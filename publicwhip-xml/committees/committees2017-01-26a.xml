He is accompanied by Mr. Malachy Quinn, senior auditor.  </p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Josepha Madigan and Catherine Murphy.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 19 January.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received since the last meeting.  Item No. 268A is correspondence received from Mr. Tom Hussey at the Department of Defence about today's meeting.  Item No. 269A is also correspondence from him containing further briefing material for today's meeting.  Item No. 273A is correspondence received from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General, Department of Defence, enclosing his opening statement.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received from private individuals and other correspondence.  Item No. 257C is correspondence received from Dr. Matt Crowe, director, Environmental Protection Agency, in response to our correspondence on the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office and issues related to salmon stocks.  The correspondence states the office is funded by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, not the EPA.  As such, we will have to write to that Department directly, as suggested by the EPA.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  Item No. 263 is correspondence received from Monaghan County Council requesting the committee to investigate EirGrid expenditure.  Concerns have been raised elsewhere about EirGrid.  Does the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit its accounts?  Is there direct funding by the Exchequer of EirGrid's capital expenditure programme?</p></speech>

The views expressed by members of Monaghan County Council have been repeated by council members in counties Meath and Cavan about the manner and the conduct of EirGrid during a very flawed process.  At an oral hearing I attended, as pointed out last week at a massive rally which was covered by RTE, the views and considerations of Oireachtas Members and councillors were not recorded in a decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The points raised in the correspondence are legitimate.  I have examples of weekly advertisements across all print media platforms.  EirGrid sponsors radio shows on LMFM and expends significant moneys in sponsoring local and national GAA events.  However, that will not be much good when there are 400 pylons running across the three counties that will be impacted on, devastating the lives of the people living in them.  It is opportune and only right that Monaghan County Council is posing these questions.  Can we identify if there are direct subventions from the taxpayer to fund EirGrid&rsquo;s activities?</p></speech>

Is its debt included in the national debt?</p></speech>

The debt of commercial semi-State bodies is not part of the national debt.</p></speech>

I do not want to summarily dismiss it.  It might not strictly be within our remit, but I would not like to be glib and dismiss it without at least getting a response from the Minister on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00600"><p>I agree with that suggestion.  Does the sectoral committee have any responsibility in this regard?  EirGrid representatives were before the communications committee to discuss its policy.  Would it be appropriate for us to refer the matter to the sectoral committee and ask it to have a look at it?  That is another avenue which could be used to get answers, if it is not strictly within our remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00700"><p>We will do both.  Obviously, being a commercial semi-State body, EirGrid representatives attend the other committee.  In the meantime, we will write directly to the Minister to get a response to the letter to the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 264C is correspondence received from an anonymous source on unneeded expenditure in parts of the HSE when the moneys could clearly be better utilised.  This is a copy of a letter sent to the director general of the HSE.  I propose that we note the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 265C is correspondence received from an individual alleging the waste of public moneys on a school building in Rathnew, County Wicklow, and that there is a possible conflict of interest.  It concerns Gaelscoil Chill Mhant&aacute;in in Wicklow town and the proposal that it be relocated to Rathnew two miles away.  Concerns have been raised about the site and the costs involved.  We will forward the correspondence to the Department and request a detailed response to the issues raised.  Is that agreed? Agreed</p></speech>

Someone has gone to the trouble of drawing attention to various matters.  It takes a big effort for somebody to write a letter.  Will it be responded to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B00900"><p>The letter is to Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, from an anonymous source who signs himself as being a whistleblower.  A copy of the letter was sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

There is no name, no address and no mention of any part of the country.  When HSE representatives are before the committee, members will be free to raise the issues referred to in the correspondence.</p> <p>  Item Nos. 266C, i to iv, and 267C, i and ii, are correspondence received from an individual, enclosing various newspaper articles on the payment of public moneys by Dublin City Council for the Ballymun regeneration programme.  The clerk has been in touch with the individual concerned to seek clarification which we have just received.  It will be circulated to all members shortly.  I suggest we delay consideration of this item and return to it next week.  Officials of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will attend the committee shortly.  I suggest we consider the matter next week and put the Department on notice that we will specifically raise it when we deal with the Ballymun regeneration programme.  It involves the use of pyrite.  The Comptroller and Auditor General dealt with the programme several years ago, but this is a specific issue.  The programme is also funded by the Department, not just by Dublin City Council.  The Department is the paymaster for everything involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B01200"><p>There was a special report, but our remit does not directly cover an audit of the Ballymun regeneration programme.  It was on moneys emanating from the Department and the accountability of the Accounting Officer for these funds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#B01300"><p>We will put the Accounting Officer on notice that the committee will deal specifically with that funding.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 271C is a copy of an email sent to Mr. Dara Connolly, president of the Irish Pharmacy Union, regarding deficiencies in the legal system.  I propose that we note it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 272C, i and ii, is correspondence received from Deputy Catherine Murphy regarding a report from the Garda internal audit section which uncovered several financial irregularities.  An article from <i>The Sunday Times</i>is attached.  The report has not been published.  I propose that we write to the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer, asking her to indicate when the report will be published and to forward a copy to the committee.  We will not publish the report on the website once received.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item No. 274C is correspondence received from an individual on the Courts Service review of the management and performance of the spectrum growth fund.  It is about the wards of court issue which was dealt with extensively by the previous committee.  At one of our first meetings last year we received a minute from the Department on the previous committee&rsquo;s report on wards of court.  The Department explained that it was looking at how the fund was being looked at.  I propose that we write to it to look at developments in the light of the minute given to us.  I also propose that we forward a copy of the latest correspondence on the review that has taken place and look for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It should be noted that the fund is managed by the President of the High Court and that the Judiciary is not answerable to the Oireachtas.  However, we can still try to be as constructive as possible in the matter.</p><p>I return item No. 125C.  It was agreed at our meeting of 11 November to return to this item which concerns a letter received from an individual about Horse Racing Ireland.  This and the previous committee, as well as several politicians and committees, have been approached by the person in question on several occasions.  We also agreed to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Legal Adviser&rsquo;s office, with all of the correspondence received from the individual since the start of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, to make a decision on if and how we could progress it further.</p><p>The clerk has been in touch with the Parliamentary Legal Adviser whose advice is that Horse Racing Ireland as a body audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General is accountable to this committee in respect only of its audited financial accounts.  It is not the role of the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the handling of complaints by such a body in respect of a specific individual or to become involved in resolving individual complaints between citizens and the body concerned.  </p><p> In addition, and perhaps more importantly,  the individual refers in correspondence that letters exhibited by him will be used in High Court case number 2015/10553/P.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has checked the court listings and it appears that the person initiated proceedings on 16 December 2015 against Ireland, the Attorney General, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner and that his case is listed for hearing on 23 March 2017.  Therefore, it would also be in breach of Standing Order 59 of the Standing Orders for this committee to engage with any party to live proceedings.  A copy of a draft letter is on members' screens.</p><p> I propose we write to the individual in question informing him of same and that we will be returning any future correspondence in relation to the matter to him.  Could members take a moment to look at the letter we are proposing which has, essentially, been drafted by the Parliamentary Legal Adviser?  There are live court proceedings on the matter and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser is telling us that we should not be dealing with it.  Does anyone wish to comment on the letter or can we agree?  I will give members a moment to look at it.  There has been extensive correspondence.  It is the person's right to write to us and bring these matters to our attention but after considering the matter since December, the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has recommended that we do not deal with it.  We gave a commitment that we would try to deal with it before the end of January.  Do members have any comments or do they agree or disagree with the contents?  Can we get approval for the clerk to issue that letter on behalf of the committee?</p></speech>

Are there any queries on it?  The unanimous view of the meeting is that the clerk should issue the attached letter to the individual concerned.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda concerns statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  They will come up on the screen.  The first item is No. 4.1, University College Cork, regarding a qualified audit opinion relating to recognition by the university of expected future Exchequer funding and the non-consolidation of the UCC Trust Fund.  Attention is drawn to the non-consolidation of Cork University Foundation and disclosure in the statement of governance of instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is working on a document to summarise all these qualifications in the audit report and matters that have been brought to our attention.  The issue of third level institutions is coming up in our work programme.  We will note it and deal with it as part of our work programme.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 4.2., the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which regulates estate agents and maintains the residential property sales price register.  We note a clear audit opinion.  No. 4.3-----</p></speech>

Obviously, there are common members involving senior people in the college and the trust.  It means that it is a stand-alone fund that is not included in the accounts of University College Cork.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can clarify it if the Deputy wishes to discuss it further.</p></speech>

It is important that the committee in looking at the consolidated financial statements would be aware that there are other sums as well that are outside that which are expected to be available to the universities.</p></speech>

They are normally given for a particular capital development.  In respect of looking at the balance sheet of the university without understanding that these other funds are also available, these funds are a reserve that is available for capital developments.</p></speech>

A company called Campus Services Limited was brought in regarding the governance of the board so this seems to be a problem in these institutes.  I accept that we are coming back to it.</p> <p>  We see non-compliance with national procurement guidelines far too often with many of these organisations, be they colleges or the HSE.  I am uncomfortable that we just note it and move on.  It is incredible that over and over, we see non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  Did we agree that we would come back to that as an issue because it is unacceptable that we just note these issues and there is no further scrutiny of what is happening.  </p></speech>

Again, there was a clear audit opinion but matters drawn to our attention include the fact that the board was late in preparing its accounts and the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the period of account.  That will come up in the summary to which I referred.  </p> <p>  No. 4.4 concerns Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board, No. 4.5 concerns Tipperary Education and Training Board, No. 4.6 concerns Donegal Education and Training Board, No. 4.7 concerns Cavan Monaghan Education and Training Board,  No. 4.8 concerns Kerry Education and Training Board and No. 4.9 concerns Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  All have clear audit opinions.  Any member is free to follow up any matter in those accounts which have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. </p> <p>  Nos. 4.10 and 4.11 concern The Gathering Project 2013 Limited.  We have the accounts for 2014 and 2015 for which there are clear audit opinions.  Nos. 4.12 and 4.13 concern the 2014 and 2015 accounts of the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation Limited for which there is a clear audit opinion.  Are those organisations still alive?  There was zero turnover in some years.</p></speech>

We will write to the Accounting Officer.</p><p> Item 4.12 concerns the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation - that is the one we have just mentioned.  We will note it even though there was no activity during the course of the year.  Item 4.14 concerns the Marine Institute, which has a clear audit opinion for its 2015 accounts.  That completes the review today of the accounts received since the last meeting.</p><p> The next item on the agenda is our work programme.  This takes into account some of the items discussed the last day.  The Department of Defence will be here today and next Thursday the Department of Justice and Equality will be before us to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding annual hours in the Irish Prison Service.  Savings were expected but did not fully materialise.  We will have the appropriation account for the Irish Prison Service.  The following Thursday we have nothing specific.  We had hoped to have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but it cannot come in so that may be a very useful week to complete our work on Project Eagle if we have no scheduled meeting.  We might have to have more than one meeting that week to clear our report.  We will hold that meeting open for the time being.</p><p> On Thursday, 16 February I am suggesting we deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a special chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about levies in the agricultural sector and refunds from the EU.  The following Thursday, 23 February, we will invite the Health Service Executive, HSE, in to deal with two items, the fair deal scheme and patient private property accounts.  We will come back to the HSE on bigger issues but various members have asked to consider these two issues. </p><p> On Thursday, 2 March, we will have the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before us to deal with its annual accounts and the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about central government's funding of local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme.  I know members will want to talk about that issue.  On Thursday, 9 March, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will be here to discuss all the chapters in the report highlighting different issues, including the review of medical consultants' tax affairs and tax consultants' affairs.  Many names were published in respect of unpaid tax.  There was a chapter on research and development tax credit and deferral of stamp duty liability and the activities of the Revenue in general.  We will skip a week because the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  On Thursday, 23 March, and the following week we will discuss third level institutions.  Will members contact the clerk to the committee on how we will structure that?  We will deal with each institution separately, allocating an hour or two for each one and then move to the next one.  We cannot have six different institutions here at once because some will be skipped.  We will probably have to bring in the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in the opening slot and we will try to structure a work programme with the third level institutions over those two weeks.  Many people have mentioned that.  </p><p> On 6 April, we will meet the Department of Finance to discuss the Exchequer financial return, the Government and Department's accounts.  It is normal that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the Department of Finance in to deal with the national debt and financial position.  The Department of Justice and Equality will be here on Thursday, 13 April, to deal with the normal Vote plus the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.  </p><p> I have a note of further items listed that we will give dates for in due course, for example, HSE section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Procurement issues come up every week.  We will have to have a session or two on that area.  There are some other outstanding chapters regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's report but many of them will have been dealt with.  We may have some space after Easter to pick a few topics between then and summer.  People may want to bring in some Departments not covered in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to discuss their appropriation accounts.  Is there general agreement on that schedule?  Agreed.  If anyone has comments on it, they can contact the secretariat because it is only a draft schedule and it can move a little as time goes on.</p></speech>

It is estimated the cost could be as high as &euro;700 million which will be very significant in terms of the overall spend and as a one-off payment.

Salaries and allowances for Defence Force personnel, including civilian support staff serving with the military, accounted for 67% of the expenditure.  At the end of the year, just under 10,000 full-time equivalent personnel were employed and remunerated from Vote 36, including just under 9,200 Defence Force personnel.  Expenditure of just over &euro;176 million was incurred on equipment, supplies and other operational costs of the Defence Forces.  Administration costs for the Department of just over &euro;21 million were incurred in the year.  The diagram which members can see now on the screen gives an indication of the relative amounts of expenditure in 2015.  In contrast to other large Votes, the Defence Vote is presented as a single programme.  The detail of spending in note 3 of the account is much the same as that always presented in the past, with the focus on spending by input type.  Most other Votes have moved to output-based accounting, reporting costs for output programmes.  As a result, the Vote account does not give a picture of the costs of particular services provided by the Defence Forces, such as peacekeeping or aid to the civil power.</p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 35, Army Pensions, recorded gross expenditure of &euro;227 million in 2015.  Over 99% of the expenditure related to payment of pensions and gratuities to former members of the Defence Forces or to surviving dependants.  At the end of the year, just over 12,000 pensions were in payment.  The two appropriation accounts associated with the Defence Forces received clear audit opinions in respect of 2015.</p> <p>  Chapter 8 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 concerns the circumstances that gave rise to a decision in August 2014 to dispose of the Air Corps' Gulfstream IV jet.  The 14-seater jet was used in the past to provide air transport for the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials undertaking official engagements at home and abroad.  The Air Corps now provides a more limited service using its remaining seven-seater Learjet 45 aircraft.  The Gulfstream jet had been in service since 1992.  The total cost of acquiring the aircraft was approximately &euro;45 million.  It was sold in January 2015 for &euro;418,000.  I asked for an examination of the transaction because of the unusual circumstances in which it occurred and the accounting adjustments it entailed.  </p> <p>  Following a ministerial direction in 2010, an annual total maintenance cost of &euro;400,000 was deemed by the Department to represent the upper limit that should be incurred on the Gulfstream jet.  Costs significantly in excess of this threshold were incurred in 2013 due to necessary repairs and to treat corrosion.  A memorandum to Government in July 2014 noted that the aircraft would require an overhaul of both engines by 2018-2019 at an estimated cost of &euro;2.5 million and that retention of the aircraft beyond that date would be unsustainable given its age.  Government approval was obtained for increased maintenance expenditure in 2014, up to a total of &euro;750,000, including a provision of &euro;250,000 for an overhaul of the landing gear during the annual maintenance to be carried out by Gulfstream in the USA.</p> <p>  Significant additional repairs were identified during the inspection in July-early August 2014, which increased the total estimated cost for repairs and maintenance on the jet to &euro;1.34 million.  On foot of the escalating costs, the Department sought the views of senior officials within the Air Corps who, while noting the age of the aircraft and the risk of further corrosion or fatigue issues, recommended that it should be repaired and returned to service.  Informal contact was also made by the Department with an Irish aviation consultant company at this time, which advised that an immediate sale of the jet would probably yield less than &euro;750,000 at the prevailing exchange rates.  Gulfstream advised the Department that estimated additional costs to put the aircraft into a serviceable condition prior to a sale would bring the maintenance bill for the year to &euro;1.8 million.  In mid-August 2014, the Minister directed that no further work should be carried out on the aircraft and it should be disposed of for the best possible price.  The Department considered the most viable option at that point was to dispose of the aircraft for salvage and that a public tender competition or auction was not possible because the jet was in a stripped down state in the Gulfstream facility where very high standards of security apply.  Prospective buyers in a sales competition would not have been allowed access to view the aircraft at those premises. </p> <p>  In early December 2014, the Department received a letter, via Gulfstream, from a USA based company who offered &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft "as seen".  This offer was accepted by the Department in January 2015.  The Air Corps also had 87 spare parts for the jet in stock with an original acquisition cost of &euro;1.4 million.  At the end of October 2014, the Air Corps estimated the value of the parts was &euro;405,000.  Ultimately, the parts were sold to the purchaser of the aircraft for &euro;53,000 in February 2015.  The amounts received and the losses on disposal were reflected in the 2015 appropriation account.  I understand the purchaser has further invested in the jet and has returned it to use.  In the absence of a competitive sales process for the Gulfstream jet and the spare parts, it is difficult to conclude whether best value was obtained by the Department.</p> <p>  An inter-departmental group has been charged with preparing a report for submission to Government on the future provision of the ministerial air transport service.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

The Defence sector is made up of two Votes,  Vote 35, Army Pensions, and Vote 36, Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  This is achieved across three strategic dimensions: defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces operational outputs.  The Government's defence policy for the next decade has been set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.</p> <p>  Some 68% of the Defence Vote in 2015 provided for the pay and allowances of the Permanent Defence Force, civilian employees and civil servants, as well as the Reserve Defence Force.  The non-pay allocation provided addresses capability development and operational outputs and includes both current and capital elements.  Non-pay current expenditure of &euro;123 million in 2015 provided mainly for essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.  Capital expenditure of &euro;89 million provided for equipment purchase and renewal and the ongoing upgrade and refurbishment of military barracks and facilities across the country.  Significant operational outputs include Ireland's contribution to international peace and security, and at home, aid to the civil power.  The commitment of personnel to the international domain comprehends peace support operations, under a UN mandate, principally the UNIFIL and UNDOF missions in Lebanon and the Golan Heights, respectively.  Ireland now holds the position of Force Commander of UNIFIL. </p><p>Deputies will also be familiar with the humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Operation Pontus, undertaken by the Naval Service.</p><p> At home and on a daily basis, the Defence Forces provide a range of supports to the civil power, mainly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to assistance to the principal response agencies in dealing with major emergencies, including the severe weather response, missing persons, fishery protection by the Naval Service and emergency aeromedical support missions by the Air Corps.</p><p> The Reserve Defence Force, RDF, plays an important role in supporting the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, mainly through the provision of a capability to be able to augment the PDF in crisis situations.  The 2015 White Paper acknowledged the excellent levels of voluntary service provided by members of the Army and Naval Service reserves.</p><p> The Defence Vote contributes funding to the Civil Defence, channelled to local authorities.  Throughout 2015, the Civil Defence was involved in a wide range of activities throughout the country, including a prominent support role in dealing with the flooding in December 2015.  In response to the impact of severe flooding on businesses in late 2015, the Government established a one-off humanitarian payment arrangement for small businesses that could not obtain flood insurance but subsequently suffered flood damage to their premises in the period from December 2015 to January 2016.  An allocation of &euro;5 million was provided to the Irish Red Cross from the Defence Vote to administer the scheme in 2015.</p><p> Vote 35 - Army Pensions - provides for pensions benefits for former members of the Defence Forces and the dependants of deceased members.  The expenditure, in its nature, is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  It has increased considerably over recent years, principally in line with the increase in the number of pensioners.  In 2015, 12,128 army pensioners were paid from Vote 35, compared with 11,322 in 2010, an increase of 806 or 7%.  This Vote also provides pensions to widows of veterans of the War of Independence.</p><p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million required in 2015 was met by savings on the Defence Vote.  A distinctive aspect of Army pension administration is that military personnel can retire voluntarily at a time of their own choosing rather than at the normal retirement age.  This is usually with pension benefits that are payable immediately.  This is in contrast to most pensions in the public service which are payable on retirement which, in itself, is normally highly predictable at ages over 60 and for which the cost and timing of liabilities can be estimated with much greater accuracy.</p><p> I would now like to refer to Chapter 8 of Volume 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report which deals with the disposal of the Government jet.  As recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is the normal practice of the Department to carry out a formal cost-benefit analysis and a discounted cashflow analysis of life cycle costs which are part of the decision-making process.  It is also established practice to dispose of State assets through a competitive sales process.  In the case of the Government jet, the circumstances were entirely exceptional and decisive action was necessary to assess the relevant options quickly and proceed on the most cost-effective and prudent approach.  The Gulfstream GIV aircraft had been in service since 1992 and was fully depreciated by 2012.  An overhaul of both engines by 2018 or 2019 at an estimate of &euro;2.5 million was going to be required.  The Government noted in July 2014 that retention of the aircraft beyond that would not be sustainable, given its age.  The decision in July 2014 that the jet should be disposed of for the best possible price was triggered by the unexpected estimate for repair and maintenance of &euro;1.34 million.  Disposal for salvage was considered to be the only viable option, given the estimated cost of &euro;1.34 million to repair to a serviceable condition, the absence of any guarantee of future serviceability even after incurring repair costs, the depressed executive jet market conditions and the charges that were accumulating on the service line in the US.</p><p> There is no disagreement with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor that an assessment of costs was necessary.  This was undertaken but conditioned in its approach by the exceptional circumstances.  The assessment, governed by the policy approach limiting further financial outlay, together with the uncertainty relating to future serviceability of the aircraft, meant that there was only one course of action available rather than a set of options.  The decision to dispose of the aircraft flowed from this assessment.  The approach to the disposal of the aircraft was necessarily heavily constrained by the circumstances whereby the aircraft was in a stripped-down state in Gulfstream&rsquo;s facility in Savannah, Georgia in the US.  The normal circumstances in which an asset is under the control of the Department and Defence Forces did not apply and additional costs could only arise the longer disposal took.  In January 2015, the Department accepted an offer of &euro;418,000 to purchase the aircraft "as seen" from Journey Aviation, a US-based company.  In February, the spare parts which were now redundant were sold to the company for &euro;53,000.  While this differs from their historical value on inventory, it was considered reasonable given that, for the Air Corps, these parts were now redundant and taking account of the nature and age of the parts and the "as seen" sales condition.</p><p> As Accounting Officer for the Department of Defence, I am satisfied with the value achieved in the sale of the aircraft and spares, given the policy parameters set and the exceptional circumstances involved.  There was considerable risk of additional Exchequer costs if appropriate and timely action was not taken.  Our priority at all times is the best use of the funds available and application of these to provide necessary defence capabilities having regard to Government policy, business requirements and safety considerations.</p></speech>

My first questions will relate to the disposal of the Government jet.  I will then ask about Vote 36, to be followed by questions on Vote 35.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the sale of the Government jet points out that since 1992 the jet had been maintained in accordance with the original manufacturer's recommended maintenance and overhaul cycle.  Why then, in July 2014, did it become apparent that the servicing and repair costs would be significantly higher, at &euro;1.34 million, than originally anticipated?  Was this a sudden shock?</p></speech>

We knew, for example, that in 2018 or 2019 we would have a major job to do on the engines.  There are certain jobs that have to be done every year and certain jobs that come up to be done, on a timely basis, based on things like the number of landings, number of flight hours and so on.  One knows the jobs that have to be done and therefore, one can cast ahead.  Unanticipated maintenance costs emerge when something arises with the aircraft which would not, in the normal course, arise through general use.  We knew that the amount of unanticipated maintenance work required would increase the older the jet got and that is what transpired in terms of the corrosion and so forth.</p></speech>

Those costs were growing.  Was that not something that would be scoped?  How did the Department arrive at the figure of &euro;400,000 that was allowed for?  It had to be surpassed on one occasion.  Was there any point in having that figure in the first place if it had to be surpassed and the Department knew it had to be surpassed?</p></speech>

The &euro;400,000 was based on our assessment of the costs that had arisen in the previous period.  We worked out what the anticipated costs arising were going to be and we set that in consultation with the Minister at that time in 2010.  On a monthly and yearly basis, we kept track of what the expenditure was against that.  Obviously, all of the estimates are indicative.  An interesting thing is that in the year in which it was exceeded, if one added the two years together, 2012 and 2013, it evened out.  It it a question of movement in the costs as well.</p></speech>

What Gulfstream does there is strip the jet down quite considerably in order to conduct all of the maintenance necessary.  In effect, the jet was spread out on the workshop floor.  Only at that time when the jet was in that stripped-down state was the further work that was required identified.  We had an ongoing conversation with Gulfstream about the likely cost arising from that.  We bottomed out on the extra cost that it was going to be.</p> <p>  We then had a situation in which we had contracted quite considerable costs with Gulfstream.  Those costs were potentially going to continue to accrue.  We then put together the case and received the decision from the Minister that no further costs were to be incurred.  We then dispatched a team over to Savannah to discuss and negotiate this with Gulfstream.  The team succeeded in limiting the costs that were accruing to us to around &euro;73,000, which was a very good piece of work.  It gave us the space to work out very quickly what the best option for the disposal of the jet was.  Once the decision was taken that no further money was going to be spent on it, the next question was what were the most effective means to dispose of the jet.</p></speech>

How was it marketed and put out there?  How do we know that all possible purchasers were made aware of its availability?

We have the biggest inventory stockholding in the public service.  When one thinks about what it is - weapons, ammunition as well as a lot of military equipment - the priority for us all along always was that I could be assured that we had systems in place where we knew where everything was, how much we had and that we minded it properly.  However, going back four or five years, we started focusing very seriously on driving out inefficiencies from within our inventory.  We tried to prioritise funding into our equipment replacement programmes and so forth to fully equip the Defence Forces.  We got an external review done of our systems around inventory management and stock control.  That is why one can see a gradual reduction in inventory levels.  We also had some recoding to do when our management information system was implemented in 2005.  We have done a huge amount of work on that and it is reflected in the gradual reduction.</p></speech>

Is there a trend or was 2015 a unique year?  Has the Department a work programme for the next number of years to conduct a similar amount of work that took place in 2015 due to the state of the inherited stock and lack of funding down through the years?  It is fair enough if the work is necessary.  Was there a spike in 2015 or is it a trend?  It is fine if it is a trend.</p></speech>

We have had a higher level of turnover than previously, which one can see from the trend in numbers.  We are fully funded for Defence Forces of 9,500 personnel.  We are putting a huge amount of work, with the Chief of Staff, at getting to 9,500 personnel.  That is the one on the Defence Forces side.</p> <p>  I will give the Deputy some statistics on the turnover rates.  We certainly have a higher level of retirements than anticipated.  On the civilian employee side, one loses a lot of people on retirement and age grounds.  At the same time we are looking at how we provide some of the services and capabilities that those civilian employees had in the past through outsourcing.  What one is talking about are State industrial employees, such as plumbers and so forth, who keep our military installations right.  There is a move towards a bit more outsourcing as well.  That partially explains the underspend on civilian employees.</p></speech>

I have a question on PDF allowances, a subject that the public will be very interested in.  Border duty allowances worth a total of &euro;2.8 million were paid to 710 recipients.  In 2017 why in the name of God are we paying Border duty allowances to 710 recipients?  Unfortunately, with Brexit there may be a requirement for us to pay these allowances in the future.  The allowance is an historical one.  Paying the allowance will seem like madness to the general public.</p></speech>

An arbitration report was done at the time, which said that people should hold this on a personal to holder basis so that as these people left the Defence Forces the payment would work its way through.  Nobody, since 2009, has gone on to or is in receipt of the Border duty allowance.  As part of the Haddington Road agreement, we made another approach on the Border duty allowance.</p><p>There is a formula in the Haddington Road agreement to buy out such allowances and that process is ongoing.

Following the changes made in 2004, minimum pension age was 50 years, regardless of rank.  If a person retired before the age of 50 years, the preserved benefits came into play at 60 years.

It was part of the diplomatic mission when the jet arrived at the apron to transport the Head of Government or Head of State.  In his statement the General Officer Commanding, GOC, of the Air Corps references the fact that there would be increased overheads for servicing and so forth.  This was trumped by the financial decision at the end of the day.</p></speech>

Anytime there was an exception, we signed off on it on an annual basis.  We were driven by the policy imperative that the service be kept going.  There was no formal process of evaluation at that stage.</p></speech>

Typically repair costs tend to be in a range such that one would carry out repairs to have a further two or five years of flying time?  What further flying time would one expect to have in spending &euro;2.5 million on repairs?</p></speech>

In spending &euro;2.5 million on repairs the Department would have achieved no more than the continued certification of the engines to enable the aircraft to continue flying.  Technically, they are stripped down and put back together with updates and spare parts.  It is flying time, mileage and landing issues that drive the need for a full service.</p></speech>

I understand the person who bought it has a number of Gulf Stream jets and could cannibalise parts.

From the figures I have, the parts were sold at 3.7% of the acquisition cost, but, of course, that value would have been downgraded over time.  Even at the estimated value at the time, they were sold at a figure that equated to 12.5% of their value.  Was putting them out to tender ever considered to enable people to bid for them?</p></speech>

When we sell a major platform - for example, during the years we have sold helicopters and so on - the parts are included.  Parts are only valuable to us if they are in the aircraft.  The parts were held in an inventory at the original purchase price; some of them were 20 years old.  They are not a normal part of the inventory in the commercial sense which is turned over in the course of a year.  It was very important for us to have these parts.  Many of them were second hand, while some were new.</p><p>It would be fairly normal practice to include the spares.  Additionally, there was no guarantee of any market abroad for those from Ireland.  There was no certification with them that that was where they came from.  Every single nut and bolt in an aircraft must be certified either by a military or civil authority, depending on where the aircraft is.  There was none of that.  This was a block of parts in the Air Corps.  Unfortunately, they had that original cost but they were redundant and have no value to us.  It was a question of moving those on as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It was very expensive.  We can go back to the jet in the US getting to &euro;1.8 million to get it back on the road.  Part of that is certifying all the individual bits and parts.</p></speech>

That accounts for the discrepancy between the cost of acquiring the parts versus the cost at which the parts were sold.  It does not necessarily explain the difference between the estimated value one would receive for the parts and the ultimate value received for the parts.  There is still a major discrepancy between those two figures not necessarily explained by the witness's accounting of residual value.  How is residual value calculated in this case?  Was the &euro;400,000 as calculated way too high or is there simply no expertise in calculating residual value, which is understandable given that we do not sell aircraft parts regularly?  Did we receive below what we should have received for those parts?</p></speech>

These are &euro;1.4 million, &euro;400,000 and the &euro;53,000 that was realised.  The &euro;1.4 million was the original cost and that is how they were held on inventory.  The &euro;400,000 was an Air Corps estimate of putting those parts into use on the aircraft, so there was an assumption of the aircraft flying at that stage.  The third figure is what was realised on the sale.  None of these is necessarily a valuation of the parts.</p></speech>

Going back to the engines, they would not have suddenly started to corrode.  What kind of maintenance programme would they have been on?  Normally airplanes would have semi-annual checks, I suppose, for eight or 12 years.  This theoretical potential cost would not have come out of the blue.  Were measures ever put in place for preventative maintenance?  Military aircraft rules may be a little more loose than civil aircraft rules, as I understand it.  Generally, there would be compliance with international aviation safety assessment programme standards to preserve value if the plane had to be sold, as it was in this case, for example.  What kind of maintenance programme was their to preserve the value?</p></speech>

It is only in certain military aviation cases, where there are no civil aviation standards, that they cannot or would not apply.  We get as close to it as possible and we follow civil aviation standards.  The Air Corps put much work into that.</p> <p>  With regard to the engines issue, the corrosion issue was in the superstructure of the aircraft rather than the engines.  There is a Rolls-Royce maintenance cycle and if the engines are on a jet, tight records are kept of flight hours, landings and so forth.  There is a set cycle and we knew that was coming.  The timing of it could move, depending on the extent of use of the jet.  In other words, once the jet tipped over a certain number of hours, the engines had to go for the service.</p></speech>

It affords the capacity to get off the island and back under one's own steam.  This flexibility would factor into any future decision.</p></speech>

What happens if we need to do a transatlantic flight?  How many of the forthcoming EU presidencies do not have a direct commercial service from Dublin?  We are taking into account the tempo of international business with which the Government is involved and the places one might need to go, as well as the regularity of trips.  We also consider other uses of the jet, such as use as an air ambulance.  We are looking to capture that scope of usage in order that when we go to the market, we can overlay the various options, from leasing to outright purchase.  There are a range of them that we have not got into.  We know what they are but we certainly have not got into expressing preferences on them.  I have statistics on the use of the jet.  The number of ministerial air transport missions has fallen off since the GIV is no longer available.  It is between 60 and 70 for the past three years.</p></speech>

We are very careful to ensure the landbank we have is fully developed and appropriate for use by our military colleagues.</p><p> We have been selling former RDF barracks - a lot of small properties we had that were a drain on us and that we were no longer using.  We have one or two other larger barracks or larger properties that may come on the market in due course.</p></speech>

I will confine my remarks to the sale of the Government jet.  I want to deal, not in policy because the merits of the Government jet are not what we are here to examine, with the policy on value for money.

Stripping away the middle part of it, in terms of Mr. Quinn's response to the sale of the Government jet it is somewhat extraordinary.  Mr. Quinn states that, "There is no disagreement with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that an assessment of costs was necessary.", but goes on to state at the end, "As Accounting Officer for the Department of Defence, I am satisfied with the value achieved in the sale of the aircraft and spares ...".  Essentially, Mr. Quinn is saying that the end justifies the means.  Could Mr. Quinn comment on that first?</p></speech>

The value that was arrived at is not the issue here.  In terms of process, Mr. Quinn states in his opening speech that he accepts the point made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report "that an assessment of costs was necessary".  Is Mr. Quinn accepting that it was wrong not to carry out an assessment?</p></speech>

We assessed costs in terms of the costs arising.  We did not assess costs in terms of an alternative service.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is clear.  It is very simple.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states that in process terms, an assessment of costs should have been carried out.  Mr. Quinn accepts that it was necessary, but there was no assessment of costs carried out.  I am asking Mr. Quinn whether he accepts that he did not do what was required of him.  I do not want to hear about extenuating circumstances.  I am talking about the process here.  If Mr. Quinn accepts what the Comptroller and Auditor General states on which Mr. Quinn states there is no disagreement, that, to me, is accepting that what should have been done was not done.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Is Mr. Quinn essentially saying here that we should not plan for the unexpected in case the unexpected happens?</p></speech>

In any sale, one should do a cost analysis.  I would imagine the company, Journey Aviation, that bought the jet carried out a cost analysis because it was prudent for it to do so.  There were basic requirements here to conduct a full cost analysis and that was not done.</p><p>I will come to the decision-making process, on page 101 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  This refers back to an earlier question that was asked where the general officer commanding of the Air Corps recommended that the aircraft should be repaired.  The report states:</p><blockquote>He recommended that the aircraft should be repaired.  The Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) also recommended that the aircraft be returned to service.</blockquote> <p>That was on 8 August 2014.</p><p>I also ask Mr. Quinn to clarify the following because it is remarkable.  Paragraph 8.15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states: &quot;The Department made informal contact with an Irish aviation consultant company .. .&quot;  What does &quot;informal&quot; mean and how is informal contact different from formal contact?  Will Mr. Quinn explain what exactly this informal contact was, who from the Department contacted whom, who this person was and what level of expertise the person had?</p></speech>

He said an immediate sale would likely be to a parts dealer, which conjures up the thought that the aircraft would be sold for scrap.  Mr. Quinn described the aircraft in the Savannah plant, broken down into parts and that image is in my head.  The contact also stated the likely sale value would be approximately $1 million, or &euro;750,000, but a decision was made to sell for &euro;416,000.  Is that what happened?</p></speech>

We have an image of a jet stripped down in a hangar in Savannah and are being told that an informal contact who was paid just &euro;900 and whose expertise in this area we know nothing about advised that it should be sold for scrap because it had had its day.  It is still flying.  On 23 November 2016 it flew from Paris to New York; on 28 November it flew from Allentown to New York; and on 3 December it flew from New York to Barbados.  It is being advertised here and can be leased.  The advert mentions its amenities - a split cabin for privacy, a full service gallery, a full lavatory, a flight phone, an SAT phone, video monitors and stereo system speakers.  There are nice pictures of the inside of the jet.  I was in contact with the company which had bought it and I am waiting for it to get back to me, but I received a copy of the insurance certificate which I have given to the clerk.  It was reregistered as N297PJ and is insured at a value of $5 million.  That seems to be a far cry from the image of a jet in pieces and which had had its day in a hangar in Savannah.  It is being flown around the world making money for a company which did make a cost-benefit analysis.  That is why I say I have a problem with the lack of due process on the part of the Department.</p></speech>

The minimum cost of repair was &euro;1.34 million.  It is an aged jet and while I will not comment on the service provided by an independent party, we have to deal with the requirements of serviceability for a Government jet.  There were known accumulated costs as it was sitting on the production line, although they were to be negotiated downwards.  It was going to cost a minimum of &euro;1.34 million to keep it flying.  In addition, we would have to spend &euro;2.5 million in 2018 and 2019 on the engines.  We had to take all of these factors into account.  I am not aware of the commercial operation which is flying the aircraft.</p></speech>

As the Accounting Officer who signed off on the sale for &euro;418,000, Mr. Quinn should be aware of it.  The same company that bought the parts that were worth &euro;800,000 bought them for &euro;40,000 and used them to get the aircraft back into circulation.  I imagine that it is making money because the jet is travelling all over the world.  How can Mr. Quinn say we can just put aside proper process and what we need to do - make a proper cost analysis of the disposal of very significant pieces of equipment and assets - on the basis of exceptional circumstances?  Will he talk us through the question of who makes these decisions?  On what basis are they made and can the Department cast aside proper accountancy processes?  Did Mr. Quinn make the decision in the first instance?</p></speech>

The question thereafter was how we could get the best value in the disposal of the jet.  We knew that it would cost &euro;1.34 million to repair it and that we were accumulating costs up to a potential &euro;500,000 to Gulfstream for the work that was ongoing at that stage.  In those circumstances and with the advice we had received-----</p></speech>

His report is very clear and there is no disagreement about it, yet Mr. Quinn is now justifying why these things were not done.  That is completely unsatisfactory.  It has happened on a number of occasions and there are shades of a different process on which we held very lengthy meetings to determine whether we had obtained value for money for something.  In the end we got what we had looked for, but what we have heard today is not good enough from the point of view of ensuring proper due process.</p></speech>

One is the money given to the Red Cross for flood defence.  Is there a breakdown of how much of it went to the Red Cross for administration expenses or did all that money go for flood victims?</p> <p>  My second specific question is on the spare parts.  Mr. Quinn will forgive me for thinking that somebody had to be flying high - excuse the bad pun - with public money.  On spare parts there has been a valuation of &euro;1.4 million.  Mr. Quinn mentioned three figures - &euro;405,000 and then within a few months it is down to &euro;53,000.  I do not think he flippantly said it, but he said that a lot of them were second-hand.  Actually almost half of the spare parts were not second-hand.  Why was no analysis done of the spare parts to see which were not second-hand, which were new?  There is a question about no certification for the parts.  I will leave questions about the jet, as it has been asked by other people.  On the spare parts, how can we go from a valuation of &euro;1.4 million down to &euro;410,000 and within a matter of months to &euro;53,000 and a flippant comment that they are second-hand, when practically 50% are not?</p></speech>

Five million euro was allocated to our Vote and we passed that on to the Red Cross.  A lot of this will come up in the 2016 account because that is when a lot of that was paid out.  A total of &euro;3.1 million was paid to 357 successful applicants.  That is broken down between businesses and community-----</p></speech>

It is poor value for money to think that we only realised &euro;471,000, particularly in view of the fact that it originally cost &euro;48 million.  It is poor management to say that it was sold to the one buyer left.  It was stripped down in Savannah and the only option was to sell it to one person, but that does not seem right to me.  It was not value for money.  If the jet had been repaired at whatever cost and put back into commission, would it have realised more money?  As my colleague said, it is now being used for commercial purposes, so I presume they would not have spent the money unless it was of commercial value.  Did taxpayers here lose money as a result of the jet not being repaired and then sold off?  If so, we could have had several different bidders from all over the world.</p></speech>

If one is selling weapons, one has to go back.  If it is a State sale, one can sell weapons, otherwise one has to go back to the original equipment manufacturer.  The bulk of ours go to Hammond Lane to be cut down.  We are reluctant to sell clothing, much of which will be used as rags.  There are different ways of moving obsolete stock.  One of the challenges we have in the military world is that because we operate in a contingent capacity, there will always be something on the inventory that is never used, but it has to be there if required.  Therefore, the challenge is always to get the right stock policy statements and levels, so that everything the Defence Forces need for whatever reason is available to them.  However, one does not have too much or too little.</p></speech>

I will refer to the Government jet given that everyone else has spoken about it.  Deputy Cullinane referred to its new owners, Journey Aviation, its destinations, including Paris, and its home base of Palm Beach.  I wish the new owners well.  I looked at the flight history of the Government jet, in particular, the number of times it broke down.  Deputy Cullinane stated the jet flew from New York to Paris under Journey Aviation.  In 1997, only five years after it commenced operations for the State, the Government jet broke down en route to Paris leaving the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, on the tarmac.  It also famously broke down in Mexico and the United States where it blocked Air Force One on one occasion and had to be taxied out of the way.  In 2003, it failed to get off the tarmac at Baldonnel Aerodrome when the then Taoiseach was about to fly to Prague for a meeting and an air taxi had to be hired at short notice at a cost of &euro;36,000.  I wish Journey Aviation the best and wish its customers well.  Deputy Cullinane referred to various fancy paraphernalia.  I wonder if the number of times the Government jet broke down was advertised because we are as well shot of that particular aircraft.  As an aside, I know Donald is selling Air Force One and buying a new one.  Perhaps we may avail of that opportunity at a knock-down price.</p><p>To address Vote 36 of the appropriation accounts, there was a slight excess in the outturn for the purchase of military transport.  I note the excess arose due to requirements to purchase additional military vehicles.  I also note that the replacement of heavy armoured cars and troop transporters is planned by the Department.  Before Christmas, I asked the Taoiseach a question on this matter.  Will Mr. Quinn take me through this process because there is disenchantment with the tender competitions run by the Department?  Timoney Technology, an Irish company, is one of the world's leading companies in designing and developing light armoured vehicles, yet it cannot secure a simple engagement with the Department to enable it to illustrate how it could serve our armed forces and the nation.  It is a leading manufacturer and I mention it because we are a small nation and this Irish company is engaged by the Australian military and other military forces elsewhere.  I would appreciate if Mr. Quinn could make a statement on a tender process that would allow for simple engagement to have this company illustrate how it could best serve our nation.  </p><p><b>Mr. Maurice Quinn:</b>The normal process that we follow in the Department of Defence for procurement is open tender.  That is standard practice.  We are also doing a lot of work on supporting enterprise arising out of the White Paper and decisions that were taken earlier.  There is a whole range of vehicles that we are procuring in the period ahead.  I will come to the Mowags.  There are the armoured logistical vehicles and armoured utility vehicles.  Not to labour the point, but the nature of our overseas deployments is such that where troops are deployed in armoured personnel carriers, the vehicles supporting them also need to be armoured so we are doing a lot of work on that at the moment. </p><p>With regard to the upgrade of the 80 armoured personnel carriers we have, which is original equipment provided by Mowag, there was a very long process followed within the organisation to bottom out on what was the most appropriate way of ensuring that armoured capability was available to the Defence Forces into the future.  We had 80 of these vehicles starting back in 2003 I think and the outcome of all of that was that the nature of the work that was required to be done on the vehicles meant that we needed to deal, on a sole source basis, with the original equipment provider.  That was the contract that we awarded shortly before Christmas to GDELS for the work to be done on our armoured personnel carriers. </p></speech>

As Ireland is a small country there are not many companies of this type engaged here in these particular services.  Mr. Quinn referenced the White Paper on Defence.  Deputy Coveney, when Minister for Defence, visited the company I mentioned, as did Deputy Bruton in his then capacity as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is recognised as a world leader in the supply of the suspension systems for armoured vehicles.  What I am asking Mr. Quinn is how a company can illustrate and demonstrate to the Department of Defence that it is capable of meeting the criteria set out.  In a previous response to me on this issue the Taoiseach said that there is constant monitoring to ensure the availability of proper equipment for the Defence Forces, that he had discussed the issue of resources with the Department of Defence and that it had been agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the matter would be carefully examined.  He also said that he hoped the Defence Forces would never be sent out with inadequate or inferior equipment.  That was a hell of a statement by the Taoiseach.  As I said, the company based in Navan in County Meath is supplying hundreds of vehicles to the Australian Army, the US Army and to other armies across the Continent.  I should point out that the Taoiseach later clarified his statement.  Perhaps Mr. Quinn would comment on the willingness of the Department to engage with Irish companies on the process surrounding the purchase of equipment.</p></speech>

There is also the general campaign to get people to join the Defence Forces.  Recruitment is a factor of turnover in terms of the increased rate of loss of members of the Defence Forces, both officers and enlisted, that we are experiencing.  Some 690 people were inducted in 2016.  Recruitment has been ongoing since 2008.  While the numbers have adjusted we are still at the stage of having to run to keep pace with the losses in order to retain the coherence of the force.</p></speech>

A huge amount of work, in terms of best practice and recruitment, has been done to attract more women into the Defence Forces.  It is important in the Irish Defence Forces that every promotion option and so forth is open to everybody equally.  That has not always been the case.  In this regard, the Chief of Staff has appointed a gender adviser.  As I said, there is a huge amount of work being done in that area.  Also, 15% of applications for 2016 were from women.  It is a question of increasing the number of applicants such that more women are recruited.</p></speech>

The bulk of the members are front-line troops.  We also have an Army nursing service but they are not service personnel, they are separate.  There are also a range of professionals across the Defence Forces engaged in other roles.  I would have to reflect on whether or not there is scope to specialise particular roles.</p></speech>

In Mr. Quinn's opinion - I appreciate he may not have expertise in this area - are any of the existing barracks or land banks in the trust of the Defence Forces on behalf of the State in areas that he would deem appropriate for the development of housing.</p><p>That is, are they sufficiently close to urban centres to be used for such purposes, or are they still in active use by the Defence Forces for training, ordnance or other purposes?</p></speech>

We prioritise military training and accommodation.  We would always maintain ongoing oversight of our land bank.  We do not wish to have any extra because it is an overhead for us.  In those circumstances I would not draw a conclusion that there is any land that is more suitable for other use.</p></speech>

I lived in Balbriggan for a number of years and it is close to Gormanston.  Balbriggan is an enlarging community and over the next generation it is likely to expand beyond the boundary of Dublin and encroach in the direction of Gormanston, so at that point it will become unlikely that the Defence Forces will continue to use it for its current purposes.  That is the type of land bank I mean.  To be fair, the area between Balbriggan and Gormanston might be a little too far, but I am sure there are other examples in the country, not known to me as a Dubliner, that might possibly be considered in the future as lands that are not being utilised to their full potential by the Defence Forces.  That is the origin of the question.</p></speech>

I have a serious problem regarding the parts.  It is a fraction of a fraction of the total cost.  I understand the parts going with the aircraft which was sold for parts, and thus one disposes of the parts.  However, the total cost versus the estimated value versus the disposal cost receipt is quite poor, certainly from a casual observation.  Was there a market for the items that were unused?  Mr. Quinn mentioned that some of the parts were used but could be re-used in that aircraft.  The estimated value of the parts in October 2014 was &euro;405,000.  Is that figure correct?</p></speech>

I will take it on trust because I do not know what these parts are worth.  The estimate was &euro;405,000 in 2014 and they were sold for &euro;53,000, as well documented in both the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the Secretary General's response.  Is there a market for the items that were unused, that is, still in the packaging?  Is Mr. Quinn aware of the total number of these parts and whether there is a market for them?  For example, if the Defence Forces had simply disposed of the items that had been used and retained the ones that were still in their packaging, is there a market for those items?  Given the Department's research and the employment of relevant aviation experts, did Mr. Quinn ask that question?  Could he determine for the committee whether better value might have been achieved for the unused parts?</p></speech>

It would be done on that basis where something was sold from within our own property.  It would be included.  As I explained, the spare parts had no certification on them.  They were sold as seen, so there was no come back on them.  It was very important for us when they were sold that there was no liability or come back on the State from the sale.  It was also important that, as they were redundant for us, they were not part of the Air Corps' inventory.  It was done on those bases.  Due to the nature of the way the thing evolved, we did not discuss spare parts with the external expert.  He was focusing on the jet itself.  The spare parts did not, and would not, enter into the conversation because they are after the fact.</p></speech>

I have two further questions.  It is easy to ask this question but, retrospectively, is there regret in the Defence Forces about the Gulfstream IV inventory items they had in stock, which potentially had a value greater than the &euro;53,000 or whatever proportion of the &euro;53,000 that might have been attributable to them, and whether the Defence Forces should have, in making reasonable efforts to achieve the ministerial directive which was to get the best possible value, which included the parts, withheld those from disposal with the jet for the purpose of attempting to realise their greater value?  Let us be honest, we are talking about &euro;53,000.  It is not a vast amount of money.  If the &euro;53,000 figure was not there and the parts were sold with the aircraft, I doubt that the committee would have spent a great deal of time querying the point.  It would have queried the value of the disposal but not necessarily the &euro;53,000, because it is a very small amount.  However, if it was &euro;20,000 and the Defence Forces made &euro;100,000 on new, unused parts because there is a market for them in the Gulfstream IV market, retrospectively, and particularly when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report came across his desk, did Mr. Quinn not sit back and say that perhaps they should have considered this a little more carefully?</p></speech>

There was also the prospect of having a cost of disposal of spare parts.</p><p>All of this was factored in as well.</p></speech>

My final question is on the storage costs, or potential storage costs, in Savannah, Georgia.  Does Mr. Quinn have any idea, or could he estimate, the storage costs for the aircraft in the condition it was in, which he outlined quite clearly and illustrated earlier in response to Deputy Kelly's questions?  The aircraft was in pieces on the floor, of a hangar presumably, in Savannah, Georgia.  The Department found there were excessive expected costs and the decision was made not to exceed &euro;400,000 and a decision was made to dispose of the aircraft.  Clearly the Irish State was going to have costs associated with storage, but I am not sure Mr. Quinn attributed an approximate cost to this process.  Were any other options available to the Defence Forces to return the aircraft to the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

I will confirm the exact amount, but it was between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  This was the contracted amount for work accumulating.  It continued to accumulate.  It was not a storage cost, it was actually the cost of the work that we were dealing with.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#S01900"><p>Clarification is needed on the process, notwithstanding the answers we have received from Mr. Quinn.  Will Mr. Quinn give us the name of the person who gave the informal advice?  Who in the Department made contact with this person who worked in the aviation industry?  What is the name of the company for which the person worked?  Was the person a board member, a CEO or a director?  What level of expertise did this person have?  Mr. Quinn stated e-mails were exchanged with this informal contact and adviser, which underpinned the decision made.  I go back to the earlier exchanges where we had on differences of opinion between the GOC and the person who gave the conflicting advice, which is this informal contact.</p> <p>  There seems to be a more fundamental question, and to restate it for Mr. Quinn so he knows exactly and understands exactly what the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, a cost-benefit analysis is important in the disposal of any asset or equipment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in the case of the Gulfstream jet the Department did not formally appraise the economic case for increased maintenance costs in 2013 or 2014 nor the cost of returning the jet to a serviceable position against the benefits that would accrue from this use.  In response to earlier questions on why the Department did not cost getting the jet back to a workable position and getting it flying again, Mr. Quinn stated a decision had been made by the Minister to sell it.  It strikes me there is a possibility the narrative here is that the exceptional circumstances spoken about by Mr. Quinn are political, whereby a decision was made by a Minister to sell and get rid of the jet and the Department then sought to get whatever information or scrap of paper it possibly could from somebody to justify selling it.  A political decision was made to sell it and get what we could for it.  The Department then sought whatever justification it could from an expert, which is what it got, and it seems the advice previously given by people in the Air Corps was dismissed.  This is something that worries me.  Will Mr. Quinn to respond to this potential narrative?  Will he provide the committee with the specific information I have sought?</p></speech>

On the point about an apparent contradiction between Mr. Fitzpatrick's advice and that of the Air Corps, in fact they are quite similar.  The advice of the Air Corps, which I do not have in front of me to quote, was that given the age of the aircraft and the mileage on it, there was an increased likelihood that further significant maintenance would be required.  Notwithstanding this, it made the request that the jet be retained.</p></speech>

It is the biggest in the State.  Our main objective is to ensure that we have the right inventory for the Defence Forces at hand when they need it in an appropriate quantity, which means not too much and not too little.  We have done a huge amount of work on that.  Senior management resources and teams work on how we are managing our inventory to drive as many savings as we can to get the right levels.  One will always have a situation in the military where there is inventory that is never used.  That is because we are a contingent capacity on behalf of the State.  There is a whole range of scenarios to which the military must be in a position to respond.  As such, inventory is not managed like stocks in a commercial process where one is trying to move stuff off and make a return on it.  We come at inventory from a very different space.  Because of all the work we have been doing on that in recent years, one can see a spike in the inventory for 2015 in the amount of write-offs where we have had obsolete or slow-moving stock.  That is an overhead on us.</p></speech>

I do not wish to prejudge anything we are going to say about Project Eagle, but it seems to be the same lack of analysis.  I do not know whether there is something in the air in that we have Project Eagle and are now talking about a jet.  The Department was under pressure and it sold the jet off.  It had no other option.  Separate from that we have a parallel issue.  There is an interdepartmental group set up with no meetings since last February.  I understand that Mr. Quinn says the Department was under pressure and that other things were happening last year, but it does not strike me that somebody is taking this seriously, learning from it and coming in to say "Sorry".  In fact, Mr. Quinn is not quite saying "Sorry" because the Department disagrees with the Comptroller and Auditor General although it agrees it should have recorded this better.  I appreciate that acknowledgement.  In circumstances where there was no meeting since last February, however, we are not giving the person out there listening a sense that we have looked at this, we were under pressure, we have learned from it and we are changing.  That is what people just want.</p></speech>

I want to take a walk through the figures to give balance to the sensationalist insurance figure that is being presented to the committee with a flourish.  Mr. Quinn might walk through them with me if he does not mind.  The amount received is &euro;418,000, plus the &euro;53,000 for parts.  That in itself comes to &euro;471,000.  The immediate maintenance cost was &euro;1.34 million, and if I am not mistaken, it was &euro;1.8 million with the relevant certifications to get it back out of there and up in the air again.  Am I correct there?</p></speech>

Then we have the engine repair in 2018 and 2019.  The figure given to <i>The Irish Times</i>was &euro;2.5 million or thereabouts, so we will add that to the &euro;2.271.  We come to &euro;4.771 at this point.  If we were to add the annual maintenance costs for 2015 and 2016, which comes to an average of about &euro;300,000 to &euro;350,000, but with a ceiling of &euro;400,000 generally - let us take the &euro;400,000 for the sake of fairness - that would come to a figure of &euro;5.57 million.  Compare and contrast that with the insurance certificate which was presented here with a flourish.  The cost for that was $5 million, and we will subtract about 5% since the exchange rate is not great right now, so that is about &euro;4.75 million.  I have spoken to people in the aviation industry, and there would be two things in the insurance that would inflate the value of insurance on the certificate to take into account.  One would be the lost profit element to the company and the other would be the slight inflation between the list price received for the aircraft and the insure price to the aircraft.  Much like with insurance on a car there would be a discrepancy there.  It tends to be about 5% as well.  Ultimately, if I am not mistaken, the course of action that Mr. Quinn took saved the State money.  Would that be a fair assessment?</p></speech>

We definitely deflected further cost from the State.</p></speech>

That insurance certificate, which was presented to the committee, was designed to generate an unfair headline in terms of financial figures.  If one was to take a listed aircraft of the same specification - a newer aircraft from 1994 currently advertised online for example - with new engines, it would still come to below $5 million in sale price.  Therefore, we need to be very careful in the comparisons and fair to Mr. Quinn in the comparisons, in that there were extremely extenuating circumstances, and he took a decision in real time, and I think that it should be reflected on the record that decision was fair and beneficial to the State.  Would Mr. Quinn agree with that?</p></speech>

I want to pose some questions, if Mr. Quinn will bear with me.  I have a few topics for the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says that on 15 August 2014, the Minister directed that no further work should be carried out on the aircraft, and that it should be disposed of for the best possible price.  Mr. Quinn is saying that a political decision was made.  As the Accounting Officer, what information was provided by Mr. Quinn to the Minister to inform and assist him in coming to that decision?  He did not make that up on his own without some note or memo from Mr. Quinn.</p></speech>

If it is not, it would be good to circulate it here to see Mr. Quinn's rationale as to why he arrived at that decision.</p> <p>  I refer to chapter 8, paragraphs 12 and 13, which trouble me a little bit.  Mr. Quinn spoke about having spare equipment in stock for all contingencies and how it is the job of the Army to always be vigilant, plan ahead and plan for unforeseen circumstances.  The essence of paragraphs 12 and 13 is that the Department, and Mr. Quinn, as the Accounting Officer, were of the view that it would have been highly speculative to produce contingency cost projection that may arise for unidentified or unforeseen problems.  Even the boy scouts have a motto, b&iacute; ullamh, be ready.  Mr. Quinn is saying that the Defence Forces were not preparing for unidentified, unforeseen problems.  What kind of an Army would we have if it was not planning for unforeseen developments?  The Department should always have a note in the event of problems.  That jet could have crashed anywhere in the last 22 years.  There should have been a note on the options to consider but Mr. Quinn is saying that there was no point.  The essence of that is there is no point in speculating or drawing up a contingency plan for an event that we are not sure might ever happen.  The essence of the Defence Forces is to be ready and prepared.  A crash or anything could have happened.</p><p>I understand that when the issue arose you had to make the best fist of it but not enough advance planning had been done.  The Department was caught on the hop when it happened.  It was always a possibility that some fine day the aircraft would run into a problem.  The Department seemed to have zero contingency planning in place.  I am speaking about the lack of a contingency plan.  To put it simply, if the current aircraft, the Learjet, ran into a problem tomorrow morning I would hope Mr. Quinn had a contingency plan in place and would not be stating that the Department did not get into providing contingencies for unforeseen problems.  It is the Department's job to do that.  Do you take the point?  Have you a plan in place if something happened to the Learjet tomorrow?</p></speech>

Let us say it is parked on a runway in any airport tomorrow and some other vehicle hits it, causing damage, and it is out of commission for a day, a week, a month or six months.  What is in place today to deal with that eventuality?  Surely the Department has some options as things can happen.</p> <p>  There was a problem with the first jet and there was no contingency plan in place.  Has the Department not learned anything from that event?  Mr. Quinn should have told himself that the options for a decision would be ready if the Department was ever caught in a situation like that again.  I am not asking you to have made that decision but you are telling me that you are equally as unprepared if something happened to that jet on some runway tomorrow as you were when it happened on that workshop floor over in Georgia.  I am disappointed if that is the response from your Department.</p></speech>

If we lose the jet completely we do not have an arrangement in place to procure an alternative.  If the jet goes out of service we have alternative means of transport available to its users.  We have the standard maintenance plan for the Lear, as we had for the Gulfstream IV in its turn, which is to maximise and optimise the serviceability of the aircraft.  We have that kind of matrix of services available.  We do not have a procurement process for an alternative jet.</p></speech>

Obviously you can lease aircraft, as has been mentioned here, for a day, a month, three months or six months.  Surely somewhere on your desk you have what could be done if you were told the jet was hit by something it in London or wherever and that it was going to be out of action for six months. It is the job of the Defence Forces to have contingencies, that is what armies are meant to do.  I am surprised to hear that you do not have the options at the tip of your fingers to look at.  It sounds to me as if you would go scratching your head if that problem arose.</p></speech>

I ask the Secretary General, when it is appropriate and after the Department has closed its tenders, to send us an information note in respect of what it was seeking as part of this procurement process.

The Secretary General might forward that note.  While he has read it into the record, it was hard for us to catch all that.  Given the fact that the original jet is no longer in commission, what has happened to the people who were involved in piloting and maintaining it?  How are those pilots keeping their hours up?  In other words, following on from what the Deputy asked a moment ago, are some of the planes flying for no other purpose than for pilots to keep their hours up?</p></speech>

The PBN Defender is flown as required by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Cessnas are used for training, as are the Pilatus.  The challenge in the Air Corps is primarily around having a sufficient supply of pilots.  That is the pinch point we have.  Rather than having pilots not fully occupied in their hours, we do not have enough pilots.</p></speech>

I just want ask one last question on the jet.  I have other questions for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the last paragraph of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, paragraph 8.42, he states "In the absence of a competitive sales process, it is difficult to conclude on whether best value was obtained."  That is effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General's final word.  What is the response of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to that conclusion by the Comptroller and Auditor General?  It cannot be happy with a conclusion like that from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

We would also recognise that exceptional circumstances can come to the fore that militate against what we would call normal forensic analysis being undertaken.</p><p>The Minister and Department of Defence deemed that exceptional circumstances arose, for the various policy reasons which the Secretary General, Mr. Quinn, spoke about and the jet being up without wheels in Georgia.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have considered that the Department of Defence's approach appeared reasonable.  Looking back, we can appreciate that there was scope for other approaches.  However, the Minister and Department determined that exceptional circumstances existed and we have to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

The last thing I want to ask about concerns legal costs.  It would not be a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts if we did not hone in on them.  Table 6.5 on page 730 of the Appropriation Account 2015 concerns legal costs.  There were 215 legal cases involving employees and the cost of compensation was &euro;1.783 million.  The legal costs paid by the Department and the costs awarded in that case amounted to &euro;1.475 million giving a total cost of &euro;3.258 million.  The amount paid to employees was &euro;1.783 million and in addition to that, legal costs on top of that came to 83%.  That is very high.  There were 39 claims from members of the public and compensation awarded amounted to &euro;431,000.  The legal costs associated with those awards amounted to &euro;175,000 when the two are added together with the figure being 58%.  Why are legal costs 83% on top of the actual compensation paid when members of the Defence Forces take cases against the Department when they are only 58% when members of the public take cases against the Department?  Does the Department contest cases brought against it by its own employees more vigorously and incur more legal costs than it does when it contests claims brought by members of the public?  Logically, it incurs more legal costs.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  Why does the Department incur more legal costs in cases where it is fighting against Defence Forces personnel compared to, say, traffic accidents involving members of the public?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Quinn" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#X02200"><p>As the Chairman knows, we do not have any direct control over the amount of time and legal costs.  The Chief State Solicitor and the State Claims Agency agree bills of costs and their tax default agreement if necessary.  My analysis of the situation would be that much of that depends on the nature and complexity of the issue being dealt with.  When the State Claims Agency is dealing with claims by members of the public, these claims are, in general, reasonably straightforward whereas when you go through some of the more intractable cases we have had with employees where there are very specific and difficult points of law and the rights of a particular individual are being dealt, they are more complex, take more time and, therefore, incur more costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017012600002#X02300"><p>That is an inadequate answer.  I accept that during the course of the year, you can have one, two, ten or 20 complicated cases but we are talking about over 200 here.  The pattern is that we are looking at nearly 300 cases during the year.  It is not a question of some individual cases being more complicated.  There is a clear pattern of legal costs being higher when the Department is dealing with members of the Defence Forces.  Does the Department contest these cases more?  It brings me to the issue of Baldonnel.  A whistleblower produced a report in 2015 regarding the difficulties members of the Defence Forces had in respect of dealing with hazardous waste and chemicals out there.  Mr. Quinn is aware that the Department is responsible and that according to the Health and Safety Authority, the Defence Forces did not have proper health monitoring for its members and did not provide proper personal protection equipment and adequate staff training.  The Health and Safety Authority had to visit Baldonnel three times last year and issued a report in 2016.  Can Mr. Quinn give us a copy of that report?  I know six of these cases are before the courts.  In light of all that, is Mr. Quinn telling me that the Department is going contest liability?  Surely it should be saying "hands up, let's settle this and let's get rid of the 83% top-up cost for the legal profession for wheeling the thing in and out court?"  In how many of these cases does the Department accept liability and avoid the avoidable and unnecessary costs that the State Claims Agency incurs on the Department's behalf?  Many of these costs could be obviated if the Department put its hands up and accepted liability where it is the appropriate thing to do.  Can Mr. Quinn comment on that?  The Health and Safety Authority is telling the Department this.</p></speech>

The first concerns the Health and Safety Authority and the Air Corps.  As the Chairman knows, we have litigation and people who have availed of the protected disclosures legislation so we must be careful in the way we deal with that.  To clarify, the Chairman is correct in that protected disclosures were received in December 2015 and January 2016.  The Health and Safety Authority visited the Air Corps quite soon thereafter.  There was an ongoing conversation between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority, particularly about how hazardous chemicals were being managed.  The final sign off with the Health and Safety Authority was in October 2016.  Quite a comprehensive plan has been signed off on between the Air Corps and the Health and Safety Authority that will be implemented over a number of years so that is all up and running.</p> <p>  Where liability is not contested or where there is shared liability, it is our practice with the State Claims Agency that an effort is made to resolve cases as expediently as possible.  However, when it comes to litigation against the State, there is an obligation to ensure the correct treatment of all cases, which is, as the committee knows, to go into a process of establishing loss or damage and its extent along with cause and so forth.  That process must still be gone through.  </p></speech>

In how many cases did the Department accept liability and avoid going to court?  What were the legal costs associated with the cases in which the Department accepted liability versus the ones where it did not accept liability and went to court?

From what we see, the State Claims Agency turns over hundreds of millions every year and some of the cases should not have to go to the High Court for settlement.  If there were earlier admissions of liability across the board, we could avoid having the taxpayer pay unnecessary legal fees.  I worry that sometimes a Department might know there is a liability but not want to settle a figure in case the Comptroller and Auditor General says it should not have done so.  Instead, it might decide to let the High Court or the Supreme Court settle the figure.  Whether it is higher or lower, it does not matter because the Department will have covered itself because it did not settle the figure.  The taxpayer is not being well protected in that process.  Does Mr. Quinn understand where I am coming from?</p></speech>

During the first part of today's meeting, Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Hara of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, will address the committee regarding the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria.  I welcome Ms O'Hara.  We are all shocked on a daily basis by the suffering of the people of Syria, particularly the people in Aleppo where the constant bombardment has affected so many lives and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured.  The rest of the world has a duty to do everything in its power to ensure this ceases as soon as possible.  As everyone in this country is aware, the only way for this to be achieved is through dialogue.  While news coverage of the crisis in Syria has diminished somewhat in recent weeks, I am sure the humanitarian issues facing the people in the region, especially the plight of the refugees, are as great as ever.  I am glad Ms O'Hara was in a position to clearly transmit that message on the national broadcast media this morning.</p><p>After we have heard Ms O'Hara's opening statement, we will invite her to participate in a question and answer session with the members of the committee.  I remind members, witnesses and the people in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording and broadcasting equipment in this room, even in silent mode.  Today's meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV and across various media platforms.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Ms O'Hara to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I do not intend to read all of my written statement, which was submitted to the committee in advance of today's meeting.  I will pick out some highlights in the interests of having more time for questions and answers.  I am the head of the UNHCR's protection service for the Middle East and North Africa region.  I operate out of Amman.  The team I lead comprises a series of experts on issues like gender, child protection, education and other key thematic functions.  Our geographical area of coverage spans the entirety of north Africa, the Middle East, the Gulf and Israel.  I will focus this morning on our two largest operations in the region, in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>  Syria is one of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time.  We are now into the sixth year of conflict.  The fighting in Syria has caused unprecedented levels of humanitarian need.  The disregard for human life and acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale that have been seen in Syria and in neighbouring Iraq have led to enormous suffering and destruction.  Displacement internal to the region and further afield is one of the fundamental characteristics of both of these crises.  It is estimated that 13.5 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance, including 6.3 million people who have been internally displaced.  Some 4.6 million people live in places which continue to be hard for humanitarian actors to reach.  As many as 700,000 people are living in besieged areas.  This figure has decreased in recent times as a result of the evacuation of Aleppo in the week before Christmas.  The consequences of the situation in Syria have a regional dimension that affects all of the neighbouring countries.  Over 4.8 million registered Syrian refugees are hosted in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt.  Turkey is the largest single host country of refugees anywhere in the world.</p><p>Syrian refugees continue to need international protection.  Host governments, local communities and humanitarian partners, including UNHCR, are continuing to work in support of the respect of the basic rights, protection and physical security of all populations affected by the Syria and Iraq crises, including those stranded at borders.</p><p> Over the past year, a number of significant high-profile events including the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in February 2016, and the London conference on supporting Syria and the region in February 2016 have highlighted the need for changes in the way humanitarian crises are funded.  The day before yesterday I attended an event hosted by the Finnish Government to launch this year's humanitarian appeal for Syria.  That comprises the regional refugee and resilience plan with a price tag of &euro;4.4 billion in response to the needs of the 4.8 million Syrian refugees and the communities that host them.  In addition there is the Syrian humanitarian response plan, which is another $3.4 billion.</p><p> Funding continues to be crucial to meet refugee needs.  While donors have generously contributed some $10 billion to the international appeal since 2012, in recent years the humanitarian appeals have only reached about 60% funding, which, of course, has implications for the programmes carried out by UNHCR, other UN organisations and numerous NGOs that are responding to the Syria and Iraq crises.</p><p> I will say some words specific to Iraq which may not get as much coverage in the media as Syria.  Alongside Syria, Iraq is one of the biggest operational responses we have in the region.  Since January 2014, escalating violence in Iraq has led to the internal displacement of over 3 million people.  In addition there are 245,000 Iraqi refugees in the region, half of these hosted by Turkey.  At the same time some people are returning to their places of origin in more stabilised locations.  However, the sustainability of returns continues to be hampered by widespread destruction of infrastructure and the presence of mines and unexploded ordnance.  </p><p> Currently the focus of the humanitarian response in Iraq is very much centred on the situation in Mosul.  The retaking of Mosul city, which has been under the control of ISIS for more than two years is a primary objective of the Iraqi Government and its allies.  Since the start of the military offensive in October 2016, over 162,000 people have been displaced from Mosul and surrounding areas as the military offensive to retake the city advances.  As part of the emergency response for Mosul, UNHCR has been heavily involved in the establishment of new camps, the upgrading of existing camps, and the general provision of emergency shelter assistance to persons who have been displaced.</p><p> Across the region, key elements of our programmes such as the Syria operation, the Iraq operation and other situations in the Middle East and north Africa, including Yemen and Libya, include such activities as biometric registration.  I am referring to the registration of refugees so that we have an accurate database of the number and profile of refugees, which informs the response programmes for which we have just launched this appeal in Helsinki.</p><p> Winter assistance is a fundamental characteristic of the response plan.  We have been fortunate so far this season in the Syria response plan not to see the freezing temperatures that have been seen in some places in Europe.  However, the winter assistance plan is costly.  We have many refuges in the neighbouring countries to Syria and Iraq still living under tented accommodation.  The winter assistance programme is essential for their survival.</p><p> Cash assistance is an increasingly important characteristic of the humanitarian response.  Here I refer to the increasing use of cash as a direct means of assistance as a complement to in-kind forms of assistance. </p><p> I wish to speak about global responsibility sharing.  I have referred many times to the number of refugees and displaced generated by both the Syria and Iraq situations.  Particularly in the case of the Syrian response with 4.8 million refugees, the vast majority of them continue to live in the immediate neighbouring countries.  As part of global responsibility sharing the UNHCR pursues the use of resettlement to third countries.  We have been appealing for an increase in the number of resettlement places.  Ireland is among those countries that offers resettlement places to Syrian and Iraqi refugees - a modest, but not insignificant offer of up to 4,000 places, which allows the UNHCR to ensure that some of the refugees most in need with the most acute protection problems have the option to be moved elsewhere out of the region.</p><p> I echo the Chairman's opening comments that what is needed in the region and particularly for Syria and Iraq are political solutions to the conflicts and crises that have generated so much humanitarian suffering.  The humanitarian response is in a way a reaction to the symptoms of crisis but cannot in itself solve crises.  I thank the members of the committee for their attention.</p></speech>

She referred to huge number of refugees and internally displaced persons and unfortunately the inadequate donor response.  She stated that 60% of the response plans had been funded.  Is it 60% of what was pledged by governments in humanitarian aid and assistance?</p></speech>

In the case of Syria, the Syrian appeal of last year was, of course, marked by the very large event in London on 4 February 2016, where significant financial commitments were made.  Many of the financial commitments made in London have, in fact, been fully respected.  However, the commitments made never reached the full level of the appeal.  I have just come from Helsinki where we launched the 2017 appeal.  On the refugee side, it amounts to $4.6 billion.  The event in Helsinki was not a pledging event; the pledging event will follow at some point in April to be hosted by the European Union in Brussels.  We have yet to see what the pledging levels will be for this year's appeal.</p></speech>

Has the European Union honoured what was pledged in respect of these particular crises?</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, the pledges from the European Union have been met.  The European Union is fundamental partner to UNHCR and to many other UN agencies in the sense that the European Union is very much engaged through presence of ECHO offices in the region.  We have a very close working relationship with them.  It is not simply a pledge and then later a cheque comes.  The ECHO offices are physically present in the region and work very closely with us in the design and implementation of the humanitarian activities towards which European Union funding goes.</p></speech>

I have followed her career with great interest.  I thank her for coming here to give us such a comprehensive overview of the immense scale of the humanitarian crisis, particularly in Syria and Iraq and of the enormous challenge in meeting the humanitarian response that Ms O'Hara has described.  The figure of 4.8 million Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries - more than the population of this country - gives us some sense of the scale.</p><p>I know all of us are keen to see a more expeditious and speedy resettlement programme in operation here, in keeping with the pledge we have made to take 4,000 refugees from Syria.</p><p> I wish to ask a question on Ms O'Hara's concluding comments.  The response to the humanitarian crisis and the refugee displacement is a response to the political crisis.  Therefore, the only solution to the plight of the Syrian people is a negotiated political settlement.  Can Ms O'Hara comment on the likely prospects of such a settlement?  Does the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have a role in feeding in to the terms of any settlement?  Does the organisation play any direct role in that regard?</p></speech>

There is intended to be another round of talks, hopefully, in Geneva in early February under the direct auspices of the UN.  I should distinguish between the two.  The Astana talks came following an initiative of Turkey, Russia and Iran.  The next round of talks in Geneva is expected to be under the direct auspices of Mr. de Mistura, the special representative of the UN Secretary General.</p> <p>  UNHCR was not present at the table for those talks, but we made a contribution to that process.  It is an obligation of ours to ensure that the voice of refugees is heard.  Of course, the talks will address the necessary conditions for options to open up for refugees, including the prospect of returns.  This is something we follow closely, especially with respect to our obligation to ensure that the voice of refugees is heard and that the voice of those affected by conflict is heard in the talks to try to resolve those conflicts.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave early.  We have heard similar comments in the committee.  We have had many hearings on the crisis in Syria.  We have heard different views on the role of the Syrian Government and the regime of Bashar al-Assad.  Some of us have been critical of that Government.  We have received a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that has pointed out the intransigence of the Assad regime and its resistance to efforts at resolution of the crisis in Syria for some time.  Moreover, we have learned that it has been guilty of appalling abuses of human rights in its treatment of Syrian citizens &ndash; we have put these points to witnesses previously.  Can the UNHCR comment on the role of the Syrian Government of Bashar al-Assad?</p></speech>

Anyway, I understand the context of the question.  As a representative of UNHCR, it is not my business to comment on the role or position of any government.  However, clearly the solution to the Syrian crisis has to involve the Syrian Government.  It is a fundamental player in everything that has happened during the course of the past six years.</p> <p>  With respect to the extreme violations that have taken place within Syria, the UNHCR, alongside the Secretary General and other actors of the UN, especially our sister agency, the UN High Commission on Human Rights, has constantly spoken out against the violations perpetrated by all sides in the Syrian conflict.  The violation of human rights and the suffering of Syrian civilians must be brought to a close as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The committee takes this issue seriously.  The first hearing of the committee post the general election was used to discuss the refugee crisis and the wider crisis in the Middle East.</p> <p>  Some of us were in Cairo some weeks ago.  We had the pleasure of meeting the Secretary General of the Arab League.  Ahmed Aboul Gheit made some comments to us that day.  It was telling that the continuing imposition of western style democratic values on the Middle East is not welcome there.  We simply cannot transpose what happens in western Europe and try to tell people in Libya, Iraq and Syria that this is the way they should lead their lives.  When we are considering solutions to this, we should consider the disastrous interventions carried out by Britain, France, USA and other western powers in Libya, Syria and Iraq.  This is one of the reasons for the current crisis.  There are no blameless actors in the whole tragedy.  That is the problem.  This view was put to us loud and clear.  Europe and the West do not always have the solutions.  Our values are not the only correct values and should not be followed necessarily.  If we - by which I mean the West - were a little more cautious in our approach over the past 20 years, we might not be dealing with a crisis of the current proportions.  Having said that, I commend the UNHCR representatives, their colleagues and all the other agencies on their work in what is a difficult and catastrophic situation.</p> <p>  Ireland has a modest commitment under the resettlement programme.  However, the European commitment is modest as well.  What is the view of the UNHCR on Europe and the EU response to resettlement in particular?  Does the UNHCR have a view on third-country arrangements, such as the Turkish arrangement?  What is the view on the move for a further 15 arrangements to be put in place?  We are talking about an outrageous situation whereby 80,000 refugees are proposed to be resettled to Afghanistan.  I imagine the UN has a view on this &ndash; I hope it does and I am keen to hear it.</p> <p>  Do the UNHCR representatives have a view or comment on the persecution of minorities?  The case of anyone who is persecuted as well as any death is abhorrent.  However, the systematic persecution and the genocide perpetrated on Christians, Yazidis and others in the Middle East are unacceptable too.  When we discuss the horrors the Syrian regime has inflicted on the people there, we also must consider what the so-called Islamic State, al-Nusra Front and other groups that are supposed to be moderate are carrying out against ethnic minorities in the region.</p> <p>  I agree completely with the witnesses that political solutions are required.  I welcome the comments to the effect that all those involved have to be part of an overall solution.  I thank the deputation for the presentation this morning.</p></speech>

Ms O&rsquo;Hara referred to funding.  What is the breakdown of the $67 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict in Syria?  In what beneficial way is it being used?  How many members of the Irish rapid response corps have been deployed to the Balkans or the Middle East to help UN agencies responding to migration challenges resulting from the Syrian conflict?  How much Irish Aid funding has been given to NGOs, UN organisations and the Red Cross in partnership with local organisations to offer assistance to those affected by the Syrian conflict?</p></speech>

I will address the question on resettlement first.  It is fundamentally important to bear one point in mind with resettlement.  We are discussing a global refugee and displaced population which tops 60 million.  Let us consider my region of the world specifically and repeat the figures for Syria - they are phenomenal.  There are 4.8 million registered refugees.  The number of refugees that will have access to resettlement will always be only a small proportion of the refugee population.  For the Syria response in particular, the UNHCR hosted a high-level meeting on resettlement and other forms of humanitarian admissions in Geneva on 30 March last year.</p><p>The goal our High Commissioner was aiming for was 10% of the total figure of Syrian refugees, let us say, somewhere in the region of 400,000 to 500,000 from within the Syrian refugee population.  A number of pledges were made at that meeting, including some new resettlement and admission pledges from countries that have not had a tradition of resettlement.  The United Arab Emirates pledged 15,000 places over the course of five years, being a new potential resettlement partner.<br/><br/>As UNHCR, we are always looking to any resettlement country to increase the numbers.  Indeed, the numbers for Ireland and for other members of the European Union are rather modest but not insignificant.<br/><br/>As for what we use resettlement for, it serves a number of purposes.  In part, it is simply an expression of solidarity.  It is sending the message to countries in the neighbouring region - the ones hosting the vast majority of refugees - that they are not alone and we are also willing to step up and admit refugees to our own territory.  Through a selection process which allows to look at specific protection needs, even small numbers of resettlement places are significant.<br/><br/>Last year, recalling again that our High Commissioner had set the bar at this target of 400,000 out of the Syria crisis, out of the entire region of Middle East-north Africa we submitted 96,000 submissions for resettlement.  Submissions differ from departures and arrivals because we are submitting in one calendar year and, of course, there is a time lag due to security clearance and other requirements.  The 96,000 is the number we submitted from the region last year.  The largest of the resettlement countries, the ones with the largest quotas, would be traditional resettlement partners, such as Canada, the US and Australia.  That said, the quotas offered by countries, such as Ireland and the European Union, are significant.  They are important to us.  We are always lobbying for higher numbers but whatever is on offer we will use to the maximum for refugees.<br/><br/>In response to the question about different arrangements, specifically the Turkish-EU arrangement, that is something about which UNHCR expressed concern at the time.  We continue to have concerns about bilateral and multilateral arrangements that affect the ability of refugees to gain access to safety.  At the same time, a fundamental feature of what was happening out of Turkey at the time the deal was struck was these large movements of refugees by dangerous sea routes, something we see much less of now in the eastern Mediterranean but something we continue to see at quite significant levels in the central Mediterranean, particularly with Libya as a departure point.  We have a fundamental concern about the safety of life at sea.  We would encourage that any of these bilateral arrangements take account of that and take account of adequate measures that ensure refugees are not being unreasonably blocked or pushed back to situations of danger.  That said, we understand the migration management motivations behind these specific arrangements that are being negotiated between states and we stand ready to discuss with states and offer our technical advice in order that whatever deals are struck are in the best interests of refugee protection.  For us, the fundamental red line is the 1951 convention bar on <i>non-refoulement</i>, the forced removal to a situation of danger.  That is something we would always be looking out for in these types of agreements.<br/><br/>On the question with respect to the situation of minorities, the minority populations in the region have suffered greatly.  What has happened to the Yazidis with the flight of almost their entire population from the area around Sinjar in northern Iraq was something that garnered a lot of media attention.  Many of these Yazidis continue to live in camps as internally displaced persons within Iraq and many of them are also displaced to countries in the region.  For the refugee side of the minority response, the appeal that I referred to would include the needs of minority populations.  It is important to underline that many of the minorities, be they Yazidis or Christians, remain, some of them still in their homes but some of them as internally displaced, both within Iraq and Syria, and those internal displacement situations are also in acute need of funding to be able to respond to specific needs of minorities who have suffered considerably.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy McLoughlin's question about how the finances break down, what we were launching in Finland is a response plan known as the regional refugee and resilience plan, 3RP.  I have mentioned on several occasions the price tag of &euro;4.63 billion that attaches to this plan.  This is not the UNHCR's response alone.  This covers the needs of all the participating UN organisations and as many as 240 other partners.  That covers many of the non-governmental organisations, both international and local.  It also refers to the needs of the hosting governments, especially in the areas, for example, of education and health services.  It goes without saying that if there is such a large influx of refugees, for example, more than 1 million registered refugees in Lebanon, that will have an impact on health and education services.  Most of the receiving states have pledged a full commitment to ensuring Syrian refugee children have access to education, but that costs money.  A massive influx to a country's education system means funding is needed to increase classroom sizes, classroom numbers and the number of teachers on the payroll.  Therefore, the appeal is broken down across sectors and it addresses education and health.  I will not go into the details of it because it would probably be too tedious to go through each, but I can leave the committee a copy of the appeal which includes a detailed breakdown.<br/><br/>I cannot answer the Deputy's question as to how many Irish members of the rapid response corps have been deployed.  I can only speak to those representatives of Irish NGOs that I see in the region.  GOAL and Concern are fundamental partners in many aspects of the refugee response.  Irish Aid is, in fact, quite a significant donor to the UNHCR, including in the office where I work in Amman, Jordan.  I work out of our regional office in Amman and we have a staff member there who is supported by Irish Aid funding.  Ireland is a significant partner to us and we are grateful for the support we have received.</p></speech>

I have a few points to make and a few questions.</p> <p>  Ms O'Hara mentioned the 1 million refugees in northern Lebanon.  I visited the refugee camps in northern Lebanon two years ago.  Has Ms O'Hara been there recently and what is the situation?  Many of these people do not want to become so-called refugees.  They just want to go back home.  At a conference in Beirut which was attended by many of the religious leaders from all over the Middle East, I said that I was not speaking about what dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi did, but that there was religious freedom under them.  When these dictators were taken out, there was no solution.  These people we are speaking about do not want to become refugees.</p> <p>  The western world cannot keep taking refugees from the Middle East.  I remember meeting one family and all the woman said was that she wanted to go home to her town in Syria.  That woman had to leave because she was Christian.  This will continue unless there is a political solution based on the Middle East.  The superpowers have to work together to find a solution.  We cannot be using the Middle East as a pawn between Russia and the United States.  Western-type culture cannot be imposed on the Middle East.</p><p>The Middle East is thousands of years old and the United States of America is only a couple of hundred years old.  I was in Egypt with my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and that came up.  The solution for the Middle East must be found within the Middle East.  Iran, Iraq and all of these countries have to work, perhaps with financial support from the Western world, if we are to get a political solution within the Middle East.</p><p> What is the situation like in the camps in Lebanon?  We are taking a number of families from Syria in my own county of Galway.  I have been invited to meet them when they arrive and I look forward to that.  Last night, President Trump said he was going to ban people from various countries, including Syria.  There will also be Brexit in England, which is also going to have a knock-on effect.  This is worrying.  These countries are going to close their borders to refugees and to providing them with new lives and opportunities.  It is going to put more pressure on other countries.  Perhaps Ms O'Hara could comment on that.</p></speech>

The figures presented here today are staggering.  There are 5 million Syrian refugees abroad, 6.6 million are internally displaced and 13.5 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.  War and conflict create refugees as do climate change and famine.  The only solution long term is a political one.  There is a great deal of positive news in regard to some of the discussions in Kazakhstan.  Does Ms O'Hara believe those discussions are going anywhere?</p> <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures set out that 974,000 people are living in besieged areas in Syria.  How does the UNCHR access these people and provide them with food?  How do UNHCR staff get in and out?</p> <p>  On Turkey, I listened to the interview earlier on "Morning Ireland".  Another staggering number mentioned was the 2.8 million refugees.  Does the UNHCR have a view on the EU-Turkey deal, specifically that the EU considers Turkey to be a country of safe origin?  I raised this yesterday post the European Council meetings.  I do not know how anyone under any criteria could consider Turkey a safe country of origin given how it violates the civil and human rights of its own citizens and others.  Turkey is part of the conflict in that region.  It has armed, funded and trained some of the jihadists operating in Aleppo and elsewhere.  However, it is also part of the solution in the area.  I read reports of a leaked letter from the UNHCR which shows that the Turkish Government is refusing and delaying access to asylum seekers in refugee camps after have been deported from Greece to Turkey.  Does the UNHCR have any information on that?  The UNHCR agreed in this agreement that it would be a key actor in the resettlement process.  I am concerned that the UNHCR is a key actor but is not getting access to the camps.  What is happening there?</p> <p>  In regard to vulnerable families and children in refugee camps, I have heard disturbing reports of young girls being sold off into marriage by desperate families who are refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.  What is the approach of the UNHCR to tackling this problem?  Does it have any programmes in the area?</p> <p>  One does no longer hears a great deal about Mosul.  Ms O'Hara said 162,000 people had been displaced due to the fighting there.  It has slipped off the radar despite the ongoing military operation.  What are conditions like for people?  How many are estimated to be still in Mosul?</p> <p>  During the evacuation of eastern Aleppo, there were widespread reports of people going missing, particularly young men following encounters with the police or state security services.  Again, there were concerns following the evacuation.  I am sure the UNHCR is aware of this.  Is it providing support to the families of those who are missing?</p> <p>  There was mention of President Donald Trump.  He is talking about banning resettlement for a certain period.  What impact will that have directly?  He is talking about greater security clearance and so on.</p> <p>  The pledge on funding for Syria has been mentioned by many speakers.  What happens there?  I do not understand why countries make pledges but do not follow through on them.  Is there any attempt?  Is this a regular occurrence?  What excuses do they make?  How do they justify pulling away after providing the pledge internationally?</p></speech>

I am very glad to hear he had the opportunity to visit Lebanon which is one of the main host countries of both Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the region.  I have been speaking more or less exclusively about Syrians, but it should not be forgotten that there are also Iraqi, Somali and Sudanese refugees.  The countries in the region are hosting refugees from beyond Syria.  In his conversations with the people he met Deputy Grealish presumably referred to the fundamental question in the hearts of all refugees, which is the possibility of being able to return home.  I have heard that myself time and again in interactions with refugees.  Lebanon is one of the locations that we cover from our office in Jordan.  I was last in Lebanon just before Christmas and will be there again in the middle of February.  We hear the same things Deputy Grealish heard.  People would like to go home.  However, they are not necessarily willing to go home until they feel things are sufficiently secure.  That is why it is so important to keep a focus on the possibility of a political solution.</p> <p>  Lebanon is significant in that it is also one of the larger host countries for some of the religious minorities, in particular Christians.  Lebanon has quite a high proportion of Christians who have fled Syria.  It is a matter of concern to these communities and their leaders that they do not want to be banished permanently from the Middle East.</p></speech>

Returning home in the wake of some of the levels of violence the minority communities have faced is no easy matter.  There is a long road to travel in terms of rebuilding confidence if indeed that can be achieved at all for the minority communities.  This is something that must remain front and centre of all discussions about political solutions and the prospects for return.  Return is something that remains very much to the forefront of the minds of the vast majority of refugees.  It is something on which the UNHCR works very closely with host communities.  It is definitely a solution that holds out greater prospects than resettlement could possibly achieve.  We are not there yet, however.  The political solution is not in place and conflict continues in parts of Syria and Iraq which makes it not an immediate prospect that people will be able to return home.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe gave me a great deal of homework with his list of questions.  I will try to go through them one by one.  Each and every one of the points he raised was important to address.  The figures are staggering.  This is one of the biggest displacements we have seen in recent times.  The annual statistics issued by UNHCR in 2016 show higher levels of displacement globally than we have seen since the end of the Second World War.</p><p>We are facing a crisis of displacement and the Middle East and North Africa are very much at the crossroads of this displacement, particularly around Syria and Iraq.  Staggering as the numbers are they should not overwhelm us because there are responses and possibilities.  This is why we continue to put these kinds of appeals in the public domain and why we are seeking funding to continue essential programmes which address many of the issues about which the Deputy expresses concern.  </p><p> I will refer to one issue, in particular that the Deputy mentioned, the question of underage marriage and gender based violence more broadly.  We are very much engaged with local communities, and are working on community-based approaches to address those sort of problems.  What do I mean by community-based approaches?  I mean precisely the sort of things that were raised in some of the Deputy's colleagues' questions and comments, to the effect that one has to understand culture and community in order to reach solutions.  When we talk about community-based approaches, we are talking about going into the camps and neighbourhoods where refugees live, speaking to children and their parents and trying to get a good understanding of what drives people into permitting their children to enter underage marriages.  Some of the push factors are definitely financial because people have slipped into such levels of poverty.  Underage marriage, or youth marriage, is sometimes seen as a survival tactic, but it is one which we would perceive as negative because of its impact on the lives and well-being of young girls, in particular.  There are a lot of programmes ongoing in that respect.</p><p> The Deputy also stated that there are some signs of hope coming out of Kazakhstan.  The two-day discussions, which recently concluded in Astana, primarily involved the military actors, those actually doing the fighting.  One of the fundamental outcomes from Astana has been the hope that the ceasefire that was declared in Syria would hold.  Now we see Turkey, Iran and Russia offering themselves as guarantors of that ceasefire.  The cessation of hostilities is, of course, a significant step forward for civilian populations.  The easing of the daily pressure of bombardment is a huge step forward for populations in places like Aleppo, and of course it is to be welcomed, but it needs to be followed up with a firm political solution addressing all other aspects of the conflict ceasefires have come and gone in Syria.  Hopefully, this one will hold.</p><p> With respect to the Deputy's question about Turkey, the UNHCR expressed concerns about the EU-Turkey deal.  For those that are removed from Greece and returned to Turkey we have access to the places where those individuals are held.  We have the possibility to visit and to provide advice and assistance to the Turkish authorities with respect to those cases that are returned.  As I said in response to one of the Deputy's colleagues, one of the fundamental things we lobby the Turkish authorities for is to ensure that persons returned to Turkey, who are in need of international protection, would not be returned onwards to situations of danger, be that back to Syria, Afghanistan or from wherever they may have come.  That is something we are working very closely with the Turkish authorities on.</p><p> I should make a distinction between the locations to which persons removed from Greece go back to in Turkey and the general camp population for the Syrian refugees, to which we have access.  In making that point I would like very much to underline that one of the significant features of the Syria response across the region is the fact that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are not, in fact, living in camps.  One of the fundamental characteristics of this population is that this is a very urbanised population.  The vast majority of refugees are living in host communities in urban locations.  The situation is very different when we look at internal displacement.</p><p> The Deputy asked in particular about the conditions for people leaving Mosul.  Of the 162,000 people who have been displaced, the majority of them are living in temporary camp locations which have had to be set up very quickly to respond to their immediate needs.  Not everyone is in camps, some people have friends and relatives that have been able to host them, but the camp conditions facing those leaving Mosul are very basic.  This is partly by design because of the hope that the displacement will be short-lived and that people will be able to return to Mosul, but that has yet to be fully realised.  The camp conditions are quite basic.  They are not the most comfortable of locations to be living in.  </p><p> The Deputy asked a specific question about the Aleppo situation and the reports of people having gone missing.  In the week leading up to Christmas, roughly between 19 and 22 December, when this evacuation operation took place from Aleppo, between ourselves, UN entities, and the Red Cross, which has had a fundamental role in assisting in the departure of medical cases, we estimate that as many as 35,000 people had direct assistance to be evacuated from Aleppo.  We also estimate that an additional 111,000 people were displaced in Aleppo but have remained there, roughly divided in half between the eastern and western parts of the city.  </p><p> The UN was called on under the conditions of a Security Council resolution to undertake observation and monitoring of the evacuation from Aleppo.  The degree to which we were able to do that effectively was extremely limited.  The buses moved quite fast.  People were loaded on those buses and, while we were there physically in an observer role, it was very difficult to have direct access to people and to be able to speak to them.  We have had much more access to people at the points of arrival in locations within Idlib province.  There, as the Deputy stated in his question, we have spoken to people who have lost family members.  They have been separated from them.  They may be in detention.  There is a lot of work ongoing trying to trace family members.  That was a characteristic of the Aleppo evacuation and indeed of other evacuations prior to that.  I had personal experience myself of the evacuation from Homs in the summer of 2014 and we saw similar dynamics there.  </p><p> On what I believe was the Deputy's last question, and he will tell me if I skipped any, on the question of pledging, we also often wonder why one would pledge and then not commit.  It obviously creates problems for the sustainability and predictability of funding.  What I want to make very clear is that when I talk about the major appeals only reaching a 60% level of funding, that does not necessarily equate to pledges having been made and not fully met.  That starts from the fundamental basis of the pledges not necessarily matching up to the needs because we are constantly working on the basis of needs-based planning.  By needs we are talking about people's fundamental needs, along the lines of the breakdown of the appeal that I gave the Deputy's colleague, such as health services, education and all those basic needs.  We find that all too frequently the pledges simply do not match the needs.  There are a range of reasons some individual states may fail to meet their pledges.  It can be budgetary changes within a state or it can be changes in administration.  Within a given funding year, there can be changes made to the pledges that individual states have made.</p></speech>

I will not go back over questions that have already been asked.  We know the political situation and the political answer in regard to Syria from what Ms O'Hara has said.  My question is on where that will lead into rebuilding and people going home.  What is her sense of how near or how far away that is?  With the fall of Aleppo I think people were wondering if that might be it in terms of the military end of it or if we are going to see another Aleppo in places like Douma or Idlib?  Does the UNHCR have any engagement with the white helmets?  We hear conflicting reports about their work.</p> <p>  Others have mentioned the Yazidis and the minorities.  Where can the UNHCR help people like the Yazidis who are scattered in a number of countries, who are an ethnic group and who want to go back to their homeland and to have their right of return?</p><p>Are protection zones respected when there is an attempt to provide a protection zone for vulnerable people?</p><p> The UN is a massive organisation.  There are many NGOs, other organisations and faith-based groups in the countries where the UN is working.  What is the level of co-ordination?  Even though all of the groups are present, some people can fall through the cracks.  Before Christmas some of us met a group that is working with Iraqi Christian refugees who are based in Jordan and relying on fund-raising efforts in this and other countries to support their health, education and housing needs.</p><p> Regarding Yemen and the effect of the use of drones and cluster bombs, what work is the UN doing in that country?</p><p> Finally, other members have asked about Turkey.  My concern about Turkey is that there are Kurdish groups who are very proactive in supporting democracy and people's democratic rights, yet we are aware of the conflict between the Turks and the Kurds.  Where can there be a resolution to that in the future?  My fear is that, again, the Kurdish people will be the victims in all of this.</p><p> The witness mentioned community based work.  We had a meeting with representatives of the Global Fund recently and they pointed out that community-based interventions in terms of health are much more effective, so it was good to hear that point.</p></speech>

Is it a policy decision that the UNHCR does not involve itself or is it the fact that it was not invited?  As an organisation that has been deeply involved in the situation it must know a great deal more detail than most of us on this side of the world.  It is extraordinary that it would not be involved in any attempts to bring about a political solution.</p> <p>  Pouring money into this problem will not solve it.  I had the experience in the 1990s, when I was Minister for Defence, of regularly visiting Lebanon and Syria.  As the witnesses will be aware, at that time Lebanon was under attack more than Syria.  It is extraordinary that this reversal has now happened.  Where does the UNHCR fit into the equation?  Pardon my ignorance if I should know this.  However, it strikes me that there is a huge weakness in how to bring about a solution after six years of war.  Pouring money into the situation will not solve the problem.  It is time that key people such as the witnesses and others, who understand the difficulties, are brought into an attempt to bring about a peaceful solution.  It is very difficult for people here to understand the difference between our culture and the culture in that part of the world.  As I found out, one must be there to understand it.  We are getting ourselves into a situation where we are blaming one country, such as Iran or others.  The reality is that if people have religious beliefs and come under attack and if people of their religious beliefs are being attacked in another country, it is automatic that they would have sympathy and move towards trying to solve it.  That would happen equally in this country, if we saw Christians or Catholics being attacked.  Of course we would help.</p> <p>  At this stage the talking is over.  It is time to get the key people around a table and not just keep pouring money into the situation.  We are talking about vast sums of money that could be used far better in rebuilding the infrastructure and getting people back into their homes.  Can the witnesses give some guidance on what is the best thing we can do to promote a situation that would assist the UNHCR and others to get around the table and try to find a solution to this problem?  Blaming one country or another is irrelevant at this stage, as far as I am concerned.  There are reasons that others are involved, but at this stage there is not much point in arguing about it.  They are involved.  Perhaps the witnesses would educate me on where their role starts and finishes, or am I asking too much of the UNHCR in saying that it should be around the table when the negotiations are taking place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Hara" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017012600002#G00300"><p>The Deputy certainly is not asking too much.  I am here to answer the members' questions and I will do my best to do so.</p> <p>  I will respond first to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  She asked how close we are to returns.  It is a difficult question to answer.  There are very high aspirations for returns.  It is important to understand that returns have been ongoing simultaneously with the waves of displacement I have described.  By and large, it is from within the populations of internally displaced.  In that situation people who were displaced stayed close to home and if the situation improves they would attempt to return.  We see circular patterns of displacement and returns throughout the region.  However, if the Deputy's question is about how close we are to seeing the large scale return of refugees, we are some way from that although, as I said in response to earlier questions, that is the aspiration of the vast majority of the refugees.</p> <p>  On the specific question about the White Helmets, it is not an organisation the UNHCR is working with directly in the sense of providing direct funding to it.  However, we are very familiar with its work in Aleppo and other locations and we have seen at first hand the value of its work in attempting to save lives.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about protection zones.  The UNHCR has spoken publicly on this on a number of occasions.  The mere declaration of a zone as a safe or protected zone by one or other party to a conflict does not make that zone materialise in a way that it could be considered viable and safe.  I work for an organisation whose primary responsibility is to defend the right to asylum.  The fundamental underlying component of the right to asylum is the right to be able to flee, including across international borders, if the protection of one's life and one's family's security requires that.  We take a very cautious approach to the various declarations about safe zones.  In previous conflicts we have had the experience of safe zones that turned out to be not very safe.  I think in particular of experiences lived and lessons learned very harshly in the Balkans, so we approach the safe zone questions with much caution.  However, we simultaneously welcome localised ceasefires and the pacification of areas that would allow people to remain or to return.  The option of safe zones is worth exploring but the zones would have to live up to quite high international standards to be genuinely called safe zones.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about Yemen, it is a country within our area of coverage.  I have been to Yemen only once but we have a considerable team working there.  The crisis in Yemen is characterised more by internal displacement than by refugees.  We do not see huge numbers of Yemeni refugees in the region, but the levels of internal displacement are quite massive and on a par with those in Syria and Iraq.  Unfortunately, the Yemen humanitarian appeal, which I was reviewing in draft yesterday and which will soon be released, is one of the most underfunded in the region.</p><p>What we see in Yemen, in comparison with Iraq and Syria, is a humanitarian crisis that in some ways goes beyond what we see in the other two countries.  I am not referring to the numbers involved but issues such as levels of malnutrition which are extremely acute in Yemen and a characteristic of the crisis that is very distressing. </p><p> The Deputy asked me a specific question about Kurdish populations.  I should make clear that the UNHCR has no direct involvement with programmes in Turkey which are responding to the internal displacement of Turkish Kurds.  However, we are very much involved with Kurdish populations across all of northern Syria and the Kurdish regional area of Iraq or KRI.  The KRI is a location that hosts refugees - 250,000 Syrian refugees still live in the region - and is simultaneously responding to very large-scale displacement.  Many of the people who have been displaced from places such as Mosul are moving either to the Kurdish region or areas on its boundaries.  The authorities in the region are playing a significant role in the response to internal displacement and continuing to host refugees from Syria. </p><p> Deputy S&eacute;an Barrett's question was definitely not easy, but it merits an answer.  It is not so much a question of the UNHCR not being invited to the talks but one of different roles for different parts of the United Nations within the talks.  An invitation to the talks in Astana was extended to the United Nations and the UN delegation was headed by the Secretary General's special envoy, Mr. de Mistura.  In reference to the political process which Mr. de Mistura leads, for which talks are anticipated to resume in Geneva in early February, the last rounds of formal talks in Geneva broke down without much success last April.  While the UNHCR does not sit at the table as a party to the discussions, we are present at them.</p><p> I referred to our role and responsibility to ensure the voice of refugees was heard.  Part of the Geneva talks addresses the involvement of civil society and includes refugee representatives.  That is where we participate and we do so alongside the refugees.  However, the UNHCR also participates based on our experience of displacement, which is not only in Syria and Iraq.  Our experience stretches back to the foundation of the UNHCR in the early 1950s.  We are at the talks and have a voice, but our voice is primarily humanitarian.</p><p> I hear the Deputy loud and clear and certainly do not disagree with his comments to the effect that continuing to pour money into a humanitarian response does not in and of itself bring a solution.  I could not agree more that the money could arguably be far better used on reconstruction activities which will be needed when any solution starts to kick in.  At the same time, when we see a final solution - a political solution - being reached, there will be a shift towards returns and reconstruction.  There will still be humanitarian needs, however, and the appeal we were addressing in Helsinki, namely, the phenomenal price tag of $4.63 billion to which I have referred several times, was to pay for essential services that need to be maintained until such time as there is a full solution because these are basic services.</p></speech>

If the UNHCR is dealing daily with people at the coalface, surely it is advisable to have representatives of the organisation, not necessarily Ms O'Hara, at the negotiating table, even it means sitting behind the main UN representative.</p> <p>  It strikes me that it is very difficult for people to understand events in Syria.  Religion is involved and there have been all sorts of other issue over the years.  While it will not be easy to find, a solution is very badly needed.  A small country such as Ireland can try to force a circumstance in which people are kept at the table and those at the table are those who have knowledge and experience of the difficulties on the ground.  An organisation such as the UNHCR needs to be at the negotiations, whether seated at the table or behind those at it.  It should at least be hanging around when the negotiations are taking place.</p></speech>

This has caused a major cultural change.  The death of Alan Kurdi caused a major outpouring among Irish people who wanted to provide help and support.  A number of groups consisting of organisations which deal with migrants, politicians and others came together to try to learn from mistakes made in the past and respond to the goodwill that had been shown.  Unfortunately, difficulties have arisen in that regard.  People will automatically conclude that I am referring to recent developments in Ballaghdereen, but accurate information dissipates fear.  We need to ensure people know about the resources available and so on.  How important are these factors in the resettlement programme and ensuring those being resettled are welcomed rather than met with antagonism, fear and uncertainty?  Is this a key component of what we need to do in the future?</p> <p>  Ms O'Hara stated the Irish response had been modest.  We would all like to increase it.  We must learn from what has not worked in the past, for example, direct provision, and take new and different approaches.  How important will this be, particularly for politicians?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.794" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Hara" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017012600002#H00400"><p>I can respond from the point of view of sending refugees.  I fully agree that resettlement is not easy to achieve.  It presents cultural challenges.  It is very important that refugees be properly prepared for the resettlement process.  For example, they need to know where they are going and what to expect.  A degree of counselling should be undertaken at the departure point.  In my current role I am more involved on that side of the equation.  However, this leads on naturally to the issues the Deputy raised about the importance of having proper reception and integration mechanisms available at the point of arrival.  We sometimes talk about resettlement in a casual way and only in terms of numbers, but there is more to resettlement that just numbers.  Cultural adaptability and reception are significant factors in the success of resettlement programmes, not only for the benefit of the refugees and their family members who are the direct beneficiaries of being accepted on a resettlement programme into a country such as Ireland but also for the credibility of resettlement programmes in the eyes of the general population of hosting and receiving states.  It is only with the support of the general public that programmes of resettlement can be maintained and have a positive impact.</p><p>I could not agree more with the comments Deputy Crowe made about the importance of considering and analysing critically what has and has not worked regarding reception to constantly strive to improve resettlement programmes.</p><p> Regarding the Irish programme, I used the word "modest" several times but I coupled it with the words "not insignificant".  Considering the size of Ireland and of our population, 4,000 does not sound like a huge number in the context of the general numbers I have mentioned to the committee, but that 4,000 means an opportunity for 4,000 individuals - women, children, family members - to come to somewhere like Ireland for a fresh start.  It is modest but definitely not insignificant.</p></speech>

These are people living in really desperate circumstances.  This 63 million is equivalent to the population of Britain and just short of the population of France.  Regarding the figures Ms O'Hara quoted in her presentation in respect of Syria alone, 13.5 million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance, 6.3 million are internally displaced, there are 4.8 million Syrian refugees and 4.6 million people live in areas that are hard to access.  This is for one country alone.  It is really frightening to think of the desperate situation and the huge humanitarian programme of assistance that is needed.  As other members have said, and as Ms O'Hara stated earlier in her concluding remarks, we need a political solution and we need dialogue.  We sincerely hope the talks that resume next month will bring some progress.  In her experience in this regard with her colleagues, working daily on this situation, does Ms O'Hara see any grounds for optimism regarding progress being made this year in the region?</p></speech>

If not, it would be difficult for us to continue our work.  Where I see the hope is in the expression of refugees themselves.  Deputy Grealish referred to this arising from his visit to Lebanon.  We must remain with some optimism based on the desires and the willingness of refugees and internally displaced persons themselves to find a solution.  Obviously, they cannot do that alone.  If they could, a solution would have been found long before now.  However, in my everyday work, I see the hope still in the expressions of the refugees and the IDPs.  It is our obligation as UNHCR, as a humanitarian organisation, to work with them to achieve those aspirations.  I hope we will see progress in the course of the year because we are entering the seventh year of the Syria crisis and there must be a limit.  It cannot continue unabated as it has done.  We have seen some improvements with ceasefires.  The benefit of the ceasefire is felt by the civilians inside Syria, but the ceasefire that dates from the start of the evacuation of Aleppo is continuing to hold, so we do see some signs of progress.  Hopefully, they can be consolidated and built upon into something more permanent.</p></speech>

I am very glad that Enda O'Neill, head of the UNHCR's office in Ireland, was able to join us for this presentation as well.  I wish Ms O'Hara and all her colleagues in her organisation every success in the very important work it does on behalf of the most disadvantaged people throughout the world.  We know there are unfortunately so many countries and regions needing the UNHCR's assistance.  We sincerely hope the Governments of the world and the international community in general will be generous enough to act as donors for the amounts that are required to try to ease the plight of the most disadvantaged people in the world today.  I repeat that we wish the UNHCR continued success in its work in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

She is accompanied by Ms Catherine Heaney, who has been working on this campaign with the Dwyer family.  They are both very welcome today.  I am aware they have been campaigning to have an international-led investigation into the circumstances of the killing.  The purpose of today's presentation is to inform members of this committee of the latest developments in the family's campaign and to assess what assistance we, as a committee, can lend to that campaign.  As the witnesses are aware, we will hear their opening statement before having some questions and answers.</p></speech>

I thank members for giving me the opportunity to make this presentation today.  I am accompanied by Ms Catherine Heaney, as the Chairman mentioned, who has supported me in navigating the advocacy infrastructures we have engaged in with this case.</p><p>I would like to start by reminding the members about my son.  Michael came into the lives of myself and my husband on 15 June 1984.  He was the eldest of our four children and was brought up in a small, close-knit community in Ballinderry, north Tipperary.<br/><br/>Before he left for Bolivia in 2008, Michael graduated with an honours degree in construction management and took up a short-term contract in site security.  That job ended.  At the time, Ireland was in a deep recession and there were no jobs in construction for a young graduate.  He left Ireland to undertake a security course in Bolivia.  I helped him organise his travel.  There was no hidden agenda.  He used his own passport during his travels and kept in contact with me.  He told me about his girlfriend, a Brazilian medical student.  He sent me copies of his curriculum vitae, CV, so that I could help him obtain a job here in Ireland.<br/><br/>Michael was a loving son, a caring brother and a great friend.  He loved life.  He was full of fun, and he loved to socialise.  Our home has been quiet for almost eight years.  The laughter he brought has been silenced in our house.  I knew my son.  He had no ulterior motives.  We are not a political family, and Michael was not political.  He would have had no interest in or knowledge of Bolivian politics, and he did not speak Spanish.<br/><br/>Michael was killed by the Bolivian special police force, UTARC, at the Hotel Las Americas on 16<sup></sup>April 2009 in an operation that President Morales claimed immediately afterwards through the media he had ordered.  The initial evidence supplied to the Irish Government by the Bolivian authorities did not stack up.  That was the opinion of the Irish Government, which immediately called for an independent international investigation.<br/><br/>The Bolivian authorities claimed <i>in flagrante delicto</i>as the justification for not complying with the normal criteria for a raid on a private building in the early hours of the morning.  To support this claim, Bolivian officials stated that there was a street chase from the centre of Santa Cruz to the Hotel Las Americas and that there was a 30 minute shoot-out in which Michael was killed.<br/><br/>When Michael&rsquo;s body was repatriated to Ireland, it was examined by the State pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy.  She also examined the photographic and other information that was made available by the Bolivian authorities.  Her analysis concluded that Michael could not have been engaged in a shoot-out.  The bullet when straight through his heart and damaged his lung.  When he lay dead or dying, he was shot four more times in the back.  He was in bed wearing nothing but his underwear.  There is no doubt that Michael was summarily executed.<br/><br/>The Irish Government, the European Union, through the offices of the European External Action Service, EEAS, and our family have every confidence in the report presented by Dr. Cassidy.  That is why we are united in our call for an independent, international and transparent investigation into the killing of Michael.<br/><br/>I would like to put on record that I have hugely valued the support of successive Irish Governments, in particular that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, the former Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is present, the European External Action Service and the European Parliament, especially the former Irish delegation of MEPs who have not given up in their questioning and support for Michael&rsquo;s case.<br/><br/>Since the day of Michael&rsquo;s death, my family&rsquo;s objective has been to establish the truth.  Large elements of the media &ndash; in Ireland and internationally &ndash; sullied his name.  The information and the photographs released by the Bolivian authorities were not questioned.<br/><br/>In the immediate aftermath of the executions of Michael and two others in the Hotel Las Americas, and in which two more were arrested, the Bolivian authorities used this event to arrest 37 local businessmen and opposition figures in Santa Cruz.  Almost eight years later, the trial of those men continues in the kangaroo court of Santa Cruz.  While four of them opted for an abbreviated process in 2015 and took a plea bargain for lesser charges in return for a sentence of time already spent in prison, that plea was essentially a plea for freedom.  The ongoing trial is the excuse that we are given for the Bolivian authorities not commencing the investigating into the execution of Michael.<br/><br/>Michael is not part of that trial.  He does not get an opportunity to defend himself.  It is absolutely unjust that my family cannot get the truth put on record in Bolivia and have those responsible held accountable for Michael&rsquo;s execution.<br/><br/>Over the past eight years, we travelled over and back to the European Parliament to mobilise support for our call for an international investigation into Michael&rsquo;s killing.  We travelled to Geneva to submit our case to the UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial executions who, on review, deemed that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that this was an extra-judicial killing and subsequently issued letters of allegation to the Bolivian authorities, the highest level of complaint from the office of the UN.<br/><br/>In 2012, we submitted a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights specifically on the violation of Article 4, the right to life.  In recent months, Michael&rsquo;s case entered into the first of three phases <i>en route</i>to the inter-American court.<br/><br/>In June 2014, we learned that Marcelo Soza, the chief prosecutor in the trial of the 37 accused in Santa Cruz, had fled from Bolivia to Brazil as he had failed to deliver the sentencing of the accused and was now under persecution himself.  We travelled to Brazil to interview him.  He provided a witness statement to us confirming that there was no legal basis or authorisation for the police raid on the Hotel Las Americas, that as the first official present to gather evidence at the scene he found Michael was unarmed, that there was no evidence of a shoot-out and that, during the five years of his investigations, he found no evidence implicating Michael in any unlawful activity in his time in Bolivia.<br/><br/>Later in 2014, Catherine Heaney, my eldest daughter Aisling, who is here with me, and I travelled to Bolivia to see how we could further piece together Michael&rsquo;s case.  That visit was also a deeply personal one.  We visited the room in which Michael&rsquo;s dead body had lain.  I felt that the person who killed him was just centimeters away, both in my mind and physically, when Michael was killed.  The room was so small, there was no room for a shoot-out.  We saw the city in which he spent the last days of his young life.  It was an upsetting time for us, but it was important for us to make that connection.<br/><br/>During that visit we met with the hotel manager who was the first witness to see the lifeless bloodied bodies lying in the bedrooms.  His evidence is crucial.  There were no guns lying near those who were dead, and no evidence of any crossfire.  All the bullet damage came from one direction - the police.  He recounted how the heavily armed police had threatened the night porter at gun point, demanded that the hotel front doors were unlocked, disconnected the CCTV cameras and, having confirmed the room numbers of their targets, quietly made their way to the fourth floor of the hotel.  There was an explosion followed by short bursts of gunfire, and it was all over.  Three people lay dead in their bedrooms.  Later, we heard from another witness, a guest at the hotel, who said that after hearing the explosion they heard pleas for life, shots and then silence.<br/><br/>Also during this visit in 2014, supported by the offices of the EU and the Irish Government, we travelled to La Paz and met with representatives of the Bolivian Government.  Our objective was to present to them our family&rsquo;s complaint about the ex-judicial execution of our son and to personally call upon them to accept our request for an independent, international investigation.  As recently as last night, the response from the Bolivian Government was sent to us.  It was its response to the Inter-American Commission.  One point it made in that response was that the family had not made a complaint about Michael's killing.  It is a point we might discuss after the presentation but I only got this information last night.  That type of response is what we have faced over the past eight years.  We went to Bolivia twice to make an official complaint and yet in a letter to the Inter-American Commission, they said they never received any complaint.<br/><br/>During our engagement, the representatives of the Bolivian Government expressed their condolences to us on the loss of our son.  In response to our call for an independent, international investigation, they indicated that other processes could only be considered once the ongoing trial in Santa Cruz was complete.  In terms of an update on that trial, they are eight years into it.  They are on witness 28 of 42, and they reckon the trial will take at least another three years.  That same position was reiterated in November 2015 when my family met with the delegation of President Evo Morales during his visit to Ireland.  At that meeting, we expressed our concern that evidence and recall relating to Michael&rsquo;s killing is fading away, and that at least one of the key individuals involved in the raid on the hotel in Santa Cruz is now deceased.  They offered my family a commitment that if we were to revisit Bolivia, we would be facilitated in meeting key Bolivian officials who were involved at the time of Michael&rsquo;s killing.</p><p>After months of communications with the Bolivian authorities and an agreement to provide us with access to interview most of the list of 19 witnesses we identified, we made the long journey back to La Paz in July 2016.  Hours after our arrival in La Paz, we were informed that the interviews with those key individuals were cancelled.  After overnight interventions by the Irish Government, we were met by Bolivian deputy officials who eventually produced two individuals for us to interview.  However, those individuals were apparently suffering a severe episode of amnesia and the response to each of my questions was frustratingly the same.  They could not remember a thing of their evidence gathering of the current most high profile case ever to happen in Bolivia.  Our journey was wasted, Bolivian promises broken, and the diplomatic process that I have so heavily invested in was severely fractured.<br/><br/>My recent encounters confirmed to me that I will struggle to ever get justice for Michael in Bolivia.  We have assembled evidential documentation over the past eight years and keep a close eye on developments in Bolivia.  We have submitted a case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and while we received an initial commitment that our case would be fast-tracked through the system, it now appears stuck.  Sometimes, it feels that we are running out of road in terms of clearing Michael&rsquo;s name.<br/><br/>I ask members of this committee to consider ways of assisting to deliver some justice to my dear son, Michael.  At a very basic level, I urge members to consider the reports and information we have gathered and for them to make their own assessment of Michael&rsquo;s case.  A report of this committee would be hugely important in supporting the concerns that the Irish and European Governments - in addition to my family - have been highlighting.  Based on this work, I would be pleased if members could consider submitting an <i>amicus curiae </i>or letter to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights pointing out their observations and concerns.<br/><br/>I do not intend to hold back on my work in calling the Bolivian authorities to account for their actions.  I call on the committee to consider any potential to visit Bolivia to examine the circumstances of Michael&rsquo;s killing.  Alternatively, in any personal visit by me, I would very much appreciate the potential of having a representative from this committee to join me as an observer.  An immediate action from that could be an observer's report to this committee which could subsequently be used in my international advocacy.  I want witness testimony on the facts surrounding Michael's killing put on official record at least in Ireland before it is too late. <br/><br/>Nothing can bring Michael back to us but we will not give up in our search for the true facts and justice.  Michael was the victim of an extrajudicial killing.  The manner of his killing was a flagrant abuse of the UN Convention on Human Rights, and in particular Article 4 on the right to life.  His killing is a human rights issue.  It is a loss that myself and my family find so difficult to cope with to this day.  My son was an innocent victim.  Ultimately, I want those responsible for executing Michael to be held accountable.  I thank members for their time.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

She delivered her very comprehensive report, which must have been exceptionally difficult for her, in a very composed manner.  When I had the opportunity to meet with her and Ms Heaney last summer, I mentioned that we would afford them the opportunity to come before the committee at a time that suited them to ensure that the committee, along with all Members of the Oireachtas, would do everything we could to try to assist and ensure that the truth would be discovered.  The committee met with Mr. Pat Bourne, head of consular services in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We told him at the time that we would be meeting with Ms Dwyer and Ms Heaney and that we would afford them the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.  We will be very pleased to follow up the proposals they put to the committee and to support them.  We want the basic truth to be found and for the Bolivian authorities to co-operate.  I propose to the committee that we will again meet with senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and make sure we are not at cross purposes in terms of the Department's own work but that we will work in conjunction with it.  The witnesses will have the full support of the committee in whatever way we can to support them in getting to the truth.  I invite members to comment or ask questions.</p></speech>

I also commend Ms Dwyer and her family and Ms Heaney on the tireless work they have carried out on behalf of Michael.</p> <p>  My knowledge of the case is limited.  It seems to me that Ms Dwyer's son was summarily executed and we must carry out some actions on behalf of the Dwyer family.  I am very sympathetic to the proposals that have been put forward.  We must examine them as a committee and see how we can act on the recommendations.  When will Ms Dwyer hear from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights whether the case is admissible?</p></speech>

We received the response last night.  As I mentioned, the commission has indicated that we have not made an official complaint but the process from here is that we have 30 days to make a counter-response and then the commission will make a decision on admissibility.  We believe from our work with the commission that we should get through this process.  The commission struggles itself with resources and funding.  We were given a commitment by the head of the commission that we would be prioritised but because of the lack of resources it could take another six months before we get to admissibility.</p></speech>

He said it is one of the most important cases that is being taken at the moment in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  In terms of adding weight to our complaint, while the committee cannot become a joint complainant the commission would welcome letters of support for individual cases that are before it.</p></speech>

The fact is that they invited us there and committed to provide the witnesses to us.  Ms Heaney and I, and my daughter Aisling, travelled to London in April of last year.  We set out who we wanted to meet.  Communications went backwards and forwards and as late as two weeks before we travelled it was confirmed that we would meet those people.  It was horrendous to hear three hours after we arrived that the meetings were cancelled.  I was distraught.</p></speech>

I read the transcript of Ms Dwyer's presentation as I received it last night.  I admire and acknowledge her persistence.  She has never given up on getting justice for her son over all these years.  She and her family have been doing incredible work.  It must have been most frustrating to meet with the officials and be told the meetings with the witnesses were cancelled.  Is there any possibility of the meetings being rescheduled?</p><p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe asked about the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.  Ms Dwyer also mentioned meeting the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings.  Has she any hope that this might lead to justice or a way to progress the case?  I also wonder about other regional bodies in Latin America.  Bolivia has good relationships with a number of other Latin American countries, such as Cuba.  Some of us engage with the Cuban Embassy and ambassador.  I wonder if we could do something through his good offices.  Something similar worked in another part of the world for me another time.  Where can Ms Dwyer bring the evidence she received from the chief prosecutor when she met him?  Can she make any progress on it?</p></speech>

That is the highest level of complaint the UN can make.  The UN does not carry out investigations.  It examines the evidence, makes a conclusion and writes the letter of allegation.  That is as far as the process goes.  That is why we moved into the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights scenario.</p></speech>

Through this, we became aware that Bolivia had been campaigning heavily to get onto the UN Security Council and used the Colombian peace process as one of the things it could bring to the table.  We tried to exploit this contact.  Unfortunately, the referendum was lost and the connection fell apart.  We are happy and willing to consider other infrastructure.</p> <p>  Ms Dwyer made the point about the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the court.  It faces the problems of defunding and a low level of commitment and compliance in South America.  Often there are cases in which the court proposes fines and countries never pay them.  It happens a lot in the human rights context.  There is also a major fear with the change of administration in the US, which is the biggest funder of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, that it could be further eroded.  It is the strongest instrument across the Americas.  This is why we have invested so much.</p> <p>  We sought advice and examined every infrastructure option.  Many of them are weak.  There is a dual context.  It is very important that the truth be found, for the sake of human rights.  One cannot just kill somebody for nothing.  The other purpose is to clear Mr. Dwyer's name.  Once somebody's name is damaged, it is very difficult to rebuild it.  It takes years, whereas the damage can happen in just a day.</p></speech>

I am desperately sorry for Ms Dwyer's loss.  It was very moving and she is amazing to be able to do this and fight for him.  I offer my condolences to Ms Dwyer and her family.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe asked the question I had in mind about the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  Did Ms Dwyer make any kind of formal complaint?  I presume she did.  Was it not in the correct format and was that why the Bolivian Government said she had not?</p> <p>  They say Mr. Dwyer was involved in a 30-minute shoot out.  However, his body was found in the hotel and, as Ms Dwyer said, in his underwear.  Are they suggesting he was running through the streets for 30 minutes in his underwear and then he was shot, and how can they back it up?</p></speech>

The statement said there was a chase through the streets of Santa Cruz, back to the hotel where a 30 minute gun battle ensued.  This clearly was not the case.  I have explained how the police raided the hotel in the middle of the night.</p> <p>  Although we had made complaints a number of times ourselves and through the Irish Government, the Bolivian Government said publicly that it had never received a complaint.  When we went to Bolivia in 2014, our main objective was to hand a formal complaint to the Bolivian Government and we made them stamp it in order to show it had been received.  We have a stamp on our submission that says it received it.  In July 2016, we went back and reiterated the complaint.  It is completely incredible that it would turn around in its response and say it had not received a formal complaint.</p></speech>

I have been following the case for eight years along with Ms Caroline Dwyer and Ms Heaney.  They are very welcome today, along with Ms Aisling Dwyer.  The Dwyer family live in Ballinderry, County Tipperary.  They are an incredible family and very well thought of.  They need the committee's support.  I have no questions, given that I have been involved for so long.  I will make some comments and some suggestions to the committee on the issue.</p> <p>  From the way Ms Dwyer has put forward her evidence, we can see there is no closure for the Dwyer family.  We need to help them to get some form of closure, whatever percentage that can be.  For Ms Dwyer and her family there can never be full closure.  They have lost their son.  Michael Dwyer was executed, murdered by a foreign government.  I have seen the evidence and videos.  He was picked out and executed by a government.  This Parliament needs to support the family in getting as much of this evidence as possible out there, highlighting it as much as possible and getting as much closure as possible.</p> <p>  Ms Dwyer has outlined the journey she has been on regarding the support here, the European Commission and the UN.  However, the simple fact is that the Bolivian Government will not allow the evidence to come out.  We saw it as recently as last night.  They said the family could meet the witnesses when they travelled.  All of a sudden, the witnesses disappeared and the ones they met were no use, given that they were being programmed.  Last night, the family received a letter saying there had never been an official complaint.  They have handed in written, signed complaints.  The Bolivian Government is deliberately obstructing the process given that it knows it executed an Irish man.  It picked him out and executed him.  I believe he was summarily executed after the fact.  I think it is the family's belief also.  The evidence points to it.  I have seen all the evidence.</p> <p>  This stinks from the very top, from the President of Bolivia.  The prosecutor in the case had to seek refuge in Brazil.  The evidence he has given is incredible, as is the evidence of Elod Toaso, who said Mr. Dwyer had been alive and had been brought back and executed.  Nearly eight years ago, an Irish citizen was taken out by the Bolivian Government and executed, and, by God, we are going to have to do something about it and support the family.</p><p>I am convinced on this.  I have followed this for many years.  I have done whatever I can to support the family, and I know that all parties and all institutions have done so as well.  Within the next 30 days, Caroline and her family, and Ms Catherine Heaney, who has done so much work <i>pro bono </i>to help the Dwyer family over the last number of years and who deserves our thanks, will have to send back a submission to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.  They will need all the support they can get, and the Department will supply that.<br/><br/>I am asking this committee to send a delegation to Bolivia.  This is an extraordinary situation.  We have done this in the recent past, and rightly so.  It does not have to be as large a delegation as that which went to Egypt but we need to show the Bolivian Government that we are not going to tolerate the blatant execution of an Irish citizen.  We are going to highlight it to embarrass it, if it is not going to co-operate.<br/><br/>There is also an issue in regard to getting evidence on the record.  We need a platform to put out all the evidence we are aware of.  We need a medium to do that and any help or suggestions the committee would have in regard to doing that are welcome.  We need a forum to do that before more time passes.<br/><br/>A declaration from this committee on its view in regard to what happened to Michael would also be helpful.  Closure comes in many different ways.  Initially, the way in which this family was treated by some aspects of the media in this country was nothing short of a disgrace.  There is still an element of that out there.  A declaration from this committee would be very supportive.  This young man was executed.  He was in Bolivia, he was working and he was executed for no reason.</p></speech>

To get that at a UN level, what we would require is the co-operation of the Bolivian authorities.  In many ways we keep getting stuck.  If the case clears from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights then that court hearing will be vital as a forum.  It is not a paper court, like the European Court of Human Rights.  It is an actual physical court, where there is testimony and witness statements.  In terms of documenting what happened that is going to be a really important forum.  We are confident that will happen, although much more slowly than we had originally anticipated.</p> <p>  To go back to some earlier questions, such as the possibility of the meetings that we were promised last year being rescheduled, we have low confidence in the system, but perhaps if the question was posed by a different forum it would be possible.  A few years ago former MEP, Mr. Gay Mitchell, was on the European Parliament's Committee on Development, the sub-committee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  A huge amount of Bolivia's aid actually comes through Europe.  It is a Spanish speaking country and there are strong connections with the Spanish Government.  Mr. Mitchell went carried out reconnaissance before the new round of development aid was agreed for Bolivia and he made it his business to meet quite a number of politicians and asked hard questions and he became very engaged in the case.  I think that there is still more political advocacy to be done.</p> <p>  On the evidence of the prosecutor, Marcelo Soza, we travelled to Brazil and all this travel has been funded by ourselves.  We travelled for two days to Brasilia, arriving in the early hours of Saturday and leaving on the Monday.  We met Mr. Soza and recorded all his testimony, so we have that on record, on tape.  I also took extensive notes at the meeting.  He also shared the hard drives of his computer with us, so we downloaded those and brought it back.  That showed evidence that he claimed had been tampered with, evidence that had been created post-event and placed.  He gave us a huge amount of information, and he also wrote a letter and signed it to say that he would be happy for this to be presented to any forum of the Irish Government, the European Parliament or indeed any other international body.  That is available.</p></speech>

It is a very close community and he was able to ascertain the impact that this had, particularly on the family.  He followed the matter closely.  Concerning the issue around the media coverage, we did not talk about post-truth or alternative facts then but there were lots of them, and I think that has been hugely damaging to Michael's reputation.  I have often said that it is hard to kill a dead man.  He really had been defamed, and was not available to contest that.  I think that is an important point to have on the record, and I thank Deputy Kelly.</p></speech>

The purpose of suggesting that you make a presentation to the committee was so that we could put on the record our absolute support.  We will follow up on the suggestions proposed and the actions that you would like to see us take.  I am very glad that the head of consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Pat Bourne, is here today with colleagues from his division.  We have met Mr. Bourne in the past and discussed this issue, and we know he has taken a very keen and ongoing interest in supporting you.  What I suggest to our committee is that we will agree to meet with Mr. Bourne and his officials next week and follow up on the actions that you have requested.  We will liaise with the Department to ensure that we are all working in parallel and working together, and will take on board the suggestions that have been made by members.</p> <p>  I do not know off hand which European Commissioner has responsibility for human rights but we might engage directly with that Commissioner as a committee.  Can I just assure you that we will do everything we can as a committee to support you in your endeavours to get to the truth.  You have made an excellent presentation to us today.  It must have been an extremely difficult presentation to make, and it was done extremely well.  The Department has said to us that you have been trying so hard without seeking media coverage to try to unearth the truth, and it is deplorable, as Deputy Kelly said, that in the past we have had media commentary that was beneath contempt at times.  Hopefully, our work and our endorsement of your seeking the truth will redress some of that.</p><p>We will run any correspondence we send to an agency or political representative past the witnesses first to ensure good dialogue.  We will also include the Department.  Please be assured the witnesses have the full support of the committee in whatever way we can help.  I offer them sincere thanks for the presentation.  I am glad that Ms Dwyer's daughter, Aisling, could be here today as well.</p></speech>

My name is Jerry Beades, Chairman of Friends of Banking Ireland.  I have worked all my life in construction, engineering and property.  Currently, I am chief executive officer, CEO, of JMCI QATAR, an engineering and specialist construction firm operating in Doha, Qatar, on rail and stadium projects for the 2022 World Cup.<br/><br/>I am joined by Brian Reilly, an associate of Friends of Banking Ireland and someone who has suffered financially as the owner of a small and medium enterprise, SME, and as a customer of certain financial institutions.  Mr. Reilly is an experienced company director with a background in printing and logistics, including the not-for-profit provision of social housing projects in north County Dublin in the 1970s.  Mr. Reilly co-founded Right2Homes in 2016 to provide a fundraising and advocacy platform for a constitutional challenge to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, the so-called eviction Bill, which retrospectively gives banks the weaponry they need to seek repossession of family homes via summary proceedings in the courts.<br/><br/>Friends of Banking Ireland was established in July 2006 to highlight the abject failures in the Irish banking system and the corresponding failure of regulatory oversight.  This has already been covered in detail by the banking inquiry and we do not propose to examine the same area covered by that inquiry.<br/><br/>This is the third time Friends of Banking Ireland have come before an Oireachtas committee.  As a result of the initial campaigning work, Friends of Banking Ireland presented to the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 13 May 2008.  We returned on 16 September 2009 at which we discussed the meltdown in the financial services sector.  Issues covered centred on the light touch approach by the Financial Regulator and supervisory agencies here in Ireland.  In the past year, I began to see the exact same patterns emerge in the European and international financial system, as existed prior to the global financial and property market collapse to which I will return.  In the period since 2006, Friends of Banking Ireland have worked with a huge number of Oireachtas Members on cases that they felt they could not process through the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to the devastating impact of reckless lending and the failure to regulate,<b></b>in the summer of 2006, I was the first person in Ireland to publicly and explicitly call for the resignation of the former Financial Regulator, Mr. Patrick Neary.  I referred to him as &quot;the dog that didn&rsquo;t bark&quot;.  There was nothing personal in that comment.  I made it on the basis of his abject failure to question or query the criminally reckless activities of some of the financial institutions his office was meant to regulate.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to family home and family<b></b>farm evictions, over the weekend, the Free Legal Advice Centre, FLAC, warned that 2017 may be the year of housing repossessions unless dramatic action is taken to assist mortgage borrowers who are in distress.  When added to the scale of the repossessions planned for family farms and small businesses, we are not in a position to &quot;Keep the Recovery Going&quot;; instead, we are facing a humanitarian crisis.  With others, I was active in challenging auctions of family homes and farms where there were disputes ongoing with financial institutions.  Today, I am pleased to say that a code of conduct now exists to ensure that no home or farm will go for auction if there is a dispute ongoing.<br/><br/>What has happened since 2006 is like something from a horror movie.  In 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, in documents that can now be viewed online, proposals were put by the late Brian Lenihan, then Minister for Finance, to have a 30% to 50% haircut on mortgage debt.  This was to be in parallel with the bank bailout.  That did not happen, and I have those documents with me today.  Officials got in its way, and it was not even countenanced.<br/><br/>Fast forward almost ten years and we now know that the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, was thrilled to welcome in the vulture funds, as outlined in the excellent RTE documentary, &quot;The Great Irish Sell Off&quot;.  Those vulture funds have picked up over &euro;200 billion worth of loans, secured against underlying assets at 5% to 20% of the market price.  Again, the State is losing out.  As the assets are not for sale - only the loans - there is no stamp duty and no gain for the Irish State.  The whole set-up is a scam.<br/><br/>In terms of what follows next, the vulture funds call in the loans seeking to take charge of the asset which has been used as security.  They then send in the security men who smash doors and change locks, usually under the cover of darkness.  Meanwhile, SME type builders who want to get back to work are being crippled with funding costs of up to 15% and more.  We wonder why very few homes are being built.  The banks are laughing at us because politicians are slapping them on the wrist for ripping off people with tracker mortgages when the bigger financial scandals are being glossed over.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to the potential conflict of interest for the Judiciary,<b></b>any citizen is able to visit the Oireachtas website and read the register of interests of Members of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001.  That also applies to elected councillors and MEPs.  The Irish Judiciary make decisions every day about NAMA, banks, receiverships and liquidations, home repossessions and evictions, yet the view from the Four Courts is that citizens have no right to know if a judge has a potential commercial or personal conflict of interest.  Questions have arisen with regard to such conflicts.  I believe the scale of the repossession orders and judgments that are currently favourable to the larger banks and financial institutions is a matter that will be the subject of a public inquiry in the coming years.  It is in the interest of the Judiciary also to ensure that, just like politicians, they have a transparent and ethical public declaration of their interests.<br/><br/><b></b>Traditional banking in Ireland is dead.<b></b>The current model of banking is broken, and not just in Ireland.  If it were not for private equity, venture capital, peer to peer lending and the credit unions, day to day commerce for hundreds of thousands of small businesses would have effectively ceased.  We know the committee has had engagement with Mr. Gerry Mallon, the CEO of Ulster Bank Ireland, Mr. Bernard Byrne, the CEO of Allied Irish Banks, Mr. Jeremy Masding, the CEO of permanent tsb, and Mr. Richie Boucher, the CEO of Bank of Ireland.  The members have also heard presentations from Professor Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  Their respective presentations were really nothing more than a polite box ticking exercise to say that they had engaged with the Oireachtas.  It was not a meaningful engagement.<br/><br/>The Governor of the Central Bank was at pains to tell this committee before Christmas that it did not need to be concerned.  He stated: &quot;...the banks are more resilient and the supervisory regime much more robust compared with the pre-2008 period.  Nonetheless, the Central Bank needs to maintain its vigilance.&quot;  He went on to state: &quot;Compared with the pre-crisis situation, the domestic banking sector is now slimmed down.&quot;  If there was ever an award for understatement of the year, he should get it.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to being unaccountable and unelected, in<b></b>April 2013, President Michael D. Higgins addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  He stated: &quot;...European citizens are suffering the consequences of actions and opinions of bodies such as rating agencies, which, unlike parliaments, are unaccountable.&quot;  If we substitute the words &quot;rating agencies&quot; from that quote and insert &quot;financial institutions and central banks&quot;, it would now read: &quot;European citizens are suffering the consequences of actions and opinions of bodies such as financial institutions and central banks, which, unlike Parliaments, are accountable.&quot;<br/><br/>Every member of this committee has been elected through elections to D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and I know they are very conscious of how accountable they are to their electorate.  It is always a political or publicity stunt to take a cheap shot at our elected parliamentarians, and there are enough people who never miss an opportunity to kick our elected politicians, rather than engage with them to try to influence change.  To lay the blame at politicians only lets those unelected and unaccountable organisations off the hook.  There is, however, a deep malaise in the way these institutions operate and it appears to us, as an advocacy group, that those whom we pay to regulate them do not aggressively pursue these financial institutions properly.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to the absence of regulation at Central Bank and European Central Bank level,<b></b>I have circulated a copy of a very detailed letter sent to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, last year, a copy of which was sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.</p><p>It related to legal proceedings initiated in the High Court in Dublin to ensure the European Central Bank and national central bank governors actually regulate the risky lending associated with the oil industry.  In the letter, I wrote: </p><blockquote>Replace the words property market with the word oil and we are watching an exact replica of the global financial crisis that collapsed banks, bankrupted countries, destroyed families and in many cases, ended lives.<br /><br />What is happening is an exact replica of the Subprime debacle that started in the United States and eventually engulfed the European banking system.  In order to keep lending off their balance sheets, US institutions relied extensively on a lending process called the &lsquo;originate-to-distribute model&rsquo;, which fueled the subprime mortgage crisis.</blockquote><p>The interaction by the committee with the Governor of the Central Bank before Christmas was almost like a slapstick comedy.  Members, including the Chairman, effectively forced the Governor and his officials to admit to the scale of the scandal of the tracker mortgages issue.  It was clear from responses to questions as to whether anything had been learned in the past decade that the regulators and those we pay to supervise financial institutions are still unwilling and perhaps unable to sanction and regulate the banking and financial services sector.  We are staring into a humanitarian crisis involving repossessions and homelessness caused by the abuse of policy.<br/><br/>I wanted to address many issues but I had to keep my statement short.  Friends of Banking Ireland has had a high profile since it was established 11 years ago.  I will be pleased to answer questions on any issue. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jackie Lavin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017012600002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the joint committee this morning.  I am appearing today on a personal basis representing Glencullen Holdings, which was our company, and on a group basis representing the Ulster Bank GRG Irish Business Action Group.  The action group was set up because more than 2,140 Irish businesses have experiences of abuse, breach of contract and unfair treatment at the hands of Ulster Bank's Global Restructuring Group or Ulster Bank GRG.  This has resulted in a tsunami of receivers being appointed, businesses closing and lives and families being ruined.</p> <p>  We believe Ulster Bank and its Global Restructuring Group deliberately targeted and shut down viable businesses in a property grab strategy.  These businesses are representative of a wide range of sectors, including industry, retail, property, farming, automotive, warehousing and distribution.  We represent 60 such businesses and the numbers are increasing daily.  When their individual stories unfold, it becomes obvious that there is a commonality of experience.</p> <p>  From 2008 onwards, all businesses experienced cashflow problems as business in general took a dive during the financial crash.  Royal Bank of Scotland, the parent group of Ulster Bank, reported a loss of &pound;24 billion and its share price fell by 66%.  The bank targeted UK and Irish businesses with loans of between &euro;1 million and &euro;25 million.  These businesses were removed from Ulster Bank&rsquo;s normal relationship managers and placed in its Global Restructuring Group, which is headed up by two special agents of the bank.  The reasons given by the bank had a common theme.  These special agents or managers were to restructure the debt of each company, guide it through the recession with cost saving strategies, and achieve better productivity, reduced interest rates and so forth.  The GRG was sold to the business owners under the guise of the bank taking a special interest in their company in a friendly and caring partnership arrangement.  Businesses did not suspect that GRG was a purpose vehicle designed to take down the company, as has been borne out in disclosures in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  RBS, Ulster Bank and the Global Restructuring Group engaged in a grab for cash strategy.  I refer to the whistleblower account on Buzzfeed and the "Newsnight" programme on BBC2.  They first targeted companies which had a positive loan-to-value ratio.  These companies were essentially easy targets.  I will give members a brief snapshot of one of the businesses in question, how it was dealt with and how Ulster Bank and the GRG engineered a default.  I refer to our company, Glencullen Holdings limited, which had been a customer of Ulster Bank since 1990 and had never defaulted on a loan.  The company was experiencing cashflow difficulties in 2009.  In 2010, the bank demanded further securities and pulled in all properties in the group.  This gave it an overall cover of properties worth &euro;65 million for a debt of &euro;10.5 million and an overdraft of &euro;1.5 million.  In October 2011, the company was put into Ulster Bank's Global Restructuring Group, which immediately started to squeeze the cashflow.  It restricted trade, put a shadow director in charge and basically monitored every move, every car that was bought and sold, parts, service and so on.  Every cheque payment had to be sanctioned by the shadow director.  The bank grabbed all cash that was brought in through the company, including the personal pension of the 100% shareholder and chairman, who had already invested &euro;20 million of his own money in the company.  Despite this, the GRG wanted more.</p> <p>  Just six months later, in April 2012, Ulster Bank reduced the overdraft facility for the company from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;800,000.  This lack of cash put our franchise terms and conditions contract under pressure and resulted in the company having to pay cash at the gate, so to speak, for all vehicles and parts.  At that time, we were turning over &euro;200 million and employed 200 people directly.  It was not possible to keep the business going without credit.  An internal Ulster Bank Global Restructuring Group document revealed by Buzzfeed and "Newsnight" stated the following: "If the company has not defaulted.  We can engineer one."  That is how Ulster Bank's GRG engineered our default. </p> <p>  In July 2012, with the lure of cash and at the insistence of the GRG, taking into account the understanding that the company could acquire other franchises, Glencullen decided to part company with its main franchise for a buy-out price.  GRG managers-agents went into a frenzy at the thought of cash.  They were on the telephone daily during the negotiations - I personally heard these conversations - insisting that the company take the cash.  A portion of the payment, namely, &euro;650,000, had been earmarked by the company financial controller for the Revenue Commissioners.  While the bank, which controlled the cheque book, agreed to this payment being made provided it received the balance, it was never made.  </p> <p>  In September 2012, we secured a stocking loan of &euro;1.5 million from another bank.  Ulster Bank refused to sign the standard letter as our main banker, even though it had insisted that we give up our main franchise to bring in cash.  Having done this, the bank refused to support any new franchises for us to continue in business.  Suddenly, our two GRG relationship managers were not available to sign the letter.  Our shadow director said he could not sign, having previously stated there would be no problem in doing so.  It became clear to us that Ulster Bank GRG was reneging on its promise.  In denying us the franchises, it prevented us from continuing in business.  </p> <p>  In October 2012, we were struggling on as we tried to hold on to the business.  The GRG managers were on the telephone daily telling us we were insolvent and that we had to call in the receivers.  At this time, our property values outweighed our loans by a ratio of at least three to one, even after they had been reduced from the figure of &euro;65 million.  We now know that it was a requirement that we call in the receiver because the bank had a difficulty pulling the plug on a company that had not defaulted.  It refused to pay Revenue in an attempt to force Revenue to appoint a receiver instead.</p> <p>  Eleven months after GRG took over Glencullen, the receiver was called in and everything was taken, including all our documentation and the back-up receiver.  This left us with nothing with which to fight back.  In the intervening four years, it has stonewalled us and refused to give us any documentation on loans, a payment schedule or bank accounts in spite of numerous requests.  This systematic abuse of customers is mirrored across all the other businesses we spoke to across the country.</p> <p>  Motor industry sales have increased by 66% since 2012.  This proves that a company such as ours, which had secured good franchises, would not only have been well able to survive, but would have thrived in the improving economy of the past four years.  Having sold five of the prime properties for &euro;8.1 million, Ulster Bank's GRG had its money back as it had written the debt down to &euro;8 million.  We were advised of this by the GRG manager.  The remainder of the properties have been left derelict with no maintenance or security.  They have been broken into and some have been set fire to, with the remainder sold off to vulture funds.</p> <p>  We also believe there were preferred client deals on our properties.  We know Ulster Bank's Global Restructuring Group gave a pre-pack deal and right of first refusal arrangement, along with a &euro;12 million loan, to a preferred client to expand his business.  This proved that Ulster Bank had an appetite for the motor business at the time, despite informing us that it had no appetite for the motor business.</p><p>That particular prime property lay empty for three years and was denied to us and to other investors who approached about purchasing it.  Other prime dealerships, such as at Liffey Valley, were taken over by other preferred clients and our customer database was used to write to customers, telling them that they would be opening and looking after their needs.  This was within weeks of receivership.</p><p> There is a personal loss to all of this, as there is to all of the stories that the committee will hear today.  Mr. Aidan Cullen, the managing director of Airside dealership and the younger brother of our chairman, died from a stress-induced heart attack ten days after the receiver took over.</p><p> Collectively and conservatively, these 2,141 businesses put into GRG employed over 20,000 people, which is the equivalent of several large multinationals.  Their tax contribution to the Exchequer was in excess of &euro;250 million per annum, not taking into account corporate tax.  Taking the average salary of &euro;35,000, this equates to over &euro;1.25 billion over the past five years.</p><p> The knock-on effect to the economy was and still is immeasurable.  The personal debt remains with these people as Ulster Bank sold the loans on to vulture funds for a pittance.  That injustice continues as they have taken the bank&rsquo;s place in pursuing the owners for 100% of the loan.  Ulster Bank lied to the joint Oireachtas committee during their submission in December 2016.  I was present at the time in the Gallery when its representatives said they had not received any complaints.  They received many complaints from customers, our members included.  They also committed to writing to all customers.  No letters have been received to date.</p><p> There is a UK precedent.  I refer to the Berg banking report and Ms Alison Loveday is with me today.  She compiled that report and is available to answer questions later if the committee so wishes.  On 8 November 2016, RBS announced that despite its previous denials, it now accepted that it had failed some GRG business customers and would, as a result, be implementing a new complaints review process and an automatic refund of complex fees charged to GRG customers between 2008 and 2013.  Following investigations into the conduct of RBS, Mr. Andrew Tyrie, MP, chairman of the UK parliamentary treasury select committee labelled findings "shocking", and demanded that the firms affected be paid compensation.  He said that many businesses "who deserved better" have been at the wrong end of RBS conduct.  Dr. Lawrence Tomlinson has also commented that the perverse incentives described in the Tomlinson report did exist within GRG.  He went on to comment that there were many questions for the banks and the regulator to answer.  Mr. John Mann, MP, has asked the Serious Fraud Office to open an "urgent investigation" into RBS.</p><p> RBS files expose the bank&rsquo;s secret scheme to boost revenues during the financial crisis by draining businesses of cash and stripping their assets.  Key findings show that, under pressure from the Government, the largely taxpayer-owned bank ran down businesses in its restructuring unit as part of a deliberate, pre-meditated strategy to cut lending and bolster profits.  RBS GRG managers encouraged employees to hunt for ways to boost their bonuses by forcing customers into loan restructuring in order to extract heavy fees as part of the profit drive nicknamed "Project dash for cash".  Firms that had never missed a loan payment were pushed into GRG under the bank&rsquo;s secret policies for reasons that had nothing to do with financial distress.  This helped the restructuring unit to a profit of more than &pound;1 billion in a single year.  The property division, which amassed assets worth &pound;3.3 billion during the crisis, was passed confidential information that was not available to other bidders when it wanted to acquire properties from businesses in GRG.</p><p> A vast proportion of RBS&rsquo;s business loans were secured against real estate and most agreements contained a loan-to-value covenant stipulating that the customers borrowing must not exceed 70% to 80% of the value of the assets.  The dire economic outlook made it easy to argue that a fall in the value of properties put customers in breach of their loan-to-value covenants.  That meant that the bank was able to break the deal.  The problem for the bank&rsquo;s customers was that property valuations are, as its executives later admitted in their evidence to parliament, "an art as well as a science".  RBS often evaluated properties in a way that dispensed with any independent checks and balances.  RBS managers needed only to perform an internal "desktop valuation", effectively just estimating how much a property would be worth.  RBS auditors raised concerns that the "valuation of properties might be manipulated as valuation is performed internally".  Managers also tended to assess the value of customers' property on the basis of how much it would sell in a fire sale rather than in an ordinary sale.</p><p> It can thus be seen from the various UK Government and media investigations and a review of the bank&rsquo;s own internal documents that a deliberate process was adopted by the bank to improve its own position at the cost of the bank's customers.  There is a solution.  In order to achieve fair play and justice against Ulster Bank GRG, we need to level the playing field in the costs of attaining justice.  In accordance with the Irish Constitution and EU law, every citizen is entitled to access to justice.  For many SMEs, the timelines and costs associated with court proceedings are impossible.  The Judiciary needs to deal with cases justly and at an appropriate cost, which includes ensuring the parties are on an equal footing and properly considering the financial position of each party.  Affected SMEs in Ireland that were closed down by the actions of the GRG should receive free legal aid or be funded by Ulster Bank.  After all, the banks costs are being paid from the customer&rsquo;s estate and are being added up against the customer&rsquo;s debt.</p><p> Disclosure is a clear part of the litigation process whereby clear and concise documents relevant to enabling the court to determine issues within a case are provided to save time and costs.  Agreeing from the outset what documents the bank is obliged to provide would avoid a situation whereby claimants would be forced to guess at what documents are available or forced to argue their case without the benefit of the documents.  A relaxing of the disclosure rules to allow claimants to share documents would sort this.  There could be a standard set of documents relevant to GRG claims or Libor actions.  This would avoid the need for each individual claimant to incur costs in seeking disclosure of the same.  For example, each bank could decide which cases to settle, subject to confidentiality, what disclosures to provide in each case and prevent employees from speaking out or whistleblowing by again making their severance terms subject to confidentiality and so on.</p><p> A standard methodology could be agreed for calculating loss.  The refund of complex fees as offered in the UK is totally inadequate and is no match for the losses endured by GRG customers.  The Central Bank and the Financial Regulator should take an active role in forcing Ulster Bank to compensate customers who have suffered at the hands of GRG and rescind their banking licence pending an independent inquiry and a proper compensation package being put in place.  They should reject out of hand the so-called "complaints" system put in place by Ulster Bank, whereby one has to write into the bank to have their complaint evaluated the bank itself.  In that system, the abused customer is expected to once again enter the lion&rsquo;s den to complain about the lion.  The statement of claim from the Ulster Bank GRG action group is estimated to be in the region of &euro;500 million to date and will rise accordingly as more companies join the group.</p><p> The Central Bank code of conduct rules state that all financial institutions must act in the interest of the customer and in good faith.  Clearly, the opposite is the case in this instance.</p></speech>

We clearly support and promote the introduction of a comprehensive public banking network in this country based primarily on the credit unions, but most of all, on a system that puts credit back into the hands of the general public.  That is almost the <i>sine qua non</i>of the PBFI.  For the purposes of clarity, the Public Banking Forum of Ireland wants to put it on the record that the creation or facilitation of credit, of what we all call money and use as money, has effectively been in the controlling hands of private entities since the Central Bank Act 1942.</p><p>That process has consolidated down into the hands of three or four chief bank executives in the current system.  No matter who they are, that is the system.  As the late US President John F. Kennedy supposedly said, "An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it".  The impact of the above decision has been accounted for here by those on my left and right, but, in fact, the committee has only heard the tip of the iceberg.  The golden rule is that he who makes the gold calls the shots.  He who creates the credit calls the shots.</p><p> A comprehensive public banking system, owned in perpetuity by the Irish people, which can be neither bought nor sold and is backed by the natural assets of the State, can correct that mistake.  While it is far from my function or my authority, or that of the PBFI, to dictate policy, we believe that we have provided, in the linkages here and other information that we have available, the material to back up what we have to say.  We believe that if it cannot be refuted, then it should be implemented.</p><p> Money, which is better referred to as credit, is the life blood of the economy.  Banks control its creation, the purpose for which it is loaned and who gets it.  Banks create the money supply when they make loans and in this process, they are facilitating credit creation by each man woman or person.  It is this credit, released by the banks, which we use as money.  Approximately, 3% of the money supply is in cash, as notes or coins.</p><p> Banks control where the credit is loaned.  For the most part, they decide who is facilitated with credit and for what purpose, and that purpose can be either for the productive economy or for asset speculation.  We need seriously to discuss, debate and decide what constitutes the productive economy.  Credit facilitation by the commercial banks for asset speculation leads to property price escalation, boom-bust cycles and, eventually, wealth transfer.  UK figures for credit creation for the decade up to the crash of 2008 show that only 8% went to businesses outside the financial sector.</p><p> The current banking system in Ireland can be referred to as three or four commercial banks, with Bank of Ireland, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank controlling 95% of lending to small businesses.  Irish companies pay some of the highest rates of interest in Europe.  In effect, credit control is in the hands of three or four individuals.  According to the ISME Bank Watch Survey Q3 2016, access to finance is still a problem in the bracket up to &euro;0.5 million.  Above that, there is a certain facility available.  We would suggest that should be done differently as opposed to funds being administered from the ISIF and the SBCI.  Nonetheless, there is a big gap in the market between what the credit unions have been providing and what needs to be provided in that small sector.  SMEs require volumes of credit.  It needs to be professionally administered, properly focused, and fully supervised in a system which is ethical for all concerned, and not based on collateral collection.  As the committee has just heard, this does not exist today.</p><p> The banking situation in Ireland has deteriorated since the crash.  While the banks at that stage were deemed to be systemically too important and they had to be bailed out, the system now has contracted down to effectively four.  We would suggest that the "&rsquo;too-big-to-fail"&rsquo; gun is already to our heads again and I would ask the following questions.  Is CBOI regulation fixated on the small people rather than the IFSC?  Who actually owns the &euro;150 billion in assets, debts or loans - call them whatever one likes - held in SPVs, and who owns the &euro;430 billion held in FVCs?  Who can explain the CIA's figure of approximately &euro;1.7 trillion in total Irish debts?  Do savers and depositors understand EU 2012 bail-in legislation?  Do they understand the European Banking Authority, EBA, findings that our banks are among the riskiest in the EU?  Furthermore, who owns Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, a tool by which complete control is exercised over our cash machines and all the payments within the State?  I suggest that until that matter is totally analysed and dealt with, we will make little progress.</p><p> Credit unions are being driven out of existence in the interests of the commercial banking industry.  We have known this for quite a while because the same pressure is being exercised from the ECB on the German Sparkassen model and on the co-operative models.  Our most recent contribution to it is that they will be lucky to end up with 600 independent units whereas up to now they have operated 1,430 publicly-owned banks in Germany.  The pressure on the credit unions is not unique.</p><p> Failed economic theories will not work.  They will not solve Ireland's problems.  Proven economic principles must be applied.  New thinking is required to arrest the slide into total urbanisation of the Irish people, and total dependence on foreign direct investment, FDI.  The concept of growth needs to be at least debated and defined.  By and large, growth equals growth in debt - that is how it is defined.</p><p> A serious restriction on credit facilitation has to be brought to bear.  Credit for speculative purposes must be seriously restricted in support of SMEs, the productive economy and communities.  At least ten regional community banks across the country are essential, and utterly affordable over five years at a cost of less than &euro;150 million. That is less than &euro;40 per head of population, which would hardly break the unborn.</p><p> We believe that the German Sparkassen model best suits Ireland.  That model can be modified to suit Ireland and expertise from the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation, SBFIC, can be sought.  It is a model proven over 200 years.  The post offices could also pursue the highly successful New Zealand Kiwi post office bank model as established in 2002, now with over 800,000 customers and, I understand, having cleared &euro;80 million in profit last year.  If that is the case, it must have cleared the bones of &euro;500 million since it was set up on 2002.</p><p> If Ireland were to adopt the German model of community banking, we would need 45 to 50 community or publicly-owned banks of some shape, make or form.  Ireland has a perfect framework from which to build, in the public interest, a comprehensive public banking network.  We have the credit unions and the An Post network which are a perfect platform.  We suggest that the expertise of the SBFIC expertise be employed to design the model for us.  Some years ago it made us the offer to do so at cost.</p><p>Community banks serve a range of purposes.  They put credit into communities and they break up the monopoly.  When they are properly focused, such as the German Sparkassen, they fund and support the small SME sector, which provides 70% of jobs.  They reduce the control of and dependence on the "too-big-to-fail" banks.  Regions are supported as is the indigenous potential of the state.</p><p> The safety of deposits becomes a real issue because, whether people know it, banks do not take deposits; they borrow money from people who think they are making deposits.  The nature of a private company is to make a profit.  Private banks pursue profit and that is all they will do.  We have seen plenty of this.  Private entities should not be allowed to hold a gun to the heads of the people and the Government over the provision of credit and capital.  Private entities cannot be allowed to decide whether to house our homeless, treat the sick or deliver quality of life to Irish citizens tomorrow or ever.</p><p> Every project requires three items, which are the will, the skills and the capital.  We have the will and we have the skill, but the capital is in the hands of a tiny number of people.  Community banks would change this.  The question of market share needs to be raised and I will return to this point when answering questions.</p><p> A comprehensive public banking system owned in perpetuity by the Irish people is a change that would put a stop to the monopoly.  If we were to look at the German model, which I hope we will discuss, we can clearly see it has a very different policy.  A total of 89% of businesses in Germany have a turnover of less than &euro;1 million.  We have many dairy farmers and shopkeepers turning over this amount.  Only 1% of businesses have a turnover of more than &euro;50 million.  Co-operative banks, and the Sparkassen banks in particular, are the backbone of the German economy.  I have statistics if committee members want me to read them out.  A total of 3.7 million small and medium enterprises form the backbone of the German economy.  They represent 99.95% of all companies.  They employ 29.1 million people, or 68% of the working population in Germany.  They provide training for 1.2 million young people, which is 89% of all trainees.  Micro-enterprises with fewer than ten employees provide 34% of workplaces in Germany.</p><p> Our dedication in this country is to foreign direct investment and bigger is better, and these are absolutely flawed concepts and must be corrected.  Community banks are part of the process of re-empowering communities and taking back from the vested interests the control they have over every man, woman and child.  A commercial banking industry which is 98% self-serving and bleeds 40% of the economy full time needs to be changed.  If the committee wants me to translate this in a simple way, at present our property prices are three times what the average individual can afford.  This arises primarily out of a lack of credit control.</p></speech>

I will begin with Ms Lavin, who made a very strong opening statement.  It was powerful stuff on her experience with Ulster Bank.  She made very strong allegations about engineering a default and manipulation.  She alleged it lied when it came before the committee in December.  In her opinion, where should all of this go now?  We are observing what is going on in the UK.  Here, the Central Bank does not have any ongoing investigation into Ulster Bank and the treatment of the 2,141 SME customers who ended up in its Global Restructuring Group, GRG, of which fewer than 100 came out intact.  Is it the case that all of this will have to be worked through the courts with civil proceedings by all the borrowers?  In Ms Lavin's view, should there be a comprehensive Central Bank-led investigation using its statutory powers into this very issue?</p></speech>

They have put up their hands in the UK and admitted wrongdoing.  The Central Bank has to lead an independent investigation.  The complaints mechanism which Ulster Bank speaks about putting in place is totally inadequate.  It has already led two of these, here and in the UK, whereby it paid a so-called independent entity to find it completely not guilty, which was a whitewash as we all know now because of the revelations which have since come to light.  It is essential that the Central Bank takes the leading role and establishes a proper independent investigation so proper compensation can be set aside for these companies which have suffered because it is quite clear now it was a deliberate bringing down of perfectly viable companies that would have survived through the recession.  We hear this every single day through the organisation we have established.</p></speech>

It is most unlikely that 2,140 people would be put into GRG and only six would come out.  I know because of questioning by Deputy Doherty when Ulster Bank came before the committee that it admitted it could have been up to 100 people.  Up to 100 could be one or 99.  I believe it is six, and I know one of the people who came through it.  The reason he feels he came through it was because his properties were not prime and ready for sale.  They were half built, three quarters built or in bits and pieces.  They were not prime properties.  Those taken first were prime properties ready to go and be sold in a fire sale.  It was widespread because it is not possible that out of 2,140 only six would survive.  It is not possible.</p></speech>

We have heard strong testimony on Ulster Bank.  The question must be put whether the same practices were prevalent in other banks.  They also had sections for problem loans and customers ended up in the sections and many of them did not come out.  If there is to be an investigation into Ulster Bank, are the characteristics and traits similar in other banks in the view of Mr. Beades?</p></speech>

I attended some of the meetings in the North of Ireland when Mr. Tomlinson came over from the UK, which were also attended by Ms Lavin, when this opened up.  As a result of attending the meetings, I discovered I was a victim of GRG.  As Deputy McGrath knows, I have been on ACC's case and on the case of a number of other banks and I did not need another front opening up.</p><p>However, we in Friends of Banking Ireland had been following Ulster Bank and I have spoken publicly on it.  Ulster Bank was also operating 27 legal entities, including Ulster Bank Ltd. and Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd.  The 27 legal entities, between business names and companies in Northern Ireland, the UK and Ireland, were operating in the Republic.  When they were taking people to court, and this is a similar issue in respect of Bank of Ireland and Bank of Ireland Private Banking, one discovered that the wrong bank was taking the person to court, yet the court ignored it.  The attitude was "So what, you owe them money", which has been happening in the courts.  That is why I mentioned the Judiciary issue.</p><p> We had been lobbying before this current round.  The then chief executive of Ulster Bank appeared in the House of Commons four years ago and we contacted Sammy Wilson MP and got him to ask questions of the chief executive on a raft of issues.  Ulster Bank is rotten to the core.  It was involved in changing the indexes on its Irish subsidiaries from 2006 on, which resulted in changing contract terms, writing to people and giving them options.  If one did not take the option, it changed one's contracts.  All of these letters have gone missing.  They are not on people's files and one cannot get them under data protection.  It is a complete and utter mess.  While we are discussing Ulster Bank here, this is replicated across almost every bank, unregulated by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

This is an issue I have pursued by parliamentary questions.  Receivers can be appointed under company law or land and conveyancing law.  It appears that the framework around the appointment and conduct of receivers is weak.  Instances have been brought to my attention where assets were mismanaged, receiverships were kept going seemingly in perpetuity and presumably with direct benefit by way of fees, ultimate decisions made were not commercially sound and the borrower was completely in the dark and locked out of the entire process.  What is Mr. Beades's view on the role of receivers and what can be done to make them more transparent and accountable?  What rights should the borrowers whose assets have been put into receivership have as part of that process?</p></speech>

It is unregulated, unaccountable theft across the board.  If one looks at other jurisdictions, New Zealand and Australia have introduced legislation in this regard.  When I was preparing for this meeting yesterday I came across a KPMG report which reiterated almost everything the Deputy said in the parliamentary debates in Australia and New Zealand.  Those countries have introduced regulation because they had this carry-on seven to ten years ago.</p> <p>  The receivership area is mostly unknown to people.  I happen to be very lucky in so far as I have a personal friend for 30 years who is a receiver, so I was able to gain expert knowledge.  He would be a low profile receiver but he has carried out over 700 receiverships in 30 years.  What has taken place is astonishing.  It is an area even the legal profession does not understand.  If it is a company, it is recorded in the Companies Registration Office, but we refer to the private receiverships.</p> <p>  Parliamentary questions have been tabled on this issue.  Deputy Pearse Doherty might have asked some in the past, as we communicated with him on these issues.  The Central Bank has replied that it does not keep statistics.  These are the private receiverships.  What happens, effectively, is that they are appointed on the mortgage document.  When people sign a mortgage document, they sign away their rights and give the bank the power to appoint a receiver if anything goes wrong.  The document varies from bank to bank and from receiver to receiver.  It is unregulated.</p></speech>

At present, credit unions are sitting on billions of euro that they cannot lend because of lending restrictions and long-term lending restrictions.  Many credit unions have a monthly cap on what they can lend and many have a maximum loan size.  Is there a need to re-invent the wheel?  Should we not put a public policy focus on developing the potential of credit unions, given that they are in practically every town and village in the country?  It is similar with post offices.  I am not sure what is Mr. &Oacute; Muilleaneoir's plan.  Is it to put capital in and then go to the markets to raise more money to lend ultimately to borrowers?  Why not just develop the credit unions and the post offices, which are not-for-profit and have a voluntary ethos in many respects as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.859" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Muilleaneoir" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017012600002#H00500"><p>I am delighted to get that question because it is something that must be clarified.  Within the next two weeks we will publish a paper on this issue and how we suggest it should be done.  The committee will receive a copy of that as part of this debate.  It is almost due to be printed but there are a few i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed.  It is ready.  It is a comprehensive and valuable document.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked fundamental questions and he can respond if I do not answer the exact question he asked.  Fundamental to this issue is the matter of credit and the role of credit unions.  Credit union, by definition, is something of an oxymoron.  Technically, credit unions lend money from their deposits, whereas banks facilitate credit creation which is a very different issue.  That critical element must be understood.  Take the example of the &euro;7.5 billion or &euro;8 billion in excess deposits that credit unions have.  If the credit unions were to deploy that into ten community banks and worked on the principle of the German Sparkassen, they could create a loan book of approximately &euro;40 billion almost overnight.  That would fund many things.  Likewise, there was money in the pension funds and &euro;7.9 billion of that was handed over to Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  I believe that was a very wrong use of those funds.  They could have been used on the basic principle of the German Sparkassen.  Between the credit unions and that fund of &euro;7 billion, a loan book of &euro;90 billion could have been created which could have solved a range of issues in debt write down and could have supported a range of new businesses.  That cannot happen overnight, as it must be allowed to develop, but the potential that exists is enormous.</p> <p>  Nobody can say that there is no room in this economy for credit.  There is plenty of room, and there is also the clout to create it.  That clout must be put back into the communities, because the credit unions are not allowed to use it.  What has been done with the ISIF funds is utterly wrong.  One of the suggestions made to us by the Germans is that we bracket the lending in the community banks.  They suggested that the credit unions would continue to lend in the bracket up to &euro;20,000, give or take a little, that the community banks would lend from that figure to perhaps &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 and that a further entity would be created to lend from that bracket to &euro;10 million.  Not many of the latter would be required.  However, the gap at the upper end is being filled at present by the ISIF funds and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  They are just institutions lending out real money, whereas credit could be used to manage all of that if we understood and managed the credit.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

To be honest, I and several other members of the newly formed group have been working on this for over four years, some people for longer.  We have not had the possibility of access to justice through the courts, first, because of costs and, second, because we felt that everything was stacked against us.  One went in as a lay litigant but, on the other side, senior counsel and everything was stacked against one.  It was not an even playing field.  In most cases, one was turfed out of the courts.</p> <p>  The means of reporting to the Financial Services Ombudsman are not available or accessible to most people.  I tried to engage with the office and they came back to me saying that it was only available to companies that had a turnover of up to &euro;3 million.  I asked what people who have a turnover well and truly in excess of that amount do, and they said: "Well, you have the courts, the High Court".  In other words, therefore, one has nothing.  There are no means of complaint for people with over that amount of money.</p></speech>

It probably shines a spotlight on the difficulty of accessing the courts by commercial individuals or those who have a turnover of more than that amount.</p> <p>  The whistleblower in Ulster Bank was a former executive of the bank operating here in Ireland.  He claims that the banks put a business into a special unit.  A business would be moved along to another section of the bank and overnight all the credit terms would be changed, which is similar to the story mentioned by Ms Lavin.  He says that eventually the business ran out of cash, the assets were seized and sold on, and all the money went to Ulster Bank's bottom line.  I have to stress that there was no default even likely in many cases and what went on was simply outrageous.  </p> <p>  Ms Lavin talked about the difficulty of accessing the courts.  On my proposal, the committee has written to the Central Bank asking it to investigate these areas.  It has informed us in correspondence that it is engaged with Ulster Bank, yet it is not willing to have an independent investigation.  Has Ms Lavin's organisation been able to reach out to the former executive of Ulster Bank?  Obviously, he or she was not named in this newspaper report.  The information that he or she may hold could be key to forcing the Central Bank to investigate - with the evidence of the Tomlinson report and the evidence presented by individuals - if it is not willing to carry out an investigation of its own volition.  The whistleblower may be the key to tipping it into acting in this regard.  </p></speech>

Over 250 people were engaged on behalf of Ulster Bank in the GRG and they were looking after 2,000 customers.  They were vociferous in their engagement with the companies in Ireland, much more so than they were in the UK.  They had over 12,000 companies to deal with in the UK and I feel that on a one-to-one basis they were more vociferous in Ireland than they were in the UK.</p></speech>

I will focus on the number.  When Ulster Bank representatives were before the committee, I asked Mr. Andrew Blair if the number was six and he said it was more than that.  I asked him if it was seven and he said: "It is more than six or seven."  He also gave a commitment to this committee as follows: "Subsequent to the meeting, I could certainly provide the Deputy with a number."  I then asked him if it was fewer than 100 and he said that was the case.  In fairness to Ulster Bank, subsequent to the meeting, it was supposed to give us the number, but it has told us that approximately 100 of these cases returned to the bank.  It has not given us the number, but an approximation so perhaps that is something we should follow up with the bank.  Ms Lavin is claiming that the number is as low as six.  Can she enlighten the committee on that?</p></speech>

In their report they said they received several hundred complaints, but they only interviewed five complainants.  I assume the reason they only interviewed five - we were one of the five - is because they wanted to keep it at that number.  There was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>by a well known journalist who alleged that only six came out.</p></speech>

Regardless of whether it is six or 96, the fact is that over 2,000 Irish companies, with tens of thousands of employees, had a huge tax bill.  Given what people from these businesses have said to me privately, they went bust as a result of being put on death row by Ulster Bank.</p> <p>  With the support of the committee we will, hopefully, continue to pursue this issue.  I believe that the Central Bank has to carry out this investigation.  It is not appropriate for businesses that have been thrown to the wolves to have to fight this through the courts.  Our regulators are there to do the job.  This committee was instrumental previously, as was mentioned by Mr. Beades, in dealing with the tracker mortgage scandal.  Our letter to the Central Bank, on foot of a request from the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation, led to the industry-wide investigation which we now know involved 15,000 victims.</p><p>Hopefully, the pressure from the committee results in some sort of clarity.  Ms Lavin mentioned that the Ulster Bank lied to us.  Can she explain exactly or, after the meeting, submit the transcript of what Ulster Bank stated and exactly why Ms Lavin believes it was not accurate?  I am not sure if it was-----</p></speech>

Maybe that was because there was no complaints mechanism, but the bank certainly received numerous complaints.  To say it got no complaints was, to say the least, a mistruth.</p></speech>

It is an issue that I know has been deeply frustrating for Mr. Beades's organisation and those it represents.  It is an area we have raised ourselves with Government officials previously.  Mr. Beades said it was very difficult to understand and that many members of the Judiciary do not understand it.  With the support of the Chair, if the Chair so wishes, I invite Mr. Beades to submit to the committee a short paper as to what he believes should happen in relation to regulation.  What are the areas we need to focus on in terms of receivers?  Sometimes, when we deal with issues of repossessions, we sometimes, as a people, focus on the top number, which is the number of houses that have been repossessed, and not on the way they are repossessed.  Mr. Beades presentation has shone a light on some of those issues.  Given the time constraints, it would be interesting for the committee to look at that area to see if we can move it on.  I invite Mr. Beades to speak on that.</p> <p>  I have long been an advocate of public banking.  At this committee many years ago, the former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Patrick Honohan, acknowledged that there was space for a Sparkassen model and that was something to be welcomed.  What engagement has there been with the Central Bank or the Department of Finance to move this forward given that there is somewhat of a commitment in the programme for Government and that the former Governor is on the record as saying a third tier of banking is possible or desirable in the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Beades" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017012600002#K00400"><p>We will submit a paper to the committee on the receivership issue because it is a no-man's land, which is probably the best way to describe it.  No one understands it.  As an organisation, we have been at the forefront of a lot of receivership disputes.  We have been involved in court cases where we have challenged receivers and have been successful in a number.  This goes right across the banking sector to include even what Ms Lavin is talking about and the Governor of the Central Bank.  When a private individual has to go to court, law is an evolving concept, based on precedent.  As such, the case that goes first sets the scene for how one's case will be dealt with.  In fact, in banking law it never evolves or develops because the banks have long pockets and fight one the whole way to the steps of the court.  When they are going to lose, as we have seen in a number of receivership cases, they settle on the morning of the trial.  They buy the case off.  As such, the law for the citizen never develops.  There is a famous case, namely, McPhillips, who was against a receiver and what went on in it was appalling in the cross-examination done by lay litigants.  This was early last year.  It got so embarrassing for the receivers involved that, with a couple of million owed, it has been settled for buttons.  Of course, there is a confidentiality clause.  In fairness, the judge was one of the few judges down in the Four Courts who allowed lay litigants to conduct cross-examination to get to the bottom of it.  Most of the Judiciary do not because they are compromised because of their own involvement with banks.</p> <p>  Citizens' law never develops.  We have a massive problem down the courts.  It is not just the Judiciary.  The courts system is not fit for purpose and neither is the Central Bank.  The oil case I referred to, which has run for three days in the courts, has not even got media coverage.  What has come out of it is that the Central Bank, the Governors and the ECB are totally immune from prosecution.  I have prosecuted 23 governors and 23 central banks.  It is back in court next week.  The outcome is that they are immune even though the Slovenian governor was arrested and the Slovenian bank has been raided for &euro;300 million fraud.  They are claiming they is immune and the Slovenian police are saying they are not.  It is a complete farce.  When one talks about the banking sector and the private banks the guys are talking about, we are all part of groups and we all interact.  I attend their meetings and I am familiar with it.  With the Central Bank and the ECB, it goes to the heart of Europe.  It goes to the heart even at the moment of Brexit.  Where is Europe taking us?  The whole banking sector is not fit for purpose in Europe, which is another day's battle.  I am going into another area which is probably not for this committee.  However, there are serious issues to be addressed for ordinary citizens.</p></speech>

Serious fundamental issues have to be addressed.  I will go back to Deputy Pearse Doherty and try to answer his question about our communications with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  In the case of the Central Bank, the PBFI has had no direct contact.  However, we know that a representative of the German SBFIC in Bonn met them about three years ago when that person came here to meet us.  They acknowledged that gap in the market in their discussions and it is part of a paper which is referenced in our submission.  I met Deputy Michael McGrath in his D&aacute;il office with two consultants from the German Sparkassen foundation.  Out of that came a 42-page paper, which is also available to the committee.  It was submitted in due course to all of the political parties, the Department of Finance and nearly everybody got a version of it in some form or other, even though it was a confidential document or had limited confidentiality about it.</p> <p>  That document is important but what is more important is that we engaged a little bit with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance in 2015 and were told the matter was under serious consideration and not to worry.  Having pressed the issue in terms of the follow-up from the Department, we got a reply from the Minister and from the Secretary General on 7 and 8 January last year.  Personally speaking, those two letters are an embarrassment and I would not even publish them.  I will say no more about them.  The fact that they could even be written is an extraordinary statement of either utter stupidity or absolute complicity in the structure of the problem.  I am not talking about the solution; I am talking about the problem.  That is the answer to the question.  We have no communications.  As a result of those two letters, we set about establishing the public banking alliance for the last general election to try to shove the issue into the public domain.  That has been very successful in forcing the issue onto the programme for Government and it has been very helpful in terms of some of the proposals being put forward with respect to post offices.  We have been prodding that issue about the Kiwi model.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

From my own experience, I can concur with almost everything that has been said here today.  The behaviour of the banks has caused devastation right across the banking system and the country, in particular in rural Ireland.</p><p>I am particularly interested in Ms Lavin's evidence put forward on the engineering defaults.  It absolutely reflects my experience, which is that the most responsible, viable businesses in rural areas have been shut down because of minor cash flow problems.  The system has been engineered such that those businesses have been affected.  The tragedy, as referred to, is that there are many people who would be alive today were it not for the way the banking system and individuals within the banks behaved right across the country.  They have behaved that way only because they have been allowed to do so.  That is the crux of the problem.  Jobs have been lost and there has been significant emigration.  All these factors combined caused the devastation.  I appreciate the attendance of the delegation.  We have had the bankers before us also.  We, as legislators, are here to determine how we can prevent what happened from happening again and how we can right some of these wrongs.</p><p> I completely agree with the delegates' analysis of the European banking system because it is a case of the emperor having no clothes.  At some point, somebody will have to say that all the quantitative easing and everything done in the background are sustaining a system that has not been fixed.  What is coming down the road to us is very unpleasant indeed.  Ulster Bank delegates who appeared before us referred to the number of repossessions and the loans in arrears for over 90 days.  The bank openly admitted the number of repossessions would increase this year.  This year will probably be more devastating than any of the previous years.</p><p> One of Mr. Beades' main points was that the regulators in this State are simply not doing their job.  Is this because of a lack of will or because of the lack of a legal basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.889" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Beades" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017012600002#L00200"><p>It is very hard to answer that question.  We are dealing with the matter every day of the week and note that there is a complete lack of reality.  We met Ms Sharon Donnery, now the Deputy Governor, ten years ago.  I am astonished she has reached Deputy Governor level because of where she was positioned in the earlier days at the time of Mr. Patrick Neary.  The whole Department she ran was not fit for purpose.  We could not engage.  One could tell the Department a story but one never got an answer back.  We found from the banking inquiry, etc., that it did nothing.  The same people are appearing again.  I was astonished to see Ms Donnery appear at some of the committee meetings here.  Nothing has changed from our perspective.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the statistics and the numbers.  What alarms me more is that the statistics being fed out here are so wrong.  In the context of where we have come from and the statistics we put together, we conclude 4,000 self-employed people basically vanished.  They were not allowed to sign on for welfare and some emigrated.  They are still out there and we still meet them.  They still come to our offices and they are down in the courts.  They are not entitled to anything but they are there.  I reckon, therefore, that the number of people in financial difficulty is closer to 500,000.  Some 2 million people pay tax and work in the State.  Some 25% of the population, or thereabouts, is affected directly.</p> <p>  Let me give some other statistics.  We have an office at the back of the Four Courts.  Much of what we do is low profile and we are not telling everybody we have fairly sophisticated organisations in different sections, or otherwise.  In a three-month period last year, 1,045 people walked in the door of our office and I got the staff to keep statistics on them.  Of those who came in, there was nobody under 29.  A 29 year old now was 19 ten years ago and was not borrowing money.  There is a whole generation of people up to the age of 30 something who do not have financial debt.  Some 200 of the people who came to our office, or 20%, were between 30 and 40.  They range from garda&iacute; to civil servants and others right across the spectrum.  All are in debt.  I called into the office one day and met a young woman with two children and a pram who owed &euro;7 million to a bank.  It is just astonishing what we see.</p></speech>

Eight hundred people, or 80%, were between 40 and 80.  An 80 year old would have been 70 ten years ago when doing his last deal and he is now facing eviction.  These numbers are not being discussed by any organisations, yet when one asks the Central Bank for the statistics we ask for through some of the Deputies, it says it does not keep statistics on SME debt or the number of SME loans.</p></speech>

In terms of what law needs to be changed, however, does one need to tear up the ECB?  This is all a matter of policy.  We do not own our Central Bank anymore; it is actually owned by the ECB.  This is what came out in the court case with the governors.  It is absolutely astonishing what we found out in that case.  How does one go about change?  The Irish Governor has no powers even to answer some of the questions the Senator is asking.  I am 11 years into this trip with Friends of Banking Ireland, as I describe it, but I am getting further away from getting answers to questions.  The model is so broken I just do not know where one would start.</p></speech>

The last thing we want is Central Bank power.  We have seen how it has operated in the past ten years, never mind before that.  I would object utterly to more power.  I had a disc for everybody in the audience but I left it in the car.  Mr. Richard Werner made a presentation here last April.  It is absolutely essential viewing for everybody over 15 years of age.  Mr. Werner explained the role of central banks.  I plead with members who have not watched the presentation to take an hour and 20 minutes to do so and then watch it again.  I have watched it several times.  Mr. Seamus Maye, my ally here, if given a few minutes, will give the committee a few ideas as to where the competition issues arise.  It is crystal clear that the Central Bank has no interest in anything other than squeezing the little people.  It has no interest whatsoever in regulating the banking industry.</p></speech>

What could be done by us to regulate them a little more?  I refer in particular to the regulation of the owner rather than the middleman.  Would this make a difference?</p></speech>

These are the people who own the loans and call the shots.  What seems to have happened is that the owners have appointed agencies to administer the loans.  The agencies are only pawns and have no say.  They inspect the properties and report back and then they are told to close them down and send in a security man, for example.  When we get into confrontation with them, they tell us they are not the owners of the loans.  Sharp regulation is needed.</p> <p>  An organisation that is following all the activities of the vulture funds circulated among the members of the committee various papers, including "Towards Justice Centred Debt Solutions: An overview of the debt crisis in Argentina with recommendations for Ireland".  The agency, called Debt and Development Coalition Ireland, is American and we stumbled on it by accident.  It has a document entitled "From Puerto Rico to the Dublin Docklands" and another on corporate tax secrecy and Apple, which is very interesting.</p><p>The organisation pointed out to us at a meeting how a vulture fund bought the debt of a mine in Africa.  The vulture fund just depopulated the whole village beside the mine and got away with doing so because it was in Africa.  As someone said to me in Mayo, the vulture funds intend to depopulate every rural village in the west of Ireland.  That is how serious the situation is.  This is a humanitarian crisis and is not just a housing crisis and evictions.  We need legislative reform.  The problem is so vast that it is difficult to know where to start.  </p></speech>

The banks did not cut deals because somebody had to make a decision.  Let us say a bank had a &euro;10 million loan and something worth &euro;100,000 so somebody had to sign off because the loan book had to be reduced by a value of &euro;10 million.  Nobody wanted to make such decisions in banks.  That is what the bank problem was.  What is happening with these guys now is that they are coming in and looking around.  Nobody can access credit so people try to cut deals, they cut a deal but owe a couple of million of euro and the vulture fund says, "Right, give us half a million".   Where is that person going to get half a million euro?  The next thing is a receiver is called in and the person or persons are put out of the house.</p> <p>  We need a model where people can access help.  If we had the public banking scenario then we would have had banking to lend to people to buy them out of debt but that was if it was left to an Irish situation.  Mr. John Moran was excited about bringing in vulture funds, which was scandalous.  When the history books are written on this matter, Oliver Cromwell and John Moran will be on a par because that is how serious the situation is.  </p></speech>

We are where we are and the vulture funds own huge tracts of properties.  Why can the Government not conduct a compulsory purchase of these properties?  It should be done at the price paid or at a 10% discount.  My goodness, it would be easy to give the vulture funds a 10% or 20% discount because they bought the properties for nothing in the first place.  Give them a little profit, let them get the hell out of here and then rent the properties back to the people or let the people who lost them in the first place repurchase the properties at the knockdown price, not at the 100% price that the vulture funds want to extract.  My solution may be simplistic but it is a solution because trying to rein in the vulture funds at this stage would be a waste of time.  Unfortunately, the damage has been done.  The Government should bring in legislation now that would impose a compulsory purchase order on all of these properties.  The vulture funds want to leave Ireland.  They do not want to be here as they have conducted their business.  They want a quick profit and out.  Let the Government facilitate the vulture funds by letting them leave and give the properties back to the people at the same price that it gave the properties to the vulture funds.  It should rent them or introduce a buy-to-let or lease scheme for the people who are homeless.  Can the Government note equate the homelessness problem with the vulture funds that have turfed people out of their homes?  Is there no joined up thinking to tackle the problem?</p></speech>

Legislation provides that vulture funds must have an agent operating in Ireland and it is the agent who deals with the holder of the loan.  I have spoken to customers of Ulster Bank, who were similarly in the GRG group.  Some of them have told me that they were directly dealt with by the vulture fund and not by the agent at all.  Has Friends of Banking Ireland experienced or has it knowledge of cases in which vulture funds that have not been regulated in Ireland have gone directly to the customer on issues?</p></speech>

We had prime sites all over the country, nothing was half built or half finished.  Our loan to value ratio had been reduced from seven times the value of the loan because the value of the properties had been written down to about three times the value of the loan.  We had a pragmatic view also in that the properties that were not producing the level of return we required were for sale at the time.  We were doing the right thing in terms of getting as much cash in as we possibly could to pay off the loans.  We were doing all of that.  There was no need whatsoever to transfer our loans.  It was not as if were not engaging with the bank.  We were engaging with the bank on a daily basis and they knew everything that was going on.  The bank encouraged us to take the buyout from our main franchise in order to get the cash.  The bank was in to grab the cash at all times, without any thought of the cost to the company.  As soon as the company divested itself of its main franchise and had others to come in instead, and that was the whole purpose of giving up the main franchise, the bank then shut down shop and did not allow the company to carry on business any more.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question on the impact of this on us as people, from 2012 it was shock tactics.  One minute one was in business and the next minute, one literally had nothing.  They took absolutely everything - mobile phones, computers and the pens from the desk.  They shut everything down.  </p> <p>  We never had an experience of a receivership and we were in shock.  We were naive and stupid.  If we knew then what we know now, it would never have happened.  That is another story.  </p></speech>

I am a great advocate of the credit unions.  The credit union is in every town and village.  Prior to the crisis, I was in practice, as I am a chartered accountant by training and if the credit union movement had not looked after the SME sector in the previous ten to 12 years, many small businesses would not have survived, particularly in small towns and villages in rural areas.  That must be acknowledged.  The small businesses would go to their credit union on a Monday morning and get a bank draft for &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 and lodge it to their current account because the bank would not provide the money.  How many of those are thriving businesses today?</p> <p>  What is the reason the credit union movement could not fill the void for the small SME sector?</p></speech>

They have &euro;8 billion or thereabouts in excess deposits that they cannot lend for a range of reasons.</p><p>In a property market, for example, one of the ways the credit unions want to develop is to get into the mortgage market.  I think they would be stone mad, given that houses and property prices are three times what the average salary can justify.  It is a black hole for the credit unions.</p><p> One of the things the German consultants hammered home to us was the need to bracket the banking business, and they suggested the credit unions stick with what they do, lend in their bracket of &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 or thereabouts without being too definitive about it.  They could create a new entity that could lend up to approximately &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 and another one above that again.  There is no comparison between the individual in the bank or credit union who is a risk adviser and has to determine whether somebody should get &euro;10,000 or &euro;5,000 and somebody who wants &euro;480,000.  In the next bracket there is a level of expertise, procedures and a range of issues at stake.</p><p> We absolutely believe in the credit union movement.  The paper we are about to publish will make it abundantly clear.  With the stroke of a pen the credit unions could structure the public banks in their own areas.  If six or ten credit unions in south Dublin got together, they could establish a new public bank overnight almost.  They have everything they require, such as the outlets, offices and funds.</p></speech>

The potential the credit unions have with their excess deposits is enormous.  However, for the credit unions to get into this bigger lending is fraught with danger.  While it is not my business to tell them what to do, our research suggests they could double their business.  We are talking about setting up the ten banks.  The credit unions could double their business, and they would still have only approximately 5% or 6% of the household market.  If the ten community banks we are talking about ended up with approximately 3% of the market each, they would reach only 36% of the market.  In the German system, 70% of the system is owned by the public.  There is a need for another layer of two or three national public banks to deliver in this bracket.</p></speech>

What advantage does Mr. &Oacute; Muilleaneoir see in setting up this type of bank?  A number of years ago, when some new banks were coming into the country, I spoke in the Seanad and said in Castlebar alone there were 14 or 15 outlets where one could get money.  Although people said it was good for competition. I did not take that view.  I could not see how a small town such as Castlebar could support 14 or 15 places where people could get money.  This is replicated throughout the country.  What is the advantage in this type of bank that is not already catered for by the three pillar banks and the credit unions?</p></speech>

Startups and small businesses want supervised credit.  A small businessperson does not want it lorried out to him or her because his or her father has a house or a farm.  They want credit supervised by people who know what they are talking about and who can give proper guidance and supervision.  This does not exist in any make, shape or form.  If people have the collateral, the banks will give them whatever they want, and it does not matter how good their business plans are.  That is the only interest they have in it.</p></speech>

How do SPFIC, Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the others organise?  The big sector is from approximately &euro;20,000 to &euro;500,000.  Make no mistake, the credit unions have saved Ireland.  They have saved the communities across the country.</p></speech>

The examinership process can be done in the Circuit Court, which is a cheaper forum.  Generally it is a company that goes for examinership.  It might be forced by a bank or by circumstances.  The company must prepare a business plan and get outside auditors to do a report.  The examinership area does not seem to be giving trouble.</p></speech>

We have a case of a bakery in Cork in which the bread runs were sold on and a big row is going on.  I agree, when the businesses are sold on there can be problems.  In general, it is not coming on the radar regularly.</p></speech>

One of the reasons for which Glencullen could not go to examinership was that we were told it would cost &euro;100,000.  On another property we went through examinership and I know exactly what the Senator is talking about.  One has to get a forensic accountant to do the business plan, one has to have an investor and one has to pay approximately &euro;12,000 for a junior and senior counsel to present it in the High Court.  When one's business has been taken, one does not have access to that kind of money.  Most companies do not, particularly if one has propped up one's company during the bad times, which we had done to the tune of &euro;20 million of our own money.  One has no money left to do examinership.  This has to do with access to justice.  There is no access to justice for people whose companies have been pulled.  They do not have the money to access justice.</p></speech>

The big problem with the High Court is that the fees are off the wall.  The legislation for the Circuit Court examinership is through and, as far as I know, they are up and running.  The examinerships we have seen have been pre-packaged examinerships in which some of the English chains have wanted to get out of leases in shopping centres.  Under legislation, companies that go through examinership can dump their landlords.  There have been a number of large examinerships with some of the large retail chains going through the process.  If it were available to the ordinary householders to dump their mortgages, as has been allowed for the examinerships, it would be great.  I have been in the High Court when one of these was going on.  I listened to a High Court judge ranting on and writing down leases of &euro;250,000 per year to &euro;50,000, and authorising them.  Two hours beforehand, the same judge was evicting companies and giving judgments.  It is two different worlds.</p><p>One can consider what is going on in Clerys and all the issues surrounding it.  Again, it is a world on its own outside the comprehension of the ordinary individual.  I had my first receivers appointed in 2010 by ACC Bank and I understand exactly what Ms Lavin is saying.  I was na&iuml;ve and I am wiser now.  It turns out the receiver of my property was wrongly appointed in the first place and he sold a property worth &euro;11 million for &euro;400,000.  I am now thinking of taking proceedings against him because I have discovered it was fraud.  One is wiser after the event than one would be the day those people walk into the office.</p></speech>

Every entity should have a banking licence and be registered.  One should be able to go to the Central Bank website and see that.  I could give an example involving AIB.  We found 27 entities and the joke among some of the groups was that when somebody came, they would ask from which bank they came.  Although they would say it was a branch, we could ask which legal entity of Ulster Bank was involved, as there were so many of them.  Somebody involved with AIB had receivers appointed and I asked which AIB entity was involved.  He asked me what I meant.  He came back to me two days later and I ended up going to the companies office and discovering AIB Finance and Leasing and I think AIB Leasing and Finance.  There were five or six leasing divisions in AIB that the ordinary person could see from the headed notepaper.  The man discovered he had vehicles repossessed by the wrong division of AIB.  That issue is now in court.  All these banks were playing ducks and drakes with tax evasion and everything else.  They were lending money out with one company but if they had more profits in another company, they could write it off and bring money back.  The Central Bank is not regulating any of it.</p></speech>

They do not say "by the way, we are valuing you at X and you have them valued at XX" so we could get an independent valuation.  That does not happen.  They just come in and smash and grab.

I accept that Ms Lavin and her partner were both very accomplished business people and very involved over many years but I presume this was something they never expected to happen.  They were flying high, had plenty of business and were on television.  Did the shadow director indicate the company was in receivership immediately or did he arrive way before the receivership was even contemplated, walking into the building and saying he was in charge?</p></speech>

The company's overdraft was then reduced and its operational capacity was massively reduced.  Ms Lavin referenced the phrase "if the company has not de-funded we can engineer one", which is quite frightening.  Looking back on it - I am sure this was not Ms Lavin's perception at the time - they never wanted the business to succeed.  They wanted to get in, get the assets, strip them and sell them.  In terms of what Ms Lavin had to say, and the way she said it, it would suggest there were friends of friends who were lined up to strip the assets and pick off what they wanted and so on.

We attended the meeting in Belfast.  That was the day when I became alarmed.  It was the first occasion I had heard of GRG.  At that meeting many people asked why a part of RBS had purchased their assets.  Mr. Tomlinson's explanation was astonishing.  When the question was asked as to where all this had happened, we were told it happened in a building in London.  People were told their assets had been sold to another side of the house.  It was explained that there was a glass partition down the middle of an office and that there was a set of staff in the inside section to whom people on the other side of the wall would offer assets for sale.  In other words, they were trading the assets with staff on the other side of the glass partition.  They would offer the assets for, say, &euro;2 million or &euro;5 million, a price would be agreed and the assets purchased.  There are allegations that some of these assets ended up in Ulster Bank executives' pension funds.  It is astonishing stuff.</p></speech>

As explained by Ms Lavin, I have stayed in the background on this issue because I have so much more going on.  I know exactly what is going on.  I inquired about how I had ended up in GRG.  The bank employee whom I dealt with did nothing wrong.  I want to make that clear.  He had been transferred from the office in George's Quay to GRG in College Green and his customers went with him to GRG.  He did not know anything about what was going on.  I filled him in on what we had learned in Belfast.  When I asked him how I had ended up in GRG in College Green, his response was that when he was transferred, so too were all of his customers, but none of those customers was ever written to and told this was happening.</p></speech>

It was the stuff Ulster Bank wanted to rid itself of.  The committee has had other evidence given to it privately of hotels and other businesses that were performing well in terms of their existing loans and agreements with the banks but ended up in GRG which was then sold on to a vulture fund, following which their relationship was very different from their historic relationship and they could not build or even seek planning permission for extensions and so on, all of this being engineered to get them out and to sell off the property at a quick profit.  That has been the experience not only of the witnesses here today but of other people.</p> <p>  Am I correct that Ms Lavin's company had never missed a loan repayment or defaulted on any loan and that GRG just stepped in and did everything it could to make their lives difficult in the hope that eventually the company would crash and burn?</p></speech>

I used the piece in my introduction.  Somebody made a decision in the summer of 2014 when the vulture funds were brought in.  That was the summer that Allsops and the auctioneers, who were selling disputed properties, had ground to a halt.  There were meetings in the Department of Finance.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to 65 meetings involving the Minister and all these vulture funds yet the Minister met none of the people dealing with housing or evictions.  Apparently, this plan was hatched under John Moran.  He had previous experience in banking in New York and knew this business model that had travelled from the US to South America and around the world so he was the architect of this plan.  The rest is history.  The question is whether there were other alternatives.  We have heard from Jim Miller's group and how alternative public banking could have got money to allow people to buy back their properties from the mainstream banks so there was a model that was the opposite of it.</p></speech>

Senator Kieran O'Donnell questioned whether she was na&iuml;ve.  We must understand that anyone in business who has come across this issue since 2008 could tell a similar story.  People are not in business to go broke; they are in business to be successful.  It was a new experience for businesses, big and small, when they were hassled and muscled by the banks from 2008 onwards.  That is what is missing in this piece.  If one is a developer, it is a bad word.  If one is in business, one is are supposed to be able to look after oneself but the banks did not look after businesses.  In respect of the strong arm felt by Ms Lavin, I have heard that story on numerous occasions.  I have heard on it in respect of what happened to families.  I sympathise with Ms Lavin regarding the death of Aidan Cullen.  There are similar stories everywhere and that is what this committee must grapple with and understand.  Much of the devastation in family homes and businesses was caused by the banks.  While they covered their own backsides as quickly as they could, they inflicted terrible pain and suffering on those with whom they were dealing.  It was brave of Ms Lavin to come forward - I know she has been on other public forums - to explain this matter and put it in context so that other families and SMEs will see that although their figures might be different, their stories and their treatment are the same.  It is not just about GRG.  It is right across the banking sector.  Mr. Beades said that when the history of this is written, it will put us all to shame, particularly in this House, where we had the opportunity to introduce legislation and did not do so and where we had the opportunity to insist that the existing legislation under the remit of the Central Bank was not forced into act and did not do so.  That is where we have fallen down.</p> <p>  The question arising from Ms Lavin's contribution concerns where we were go from here.  We have agreed as a committee that on a quarterly basis, we would meet with the Central Bank and put all these issues and other issues of concern to us on the agenda.  I assure the witnesses that, as Chairman of this committee and with the support of members, I will fulfil that agenda and keep this on the agenda along with the other matters for as long as possible until we see action.  In her presentation, Ms Lavin said that Ulster Bank lied, which is pretty strong language, but we should do what they are now doing in the US and call it like it is.  If that is the case, Ms Lavin has been asked to point it out to us.  We would like to see it and will take it with the Central Bank.  Ulster Bank has not written to Ms Lavin, as it committed to do, which I find astonishing, particularly in light of the hearings we have had and the request that it would engage directly with her in this manner.  We will have to remind it of the transcript that exists of the commitment that was made.  The committee will support me in asking the clerk to write again to Ulster Bank to determine what it will do about the matter.</p> <p>  I am clear in my mind that the Central Bank said that it would meet Ms Lavin's group and was interested in hearing from it.  I hope she will take up that invitation.  It will help us in our deliberations and actions at future meetings in respect of commentary and so on.  In her submission, Ms Lavin said that the John Mann, MP, has asked the Serious Fraud Office in Britain to open an urgent investigation into RBS.</p><p>Does she think something similar should be done in Ireland?</p></speech>

I find it unacceptable that a group of vulture funds handling considerable property portfolios in this State do not feel obliged to come before the committee.  We agreed, in private session, to pursue this matter as robustly as possible in order to ensure that they come before us or engage with us in an open and transparent way, as they do privately with Ministers and the Department of Finance.  The citizens of this State deserve at least that much from them.  Does Mr. Beades have any idea of the type of deals that are done with these vulture funds?  How much of the overall debt that they buy is generally knocked off?</p></speech>

I know of one case where &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million was owed and &euro;6,000 was the figure.  The man in question has nothing but &euro;6,000 was offered to enable them to walk away and it was accepted.  I talked to private people who have bought this debt, including some from NAMA.  They got portfolios for nothing because they were seen as having no value.  In one instance involving NAMA, land sold for &euro;1 million has now been rezoned by a county council and is worth &euro;1 million per acre, resulting in a loss to the State of some &euro;100 million.  The committee should be tracking this land going forward.  NAMA was set up to sweat these assets for 20 years but, in the rush by the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to be the good boy and close down NAMA before the most recent election, massive decisions were made to dispose of assets at absolutely ridiculous values, meaning that land is being rezoned at enormous sums.</p></speech>

There is a big debate among people on this side of the issue over what has happened.  The Government rushed through a Bill before Christmas, the Courts Act, to plug a gap that we created by defending ourselves and taking cases all the way to the High Court as lay litigants.  We raised &euro;10,000 on one occasion to hire barristers at the last minute and the Court of Appeal ruled that the Circuit Court was acting unconstitutionally.  The case to which I refer is still travelling through the courts and has gone to the Supreme Court.

Civil servants employed by the State should be more caring.</p><p>Some of these registrars are worse than judges.  What people want is a full hearing on issues such as overcharging and so on.  In many cases, the bank does not even have title, yet judges are rubber-stamping summary judgments and not allowing cases to go to a full hearing.  The Master of the High Court has spoken out on the paperwork issue; therefore, I am not the only one who is saying it.</p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome our witnesses, Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh and Mr. Tom Arnold, from the Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA.  The IIEA has been doing a lot of interesting work on Brexit.  We look forward to hearing the views and insights of the witnesses and the committee will have a number of questions.  I understand Mr. O'Ceallaigh will speak first, followed by Mr. Arnold.</p> <p>  I need to go through some technical matters with regard to mobile phones.  I remind members, guests and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones and tablets are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even if on silent mode, with the recording equipment.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  On behalf of the committee the witnesses are very welcome.</p></speech>

I will deal with some of the generalities and Mr. Arnold will deal with trade and agriculture in particular.</p> <p>  The future is very uncertain and unpredictable.  We really do not know where we will be in two, three, four or ten years time.  It is very uncertain.  Last week, the British Prime Minister, Mrs May, clarified where she would like to be, but this does not necessarily mean where she will end up.  I will draw attention to several things she said, the first and most important point being the UK is leaving the EU.  This is the only basis on which we can do business, at least for the moment.</p> <p>  In its judgment in recent days, the British Supreme Court made it clear that the negotiation of leaving the EU is a matter for the British Government and the British Parliament and not for the devolved institutions or the devolved executives.  The Prime Minister made it clear she wants Britain to leave the Single Market.  At the same time, she stated she would seek to have the greatest possible access to the Single Market, and I believe she used the word "frictionless".  She stated she would do this through the form of a free trade agreement.  All of this remains to be negotiated.  What is clear is that the UK is leaving the Single Market.  The Prime Minister did not state how this would be achieved.</p> <p>  The Prime Minister stated the UK will not be part of the common commercial policy nor will it be bound by the common external tariff.  In effect, these issues are part of the customs union and it means there will be a break in the customs union.  She also made it clear she wants to have control over the immigration of EU citizens into the United Kingdom.  All of our discussions and thoughts about the future of Northern Ireland, the future of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic and our relations with the United Kingdom need to be put in the framework of these points.</p> <p>  What does this mean for the Good Friday Agreement, the relationship with Northern Ireland and the relationship of the Republic with Britain?  The Border and what happens on it will now be an issue for the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU.  What we seek to get on the Border and what we seek as a State to get in the relationship with Northern Ireland we will have to pursue within the framework of the negotiations which will be carried out by the Commission with a very big input and oversight from the European Council.</p> <p>  In view of the British stress on the control of immigration, and especially because of the likelihood the common customs union will be replaced with something different, it is almost inevitable there will be a border between North and South in the future which will be different from the Border which exists now.  If these things are to go through there will have to be some sort of control over immigration into the United Kingdom, which includes Northern Ireland, and there will have to be some form of control over the movement of goods between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It seems to me inevitable that in some way there will be a border which does not exist at present.  It need not necessarily be a physical border, for example, the border between Norway and Sweden is not physical.</p><p>There is no border post where lorries have to stop and so on.  There are rights for the customs and revenue people on one side to travel into the other jurisdiction.  There are rights, for example, for Swedish customs officers to operate on Norwegian territory and for Norwegian customs officers to operate on Swedish territory.  That might be one possibility.  Another possibility is that with the development of technology and so on, there could be a lot of pre-clearance so that things could go through without stopping.  I do think that there will be a border and that there will inevitably be extra costs for people in business and for people travelling from one jurisdiction to the other.</p><p> The second issue is the common travel area.  The common travel area is perhaps a little bit more bilateral.  It might be possible, one does not know, for the British and Irish Governments to agree some sort of arrangement to allow for a continuation of the common travel area.  It will form part of the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  Like all negotiations of this kind, nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.  Do not think that it will be possible to have a deal on the common travel area up front.  It will be part of the negotiations, but I would have thought that if the two Governments can reach agreement on the terms of a common travel area and put that into the negotiating framework, there would, I think, be a reasonable chance that the Europeans would accept it.</p><p> It is clear from listening to European sources, including Mr. Michel Barnier, that they are conscious of the problem caused by Brexit for the relationship across the Border, and that they are also very conscious of the unique problems which are faced in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is seen by the Europeans as a European success because the Europeans invested a very great deal in the peace process, as we know, through both the INTERREG arrangements and through the peace programmes in Northern Ireland.  They know that has been a success and they do not want to throw it away.  They are also aware of how fragile it is, as we have all seen in the last few weeks.  I think there is probably a better chance of retaining the common travel area than there is of retaining the situation as it is on the Border.  I would just offer a reminder of what Ms May actually said.  She said that she would do everything possible to find a practical solution to the issue of the common travel area but, I quote, "while protecting the integrity of the UK's immigration system".  There are steps here that have to be overcome.</p><p> I think overall, my greatest concern would be about the loss of a very close, daily relationship between British and Irish politicians and civil servants, which take place in Brussels.  Every day of the week in Brussels, or elsewhere, there are meetings taking place in which British and Irish officials and politicians meet and do business together.  Once the UK leaves the European Union, that sort of close co-operation that has existed for the last 40 years will disappear.  It was only because of that close co-operation that the two Governments were actually able to bring the parties in Northern Ireland together and to bring peace in Northern Ireland.  My greatest concern is that over a period, when the UK has left the European Union, those constant meetings of British and Irish politicians and officials will come to an end, and we will not find it as easy in the future to resolve the problems which always arise, as we have found over the last 20 years.  I am not hopeless at all, but I think it is going to be quite difficult.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Arnold" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017012600002#F00300"><p>I will repeat Mr. O'Ceallaigh's core conclusions.  The logic of a hard Brexit, that is to say British exit from the Single Market and the customs union, inevitably points back to a border within the island of Ireland.  Set against this logic are the clear political statements from both the UK and the Irish Government, supported by various voices from within the EU, that nobody wants to go back to having a hard Border, the desire to retain the common travel area subject to Ms May's work to not undermine immigration objectives, and then the dimension of the peace process.  We have here a certain logic of a British position, and set against that, political objectives.  The very practical question is what practical policies have to be put in place to achieve those political objectives.  That is at the core of what we are going to be faced with in the negotiation.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the broad trade and economy and I want to focus specifically on the agri-food sector.  We will look at the focus on the wider economy, first within the Republic of Ireland.  What is the economic damage and where is it going to come from as a result of Brexit?  There are two basic aspects.  One is the assumption that we refer to in the status report that we produced last week which the committee has been provided with.  It is a reasonable medium-term assumption that the value of Sterling, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, the euro, is going to be lower than it otherwise would have been.  That is a medium-term reality and that is going to put pressure on Irish competitiveness.  The second is that as we move away from British membership of the Single Market and customs union it would translate into trade barriers.  These are the transmission mechanisms whereby economic damage can be done.<br/><br/>What is it likely to add up to?  The most recent and most cogent attempt to assess this was provided last week by the Department of Finance in its testimony to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  There were three core conclusions.  First there will be, as a result of a hard Brexit, a reduction of national wealth, a possible 30% fall in exports to the UK, a rise of unemployment, a rise in unemployment with 40,000 fewer people employed in the economy over ten years.  The work that the Department of Finance and The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, have done in modelling would show that again, over a ten year period, Irish GDP would be some 4% smaller than it would be if there was no Brexit.<br/><br/>The overall conclusion has to be - it is very relevant to the wider political discussion - that Ireland's economy is likely to be more seriously affected than any other member state in the European Union.  When we turn to Northern Ireland specifically, we have provided the committee with a submission for today, and I want to point to two issues which are dealt with in this submission.  One refers to a report that was done by the Northern Ireland Assembly and The Open University Business School in 2015, on attempting to assess what the impact of Brexit would be.  I think it would be useful to read into the record the core conclusion that came from this.  It refers to the trend rate of growth of the Northern Ireland economy as being about a third lower compared to that of the UK while the comparative unemployment rate is about twice that of the UK as a whole.  Thus if the medium forecast for the impact on UK GDP from a Brexit is around 2% lower then it could be expected that trend total GDP would be 3% lower in Northern Ireland.  It refers also to this having a knock-on effect on unemployment.  So there is real evidence to suggest that because of the structural weakness of the Northern Ireland economy, any negative impact that Brexit will have on the UK will be amplified in the case of Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>The second area relates to foreign direct investment.  Clearly Northern Ireland, because of how the economy is structured, with a large level of public sector employment, needs more private investment and more foreign direct investment.  The effort to put in a 12.5% rate corporation tax in Northern Ireland as part of a recent agreement from a couple of years ago was designed to do that.</p><p>The fear is that Brexit will actually take us in the opposite direction in that it will not be possible to realise the benefit of the 12.5% rate that would otherwise be realised.  Ireland had success with a lower taxation rate because it gave access to the wider European Community.</p><p> I would like to turn to the agrifood sector which is of major importance and has not received sufficient attention up to now.  I want to touch briefly on a few areas.  I acknowledge the similarities between the agrifood sectors North and South.  I shall consider the current trade realities and how the sectors in Ireland and the United Kingdom are integrated.  I shall then examine what a hard Brexit would mean in tariff rates for the agrifood sector and, finally, take a look at some of the more medium to longer-term perspectives.</p><p> Let us consider the similarities.  In both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland the agrifood sectors have a higher economic importance than in most other countries and are more dependent on exportation to other parts of the European Union.  They are highly dependent on Common Agricultural Policy income supports as a proportion of net farm income.  On page 7 of our submission we consider some of the comparisons between Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Britain.  Let us keep it as simple as possible.  In 2014, in the Republic, direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy amounted to 60% of net farm income.  In Northern Ireland the figure was 91%.  That has remained and is likely to remain the case.  Net farm income in Northern Ireland is very much dependent on the CAP support arrangements.</p><p> With regard to trade and market realities, there is a huge interconnection between the two economies.  The United Kingdom is Ireland's largest market for food and drink exports, accounting for 41% of all such exports.  The market was valued at &euro;4.4 billion in 2015.  Some 52% of beef exports and 30% of dairy exports from Ireland go to the United Kingdom.  On the other side of the coin, Irish food and drink imports from the United Kingdom in 2015 were worth &euro;3.1 billion.</p><p> The cross-Border trade in the agrifood sector is remarkable in respect of a number of products.  One billion litres of milk are imported from Northern Ireland each year.  Half a million pigs are sent from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland for processing, while some 300,000 lambs are sent in the other direction.  This is part of normal logic; different things are done in different parts of the country.  There are more complex supply chain arrangements which I do not really have the time to go into.  What if we are to have a hard Brexit and the United Kingdom applies WTO rules which is what it is talking about as an alternative?  Based on the Department of Finance's figures and the tariff levels that would apply to Irish produce going to the United Kingdom, meat products would be subject to tariffs at a rate of 50%, dairy produce and eggs at a rate of 25% and processed meat products at a rate of 35%.  Clearly, tariff barriers of this scale would have a major impact on prices and income levels, with considerable implications for trade on the island of Ireland.</p><p> When we look to the medium and longer term in regard to agricultural policy, we must separate out the two strands.  The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland both have stability in funding up to 2020 under current EU funding arrangements.  Beyond that date, there will have to be a new multi-annual financial framework, on which negotiations will have to start in the next couple of years.  With the withdrawal of the United Kingdom's contribution to that budget, decisions to be taken on funding under the Common Agricultural Policy, for example, will become a lot harder to make.  The outcome of the multi-annual financial framework negotiations will be central to Irish Government policy in the next couple of years.  In the case of Northern Ireland, it is a good deal more complex.  First, we start with the reality that net farm income in Northern Ireland is much more dependent on subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy than other places, certainly the Republic of Ireland.  The UK Government has guaranteed funding levels up to 2020, but beyond that date there will have to be a new UK agricultural policy.  From the estimates produced in our submission, we conclude that just to make up what the current subsidies provide for Northern Ireland farmers, at least an additional &pound;300 million would be required to be added to the bloc grant in Northern Ireland.  In the context of the considerable effort made on the part of the British Government to cut public expenditure, the notion that Northern Ireland will be able to receive an extra &pound;300 million, in addition to the bloc grant, to maintain current farm supports seems highly problematic.</p><p> There is a longer term issue regarding what shape UK farm policy will take.  There is a very strong possibility that the United Kingdom will be tempted to move back to a cheap food policy, the policy it had effectively from the middle of the 19th century until 1970.  That would put the Northern Ireland agrifood sector in a position of extreme vulnerability in the next five to ten years.</p><p> I started by saying we had high-level political wishes not to have a hard border, to have a common travel area and to protect the peace process, but we must negotiate the practical policies to achieve this.  However, that is going to be very difficult and I have spelled out some of the consequences of not achieving these objectives.  This is at the heart of the negotiations.  In overall terms, a hard Brexit would be bad for Ireland, North and South.  It would represent a major inhibitor to the development of the all-island economy, on which significant progress has been made in the past two decades.  Northern Ireland, because of its economic structure, particularly of its farming sector, is particularly vulnerable.  That is the challenge we face.  That is ultimately the answer to what the committee is attempting to assess, namely, the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

They have put their finger on the problems and how extreme they will be.  The analysis of the Department of Finance is exceptionally clear, but its outlook is predicated on there being minimum intervention by the Government.  It shows the worst possible scenario, but, nonetheless, a very stark one that we cannot allow to happen.</p> <p>  My question relates to what D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh said about the excellent relationship for decades between the British and the Irish at both political and civil servant level.  It seems the only way to address issues arising regarding a hard or a soft Brexit, or an invisible border, is to focus on the relationship that could be agreed to between Britain and Ireland, particularly concerning the common travel area, about which the delegates spoke.  If the greatest danger is posed to the agrifood and agriculture sectors, it would be desirable for the British, the Irish and the Northern Irish to agree on a way forward together.</p><p>Turkey has a special relationship with the EU on some produce that can cross EU boundaries without any tariffs or penalties.  We need to seek such an agreement in terms of our agriculture and other key exports.  The advantage for the UK is that it needs good, high quality food.  It needs it fresh and it needs it now.  It needs a workforce that can speak English.  We have a huge history of Britain being the destination for many of our emigrants and families.  Therefore, there is a lot to build on.  Do the witnesses think that is the only way we can really deal with this issue?  Otherwise, the implication of Brexit, hard or soft, is the repartition of Ireland and the destruction of the economy, particularly in the North.</p><p> A total of 70% of the tourists that visit Northern Ireland reach the North through the Republic.  Many issue such as that mean that Northern Ireland would suffer disproportionately as a result of Brexit.  I do not know if the questions are clear to the witnesses.  The big barrier to all of this is that there cannot officially be a negotiation between Britain and Ireland as such, but in actual fact the communications and discussions are ongoing every day.  I would be interested in the views of the witnesses on those points.</p></speech>

This is a version of an economic war in that the UK pulling out of the EU will effectively create trade barriers that are going to destroy elements and some sectors of the Irish economy in some instances.  The witnesses touched upon the political statements.  The Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, said that there was no desire to return to a hard Border.  However, when she had the portfolio of Home Secretary, she insisted that there would be a hard Border.  We can take everything she says with a pinch of salt depending on which hat she chooses to wear.</p> <p>  The issue of the Border is of huge concern to this committee with regard to whether it is going to be reimposed in terms of physical checks.  From everything I have read and seen, because Britain is tearing up the four freedoms of goods, people, services and capital, the EU will insist that we put in a hard Border.  The Commissioner, who was here this week, has said that.  If Ireland signs up to the rules of the EU in terms of the four freedoms, we must abide by those rules if a country like Great Britain does not do so.</p> <p>  The witness touched on the Norwegian model but that is entirely different.  Britain does not want that model.  It has basically said that it is not going to sign up for the freedom of people.  Therefore, the Norwegian model does not apply.  There will not be a case in which her Royal Majesty's customs officials will go into County Louth to look at the back of somebody's truck.  I could not imagine that they would ever have dreamed of doing so.  That is not going to happen.  We need to stop talking about options that Britain itself has ruled out and look at the hard reality.</p> <p>  The freedom of movement across the Border is far more important to us than the common travel area.  The common travel area sounds great, but everybody who goes to an airport has to hand in a passport.  Their identity is already checked.  Going down a different chute in Heathrow Airport if they happen to go to England once in a blue moon does not add a hill of beans to their existence.  What does matter is the 12,000 people who go from the Republic to the North every day to go to work, the 8,000 who go from the North to the South every day to go to work and the thousands who cross the Border as part of their normal existence to see their farm, neighbours and friends.  That is the hard reality.</p> <p>  Putting 40,000 people on the Border, as Mr. Bertie Ahern pointed out, did not seal the Border.  Yet, between 1939 and 1952, there were passport checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.  They checked everybody going from Belfast, Derry and Larne.  Today, they racially profile people who are getting on boats and planes under Operation Gull.  They will upscale that when the UK leaves the EU because everybody will see Ireland as a back door.  It will not be very hard to get across the Border.  People will try to get to Britain through that back door.  Britain will check everybody going across the sea from Northern Ireland.  Yet it will also insist on trying to seal a Border that, in the height of the Troubles when lives were on the line, could not be sealed with 40,000 people.  It is going to cause an economic calamity between the North and the South, impinge upon people's daily lives and also put the peace process at risk.</p> <p>  The House of Lords report, which I am sure the witnesses have seen, has ruled out moving the Border between these islands, even though it is the most practical thing to do and even though it is what they are doing already on a racially-profiled basis with Operation Gull.  They are going to formalise Operation Gull and do it as a matter of course when the UK formally leaves the EU.  For all the issues we keep talking about that the UK keeps ruling out, would it not be more honest for us to start saying that if we want to keep the Border open, the real border checks will have to be between these two islands?</p> <p>  The economic issues, which I know my colleagues will talk about, are a catastrophe.  It is beyond reckoning how bad it is going to get.  This really is a slow car crash.  We are looking for proposals from the witnesses in terms of outlining the problems, which is helpful, because there are so many.  In reality, we should be putting forward the case for Ireland and for the people of this island.  The House of Lords is ruling out doing something that the UK did between 1939 and 1952, but would make a huge difference to a lot of people's lives if the UK put the Border where it used to be for nearly 13 years.</p></speech>

I believe it is difficult.  However, if the two Governments can between them come up with some sort of reasonable solution and put it into the negotiating framework between the UK and the EU, we might find something for the common travel area that will fly.  That is what I think, though I am not certain.</p> <p>  Going back to the point made by Senator Daly, the real issue here is whether the Republic is going to be seen as a backdoor for non-Irish EU citizens to get into the UK.  That has to be addressed.  During the war, as the Senator rightly said, it was addressed by having a control border for people from this island, North and South, arriving in the UK.  In those days, of course, they almost all arrived by boat.  There was very little air travel, if any.  It might be a little bit more difficult to control now.  During the war, people living in Northern Ireland had to carry identity cards, even though they were citizens of the UK.  Their identity cards were checked as they went into Great Britain.  Politically, there are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who would not like to have that in the future, but that is what happened during the Second World War.  It is an issue and one to which nobody can provide a solution at this stage.  We just do not know.</p> <p>  I am not so sure that tourism will be a big problem.  When the British talk about the migration of EU citizens into Britain, they are talking about settlement rather than tourism.  We all know that there are very many countries in which one can travel as a tourist for three months or six months and it does not present the slightest difficulty.  The difficulty lies when one wants to settle or, as in the United States, overstay one's welcome.  I do not foresee much difficulty on the tourism front.  However, if there are controls of some kind on the Border, be it passport controls or whatever, it might be an issue.</p> <p>  The reality is that there are going to be differences on trade that will require regulation, however they are regulated.  Likewise, there are going to be differences on migration that will require regulation, no matter how they are regulated.  I do not know how this is going to work.</p><p>As regards movement across the Border for work purposes, a possible example is Switzerland which has tight rules on working but where, for many years, there were arrangements with the French, the Germans and the Italians whereby people could travel across the border, work freely and return home in the evening.  It should be possible to find technical solutions to the question of Northern Ireland people who work for five or six days a week in the South and <i>vice versa</i>.  That can be done because it has been done for years in Switzerland.</p></speech>

We need to argue from that political base and then we need to see where practical solutions can be found.  It makes a great deal of sense, both for Britain and Ireland, to have as free an arrangement for the agrifood sector as possible.  The way supply chains operate between Britain and Ireland makes the argument for this and we should be able to find a lot of solutions.  It will come down to a degree of goodwill and we will have to do it in the context of the relationship between the UK and the rest of the EU.  Space has to be found for an appreciation of the particular problems Ireland has and willingness is needed to come up with practical and innovative solutions to the problems.</p></speech>

This has been a phoney war so far but we are now coming up to the time when the trouble starts.  We discussed the Norway-Sweden border at a Brexit fact-finding meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Belfast last Monday but it is very different from the Border between the Republic of Ireland and the North.  It is rural and mountainous and there are not too many crossing points and while it may be an option it will be politically very difficult for customs in both jurisdictions.</p> <p>  I have spoken to many diplomats and they told me of the difficulties that there were with the isolationist relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland, and between the Republic and the United Kingdom, up until the late 1960s and 1970s.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs often meets the Foreign Secretary but that simply did not happen in those days.  There was not much co-operation between the two islands at the time.  The point that 1973 was a game changer, with our entry into the EEC along with Great Britain, is correct.  It worries me that we might lose a lot of good organisations such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South interparliamentary association.  Every day at least 26 meetings take place in Europe involving Irish officials and politicians and we are going to lose that.  How will we replace that vacuum?  What can we do to ensure we never go back to a situation where the lines of communication are not open for difficult situations?  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meets in committee meetings and for two or three days every six months.  I am afraid that the dialogue, the friendships and the political understandings built up over the past 20 years will break down when the UK leaves the EU.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions for what we can do to ensure those links are maintained and enhanced?</p></speech>

However, 100 jobs were announced for Dundalk today by Almac, which clearly wants to keep its options open over which side of the Border it is best to operate from.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Arnold mention solutions because there is a uniqueness in what has just happened, both for Britain and for Europe.  There is a need for creativity and imagination to find a solution.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh spoke of the loss of the political interaction and Senator Feighan referred to the various meetings that take place.  I am equally concerned at the interaction that will not happen on either side of the Border, such as local authorities co-operating on schemes and in committees to deliver seamless services North and South.  I would hope that organisations such as the East Border Region and ICBAN, or CAWT in the area of health co-operation, will not end up counting for naught because this would affect people.  </p> <p>  The question of how the Border would be controlled came up.  It is 499 km long and has 380 roads, 38 of which are in County Louth.  Any interference with the invisibility of the Border at these points will impact on trade and people.  The Taoiseach has spoken about technology but there will be an inevitable slowing down of the movement of goods.  Hauliers are already extremely worried and they are already being impacted on by the taxes that have been imposed by the British Government when moving North.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the common travel area.  Neither the UK nor Ireland joined the Schengen area because we had common movement, North and South.  I am led to believe we have no information systems for this purpose.  The British Government uses the Schengen information system, even though it is not part of the Schengen Agreement, but there is no control over our Borders, whether this is at ports or airports.  I am not thinking of the movement of migrants in this regard but of paedophiles and undesirables and this will be part of a major problem going forward.</p> <p>  The various sectors have been talking about the problems but this needs to be about solutions.  Politicians can talk at the most senior level but anyone living along the Border has to deal with farm gate issues and some officials in Brussels, as well as those who advocated for this exit, need to be shown that they are not really representing the periphery of their regions.</p><p>I hope that as regards this bespoke solution, as well as with creative and imaginative thinking, we can get to that level of discussion.  I am suggesting that on foot of this meeting, from here on, we need to examine the solutions rather than the problems.</p></speech>

That is what we need to start moving towards.  In terms of the relationship issue, I take Mr. O'Ceallaigh's point on board that the UK leaving would mean a qualitative shift.  However, we are not going to go back to the 1970s.  There is a basis of equality in the relationship now which has been built up over decades and that is not going to change.  All I think it means is that, to use the car advertisement slogan, maybe Britain and Ireland will have to try harder to protect those relationships.</p> <p>  The agreement between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach in 2012 set up a formal structure of consultation between both Administrations.  For example, every year the permanent secretaries of Government Departments on either side meet each other.  I happened to be in the UK shortly after that happened last October and the sort of relationship building that has developed there over a number of years has been valuable.  </p> <p>  Part of the Good Friday Agreement institutions may have the potential in future to be further developed and built upon.  It will however require a conscious political effort to do that.  We must be conscious that if we are losing something by Britain not being part of the EU set-up, then Ireland and the UK will have to work harder to ensure that their own relationships are important. </p> <p>  Can Mr. O'Ceallaigh deal with the CTA and Schengen?  It is more within his competency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017012600002#K00300"><p>Yes.  I would like to add something to what Mr. Arnold said.  There is room for development in the North-South and east-west organisations, bodies such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Group and the British-Irish Council.  They could for example meet more frequently and be opened more widely to discuss different issues.  If the British pull out, and they are pulling out, we are going to lose that constant interaction in Brussels.  Therefore, we have to try to replace it by a many more meetings across the Border with local authorities, the British-Irish parliamentary groups, visits by the Oireachtas to Northern Ireland and so on.  There are many ways in which the relationships which have been built up since the Good Friday Agreement, as Mr. Arnold rightly mentioned, can be developed further to try to compensate for what we are losing in Brussels.<br/><br/>It is clear, however, and we should not miss it, that the Commission in particular is concerned not to lose the advantages which have accrued over the last 20 years by the support which the Commission and the European institutions gave in Northern Ireland and across the Border.  The sort of problems that were mentioned, including meetings of authorities across the Border, the use of a hospital in Derry by people from Donegal or <i>vice versa, </i>should all become, and I certain will become part of the negotiations.  The Irish Government will ensure that those issues are brought into the negotiations.  I would suggest that the more of those problems one finds that require practical solutions, the more they should be fed to the Irish Government so that they can be raised in the negotiations to obtain better outcomes.  <br/><br/>I am not an expert in the justice area but I do know that there is close contact between the justice authorities in this country, particularly the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and what is going on in Europol, Forex and various European organisations that are trying to deal with international crime.  Schengen is slightly different.  It is all about control of entry into the European Union.  Once such controlled entry is permitted, people are then free to move around the EU.  We are not in Schengen because we are in the travel area with the UK and perhaps that is something we may have to look at.  From my little experience of it, however, I think the practical co-operation between security and intelligence forces across Europe is very good.</p></speech>

I expected no less from either of them.  I can get worried about various aspects of the economy.  I get particularly worried about agriculture.  While we mention the style of arrangements in Norway and Turkey, agriculture does not feature in either of those.  To the best of my knowledge agriculture is left out and in the Norwegian case heavy duties are placed on agricultural produce.  I know from some very capable people in the dairying industry that the dairying aspect of agriculture is most vulnerable in terms of the damage it will suffer.  I was fascinated by some evidence that Dr. Mike Johnston of Dairy UK gave to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee.</p> <p>  I will touch on the comments that Mr. O'Ceallaigh has just made.  The nub of all this is that it is ultimately threatening our settlement of 1998, the Good Friday Agreement.  To my mind, the British have emotionally abandoned, stepped back or are trying to abandon that settlement, although they want to take the advantages of it.  We removed Articles 2 and 3 from the Constitution in order to get a settlement and stability, but there is little or no acceptance on the part of the British or some elements of unionism that there is an Irish dimension in the North.  In fact, they feel that we should all be Unionists from now on in their day-to-day attitudes.  What do we do therefore?  How does Mr. Arnold see us pulling together?</p> <p>  Margaret Ritchie, Mark Durkan and I are three fairly lonely individuals in the House of Commons trying to make a case among 650 MPs.  There might be ten or 12 of those 650 who will listen attentively - I am talking about the English MPs.  There is certainly an attentive audience in the Scottish Nationalists.  How do we all pull on the same green jersey and make this thing work for all of us?  If things become unstuck in the North - this is not a threat or a scare - and it becomes destabilised again, the whole island becomes destabilised.  We do not need that, North or South, so how do we unite and find mechanisms?  Others were talking about solutions but how do we get a cohesive strategy?  </p> <p>  I have been most impressed by the evidence and discussion of the IIEA, this committee and others.  To some extent each bit of it is like a jigsaw sitting in isolation until it is all put together.  Some of us point to the Government concerning this big challenge.  There is a lot the Government can do, but there are things the Government cannot do.  We have to find a way of maximising the contribution that each of us can bring to this.  If we do not get that strategy, backbone or spine right all the other work we do will be lost and we will not maximise its value.  Perhaps that is too much of a tall order but I am looking here at Mr. O'Ceallaigh's previous career as one of our outstanding diplomats.</p><p>He has been around all of these places.  We need such people to steer us by outlining how they would have tackled the problem 15 or 20 years ago.  Many people are concerned about this matter.  We do even have - perhaps they are not very outspoken - people from a Unionist background in the North who are concerned.  They are very pro-remain yet find themselves isolated.  For me, the magic of this issue is that it breaks away from the old sectarian divide and we have an opportunity to hold a new discussion with new terms on how we take the island of Ireland forward.</p></speech>

I am sure they have been influenced by their vast experience of working in national and international public administration.  They have outlined the facts in a cold analytical way and the grave challenges that face all of our island.</p><p>Mr. Arnold provided statistics on farm incomes and outlined how dependent Northern Ireland farmers are on a transfer of funds from the European Union.  It is a pity the matter was not addressed at meetings held by the farm organisations in the Six Counties in advance of their vote to leave the EU.  It beggars belief that people from that community voted to leave the EU.  Some people must think the British Empire will come back.  It is not coming back.  </p><p>Eighteen months ago we argued on this committee that we had not realised the potential of the Good Friday Agreement and should have pushed for more all-island bodies.  However, we are at this juncture.  As I have mentioned at previous committee meetings, when one analyses the huge progress that has been made since 1998 one discovers there has been a huge development of trade on a North-South basis and <i>vice versa</i>.  I do not think the official statistics, both North and South, capture the great economic development that has occurred in the Border regions, in particular, and further afield. </p><p>The following is often omitted from commentary.  We have many small enterprises, North and South, whose sole market is on the other side of the Border.  Many small enterprises in my constituency, which is comprised of two southern Ulster counties, depend on the Northern Ireland market as their only outlet, apart from the South.  </p><p>The delegation has highlighted the importance of the agrifood sector and the negative impact that will result when Britain leaves the European Union.  The South exports a lot of product and goods to parts of Europe and outside of the European continent.  Most of that product must pass through Britain.  Sometimes a product leaves an EU member state, goes into a non-EU member State, goes back into a European State on mainland Europe and finally exits in order to reach another destination.  With Brexit it is hard to think that there will not be a tariff or impediment to trade at some point along the way.  I have asked the Taoiseach whether there were figures available that analyse the level of export products that transit Britain with a final destination that is further afield.  Unfortunately the figures are unavailable.  I think we have underestimated the difficulties that will arise in the export sector.</p><p>The agrifood sector is the mainstay of the rural economy in Ireland.  It will be hit hard by Brexit.  Let us remember that it is always difficult to regenerate or create jobs in the agrifood sector.  I am glad that the delegation has put a strong focus on the challenges that face the agrifood sector.  </p><p>Like myself Mr. Arnold has experienced agriculture meetings in Europe.  I have never heard the British Minister or his officials argue for more money to be distributed through the CAP programme to farmers in Northern Ireland.  Those farmers think that the &pound;300 million plus will be compensated for by a direct payment by Westminster.  They are fooling themselves because I know the attitude of successive British Government to funding for the agricultural sector.</p><p>Another important development that is always laudable is the development of major food companies on an all-Ireland basis.  The programme has been given huge impetus since the late 1990s.  One can think of the main dairy producers.  In my own constituency there is Lakeland Dairies, the Town of Monaghan Co-Op Limited and LacPatrick.  They are all-Ireland companies that have sites on both sides of the Border.  As the witnesses have rightly pointed out, raw materials travel North and South.  There will be great difficulties if we have two regimes in terms of sanitary standards, etc.  We need to identify the challenges and create an awareness about them among the public at large.</p><p>Dr. McDonnell has made the good point, as did Mr. Mark Durkan in different fora that I have heard him speak in, that we must safeguard the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and  its workings.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of MPs in Westminster have not lost sleep about the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit.</p><p>Again, I thank the witnesses for their excellent contributions.</p></speech>

As I said at the outset it is very uncertain and unpredictable.  We just do not know where it will end up.<br/><br/>I agree that it is critical to preserve the fundamentals of the Good Friday Agreement.  As I said before, there is a lot of goodwill in Brussels.  Therefore, we have to bring to Brussels our concerns about preserving the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be helpful if we got agreement with the British Government in advance.<br/><br/>I am minded by what Deputy Smith has said.  Mr. Craig Oliver was in charge of Brexit communications in Number 10.  At the end of the campaign he wrote a book that was based on his diaries entitled <i>Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit</i>.  In the book he described the campaign carried out by the British Government to win a vote to remain but Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were not mentioned once.  That is the realty.  We have to play to our advantage but we need to know the playing field.  It would be useful if we ensured that the principles underling the Good Friday Agreement, in which the Europeans had a hand, formed part of the eventual outcome of the negotiations between the British and Irish.<br/><br/>Brexit is a political problem in Northern Ireland.  Some politicians and political parties in Northern Ireland were not necessarily pro-Brexit but now that the vote has been cast and the United Kingdom as a whole has voted for Brexit, they have rowed in behind it.  That means both Unionist parties, whereas the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in remain opposed.<br/><br/>On the transport issue, before Austria joined the EU it imposed a tax on European lorries crossing Austrian territory.  With Brexit it is possible that a tax will be imposed on Irish lorries, many of whom travel across British territory.  That is the sort of thing that should be pinned down in the negotiations.  Britain should be told that it cannot impose a tax or tariff.<br/><br/>It would be worthwhile for the committee to find out, through talking to people, what problems exist and have them ought to the attention of the Irish Government.  I have been out of government for a long time.  From my experience, I know that the Irish Government is capable, competent and committed to the future of this island.  The more it knows about the problems then the greater the possibility of finding solutions with its European partners that are not opposed to finding a solution to this particular problem of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

One is that we must have complete clarity of evidence setting out why this issue is so critically important to the future of this country and we need to pull together that evidence which will show that if we go down a particular road, it will have a particular consequence.  Second, and hand in hand with this, and this goes back to Deputy Breathnach's point, we have to come up with corresponding solutions or proposals for solutions.</p> <p>  As regards who is responsible, there is a wide range of responsibility.  The Government is responsible, as is this committee and other committees by the focus they are bringing to this issue, are responsible.  We need to get the wider community talking about how much this matters.  Some of this is being done through the All-Island Civic Dialogue forum, which met on 2 November and is meeting again on 17 February, and in the interim period a whole set of sectoral meetings have taken place.  The more we can get clarity of thought and clarity of proposed solutions, the better.  That is the basis for going forward.  Organisations like ourselves also have a responsibility in terms of the types of connections we have with other think tanks in Europe to hammer home these same points.  </p></speech>

I had to attend an address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Seanad and what I heard there did not instill much hope in me.</p> <p>  I wish to put matters in perspective and I apologise if I am going back over old ground.  A total of 10,905 Irish students are studying in the UK; 23% of our goods are exported to the UK, valued at &euro;26 billion; 41% of our agricultural produce, which is &euro;4 in every &euro;10, is exported to the UK; 35% of our food, beverage and tobacco products are exported to the UK, involving 150,000 jobs; and 45% of our basic metals, 35% of our leather and textile products and 85% of our dairy products are exported to the UK, on which exports 9,500 jobs depend.  A total of 47,200 people are employed in the transport industry and I heard from the witnesses that a tax might apply to trucks passing through the UK.  That scares the living hell out of me.  A total of 16,791 second hand cars were imported from Britain into this country last year.  All of that is about economics, money moving backwards and forward and all of the things that might be interfered with by tariffs.  Those of us who are old enough will remember what it was like to queue up at the Border and wait to get through it but such a queue will certainly not help our 47,200 jobs involved in our transport industry.  </p> <p>  A central problem is that we cannot have a bilateral conversation with the UK, our nearest trading neighbour, which probably takes the largest single amount of our goods and services, because the European Union says "No" to that.  Representatives of the Border Communities Against Brexit appeared before this committee a few weeks ago.  They gave us all the economic facts and figures as well but they cited one other element, namely, the rise of the old angst that existed between the two traditions in Northern Ireland, the rise of smuggling, criminality and all of that.  </p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith or Deputy Breathnach mentioned previous situations were people who wanted to go to mass on a Sunday have had to travel many more miles to get there because a big hole had to be blown up in the road that was closest to the church to stop people crossing unapproved roads.  When I consider all of this I find, having come from the Seanad where I heard what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade say - that Brussels understands and that our colleagues understand our problems - to be not very helpful.  Then I look at the UK Supreme Court ruling, on which we had a discussion earlier today, and I do not want to go into it because we will allocate some time to it, but it is safe to say at this stage that the Supreme Court ruling has placed the Good Friday Agreement in jeopardy.  For the short time I have been here listening to Mr. O'Ceallaigh and Mr. Arnold, they have probably given rise to even greater fears in me.  Their understanding of what is going on is clearly ahead of many people around here. </p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is what it is all about.  The rest of these things can be resolved through negotiations but when we consider the amount of things we have to negotiate, I think it will take 20 years to negotiate our way through what is here when we get down to the micro level.  The Good Friday Agreement is where the freedom of movement comes into play, were one can sit in one's car, drive to Belfast and not be stopped on the way.  That is the most important aspect.  </p> <p>  In terms of the political uncertainty, and I do not want to delve into or interfere in the politics of Northern Ireland, but for the first time in my life I was attacked on social media by a member of the other tradition, the Unionist tradition.  It is no secret around this table that I served in the British army and some of my Unionist friends, or those who would be of the Unionist persuasion, jumped to my defence.  Is that where we are headed?  When Mr. O'Ceallaigh made the point that there is no mention of Ireland or Northern Ireland in some of the documentation coming out of Westminster, that gives me a fair idea of where we are going.  The worst form of nationalism is driving Brexit.  I will understand if Mr. O'Ceallaigh does not want to comment on that but, from my perspective, that is the way it looks.  It looks as if the UK is pandering to a particular mindset.  In so doing, is it possible that the UK would chuck Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement onto the pyre of past interests?  </p> <p>  There is a desperate need for this committee to have people like Mr. Arnold and Mr. O'Ceallaigh advising it.  They are people with independent minds who can come in here and give it to us straight.  They spoke about cross-Border institutions and in their documentation they see no real reason that should change.  However, it will change if Article 50 is triggered without legislation in place to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  There will be no cross-Border institutions and there will be no requirement for them because there will be no Good Friday Agreement.  I am not sure that we are going the right way here.  They may not feel comfortable commenting on this but I believe we need a single point of contact in this country dealing with Brexit.  We need a senior Minister, somebody with an economic background, perhaps the Minister, Deputy Bruton, or somebody else, appointed to oversee Brexit.  The UK has appointed somebody and we need somebody.  </p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses about dealing with our friends in Europe.  We have got to be over there talking to them all the time.  Colleagues of mine have been over there and I have been there.  I have brought up the unique Irish problem and the answer I have got was at best benign.  I brought up the unique Irish problem at a conference at which I was the only speaker from Ireland and when I did so the chair thanked me for my input and said we need to move on to discuss the concept of a European army.  That concept throws one other constitutional problem at our feet, namely, our total opposition to being involved in any sort of a European army.</p></speech>

They have insight which probably leaves them better qualified at foresight than nearly anybody else might be on this very uncertain and uncharted situation in which we find ourselves.</p><p>The witnesses have covered a number of points with regard to the sectoral impacts.  Those points have been very well brought out.  As I said at a previous meeting, this is an antidote to many people's assumption that there will be a crock of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow for farmers and others in the North.</p><p> I would like to ask the witnesses about some of the issues we will face as we go forward.  They recognise that there are big challenges and uncertainties.  They have said that some working opportunities may emerge from some of the channels for co-operation and engagement that exist.</p><p> My first question relates to the working of strand 2 of the Agreement.  It should not be underestimated that when negotiations took place in the aftermath of the Agreement regarding what a North-South body should be - the Agreement itself provided that there would be at least six implementation bodies - the political reality was that there was Unionist resistance to bodies having any kind of meaningful scope, any kind of mission or any possibility for expansion.  The test rule for them was that it had to be co-operation of purely mutual interest that would be happening anyway.</p><p> It is clear when one examines the main business of most of the implementation bodies that they are focused on EU funding or on compliance with EU regulations.  The work of the Special EU Programmes Body and Waterways Ireland relates to directives and the management of funding.  InterTrade Ireland is probably the most market-facing of the bodies.  Much of what it does is about raising awareness of European challenge funds and other innovative opportunities and areas of co-operation.  Much of the work of the Food Safety Promotion Board relates to compliance.  Obviously, the Loughs Agency builds on a previous model.  Much of its work involves environmental directives and other common issues.  While it might be distinctive to hear certain phrases, a large part of the cover for much of the work of the Language Body is in the context of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.</p><p> If we do not have the commonality of interest, the funding or the compliance questions provided by the EU, what will we have in terms of strand 2 and the working arrangements under strand 2?  We will be talking about very thin fillings in the strand 2 sandwich.  That will become a key political issue because people will say the Agreement is not working in the same terms they expected.  That is quite apart from the failure of the Agreement to develop beyond those six bodies, which had their budgets cut in the name of austerity a few years ago and were subject to value for money tests as a result of the St. Andrews review.</p><p> The other side of the St. Andrews Agreement was the promise that there could be new areas of co-operation.  It was suggested that the reviews could look at other work, but nothing has ever developed from that.  When many of us look at this, we say we cannot be complacent and we are not reassured by those who suggest everything will work out and will be taken forward in a post-Brexit situation.  Very little has happened.  Strand 2 has been run low and has stayed slow for a long time now.  It is hard to see how this would not continue after Brexit.  That is one of the reasons this issue and other Brexit issues will loom much larger than many people realise when negotiations take place after the election.  All of these issues might not be resolved in time for the formation of an executive within the deadline.  They might be part of a wider negotiation, possibly using some of the review mechanisms under the Agreement.</p><p> I note what has been said about strand 3 and the British-Irish Council.  It is probable that there are a number of areas in which it might be easier to engage Whitehall's interest in the potential for co-operation and engagement.  When Whitehall departments are not sending as many officials to various meetings in Brussels and elsewhere, they might well have more time to look at other potential forms of co-operation.  Of course that raises a political tension that arose when the Agreement was being negotiated.  Some people did not want strand 2 to exist at all.  They said it should be a mere subset of strand 3.  This opportunity brings potential political tension with it.</p><p> It has been suggested that the Commission would have a strong interest in being concerned not to lose the advantages that have accrued over the process.  I think that is a huge asset for us in the time ahead.  The problem is that it is not clear that the degrees of will and interest that exist and will continue to exist on the part of the Irish Government are understood or appreciated by the British Government or by some of the parties in the North.</p><p> The best opportunity to bring this reality to the situation is to say that some European funds could continue to flow on the island of Ireland on a cross-Border basis, with the North enjoying something of a lean-to status, in operational terms, with the South.  That is what many of us want to see when we talk about special status.  It relates to Single Market and customs arrangements as well.  It is a question of allowing the North to have this sort of status.  Other people have touched on this aspect of the matter in their commentary on the immigration question.  It has been suggested that these matters should be considered in the context of the island of Ireland, rather than focusing on the divide within the island.</p><p> As Mr. &Oacute; Ceallaigh has said, the question of being able to identify and dispense European funding will need to be addressed in the negotiations.  We cannot assume it will be taken care of afterwards.  If there is anything we can take out of this week's Supreme Court ruling, it is that one cannot rely on the political understanding one has unless one builds it into legislation and actual negotiated treaties.  That is the signal warning that comes from the Supreme Court ruling.  We have to address these issues now in the context of the wider negotiations.</p><p> I would like to speak about the possibility of making specific provision in any new UK-EU treaty for the Good Friday Agreement in respect of the constitutional question.  If we ensure that in the event of a referendum on unity, there is no question mark over Northern Ireland's immediate access as part of a united Ireland to the EU, we could prevent the sorts of questions that arose in Scotland from being used to create an external impediment to the democratic potential for unity.  If the North had such a differentiated status in a UK-EU treaty, that could create the ambit for the North being able to avail of access to EU funding that would probably come via the Irish Government and the strand 2 mechanisms of the Agreement, rather than coming through the UK in the previous way.</p><p> If this possible means of securing EU funds were provided for, it is likely that the question of matching funding would arise.  Perhaps this could be considered in the negotiations that should happen between the British and Irish Governments.  I take the point that some people have made about the supposed rubric that there cannot be bilateral negotiations.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on sovereign matters.  I do not see why it cannot be used in this context to deal with some of these issues.</p></speech>

The Irish Government is already repaying the loan from 2011 in line with its commitment to do so.  Perhaps there could be an understanding that some of those moneys, along with matching funding, could be earmarked and streamed to continue to support cross-Border investment in the style we have had from European funding, not just on a North-South basis but possibly to support some east-west work as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Arnold" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017012600002#O00100"><p>When we look back over the decades, if someone had said in 1988 which was a difficult year that in ten years we would have something of the complexity and sophistication of the Good Friday Agreement, many would not have believed it.  We have a body of, if one likes, creative political possibilities built into it and while perhaps much of it still unrealised, it is still a framework within which to move forward.  What Mr. Durkan said about the possibilities presented by strand 2 which are yet to be realised may be very relevant.  Our starting point must be that the European Union sees the creation of a framework for an agreement and the delivery of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent events as important achievements not to be gone back on.  That is the political context in which we consider how we should deal with the remarkably difficult Brexit challenge.</p> <p>  There is comment in the press on whether we are going about this in the right way and if it is being taken seriously enough at a national level.  My sense is that the answer is "Yes".  I think there is a high level of commitment at the centre of both the Government and the Civil Service, although it may not be seen adequately.  One has to realise that the big decisions will ultimately be taken at head of Government level.  Therefore, the Brexit Minister has to be the Taoiseach and strategic thinking must be brought to bear to reflect how important the issue is.  However, it cannot be left to the Government alone.  The parliamentary system and wider civil society have important roles to play.  We all have a responsibility.  This comes back to the point about the evidence of the potential impact and the solutions to deal with it.</p></speech>

The British will argue for their interests which it will try to protect and advance.  On the other side, we will have the European Union.  During the course of the discussion many of the Irish and Northern Irish interests within the framework of the Good Friday Agremeent have been expressed.  They can be protected in the negotiations, but civil society, the committee and people such as us have to ensure those conducting the negotiations - those representing the European Union - are made aware of these concerns through the Government and Irish public servants.  I agree fully with Mr. Arnold.  The Government is and has been on top of this for a long time, although it is not necessarily speaking very much in public, which is understandable.  However, I do not think we can be complacent.  This is probably the biggest issue that has faced the country for a long time, but we have been successful.  Think of where we were 40 years ago and where we are now.  We can protect our interests.</p> <p>  While I accept fully that the Brexit vote, in large measure, was an expression of English and perhaps Welsh nationalism, just as I accept the Trump vote in the United States expressed a certain American nationalism, I do not detect any evidence in London that anyone wants to damage the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not think the British want to return to direct rule.  No one I know in London wants to go back to where we were 20 or 30 years ago.  There is an opportunity for people like those on the committee who support the Good Friday Agreement.  Some of the ideas Mr. Durkan proposed are well worth keeping on the table.</p></speech>

It has been taken as true that progression into a job is a sure way of improving one&rsquo;s economic and social status.</p><p>If that is to continue to be the case, the State must intervene in the labour market to ensure that work pays in all cases.</p><p> The precise number of employees on precarious contracts in Ireland is unknown.  While the precise numbers of employers offering precarious contracts here is not available, some estimates can be gleaned from statistics compiled by the CSO.  Employees on precarious contracts are likely to be a significant component of the group categorised as underemployed.  Ireland has the second highest level of underemployment in the EU, after Spain.  A total of 7.4% of employees here report seeking additional hours while the EU average is 4.4%.  Since the third quarter of 2008, the first year for which Ireland has data, the number of underemployed persons has increased by 50.5%  This compares to a growth of 31.9% across the EU during this period.  This problem is not confined to the fringes of the job market or to low-paid sectors.  Individuals on precarious contracts work in all sectors and in occupations across the pay and earning spectrum.  I make that point because there should be a pull factor in activation.  When people talk about activation, they tend to talk only about the push factor but there should also be a pull factor in a properly functioning labour market, where people are drawn into that market by the attractive proposition that work pays.  </p><p> I wish to draw the committee's attention to the role of apprenticeships in delivering a smooth transition to the labour market which should not be ignored.  Apprenticeships are in the process of expanding beyond their traditional and, overwhelmingly, male roles.  There is an opportunity here for the new apprenticeship system to offer employment opportunities at levels 6 to 9 on the national framework of qualifications.  The national apprenticeship advisory committee, with its tripartite structure, facilitates an engagement on the wages and conditions attaching to proposed new apprenticeships.</p><p> On the issue of Brexit, the only certainty is uncertainty.  There may well be inflows into the labour market from the UK from Irish people returning and also from eastern European migrants who are uncertain about their future in Britain, especially in England, and who may well have family links in Ireland.  Most immigrants have networks, as we Irish know only too well.  People may be lifting the phone to find out how things are in Ireland compared to Nottingham, for example.  This may well mean that those who are distant from the labour market will become more distant.  There is also the issue of the sectoral balance of jobs.  Trader jobs in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC,  will not replace factory-floor jobs in the food industry in the Border, midland and western, BMW, region.</p><p> In focusing on job quality, one blot on the landscape is the abuse of internships.  In some sectors, such as arts and the media, exploitative practices are becoming a normal entry route.  By this I mean unpaid internships.  The State should not be encouraging such practices and it is in this context that we welcome the decision to terminate JobBridge.  If it is felt necessary by the State to subsidise employment, it should be regular employment which attract full rights under labour law from day one and which is targeted at particular groups in the labour market.  The prospect of a scheme to replace JobBridge should be viewed with great caution.  Any such scheme should have adequate and enforceable measures against displacement.  The need for a subsidised work experience scheme is questionable given that the changed economic context which has shifted from high unemployment to relatively buoyant conditions.  In the second quarter of 2016, the youth unemployment rate in the 16 to 24 year old category had dropped to 16.5% and the overall rate was 9.1%.</p><p> My colleague, Ms Lorraine Mulligan will take over now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1237" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Mulligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#E00200"><p>I will go into a little more detail on JobBridge and how we should view that scheme at the current juncture, given the changed circumstances.  While the Indecon report points to high progression rates from JobBridge, it must be noted that 24.7% of survey respondents gained employment in a different sector to the one in which they undertook their placement.  This may indicate that some had to divert from their preferred career paths, which may be difficult to undo.  That is an important consideration in the current climate.<br/><br/>The proposed new scheme recognises the need for employers to contribute to its financial cost.  This is to address one of the findings from the Indecon evaluation in 2016 which reads as follows:</p><blockquote>As is common in many labour market activation schemes, the counterfactual impact evaluation suggests that most of the benefits in terms of employment outcomes would have occurred in the absence of the Scheme.  In other words, high levels of deadweight exist.  There is also evidence of some level of displacement in a minority of cases.  </blockquote> <p>The potential for deadweight and displacement remains a cause for concern, particularly given that self-reporting by employers may lead to underestimation.  While the magnitude of risk may be less apparent at a macroeconomic level, the dynamics of job displacement can be very detrimental in individual cases.</p><p>For example, jobseekers who had previously been in employment found themselves priced out of applying for positions that would otherwise have been suitable and that would have normally attracted an industry level of pay but which were instead filled under the JobBridge scheme.</p><p> The proposed new JobBridge scheme recognises the need for a higher level of payment for participants pegged at the minimum wage level.  However, this does act to protect industry norms in many cases.  The joint labour committee system provides an alternative and well-suited system for managing the question of work experience, training, entry level rates, etc.  The use of this system across a range of sectors should be promoted and incentivised rather than undermined by State policy.  Currently, employers in the hotels sector are, in effect, vetoing the State's system for collective bargaining by refusing to negotiate a sectoral agreement on pay and conditions.  At the same time, the hospitality industry enjoys a reduced VAT rate while the State props up low-pay through the family income supplement payment.  The introduction of a new JobBridge scheme would only provide a further opportunity for employers in low-paid sectors to dampen wage outcomes.</p><p> The proposal for a new JobBridge scheme does not adequately deal with its potential negative effects.  Despite the promise of tougher inspections, there is no mechanism to address the fact that some sectors are more prone to exploitation and low-quality employment.  The Indecon report from 2016 found that 33% of survey respondents considered that their placements did not provide satisfactory job training and work experience opportunities.  Rather than being paid the normal job rate, however, they worked at a sub-minimum wage level for 30 to 40 hours per week for six to nine months without having a quality experience.   It is already difficult for low-paid workers to manage but the prospect of interns on a new JobBridge scheme at minimum wage may undermine the potential for pay progression among ordinary employees.  In addition, the scheme does not build in the importance of career progression so that, rather than being a stepping stone, it is a treadmill.  All workers should be able to benefit from pay rates that are set at company or sectoral level above the minimum rate and interns should not be excluded from this.  Irish workers in the hospitality sector are low-paid by European standards and this should not be reinforced by an improperly designed new JobBridge scheme.</p><p> The argument has been made that it is difficult to find employment without having experience and that a work experience placement can bridge this gap.  However, there are demonstrable skills shortages in many areas of the Irish economy, such as ICT.  This provides an incentive for employers to take on graduates without experience and to provide their own on-the-job training.  A new JobBridge scheme would seem to be an unwarranted subsidy to employers in this situation.  Nor is a new JobBridge scheme necessarily an answer for targeting participants with a low level of education and, or, other social disadvantages given that the sectors they may be directed to can be prone to low-pay and vulnerable to exploitation.  In order to meet the complex needs of these clients, it would be better for the Department of Social Protection to engage directly with employers through its local Intreo offices to seek suitable work placements if appropriate.  In some circumstances, it may be more beneficial to prioritise education, vocational training or apprenticeships in order to provide the basis for sustainable employment.</p><p> The need for intensive and one-on-one engagement with young people was underlined in the Ireland's Youth Guarantee implementation plan.  This was to provide young people aged 18 to 24 years who had been unemployed for four months or more with an offer of work or alternatively a quality offer of training, education or work experience.  The intention was for Intreo office staff to prioritise young people and there were penalties attached to those in receipt of benefits for non-engagement.  The JobBridge scheme was one of the options under the plan, among others such as Momentum, JobPlus and the back-to-education allowance.  While the Ballymun pilot scheme was well-resourced, there are significant question marks about the roll-out of the Youth Guarantee, in particular regarding the capacity at local level to deliver an intensive level of support.  A progress report or evaluation of the implementation plan is urgently required in order to assess its effectiveness and chart a way forward.</p><p>Research on the effect of reductions introduced to the unemployed benefit rates for young people, commissioned by the Department through the Labour Market Council, has yet to emerge.  Again, this is vital information that should be brought forward at the earliest opportunity so that we can draw the necessary policy lessons and conclusions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#G00300"><p>I do not propose to read the submission which we sent to the committee as it is rather lengthy.  However, I would like to comment on some of the statistics provided in it. </p> <p>  In regard to long-term unemployment, in a lot of the public discourse there has been a presumption that long-term unemployment is primarily an issue for young people but it is in fact an issue for people of every age.  Access to employment is particularly difficult for those who live in areas where there has been less employment, less economic development and where there are many issues associated with social exclusion.  It is also an issue that is raised with us by people who are older, many of whom had good jobs before the crisis or were employers and now find themselves, because of their age and a skill mismatch or not, unable to access employment.  There are a range of challenges facing us in this area as we move forward.</p> <p>  We have also included in our submission a snap-shot of activation programmes.  The month of November is the most recent in respect of which data is available and so we have reviewed the two-year period from November last to 2008.  Programmes such as T&uacute;s, JobBridge and Gateway did not exist then.  The first statistics for T&uacute;s and JobBridge were only seen in November 2012 and for Gateway in 2014.  What we found interesting is how the back-to-work enterprise allowance has grown over that period.  We would be conscious that for many unemployed people, be it because of age, geographical or other forms of discrimination, self employment can be an option.  Further supports and links to the wider enterprise supports available would be a welcome development.</p> <p>  Community employment has remained at in or around the 22,000 mark.  It plays a critical role.  For many people it is the only access point to the labour market.  Following on from a point made earlier about JobBridge, it is dealt with on the Department's website under the heading "stepping stones".  Our concern is that often progression from JobBridge into the wider labour market is not at a rate we would like to see.  Also, in terms of the age profile, it tends to be older unemployed people who participate in JobBridge.  An issue that is constantly raised with us by older unemployed people is whether Ireland ever intends to address the issue of ageism in the labour market or if people who are older and unemployed are to be only referred into programmes such as community unemployment.  This is an issue on which there is need for serious reflection and in respect of which we need to make serious headway. </p> <p>  Another issue of concern for us is the figures on full-time training.  In November 2008, there were over 10,000 people on specific skills training.  According to the most recent figures available there are now only over 7,000 people in training.  The CSO data for the "training in school" figure, which is for September, indicates that in-take was the lowest ever, which is very striking.  We are hearing all the time from commentators, employers and so on that there is a skills gap.  It is worrying that up-take is falling in one of the programmes that in the past had a good track record in terms of addressing skills gaps and giving people skills that were marketable.  Likewise, take-up in terms of the back-to-education allowance is falling back to the figures of the pre-crisis period, despite the fact it was expanded a lot during the crisis.  Of concern to us are the findings of the ESRI report and the huge challenges this throws up.  Given the strong relationship between educational status, the inference is that if a person does not attain a good educational status the first time around even though he or she may do so the second time around it may not be to his or benefit.  That is a very serious concern for us.  </p> <p>  In regard to the headings used throughout the report, we have used the ones that are the three strategic objectives of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>We have used them for two reasons.  We feel the first one, putting the client at the centre of services and policies, is absolutely critical.  We have concerns as to whether that is happening.  The system has become increasingly more directive.  The feedback we are getting is that people feel they are being told to go on things rather than being able to make informed decisions about their future.  They are being directed on to programmes such as T&uacute;s, Gateway or community employment while perhaps not getting the opportunity to re-educate.  They may be sent on a re-education or training programme that may not be suitable for them and somebody else might have really welcomed that opportunity.</p><p> That is the challenge.  With all the change that is in the system, there is that challenge to get that matching piece right, taking the time when people are engaged both initially and subsequently to get to know the skills and experience they have, what opportunities are available and what needs to happen now to support that person to get into a decent and sustainable job.  It is in everybody's interest that we get people into decent and sustainable jobs.  Clearly it is in the interests of the individuals and that of their family and community.  It is also in the State's interest.  If we get more people into better, decent and sustainable jobs, there would be less recourse to in-work supports such as FIS.  It is really important to get that piece right and try to build the services around people who are unemployed and others of working age who are looking for work and looking for supports in trying to find work.</p><p> Another objective of the Department is to drive cost, efficiency and effectiveness.  We changed that slightly to pursue greater equality, efficiency and effectiveness.  We need a system that is more effective and engaging with people, and that meets their needs in ensuring there is good local knowledge in the local Intreo office and other aspects of the employment service, which include the local employment service, employability services, JobPath and programmes like the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  We need to get a better system and that leads to better use of resources and better outcomes for everybody.  It is critical that equality and social inclusion principles are built in at the heart of that.  We need to try to meet the needs of people, including those who are unemployed, parenting alone, living with a disability or whatever.</p><p> We would like to see some practical steps addressed.  For example, people on jobseeker's payment can take up work for up to 13 weeks or move into education or training and their payment is put on hold.  That is not broadcast well by the Department.  The only place it is mentioned on its website is on the frequently asked questions, question No. 20, on the jobseeker's page.  Someone would need to know it is there in order to find it in the first place.  That is something the Department should promote because it could make a big difference to people who live in areas where there is seasonal work or Christmas work.  One of the best forms of activation is supporting people to be able to take up work, build up their curricula vitae and their contacts so that they can find employment.</p><p> Likewise we are conscious that if people who have been unemployed for a long time and whose only income is their welfare payment go from a weekly support to a job with a two-weekly or monthly payment, it can give rise to an income gap.  There is a mechanism through the supplementary allowance system called "payment pending wages" that the State could use.  It would be a small investment but could make a huge difference to a person taking that step, particularly if he or she has family and is concerned over whether they will be able to provide over that period.  It is a mechanism that could be used in a more constructive way.</p><p> The target is to get unemployment down to 6% by 2020.  All going well we may achieve that but if we do, it still leaves many people who will meet the official unemployment definition, which is they genuinely have been seeking work in recent weeks and are in a position to take up work in the coming weeks.</p><p>We are aware that there are many people who, for various reasons, have lost heart trying to find work, do not answer "Yes" to one or other of those questions or may have caring responsibilities and believe it will take them longer to resolve those issues if they find a job.  They may face logistical difficulties in getting from where they live to the location of the potential job.  Initially, they may not be in a position to provide their own transport.  There are a range of reasons people do not answer "Yes" to those two questions.  The official unemployment figure captures a particular picture, but it does not necessarily capture everybody.</p><p> In terms of people of working age on other payments, because of the way Intreo was designed and rolled out at the time of crisis, the system now tends to slot them in rather than consider a way to design it to ensure it is more inclusive.  In terms of reaching that target, with Brexit and other concerns that could be an even bigger challenge but there is also a real danger that many people will be left where they are now and that Ireland will grow and prosper but they may be left behind and not get a look in.  This time around, we must ensure we do not leave people behind or with a sense that they have been parked in their local communities because they are a Traveller, parenting alone or have a disability.  This time around, we must ensure that we address those issues.</p><p> From that point of view, developing staff structures and processes that have the capacity to provide services for people from a variety of backgrounds with a variety of issues is critical.  In terms of the way the Department meets its obligations under section 42(1) of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, which is the positive duty now placed on public bodies to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and persons to whom it provides services, and protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it provides services, it is critical that that is done well.</p><p> From our perspective, it is important that a new socio-economic ground is introduced to the equality legislation to capture and address the discrimination many unemployed people experience.  The CSO report of some years ago, which was based on the quarterly national household survey, was striking in that the second highest rate of discrimination identified was of people who were unemployed.  That was identified because the survey captured people's principal economic status.  We must address that issue and ensure that this positive development also meets the needs and addresses the issues facing people who are unemployed.</p><p> Brexit could be both a plus and a minus at the same time.  We could see many job losses but we could also see job gains depending on how some of that works out but it is more than likely they will be at two different ends of the labour market and require very different skill sets.  How do we address that and, in particular, ensure that those currently distanced from the labour market do not find themselves even more distanced from that market as it emerges?  There is a target in the programme for Government to create an additional 200,000 jobs, of which 135,000 will be outside Dublin.  There is a target to get the unemployment rate to within 1% of the national rate.  When we consider the range of issues facing different parts of the State, meeting that will be particularly challenging.  We know from feedback we get from both individual members and affiliates working throughout the country that the creation and maintenance of decent, sustainable jobs in their areas is critical.</p><p> In that regard, the way policy programmes such as Pathways to Work fit in alongside the Action Plan for Jobs and the Action Plan for Education is critical.  We would be anxious to hear from a range of providers and policy makers in the education sector that the referrals to education and training courses are not being made from employment services under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  Given that the skills issue has been identified by so many people, that is something we need to get right.  Otherwise, we would be concerned that even if all the fears about what is happening in the United States and in Britain do not come to pass, there still will be significant employment and social inclusion challenges facing unemployed people.  That is an issue we must ensure we address well.</p><p> It is critical that active inclusion is built into the way policy making is designed and implemented, that services are person-centred for everybody of working age and that they are proactive and supportive.</p><p>It is also important that there is a proactive and full provision of information in order that people can make informed choices.  In addition there must be flexibility in the system to facilitate participation.  One issue of which I am sure the committee is aware is in respect of employment programmes.  At one stage pre-crisis there was a real attempt to make sure that the terms and conditions that were associated with community employment applied across all programmes, particularly in terms of access to them and then with the crisis there tended to be a focus just on jobseeker's payments.  One of the issues that has been raised with us is the difficulty facing people coming out of prison, for example, for whom perhaps a T&uacute;s programme would be an option.  It is important that some of the anomalies that have arisen are addressed so that the system is inclusive of everyone who needs support.</p><p> Supportive services that are needed to help people to reskill include the provision of adequate and affordable child care and transport.  There is also a need for good integration across Departments and agencies.  Labour market activation will not produce the outcomes we would like to see unless there is good engagement between the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department with responsibility for community and local government, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p> Employment programmes have an important role to play but we would like to see better outcomes from them in terms of access to the wider labour market and to ensure that they are a stepping stone for people.  It is important that positive duty is incorporated and there is active inclusion at the heart of the system.  We must be realistic about the resources required to realise those aims.  We must ensure the staff providing the services in the State sector, the voluntary sector and the private, for-profit sector, are working from a certain ethos and have the resources to provide them and ensure we get better outcomes for everybody.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#K00500"><p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on what continues to be a critical issue for the business sector from both an economic and social perspective.  The emphasis may change, depending on the economic cycle.  During the depths of the recession, there were compelling social inclusion imperatives to keep as many people attached to the labour market as possible.  As the economy recovers, the labour market has tightened and skills shortages are emerging.  However, before looking at some of the emerging challenges, it is important to acknowledge the achievements to date, which have been considerable.  The headline figures are encouraging.  Unemployment has fallen from more than 15% to 7.2%.  The most critical metric, long-term unemployment, has fallen from 9.5% to 4.5% and the youth unemployment rate has more than halved.</p> <p>  In any discussion about labour activation, there will be a debate about cause and effect.  How much of the reduction in unemployment can be attributed to the general economic recovery and how much to well designed activation policies?  Without wishing to be too predictable, it is important to remember that the Government does not create jobs, it is business that does.  Labour market recovery is more likely to continue in a business environment that supports competitiveness.  However, Government policy has a major impact on the conditions which are conducive to firms rehiring and on the quality of education and skills of those seeking employment.  The Government must also ensure that there is a strong incentive to work and that the best approach is taken to assist and upskill those who are looking for work.  We have made significant progress on activation.</p><p>I recall the mid-1990s when long-term unemployment remained obstinately high despite very high growth figures.  There was much discussion in those days about jobless growth.  In 1995, when the economy was growing at 6%, the long-term unemployment rate was over 9%, twice the level it is today, so we have learned a great deal about activation.  However, the figures are still too high.  Despite the improved labour market, long-term unemployment of over three years, youth unemployment, inter-generational jobless households and unemployment among people with disabilities all remain serious concerns.</p><p> The challenge is multi-faceted, so I will outline four priorities: the consolidation of existing reforms; the need to have an increased emphasis on programme evaluation; the need to continue examining employer engagement; the development of relevant skills.  On the first priority of consolidation of existing reforms, there have been significant improvements in the delivery of employment and activation services since the Pathways to Work strategy was introduced in 2012.  The implementation of new engagement processes, jobseeker profiling, the establishment of an employer relations division, a reduced payment regime for people who do not engage with the system and the back to work family dividend are all positive developments.  Employers are also well disposed to the JobPath contracted employment service which supplements Intreo in delivering support to the long-term unemployed.</p><p> We welcome the overall philosophy of Pathways to Work, which is based on a social contract to ensure that all parties understand that with rights come responsibilities.  We believe that is the correct one.  However, as always, there remains the challenge of translating the rhetoric we see in the strategies and policy documents into a reality for people who engage with the services.  Although the delivery has improved significantly, there are still inconsistencies in the quality of service.  There should be a particular emphasis on ensuring that Intreo staff have the capacity, competence and culture to deliver services that meet the needs of their clients.</p><p> We must also develop a culture of constant evaluation.  The introduction of more labour market-facing jobseeker services and programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus, Springboard, ICT skills conversion programmes and Momentum has been positive.  However, there is a plethora of other training and activation schemes for which we have very little outcomes-based data.  In the few instances we have published evaluations, the results are not encouraging.  For example, the Economic and Social Research Institute study on the back to education allowance scheme, which Br&iacute;d O'Brien mentioned, found that the employment prospects of people who used the scheme to undertake long-term training courses were significantly reduced, even four or five years after completing the programmes.</p><p> Ironically, where there was an independent evaluation of a scheme that showed very strong employment progression, JobBridge, we closed the scheme.  The Indecon review of JobBridge showed that 79% of candidates were employed directly and 64% are still in employment.  Matched against a control group, an unemployed person had a 32% better chance of getting employment and sustaining it after going on JobBridge.  Despite the way it has been characterised this morning, the Indecon report was overwhelmingly positive.  Where there were significant dissatisfaction levels they were around the payment issue, unsurprisingly.  Undoubtedly we need a reformed work experience programme that matches the new economic environment.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce a replacement.  However, I am concerned about the vacuum that has been created with the closure of JobBridge and the delay in establishing a replacement.  That should be expedited.</p><p> As an aside, the amount of oxygen taken up by JobBridge is extraordinary.  It appears to be more of an ideological debate than anything else.</p><p>At its height, JobBridge only ever had a maximum of 7,000 candidates.  At the time it was closed, the number was 3,390.  At its height, it represented less than 5% of all people on work activation programmes.  It is a tiny fraction of this activity yet it seems to be a bit of a lightning rod for ideological debate.  It is important to keep in perspective what was a very positive experience for a relatively small number of people. </p><p> I will turn to the issue of employer engagement because an effective activation policy requires a significant level of engagement with business to identify opportunities for jobseekers and promote the recruitment of people who are on the live register.  The structure of Irish business, which has a large number of small employers and a relatively small number of large companies that have the resources to engage with the many State agencies, makes this a challenge.  Intreo is also competing with many other avenues of recruitment, including staff referrals, private recruitment agencies and online services.  Therefore, we should ensure it has the staff and resources to develop this important work and that the Intreo office will be the first destination for employers looking to hire.  </p><p> In respect of training and employability skills, I followed some of the committee's debates around whether the approach to labour activation should be job first or education first.  We heard echoes of that again this morning.  I believe the response is determined by individual circumstances and is not a binary decision.  There is a need to ensure that the unemployed are matched appropriately with upskilling.  There is a sizeable cohort of very low-skilled unemployed people who are distant from the labour market and who need specialist interventions within education and training provision.  The low-skilled can become trapped in insecure employment punctuated by spells of unemployment in the absence of upskilling opportunities, while previous negative educational experiences, lack of awareness of the opportunities and benefits of education and lack of familiar role models may all act to dissuade individuals from engaging in upskilling.  This is why guidance is such a critical component.  As Ms O'Brien mentioned earlier, close and formal collaboration between Intreo offices and education and training boards in guiding the unemployed to effective training or work placement opportunities is critical.  I am aware that protocols are in place but I am not convinced that a systematic integrated service is being delivered in all areas.  On this point, we would agree with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  The principles that should guide our education and training strategy have been well documented in lots of previous reports.  They are flexibility and responsiveness in delivery, robust evaluation of outcomes based on ongoing collection and assessment of data, developing and adapting courses that meet the skills needs of local and regional employers, allocation of resources to the most effective elements of education and training in helping the unemployed, meeting skills needs and continuing to provide a pathway to work for school leavers.  These have been acknowledged in the national skills strategy and the Action Plan for Education.  The establishment of the regional skills councils, in which Intreo will, hopefully, play a significant role, will also help to bring employers together with all the local stakeholders in what can be a very crowded space.</p><p> We would also like to place a particular emphasis on developing what we call employability skills.  IBEC's research has consistently shown that in recruiting people for entry-level positions, employers may not require a lot of hard skills and qualifications.  However, they want evidence that candidates have the attitudes and soft skills that will enable them to learn what the job entails, adapt to the company culture and get on with their colleagues.  On the last occasion that we asked our members to indicate the level of importance they attached to each of ten attributes when recruiting for entry-level jobs, 75% described work attitude as very important.  This was more than double the weighting attached to the second and third attributes.  In follow-up focus groups, companies told us that they are willing to arrange for or supply any specific training required once the requisite willingness to learn and adaptability are present.</p><p>This an important message for our guidance and training services.</p><p> I wish to conclude with a comment on how we can ensure our labour activation policies can adapt to an uncertain future and the inevitable shocks imposed on economies.  Recently, in the United States and United Kingdom, we have seen a dramatic manifestation of concerns about outsourcing and relocation, increased income inequality, automation and gaps between skilled and unskilled workers.  To meet these challenges we need new forms of flexibility and security for individuals and companies.  Individuals need employment rather than job security, as fewer people will have the same job for life.  Companies need to be able to adapt their workforce to meet changes in economic conditions.  They should be able to recruit staff with a better skills match who will be more productive and adaptable, leading to greater innovation and competitiveness.</p><p> More than a decade ago the European Commission promoted the concept of "flexicurity", an integrated strategy to enhance, at the same time, flexibility and security in the labour market.  Unfortunately, the strategy was overtaken by the recession and we heard very little about it.  It should be revisited.  There are four main policy components to flexicurity, namely, flexible and reliable contractual arrangements from the perspective of the employer and the employee; comprehensive lifelong learning strategies to ensure the continual adaptability and employability of workers, particularly the most vulnerable; effective labour market policies that help people to cope with rapid change, reduce unemployment periods and ease the transition to new jobs; and modern social security systems that provide adequate income support, encourage employment and facilitate labour market mobility.  While we have certainly made some progress under all of these headings, if we hope to fulfil our commitments to growth, job creation and social cohesion, we need to create a situation in which security and flexibility can reinforce each other.</p><p> I again thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to present the business perspective on this important issue.  I will be pleased to address questions members may have.</p></speech>

We do not have sufficient data to tackle this issue which can also have a geographical dimension.  What are the delegates views on this issue?</p> <p>  Age discrimination is evident as we emerge from the recession and will become a major issue.  Age fear is also an issue, by which I mean someone in his or her 30s will not necessarily want to employ someone aged 45 years or more because he or she will have much more experience of life and employment than the employer.  We need to break down this barrier.</p> <p>  Of the six jobs I have had in my career, only two are still available.  I started off in flour milling and the production of animal feed.  All flour mills have closed.  I was also a postman, an occupation that is about to go by the wayside, and later worked as a telephone technician, a job that has completely changed.  We must tie together lifelong learning and sustainable employment because someone leaving college, university or school today will probably have at least six careers.  </p> <p>  On the issue of constant reassessment, what was good during the recession is not necessarily good now.  This applies to the VAT rate applicable to the hospitality sector, which results in the State forgoing revenue of more than &euro;300 million each year.  We must ensure we get bang for our buck, which means equality of employment and a return to the market.  We are fast approaching the point where we should consider winding down this measure and investing the &euro;300 million in tax forgone in another area.  I ask the delegates to comment on this.</p><p>We always need to keep on reassessing what we are doing and whether it is right.</p><p> There were a number of activations measures and we can look at community employment, T&uacute;s and Gateway schemes.  They are quite relevant and were successful during the recession.  There is a possibility we should revisit those.  Community employment was originally set up by a former Deputy, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, going back to the 1980s and it has changed and moved.  I am interested in the number of people in community employment and who have real jobs.  We should reassess what is real work and what is training to move on.  That is why I have lumped community employment with T&uacute;s and Gateway, as T&uacute;s has no training element and it was purely to keep people connected with employment and carrying out useful functions.</p><p> JobBridge and JobsPlus need to be considered together.  JobsPlus is an incentive to an employer to take somebody on.  Perhaps we should look at redesigning that area and the incentive with the training.  There is the possibility that somebody who is long-term unemployed will not be taken on.  There must be recognition that people have challenges in getting employment and the employer has challenges relating to training and experience.  JobsPlus was a cash incentive targeting that area.  Maybe that should be expanded.  I have looked at the Economic and Social Research Institute report and its examination of back-to-education matters.  In some ways during the recession, it was about trying to keep people connected with employment.  As I stated at another committee meeting, we often hear what we do not like and then we look for the reasons behind the results.  Who went back to education and were we giving some people something to do that might not have been suitable?  It was not misdirection as there were other channels but now we are in a better position, should we look at a better directed approach?  Back-to-education measures may not always be suitable for everyone but those who go back to education should have a quality experience.  Will outcomes be very different?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#O00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and I apologise for running a little late.  I read through the statements before I came in so I hope I have not missed anything.  The key question is in the opening statement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which mentioned activation, but activation into what?  That is why it is important we have the delegations here this morning and know the importance of the work we have agreed to undertake in this committee.  There are difficulties in the labour market and we have seen wholesale exploitation between low or zero-hour contracts.  Unfortunately, the Government has failed to tackle such issues.  My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, brought forward legislation to introduce banded hour contracts last year but unfortunately it has been kicked down the road for 12 months.  There is much difficulty and huge levels of exploitation, particularly through some of the labour activation schemes that have been in place.  I will touch on them in a minute.</p> <p>  ICTU also mentions under-employment, which is a major concern tying in with zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  Our rate is the second-highest level within the European Union, behind Spain, which is alarming.  Does ICTU have any proposals on how to tackle that?  Some labour activation schemes are positive but some have been very negative.  I welcome that the Minister, after many calls from organisations and bodies, moved to abolish the JobBridge scheme last year.  We are operating in a vacuum.  The Minister stated he hoped to bring forward a replacement for JobBridge and we are still waiting for that.</p><p>It was interesting to read through IBEC's presentation.  The major reservations my party had over the abuses within JobBridge were borne out in the Indecon report, which stated that elements of the scheme were fundamentally flawed in its design and roll-out.  It is very alarming to read this.  What do the representatives of IBEC think of deli assistant positions being advertised on JobBridge?  Surely these should be fully paid, full-term employment as opposed to JobBridge employment.  JobBridge aided and abetted the replacement of full-time, proper employment for the likes of deli assistants, which would have formerly required a day's or a half day's training, with JobBridge employment which exploited people.  We are now in a vacuum and there is no replacement for the JobBridge scheme.  Has the Minister held any consultation with organisations on what will happen next?  My party has a number of proposals and my predecessor in this portfolio, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, brought forward well thought out proposals for a replacement scheme.  I will pass the document on to anybody who is not aware of it.  There was a serious focus on the need for apprenticeships and further education, as opposed to schemes such as JobBridge.</p><p> The representatives from ICTU touched on zero-hour contracts and family income supplement.  Family income support backs up the low pay of workers and aids and abets many employers in abusing people's position.  They know they can get away with zero-hour contracts and low-paid employment because the State will back it up with the family income supplement.  Do the witnesses have any observations on the working family payment?</p></speech>

IBEC made reference to the skills shortages which are emerging.  In what specific areas are these shortages most prevalent?  How can the gap be bridged and how can the much-needed skills be secured?</p> <p>  The presentation referred to inconsistencies in the quality of services such as Intreo and the pathway to work services.  Can the witnesses expand on this and give examples of where they have seen inconsistencies?  Does the quality vary across counties or regions?  I agree with IBEC on JobBridge but while the emphasis in the presentation was on JobBridge, there are many other job activation measures such as JobsPlus, Springboard and CE schemes.</p><p>As no reference was made to those, what are the witnesses' views on them and can they be improved?  Given that the Minister has pulled the plug on JobBridge, have submissions been made to him or his Department on a new scheme?  We have a broad outline of what will be in it but has a submission been made in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#Q00200"><p>Before I hand back to the witnesses who can answer the questions in order, much of the discussion has been specifically on the individuals.  We talked about various schemes including on-the-job training, education and so forth .  I acknowledge that but particularly in parts of Dublin - countrywide it is slightly different because job opportunities may be different - we have always had geographic areas of high unemployment.  In addition to schemes aimed at individuals, such as JobBridge, community employment or apprenticeships, and apart from labour activation programmes that are aimed at the individual, there is probably something more we need to examine in the geographic areas of high unemployment around Dublin, which are well documented.  I will not name any of them because that is not what this is about, but does something additional need to be done?  Mr. Donohoe talked about intergenerational jobless households and we have seen them in those areas.  In addition to labour activation programmes, including the specific education and advancement of the individual, do the witnesses have a view on what else can be done in geographic areas with significantly high rates of unemployment?</p> <p>  I will come back to my colleagues afterwards but a number of issues have been raised so I will call on Ms Mulligan first.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Mulligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#Q00300"><p>I thank members of the committee for their questions.  I will start with Deputy Carey's remarks about why we focused on JobBridge.  One explanation is the five minutes allotted and the fact that we have fewer concerns regarding some of the other schemes.  In particular, we are quite encouraged by JobsPlus.  Senator Humphreys mentioned the interlinkage between these schemes, which must be looked at together.  There is scope to enhance and expand JobsPlus as opposed to the current situation with JobBridge, which is an internship scheme.  We feel that incentivising work that is directed at disadvantaged areas should be done through a direct payment for full-time work.</p> <p>  I wish to put on record that SIPTU certainly has not been hysterical or anything of that nature concerning JobBridge and its functioning in the past.  The comments that have been made today are in light of very different circumstances.  The key for the committee to understand is that we are in a different position economically.  While there may have been arguments about the need for employers to have some incentives to take on people, we are now in a space where we are looking at skills shortages.  Our basic question is whether there is a need in the business community to be subsidised at this stage.  We do not see the case for that.  We feel that there are other beneficial pathways for people who wish to progress.  </p> <p>  The overall point is that it is important to be balanced.  It is certainly the case that the debate tends to become ideological, but we are not seeking to put forward an ideological position on this.</p> <p>  I will now allow my colleague, Dr. Rigney, to continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#Q00400"><p>For the information of the committee, there are two key documents that its members should read.  One is on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and was produced by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.</p><p>It is dated January and it is an evaluation of JobPath.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does numbers, to the exclusion of almost all else, and states the costs per 1,000 unemployed people is &euro;9.1 million per annum.  It has crunched the numbers on JobPath.  The committee should have a look at the analysis.  I am not saying it is good or bad.</p><p> Second, it is always worth reading anything that comes out of the skills and labour market research unit of SOLAS.  It does a fine job and should be recognised.</p><p> The National Skills Bulletin 2016 is statistics heavy, as was that for 2015.  There is a chapter on labour market transitions and people going from employment to unemployment, and from unemployment to employment.  There is a body of evidence developing like a storm cloud that shows there is a growing or disturbingly large cohort of people at the bottom end of the labour market who are going into and out of unemployment.  That undermines the narrative we all favour, which is that going into a job should be a ladder, not a treadmill.  That requires legislators to think about what they have to do legislatively.</p><p> I do not want to labour the point on JobBridge.  We live in a parliamentary democracy and, irrespective of whether the issue is cash for ash or JobBridge, the Opposition has a duty to hold the Government to account.  Therefore, schemes should run themselves and should raise very little noise in the administrative system.  Very few parliamentary questions have been seen on JobBridge.  The problem with it is that there were many good, decent employers who did the right thing but got no publicity.  In order to police the level of abuse that existed, which I admit was very small, one would have needed an army of inspectors.  The State does not have the resources to fund that.  </p><p> There is the question of opportunity cost to be considered.  I receive constant complaints from people who were given contracts of self-employment which under any legal definition are false, and they are trying to get the scope section of the Department of Social Protection to adjudicate on their cases.  They are waiting for months and months because of staff shortages.  For every civil servant working on administering a JobBridge scheme and trying to ensure the regulations are obeyed, there is a person in need with a bogus contract of self-employment, or perhaps not, waiting for a judgment.  Therefore there are opportunity costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Stewart" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#R00200"><p>On the matter of what needs to be done, the Chairman asked about geographical areas where there are still high rates of unemployment and about intergenerational unemployment.  It will be very important to see the detail of the action plan for jobless households and families.  One will find it is probably not a question of doing one thing as there as there is a series of things to be done, including considering what works well currently and what has made the difference for people in terms of their being able to stay on a training programme, for example.</p> <p>  We run a training programme at the INOU called Building Futures.  We have exceptionally high levels of retention on it, the reason being that we recognise certain things happen in people's lives.  There might be times when, for very legitimate reasons, they might not be able to get to a class on time.  One basically builds into programmes a means of recognising that people will need additional types of supports as they go through them.  We have been able to do that.  An awful lot depends on how programmes are designed and on an understanding of unemployment among those delivering programmes.  The programmes must be flexible to recognise that circumstances change in people's lives.  Very often, of course, they change for the better but unfortunately they sometimes change significantly and substantially for the worse.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  With regard to programmes, Senator Humphreys made a point on community employment, T&uacute;s and Gateway.</p><p>On this specific point on community employment, it is a reality that a very significant amount of important key social and community services are delivered through community employment, which, by its nature, is a part-time temporary programme for the participants.  In terms of how community employment and other programmes are perceived by the wider labour market, there is work to be done by the Department of Social Protection in highlighting the positive and useful work being done and the useful skills and work experience being gained by participants through community employment.  There is an issue in terms of the perception of how useful and valuable the schemes and programmes are in the wider labour market.</p><p> There are different actions that need to be taken on both the income side and the support side.  It is important that we look at all of these areas, and that we should not become complacent.  Mr. Donohoe is correct about the positive developments in the labour market.  The increase in employment and reduction in unemployment is welcome.  The unemployed have played their part in that.  We are aware from recent previous experience that when jobs are created, the unemployed will take up those jobs in large numbers.  There is no question about whether the unemployed want to work.  Of course, they want to work.  Persons who were unemployed, who genuinely believed a number of years ago that they would remain unemployed, possibly for the rest of their working lives, are now back in work.  That is significant and something that should be celebrated.  However, that does not happen by accident.  Clearly, there is a need for programmes and supports for the unemployed to assist them to get those jobs so that when jobs are announced the unemployed hear about them, there is a good understanding of the criteria that an employer will have in terms of recruitment, and the unemployed are matched to those positions.  The initial problems that arose with the new DSP Jobs Ireland website was unfortunate.  It has the potential of getting something wrong to the extent that those issues arose.  I am sure that has significant potential to put employers off using that type of website and falling back on the more traditional methods of recruiting.</p><p> There are many different things that need to be done.  This is a good opportunity to raise those and discuss them, and to wish the joint committee well in its deliberations on these matters.</p></speech>

At the height of the Celtic tiger we failed to address those and when the crisis hit, many of those communities found themselves even further behind.  We must address those issues.  If we are not serious about ensuring that we are working from a starting point where there is a strong commitment to and application of equality, human rights and social inclusion, we will fail yet again to address those issues.  We must be serious this time around in putting in place the policies, the practices and the resources to ensure everybody feels he or she has a serious stake in this country, this country is for them, and the services and supports that are offered to him or her are meaningful and will help to improve his or her life.</p> <p>  In areas where there are few opportunities, in many cases it is programmes, such as community employment or T&uacute;s, that help to keep a service open.  Those communities lost out on a lot of resources.  A lot of resources were taken out of the Community Development Programme and the Local Development Programme.  Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, has quite a different focus.  Its focus is very much in terms of the resources that were in some communities that helped people be able to develop projects in their local area.  A lot of those have been reduced.  We need to look at how to provide resources to help communities make responses to the issues, including employment, facing them, but also to look at other issues that they can address.  There was a strong focus on addressing issues facing rural communities but there is an equal need to acknowledge and seek to address the issues facing urban disadvantaged communities.</p></speech>

Meeting people where they are is vitally important, but understanding people's expectations of what is and is not possible, changing that history and helping people find a way out goes back to early education and the changing of attitudes at that stage.  This involves working with the key influencers from that point onwards - specifically parents - to help foster an attitude regarding education and employment, working with the schools, teachers and the career guidance sector and building on areas such as the structural and child care issues, etc.  It also involves fostering the idea and attitude that there are opportunities outside of this.  We must tackle the structural issues, on one side, and develop this change in attitude, on the other, so that there is not this recurring theme that we fall into the same pattern time after time.  This is, in part, a matter of meeting people where they are and having that flexibility, as Mr. Stewart said, within the programmes but also of having that change in attitude whereby there is hopefully an appetite to work with the system where it can meet them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#T00300"><p>I will take up Senator Humphreys' second point on age discrimination and older people.  I fully agree with the point he makes; I have more than a vested interested in this.  On a more serious point, it is a serious issue, and the issue of pensions and retirement ages is within the remit of the committee.  It is very tricky and we need to make a start on it because these matters are all connected.  Pension coverage, specifically private sector pension coverage, is alarmingly low.  We have these anomalies in respect of retirement age now whereby it is out of kilter with the State pension age.  I am not sure I would characterise it as discrimination, but Ireland is a bit out of step with the rest of Europe in this regard.  I sit on the BusinessEurope social affairs committee, which is basically a European IBEC.  My colleagues there all talk about how we might keep people in the labour force for longer.  Europe has a labour shortage, and BusinessEurope sees that we are living longer, are healthier, etc.  However, it is quite complex because Ireland's is a relatively young population and we need progression opportunities for young people.  Squaring this is quite tricky.  We are talking to the Workplace Relations Commission about retirement ages and codes of practice.  It is a very interesting area, which I would love an opportunity to explore at a future date.</p> <p>  Senator Humphreys also raised the issue of lifelong learning.  We are very bad at this.  Our lifelong learning rate is 7%; the European norm is 15%.  In some Scandinavian countries it is over 30%.  One could speculate on the reasons for this, but we need to consider, for example, how we use the national training fund, which has over the past number of years been used for activation schemes such as Springboard and Momentum - and quite properly.  However, we need to start rebalancing it towards upskilling and encouraging lifelong learning, particularly in the workplace.  It is a significant amount of money.  Employers contribute 0.7% to the fund.  It varies each year but it is currently approximately &euro;340 million.  We could probably use it a bit more constructively.  I do not want to get into community employment, CE, which is a bit like JobBridge.  People take up positions on it very quickly.  It does not have very good employment progression outcomes.  The research on it is quite old so it should be revisited.  However, it obviously fulfils a really important role in communities.  It is when there is this confusion surrounding objectives that schemes become less effective.  The scheme fulfils a role</p><p>That should be stated and it should be designed around it.</p><p> Deputy Brady has gone, but he was talking about entry-level jobs such as deli positions.  It is important to retain that type of opportunity in any work experience scheme.  I tried to draw this out a bit in my opening remarks.  Employability, turning up to work on time and how one interacts with people are basic skills.  To be quite honest, they do not exist at all levels.  One could argue that some graduates do not have them either.  They are very important.  They are only gained in a contextual space in the workplace.  Those jobs are valuable and we should give people the opportunity to break the cycle of no job, no experience, no experience, no job at every level.</p><p> There were some comments about the abuse of zero-hour contracts and precarious work.  The University of Limerick study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts does not back that up.  In terms of statistics, it found that 2.6% of employees are on variable part-time work, 5.3% have constantly variable hours and much fewer than that are on low hours.  Again, it is one of these things that becomes an urban myth.  Unfortunately, it has the potential for some unintended consequences, particularly when legislation arises from it, because one person's precarious work is another person's opportunity for flexible employment conditions.  Employers are already implementing a large raft of European social legislation, which is quite proper and should be there, but given the uncertain economic outlook, I do not believe it is the cleverest thing to do to impose more restrictions on how employers run their businesses.  They should work within the existing law, but I do not think we need more legislation because it would push up costs, reduce opportunities for people who genuinely want flexible contracts and, ultimately, cost jobs.</p><p> Deputy Carey directed two questions to me about skills shortages and examples of inconsistencies in services.  Skills shortages are now becoming quite widespread.  Even during the recession, we were always hearing about ICT skills shortages.  There is a global shortage of ICT talent.  We live in a technological age.  Across the world, competition for people in that area remains and will continue to remain.  However, we are now also seeing skills shortages in areas like construction, hospitality, which has been a problem for quite a while, and retail.  It is much more widespread.  It is probably a good challenge to have.  It is the product of an economic recovery.  How do we address that?  Dr. Peter Rigney mentioned apprenticeships.  It is about aligning the education system and the business sector much more tightly and getting those conversations going.</p><p> Deputy Carey asked for examples of inconsistencies in services.  I do not want to name the unfortunate Intreo offices or regions.  I will tell the Deputy how that is expressed to us or how we see it.  Basically, there are people who have been referred to companies from the Intreo service who are still not prepared for the job interview.  We have all mentioned guidance and preparation in one shape or form.  In terms of their CVs and how they present themselves, it is still not optimal.  That is the feedback we have received from some of our companies.  That is really important because we are anxious that people go to Intreo first.</p><p>We all know that in the 1980s F&Aacute;S or AnCo was never the first place one would have gone to find an employee.  One would have taken other avenues.  I am hopeful one of the legacies of this recession will be that we will have a fit for purpose public employment service because we entered it without one, but we need to complete the guidance element.  It needs to be joined with the education sector and the counselling element.  JobPath is in its infancy, but I urge Deputies and Senators to take the opportunity to visit a JobPath office to see what is happening in it.  It is instructive in how those involve prepare people for interviews, something they do very well.</p></speech>

On the community employment programme, when we consider what it is measured against, there are two elements.  There is a need to redefine what is meant by community employment.  My experience of it is that those involved with the programme are finding it difficult to recruit because there are other opportunities available.  As the services provided by those involved in community employment schemes in urban and rural areas are starting to decrease, we need to redefine the programme.</p> <p>  I echo Mr. Donohue's comment.  People should go to JobPath offices to see the work being done.  It is very easy to take an take a position in opposition.  One of the key points about the JobPath programme is that it supports people in work.  We need to focus on this because we do not measure the outcome in terms of whether a person found a job and then fell back into unemployment very quickly.  We need to support people.  For individuals who have been unemployed for three to four years, it is a totally different experience.  It is sometimes very difficult for them to deal with the experience, particularly the personal interactions involved.  One needs to make a telephone call and ask them if they are having a problem and tell them how they should deal with it.  Those who have been long-term unemployed must be supported on their return to employment.  That forms part of the JobPath programme.</p> <p>  The Intreo service has been totally transformed over five years, but the focus must be maintained.  Just because the numbers are changing does not mean that we should stop considering the additional services Intreo offices could provide and how they could target suitable educational opportunities and so on. </p> <p>  We must also examine the position for people with disabilities.  There is a new cohort who are not in receipt of benefits but who want to take up employment.  They fall into the group Ms O'Brien mentioned of those aged 40 years and over who, perhaps due to their partner being in full-time employment, have been left sitting at home.  There is no support available to help them to return to employment.</p> <p>  The JobBridge scheme was of its time, as were T&uacute;s and Gateway.  We should constantly re-evaluate initiatives and make changes.  If we assess reasonably the impact of JobBridge - there is a report available on it - and take an unbiased approach to it, a fairly good job has been done.  Everybody will not be an IT expert or enter the banking sector.  There was, especially in my community, assistance available to help people who might not have worked for a long time to find a job in a deli.  When the JobBridge scheme was being set up, there was a tendency to go for the easy option to support those interested in becoming involved in the IT sector, including computer-aided design, CAD, and all such professional areas, to give them experience, but not to give early school-leavers experience in the employment market.  That is when all of the parliamentary questions came into play.  It is a much more difficult issue with which to deal.</p> <p>  Just because the numbers are improving does not mean that our focus should move from long-term unemployment.  One of the delegates did not want to label an area, but in an area in which I was very much involved, at a time when we were talking about reaching full employment, we conducted a survey and found that there was an unemployment rate of more than 50%.  There is a need for a cultural change within geographical areas.  A few weeks ago I met a number of people who told me that there was peer pressure not to take up employment.  That is something we need to break down.</p><p>Many things are happening beneath the surface.  We need to adjust in this regard and take account of people's experience.</p><p> A scheme may be set up and may be running, but it has a period or lifetime during which it is useful and targeted.  We should be constantly reassessing, improving and introducing what is needed.  One area that needs to be targeted is the intergenerational area, whether geographic or family-based.  Mr. Donohoe and I referred to it earlier.  In any event, I see a growing discrimination against people in their late 40s.  Many of those people lost their jobs during the recession.  They have been unemployed for five or six years, but they have handsome CVs.  A person might take the view that he does not want another person sitting on his shoulder.  That can happen and we need to undertake the relevant analysis to find out what is stopping people in their 40s.  They have ten, 15 or 20 years more to contribute to society and ten more years to grow.  We need to support the long-term unemployed when they go to work.  That is true in working with the likes of IBEC, employers and JobPath and Intreo.  That is vital work and it needs to be done.</p></speech>

Before I go back to the witnesses to respond, I will offer a comment to Mr. Donohoe.  He referred to the pensions issue.  It comes under a separate module but this committee is engaged on the question.  I do not intend to go down that road today but it is a separate block of work that the committee is examining.  Mr. Donohoe raised several issues in terms of the age when people finish work, associated pensions and so forth.  All of these will be addressed.  It is not specific and we may well revert to you in due course on the matter.</p> <p>  Several issues were raised by Senator Humphreys and Deputy Mitchell.  Will Ms O'Brien address these first?  We will then hear concluding remarks from all our witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#W00600"><p>I was asked about sanctions and the feedback we get from people of all ages.  In particular, I am mindful that some people may believe they have been directed onto an employment programme or an education and training programme.  They may take the view that it is not for them or that it would not be of long-term benefit.  In some cases, people take these programmes because they believe that if they do not, then they will be cut.  We believe that is altogether negative for the person involved.  Moreover, it means that others on the training programme might begin to wonder about it, especially if they are keen to be there.  They might question whether it is a good decision.  All of this creates a negative environment for everyone.</p> <p>  We believe sanctions should be an absolute last resort.  The services need to engage with people as adults, work with them, examine the position people are in and examine what is available and what can be done.  Several questions arise.  Is it a case of having to develop better skills to find a job?  Is it that people need to retrain or up-skill?  It is a question of working with people to try to find the best option for them.  Sanctions should be in the back of the drawer and only taken out when all else has failed.</p><p>Again, it goes back to the capacity and wherewithal of staff in offices.  Some people will take the approach of engaging with the person, but others will take the approach that they are sending the person to a particular place but he or she will not go.  Some of it comes down to the capacity of staff.</p><p> Another issue may be how messages from the top have been heard.  It struck us when all of the changes were happening that fraud control was put in the driving seat and everything else was put to the back.  For the employment service to really work well, the car needs to go one way, but from a fraud control perspective the car needs to go another way.  This creates tension for the Department.  The Department absorbed the national employment service, and one engages with people very differently when providing such a service than if the starting point is to ask whether someone is entitled to something.  There are two different dynamics.  We feel if we develop the dynamic of engaging people well some of the issues should be addressed before they arise.  This is very important.</p><p> We have had a variety of feedback on JobPath.  Some people did not welcome being referred to something of which they were not aware and wondered why it happened.  There have been instances where a referral happened centrally but somebody had started to do something locally.  Tension will arise between local services, including the Department's services, and national referral.  In some cases where somebody may have started down the road to something else they have been facilitated to do so, but in other cases this has not arisen.  Some people do not appreciate work supports.  Where people feel they got the job themselves they are concerned that if the employer is contacted, it will have a negative impact.</p><p> Over the years we received feedback from people who stated they did not like how the local social welfare offices used to be, with staff on the other side of the glass, but now some people do not like the open plan offices of JobPath.  It is about people feeling they can opt in.  We have raised this with JobPath providers, with regard to providing an option of meeting people in a small room, but we must make sure people are aware of this.  People have a fear that somebody else will hear their business.  Some of the issues arose because the initial cohort referred seemed to be of a particular age group.  We are conscious many of the staff in JobPath seem to be younger and there definitely was an intergenerational prang in some offices.  Some people went in the door and wondered how this young person would tell them how to find a job.  These are some of the concerns people have raised with us.</p><p> People may not be sure how long employment will last, even those who know they will get paid at the end of the month.  If all people have is a weekly social welfare payment and they are facing three or four weeks of no income, food still needs to be put on the table.  The supplementary welfare system is a mechanism within the system that could be used better.  A difficulty arose when the Department absorbed the F&Aacute;S employment services and also pulled back into itself the supplementary welfare system.  Something that struck us with regard to this system was that often in the past when an initial decision about a payment entitlement was made, we were able to get some income through the supplementary welfare system.  Access to this has certainly dropped quite dramatically, as have exceptional needs payment supports.  Serious income issues and huge difficulties arise for people who may not fit neatly into a particular box.  It is a mechanism that exists but if people are not aware of it, it is hard to find.  For a long period of time the system has been run on the premise that if people did not already know something, nobody would tell them.  If we are to make all of the changes that have happened work well, the system needs to become more proactive in telling people about the range of supports available.</p><p>This is a very practical measure that can make a huge difference to people.  It may allow them to have some payment for an extended period.  It is a small investment, particularly if a person gets a job and stays in it.  One month's additional payment could make a huge difference.  It is already there in the system but could be used to better effect to help people.  Sometimes, there is an element of fear.  People might not have worked for a long time.  They are going from the security of an income they know - they know how far they can stretch it - to a situation in which they are not fully sure how it will work out.  It is a new experience for people.  It is a small practical step that could make a big difference for people.  The Department is ensuring everybody knows everything, rather than assuming people already know, when many people do not.</p></speech>

It is one of the activities that is supposed to link up within the Intreo office.  The person the client is interacting with is supposed to know they can receive this payment while they go back into employment, so it is a one stop shop.  I fear it is not working.  Ensuring it happened was one of the key designs within the Intreo offices.</p> <p>  Regarding the glass, I was in the Department at the time and it took time to convince the staff to take down the barriers.  It came from the ground up.  Staff said they were facing glass screens when talking to people and asked if we could take down the barriers.  One of the best systems I saw was in Scotland, where people sat beside each other, the screen was there, and there was that interaction and exchange of information.  It is interesting that Ms O'Brien said some people liked the screen.  I know about the individual interview room-----</p></speech>

There is a sense of lack of privacy.  For some people it is an issue, whereas some people hated talking to somebody through a glass screen.  People raised privacy issues over the years, given that they felt, at times, that they nearly had to roar to be heard through the glass.</p></speech>

If the client's experience is bad, it affects the JobPath payment.  Elements of it need to be brought out more.  I am worried about the parking of the benefits, given that they used to be advertised on the radio and in the newspapers at key times in the year such as Christmas, informing people that if they took up temporary work it would not affect their social welfare payments.  It was a very good awareness programme which helped people back into work.  We need to ensure those-----</p></speech>

It is set against the background of needing to ensure there is quality employment and attractive work available to people so they feel it is an option.  It is a very important other side of the activation debate.  We also examined JobBridge.  What came out here today was very interesting in the sense that it seems, from the employer survey, that they are equally conscious of the issue of employability and want to ensure people are willing to train people to have those basic skills.  People are on the same page regarding the need for those basic skills.  Our view is that employers need to step up to the mark in that respect, whereas the emphasis to date has been on a national scheme.</p><p>Borne out by the comments on the difficulties for those over 40 years in terms of work and employment, the cultural change is often at employment level where employers want to bring in new people and overlook the skills of those in their workforce.  There must be a willingness on the part of the employers to engage with their staff.</p><p> There is much discussion on the complex intergenerational and geographical issues.  One important initiative at European level is the introduction of a child guarantee, which covers the issues raised by Dr. Kara McGann.  We should look at how this could be promoted, developed and rolled out in Ireland.</p><p> We are all glad that unemployment numbers are falling and the numbers in employment are rising.  All the social partners and the NGO sector must work together to find the best way to progress.  We would welcome further engagement on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-26a.1296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Stewart" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017012600002#Z00200"><p>We must build on that and it is very important we work collaboratively in the context of job creation and that, in the event that job losses arise from Brexit or other external factors, there is a significant inter-agency approach to working collaboratively.  We have come a long way in terms of the reduction in the number of unemployed and the significant increase in the numbers in employment.  We should not forget that we lost in excess of 300,000 jobs in the downturn and there were a number of years between 2009 and 2012 where emigration was running in or around 70,000 per annum.  These are the facts.  In terms of the skills shortages that Mr. Tony Donohoe referred to earlier, many of the skilled tradespeople opted to look for work overseas and availed of significant opportunities.  I hope there will now be opportunities for them to consider returning.  I know there is some evidence that is beginning to happen.</p> <p>  It is important from an unemployed person's perspective that he or she can access the jobs that are being created and that we can maximise opportunities for people to get those jobs.  We should not forget as well, and this is a point that Senator Humphreys made, that the problem has not been solved.  There is still a need for first class services and supports for unemployed people.  We must remember that as unemployment falls, the people who remain unemployed through no fault of their own will increasingly feel they are unemployed.  I would be concerned that there would be a return to the stigma attached to being unemployed.  That has not been the case in recent years to the extent that might have existed previously because unemployment and emigration had affected so many families.  As the situation improves, people who remain unemployed will begin increasingly to feel the weight of that unemployment on their shoulders.  It is for that reason the work of committees such as this one is very important.  The committee recommendations are very important.  I wish the committee well in its deliberations.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to do so.  If I was to leave one thought, it is that individuals need employment security rather than job security.  I think that security is the key as we are in such an uncertain world.  Change is driven by technology, globalisation and so on.  Notwithstanding what we are seeing in the US and the UK, these are pretty powerful forces that we might put a break on for a while but which will re-establish themselves.  The workplace will be changing all the time.  One will see the churn, as it were, in jobs.</p><p>It is around equipping people with the attributes to survive in that uncertain world.</p><p> I support Dr. Kara McGann's point that the way to do that is through early intervention.  One can trace the quality of the early childhood interventions right up to the propensity for lifelong learning.  The type of employment a person will get is geographically based, as the Chairman mentioned.  Three of us sit on the Labour Market Council and we are wrestling with the idea of jobless households and how one approaches that.  The defining characteristic of jobless households in Ireland is the number of children.  Jobless households affect all the many children living in them.  That is to support the point made by Ms Mulligan around the early intervention with children.</p><p> I am sure members will have picked up from the contributions that it is around the connectedness of services.  When agencies answer to different Departments, different motherships, there is always the likelihood of them getting disconnected when dealing with geographic unemployment hotspots and the jobless household phenomenon.  The impact of these factors is multifaceted.  It is everything from mental health through to education.  Many different Departments are involved and that has to be brought together.  I suspect it is on a geographic basis.  I have seen a project that ran for about ten years.  I am not sure it if still running.  It is called the youngballymun strategy, which tried to connect up the services.</p></speech>
