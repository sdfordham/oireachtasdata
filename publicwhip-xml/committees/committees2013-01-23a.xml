M&aacute; t&aacute; moill thar chuimse ar Choimisi&uacute;n Thithe an Oireachtais ruda&iacute; a aistri&uacute;, an mbeidh Air&iacute; in ann &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as aistritheoir&iacute; gairmi&uacute;la?</p><p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn againn leas&uacute; ar fho-alt (2F) a mholadh ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la, ag iarraidh go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gCaighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il laistigh de bhliain.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar phlean againn freisin leas&uacute; ar fho-alt (2G) a mholadh ionas go mbeidh s&eacute; mar dhualgas ar an gcoimisi&uacute;n dul i gcomhairle le daoine leasmhara, mar shampla, aistritheoir&iacute; gairmi&uacute;la, lucht na me&aacute;in, an coiste t&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta agus Foras na Gaeilge, &oacute; tharla go bhfuil focl&oacute;ireacht faoina gc&uacute;ram.  N&iacute; cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; f&aacute;gtha ag an gcoimisi&uacute;n dul i gcomhairle leis na daoine n&oacute; b'fh&eacute;idir gan dul i gcomhairle leo, agus gur cuma leis an gcoimisi&uacute;n.  Is &eacute; ud&aacute;r na faidhbe ar fad at&aacute; againn faoi l&aacute;thair n&aacute; gur dhi&uacute;ltaigh an coimisi&uacute;n dul i dteagmh&aacute;il le coiste leathan le saineolaithe nuair a bh&iacute; an t-athbhreithni&uacute; cuimsitheach ar an gcaighde&aacute;n ar si&uacute;l.  Chuir Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in leagan nua eile le ch&eacute;ile gan dul i gcomhairle le h&eacute;inne.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&aacute; bhfuair siad an t-am, mar n&iacute;l an t-am acu a gcuid gn&oacute; ceart - reachta&iacute;ocht a aistri&uacute; - a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute; raibh aon ionchur ag an gcoiste t&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta, ag lucht na focl&oacute;ireachta, ag an dream at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis na me&aacute;in n&oacute; ag aistritheoir&iacute; gairmi&uacute;la taobh amuigh de Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.</p> <p>N&iacute; raibh aon ionchur ag m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; n&oacute; ag na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; sin a bh&iacute; ar an gcoiste a bhuna&iacute;odh agus anseo sa Bhille n&iacute;l aon cheangal glacadh le h-ionchur na ndreamanna sin.  Beimid ag moladh go mbeidh dualgas, liosta de na dreamanna sin a eisi&uacute;int.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, beidh an liosta sin comhthreomhar leis an dream daoine a r&eacute;itigh an caighde&aacute;n an-mhaith a r&eacute;itigh siad, tar &eacute;is dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal.  Beimid freisin ag cur leasuithe faoi sin agus faoi an dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal le go mbeidh strucht&uacute;r leis an bpr&oacute;iseas, mar a bh&iacute; ag an gcoiste a bhunaigh an Rialtas deiridh.  Is &eacute; sin, go raibh dul i gcomhairle strucht&uacute;rtha ag gach c&eacute;im den phr&oacute;iseas agus go raibh stuaim leis an obair agus cur chuige oscailte, seachas an cur chuige r&uacute;nda a bh&iacute; ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.</p></speech>

Baineann tr&iacute; leas&uacute; leis an gcuid seo den Bhille.</p><p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam freisin leasuithe breise a thabhairt chun cinn ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la chun a chinnti&uacute; nach nd&eacute;anfar aon athr&uacute; ar an smacht at&aacute; ag an gcoimisi&uacute;n, agus ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in d&aacute; r&eacute;ir, ar an gcaighde&aacute;n mar s&oacute;rt "quality mark" ar aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in reachta&iacute;ochta.  N&iacute; cheart na dualgais sin a chur amach go dt&iacute; dream aistritheoir&iacute; nach bhfuil an st&iacute;l ch&eacute;anna acu &oacute; thaobh focl&oacute;ireachta agus t&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta de.  N&iacute; cheart go mbeadh a leith&eacute;ad d&eacute;anta seachas i gcruach&aacute;s.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an smacht ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, sa chuid is m&oacute;.  Ba cheart na hacmhainn&iacute; a choime&aacute;d sa rann&oacute;g chun st&iacute;l parlaiminte na t&iacute;re seo - t&aacute; a leith&eacute;id ag gach uile parlaimint ar domhain - a chaomhn&uacute; agus a choime&aacute;d le ch&eacute;ile.  Sin leas&uacute; a mholfainn maidir le leathanach 9, idir l&iacute;ne 15 agus l&iacute;ne 16.</p> <p> Mholfainn leas&uacute; eile chomh maith.  Luaitear sa Bhille go nd&eacute;anfar athbhreithni&uacute; gach seacht mbliana, ach s&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; seaf&oacute;ideach athbhreithni&uacute; a bheith ann gach seacht mbliana agus caighde&aacute;n nua a chur amach ansin.  In ionad sin, ba ch&oacute;ir soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go rialta.  Tarla&iacute;onn seo beagnach gach bliain.  D&eacute;anann Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar phoint&iacute; gramada&iacute; n&oacute; focl&oacute;ra go minic, ach n&iacute; ath-eis&iacute;tear An Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il.  Mar at&aacute; feicthe againn, eis&iacute;odh an caighde&aacute;n don ch&eacute;ad uair i 1958 agus n&iacute;or eis&iacute;odh ar&iacute;s &eacute; go dt&iacute; 2012.  Mar sin, s&iacute;lim gur c&oacute;ir an for&aacute;il in alt 3(2F) a athr&uacute; go hioml&aacute;n.  Ba ch&oacute;ir gur soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a bheadh i gceist agus nach dtarl&oacute;dh athbhreithni&uacute; ach uair amh&aacute;in gach 20 bliain.  Sin athr&uacute; suntasach a bheadh &aacute; lorg agamsa.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th freisin an mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it ag iarraidh go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; cine&aacute;l fochonraitheoireacht a dh&eacute;anamh den obair at&aacute; faoi r&eacute;ir Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in?  D&aacute; dtabharfa&iacute; na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; d&oacute;ibh agus aistritheoir n&oacute; dh&oacute; breise don rann&oacute;g, an bhf&eacute;adfadh an rann&oacute;g na riar&aacute;ist&iacute; a ghlanadh go hinmh&eacute;anach?</p><p> Dar nd&oacute;igh, caithf&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go mbeidh teacht ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar shaineolaithe seachtracha.  Aonta&iacute;m le sin, ach is c&oacute;ir gur comhairle a bheadh le f&aacute;il uathu seachas aon ionchur ar ghn&aacute;thobair na rann&oacute;ige, mar t&aacute; obair mhaith &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an rann&oacute;g thar na blianta ach amh&aacute;in go bhfuil riar&aacute;ist&iacute; ann.  De r&eacute;ir an eolais at&aacute; agamsa, tharla sin toisc nach raibh neart daoine ar an bhfoireann, n&aacute;r l&iacute;onadh poist agus nach raibh d&oacute;thain airgid ag an rann&oacute;g chun an obair a dh&eacute;anamh.  D'&eacute;irigh leis an rann&oacute;g an dualgas a bh&iacute; uirthi An Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il a atheisi&uacute;nt.  Rinneadh &eacute; sin agus rinneadh jab maith de.  Chomh maith le sin, bh&iacute; obair eile le d&eacute;anamh ag an rann&oacute;g.  Bh&iacute; athruithe m&oacute;ra ag tarl&uacute; maidir leis an Aontas Eorpach agus traen&aacute;il agus bh&iacute; an rann&oacute;g gafa le d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go mbeadh an caighde&aacute;n c&eacute;anna ag na haistritheoir&iacute; a rachadh go dt&iacute; Parlaimint na hEorpa agus at&aacute; ag Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.</p><p> Seo iad na pr&iacute;omh point&iacute; faoi seo, ach b'fh&eacute;idir go smaoineoidh m&eacute; ar ch&uacute;pla rud eile n&aacute;r luaigh m&eacute; agus tiochfaidh m&eacute; ar ais orthu sin ar ball.  Seo bun&uacute;s na leasuithe a bheinn ag iarraidh a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith liom a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte de nach dtarl&oacute;dh athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gcaighde&aacute;n nach raibh g&aacute; leis agus lena mbeadh costas breise ag teast&aacute;il de bharr go mbeadh an dream at&aacute; gafa le haistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n reachta&iacute;ochta d&iacute;rithe i dtreo jab an-mh&oacute;r nach raibh g&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Go bhfios domsa, n&iacute;l aon t&iacute;r eile ar domhan ina tharla&iacute;onn athbhreithni&uacute; ar an dteanga oifigi&uacute;il gach seacht mbliana.  Bheadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr d&uacute;inn d&aacute; mbeadh focl&oacute;ir t&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta parlaiminte &aacute;isi&uacute;il againn.</p></speech>

D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, beidh an coiste comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in seo an-t&aacute;bhachtach.  Ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios againn cad at&aacute; i gceist.  B'fhearr liom d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; leagtha amach, os &aacute;r gcomhair i scr&iacute;bhinn, go d&iacute;reach c&eacute; hiad na daoine at&aacute; i gceist.  Cuirfidh m&eacute; leas&uacute; le ch&eacute;ile sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, os rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it go gcuirfear caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il nua le ch&eacute;ile gach seacht mbliana, t&aacute; dains&eacute;ar ann go dtiocfaidh athruithe thar chuimse ar an gcaighde&aacute;n go rialta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mb&iacute;onn an st&iacute;l &aacute;irithe a bhaineann le reachta&iacute;ocht, ach go h&aacute;irithe, ceart nuair a th&eacute;ann na nithe seo os comhair na gc&uacute;irteanna.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh aon dabht n&oacute; aon bhot&uacute;in i gceist.  Thar na blianta, d'fhoglaim&iacute;omar anois is ar&iacute;s go gcosna&iacute;onn bot&uacute;n beag reachta&iacute;ochta an St&aacute;t go leor airgid.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an st&iacute;l caighde&aacute;nach le n-athr&uacute; gach seacht mbliana, t&aacute; seans ann go dtiocfaidh bot&uacute;in chun cinn n&iacute;os minic&iacute; amach anseo.</p><p>  N&iacute;l s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo go bhfuil athbhreithni&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar chaighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il B&eacute;arla na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ait nach bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an dara teanga oifigi&uacute;il.  Go bhfios domsa, n&iacute;l aon chaighd&eacute;an oifigi&uacute;il - seachas ceann Shasana - againn don teanga sin.  An bhfuil an coiste chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in at&aacute; &aacute; bhun&uacute; ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il B&eacute;arla na t&iacute;re seo chun us&aacute;id na teanga sin a chur i gceart?  An bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mB&eacute;arla?  Tarla&iacute;onn athruithe i mB&eacute;arla go rialta, ach n&iacute; cheapann na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is i Sasana gur cheart athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agus caighde&aacute;n nua a eisi&uacute;nt gach seacht mbliana.  Cuireann siad focl&oacute;ir nua amach chun soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh, mar shampla ar an dul chun cinn m&oacute;r at&aacute; d&eacute;anta &oacute; thaobh teicneola&iacute;ochta de - an tIdirl&iacute;on agus a leith&eacute;id.  Tuigim go bhfuil ceisteanna ar n&oacute;s can&uacute;int&iacute; againn sa t&iacute;r seo.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil caighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il don Bh&eacute;arla leagtha s&iacute;os i dTithe na Parlaiminte i Sasana.  Cla&iacute;onn said le sin, go bhfios dom - n&iacute; dh&eacute;anann siad aon mh&oacute;rathbhreithni&uacute;.  Sa ch&aacute;s seo, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it athruithe a dh&eacute;anamh ar theanga oifigi&uacute;il amh&aacute;in cu&iacute;osach rialta.  Tuigim an f&aacute;th gur tharla an t-athr&uacute; a rinneadh sa bhliain 1958 agus tuigim an f&aacute;th gur tharla an t-athbhreithni&uacute; is d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  B'fh&eacute;idir n&aacute;r cheart d&uacute;inn 60 bliain a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  Bheadh s&eacute; an-ait d&aacute; mbeadh an coiste seo ag su&iacute; ar feadh seacht mbliana chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gCaighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il.

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag lorg eolas &oacute;n Aire St&aacute;it i dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire sula nd&eacute;anaim &eacute; a chur le ch&eacute;ile.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013012300002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to come before the select sub-committee.  I thank members for being present on what is an important occasion.  I know Deputy Michael McGrath knows - I am sure the Chairman and Deputy Simon Harris are also so aware - that in the course of his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, referred to the agreement forged between the United States and Ireland.  This is an important matter for the select sub-committee and I will answer questions members may ask.</p><p>  Item No. 1 is a draft Government order giving force of law to an agreement with the United States to improve tax compliance and provide for reporting and the exchange of information on tax matters.  Item No. 2 is a draft Government order giving force of law to a tax information exchange agreement with Montserrat.  Each of these bilateral agreements provides for an exchange of information between countries in order to combat tax evasion and improve tax compliance.  Members will recall that before the Christmas break, they considered a number of double taxation agreements, a tax information exchange agreement,TIEA, and the OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters which provided for a bilateral exchange of information between countries.  I know on that occasion members were very complimentary to the officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance for the way in which these matters had been concluded swiftly.  This provided an opportunity to show to the world that our tax regime and the exchange of information between countries were at a very good level.  While the agreement with the United States represents a significant new development in terms of the international exchange of tax information, it should be regarded as a member of the same family of intergovernmental tax agreements and TIEAs more generally as it has the same fundamental aim of enabling tax authorities in both countries to enforce their tax laws and thereby encourage the development of closer economic relations between the two countries in the future.</p><p>  I will discuss first the tax information exchange agreement with Montserrat.  Ireland has now concluded tax information exchange agreements with 20 jurisdictions, 16 of which are in force.  All of them are based on the OECD model TIEA which grew from the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally.  The OECD model TIEA now represents the international standard for the effective exchange of information in tax matters.  There has been a significant acceleration of the process of signing TIEAs between OECD countries and offshore jurisdictions in the past couple of years, mainly stemming from a threat by the G20 to blacklist jurisdictions that do not conclude at least 12 information exchange agreements.</p> <p>It is fair to say from any observations of the work of the OECD, that this is a major issue of concern.  The OECD has effectively become a specialist in this area in recent years of requiring more countries to exchange such agreements as a means to improve tax transparency in them. </p><p> TIEAs allow the Revenue Commissioners to directly request from foreign tax authorities information that is relevant to an Irish tax investigation, such as bank account information or company or trust ownership information.  They will, therefore, greatly assist the Revenue Commissioners in tax investigations involving entities and bank accounts located in these jurisdictions.  </p><p> The second issue is the agreement with the United States to improve tax compliance and provide for reporting and exchange of information concerning tax matters.  This is a stand-alone intergovernmental agreement between Ireland and the United States.  The main purpose of the agreement is to combat international tax evasion by preventing individuals from hiding money outside of either state in order to avoid paying tax.  This agreement provides that the Revenue Commissioners will collect information from Irish financial institutions regarding accounts they hold on behalf of US persons and, in turn, report this information to the US Internal Revenue Service, IRS.  In turn, the Government of the US has agreed that the IRS will collect similar information from US financial institutions in respect of accounts held by Irish tax residents and report this to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> This agreement is necessary following publication of legislation in the US which has effectively changed the requirements for all international financial institutions which wish to carry on business with US financial institutions.  These changes were the result of US legislation know as FATCA - the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 2010 - which requires that all non-US financial institutions must report information about certain US account holders directly to the IRS or else face financial penalties in the form of a 30% withholding tax on all US source investments.</p><p> Ireland is one of many countries which has a considerable amount of business with the US, so Irish financial institutions would be greatly impacted by these changes.  Given the network of trade and investment that takes place between Ireland and the US, the early conclusion of the agreement will provide certainty and clarity to Irish and American financial institutions which wish to do business with each other.  The agreement, therefore, will have a positive impact on trade and investment between Ireland and the United States and will have a positive impact on Irish business.  It will also boost international tax compliance and the Revenue Commissioner's ability to obtain information from the US to help in tackling Irish tax evasion.  </p><p> The agreement itself is based on a model agreement published by the US Treasury in July 2012.  This model has been used as a template agreement for all countries which wish to enter into a similar agreement with the US.  At present there are more than 50 such countries, including fellow EU member states, throughout the world.  </p><p> The exchange of information is already provided for generally under the Ireland-US Double Taxation Convention on a case-by-case basis.  This agreement will go a step further and provide for the automatic annual exchange of information held by financial institutions.  Automatic exchange of information in regard to interest payments is already provided for in the EU context under the EU savings directive, which came into force in Ireland in 2005.  We see the automatic nature of information exchange as an important step to improve the information that the bodies responsible for collecting tax will have and thus complement the international work being done to ensure global tax compliance.</p><p> Members might recall that the conclusion of this agreement with the US was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his budget day speech last December.  The agreement was then signed on 21 December last.  Ireland is the fourth country in the world to sign such an agreement with the United States and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to helping combat international tax evasion.</p><p> The conclusion of this intergovernmental agreement was one of the issues discussed at the meeting between the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, during her visit to Dublin on 6 December 2012.  The US was appreciative of the Government's support for FATCA which will be an important instrument in building further economic activity between Ireland and the US.</p><p> Consideration of these international agreements by the committee is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 January 2013 in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make the orders.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for its consideration.  After consideration by the committee, the draft orders are then referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.  After that, the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a Schedule to the taxes Acts, by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  The legal instrument for this will be through the Finance Bill, which will be before the House shortly.  Thereupon, the Irish ratification procedures are completed.  In the case of the bilateral agreements, as soon as both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry into force provisions.  </p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, we will be happy to deal with any questions members may have.</p></speech>

In regard to the tax information exchange agreements, we have signed up to 20 and 16 are currently in force.  Are they effective?  Presumably, many of them are with countries with which we would not have a significant trading relationship and countries which may be regarded as tax havens.  When our Revenue Commissioners request information from countries with which we have such an exchange agreement in place, is there co-operation?  Is such information forthcoming?</p><p>  In regard to Montserrat, I note from the briefing notes provided by the committee clerk that our trade with it is very small - &euro;53,000 worth of trade in 2011.  I assume there are no administrative costs associated with having these agreements in place and that there are no countries which are too small, or deemed not significant enough, to have such agreements with.  </p><p>  The Minister of State might confirm if this is the first agreement of its type which we are signing up to with the United States.</p></speech>

Have the data protection issues been signed off on by our Data Protection Commissioner in regard to the exchange of such information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013012300003#B00700"><p>I understand the Revenue Commissioners are in discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner in terms of the enabling legislation, that there is not a dispute and that there should not be a difficulty in this regard.  Deputy McGrath is right in saying that it requires compliance on both sides.  It is worth saying in regard to this standalone agreement, that this is a requirement which the US had.  If I can be very crude about it, it was raising the bar because of its own considerations.  It was crucially important from our perspective that we were in there first, given the importance of trade relations and the very significant activity in terms of financial transactions between both countries and the number of US multinationals here.  Ireland is the fourth country to get it over the line.  I think the British were first.  It is important in terms of where our sphere of influence is and where we would like to keep it.</p><p>  The US Congress was proposing that companies which did not sign up to this could face very significant penalties.  From the perspective of where our interests lie and being in there quite quickly, it was very important that we made that agreement early on. </p> <p>It is to the credit of those behind me, the officials in Revenue and in the Department of Finance, that we have managed to get this over the line for what is a small diplomatic mission.</p><p> On the second issue, TIEAs are crucially important and make a huge difference in terms of our relationship with other countries.  Last year I spent some time at a conference in Paris with the OECD on the question of tax compliance and governance.  It has become a new norm that the more agreements one has in place, the greater the ranking in terms of transparency and accountability when it comes to tax evasion.  To answer the Deputy's question, it depends very much with whom one has the agreement.  There is not the same compliance with every country but we have found them a useful means through which the State can come to a relationship with other countries.  </p><p> On the Montserrat question, its national holiday is 17 March, the same as Ireland.  I am not sure if St. Patrick is the national saint but it is something we have in common.  However, I would point out that we do not have much trade in common.  I understand that in 2011 Montserrat was Ireland's 209th largest trading partner, total trade was valued at &euro;53,000, exports were valued at &euro;31,000 and imports at &euro;22,000.  It is clear we have a long way to go.  This agreement is important for Montserrat and it is important for Ireland and is another agreement we have forged.  We have a very ambitious target as I have mentioned to the committee previously about signing such agreements and the more we sign the better. </p></speech>

The financial institutions impacted by FATCA include banks, insurance companies in respect of investment services, cash value insurance contracts but not including insurance policies such as health, motor or life, where the policy has no cash value, investment funds, stockbrokers and investment planners.  The whole gamut of financial services would be affected.  Unless specifically exempted under FATCA requirements, Irish financial institutions will be required to register as a FATCA reporting institution.</p></speech>

It is great to see a good turnout of members and a packed Visitors Gallery.  The T&aacute;naiste is accompanied by Mr. David Donoghue, political director at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Adrian McDaid, Europe division - enlargement and eastern Europe, and Mr. D&oacute;nal Denham, director, Europe division, with responsibility for Presidency planning.</p><p>  Members and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the foreign affairs priorities for Ireland's EU Presidency which has got off to a great start.  We will be interested to learn about the Minister's approach to supporting the work of the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European External Action Service.  The European Union has an important contribution to make to conflict prevention and resolution and must ensure it finds an approach that maximises its effectiveness and coherence.  The challenges facing the Union in its external relations are considerable.  The joint committee has been monitoring with great concern the humanitarian crisis in Africa, the deteriorating situation in Syria and developments which are making the prospect of progress in the Middle East peace process much more remote.  We are interested to hear what the Government has to contribute during the Irish Presidency in the search for solutions in these areas.</p><p>  The committee will also meet the EU Special Representative for Human Rights in February.  We are interested to learn how Ireland will contribute during its Presidency to the promotion of human rights, including through the Office of the Special Representative.</p> <p> Development co-operation has long been a key component of Irish foreign policy and the record of the Department in this field is one of which we are justly proud.  The Presidency offers us an opportunity to help to make progress in this area and the T&aacute;naiste may wish to elaborate on his plans to contribute in this regard.  </p><p> An informal meeting of Ministers with responsibility for trade will also be held during the Presidency.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to provide an update on the United States-European Union trade agreement and progress in the recently commenced process aimed at achieving a trade agreement between the European Union and Japan.</p><p> In the context of the parliamentary dimension of the Presidency, the joint committee, in conjunction with the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, will host the interparliamentary conference on the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy at the end of the March.  We hope this will be an opportunity for parliamentarians to make a contribution to policy-making at EU and government level.  We look forward to the participation at the conference of the T&aacute;naiste and Baroness Ashton.  Without further ado, I invite the T&aacute;naiste to commence his presentation, after which we will have questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300003#B00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the joint committee on Ireland's Presidency priorities in the foreign policy area.  By way of introduction, I will refer briefly to our overall Presidency priorities before focusing more specifically on the areas of particular interest to the committee.</p><p>  As members are aware, our Presidency programme is built around the core priorities of stability, jobs and growth.  The Irish Presidency will be that of a recovery country driving recovery in Europe.  We will aim at restoring stability through effective implementation of the banking union proposals and economic governance measures such as the European semester process.  We will push ahead with legislation across the Europen Union's agenda that can stimulate jobs and growth.  We will focus strongly on promoting the digital economy.  We will support the President of the European Council in securing agreement on a multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the period from 2014 to 2020.  An adequate MFF is essential to underpin Europe's economic recovery, future growth and social cohesion.</p><p>  While our official Presidency programme sets out in detail the legislative and other priorities across all formations of the Council, the main priorities can be summarised as follows: securing stability; investing in sustainable jobs and growth; and Europe and the world, in particular, the importance of looking beyond our borders and engaging with global partners.  It is on the third priority that I propose to focus today. </p><p>  While this is Ireland's seventh EU Presidency, it is the first in the post-Lisbon treaty era.  The Lisbon treaty architecture has resulted in important changes to the role of the rotating Presidency in relation to foreign policy.  Essentially, the Presidency now plays a supporting rather than a leading role in the external representation of the European Union.  A key objective for our Presidency is to actively support the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and the European External Action Service in responding to current foreign policy and security challenges.  We expect the ongoing crisis in Syria, tensions across the wider Middle East, the Iranian nuclear dossier and instability in Africa to continue to feature prominently on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in the first half of 2013.</p><p>  Support for the Middle East peace process is, as members are aware, a key priority for Ireland nationally.  I hope to see the Foreign Affairs Council follow up as a matter of urgency on its conclusions of last May which considered, in particular, the implications of Israel's settlements policy for the achievement of the two-state solution.  We have also been emphasising for some time the need for the European Union to adopt a higher profile in pursuing overall political progress in the Middle East peace process.  We will continue to pursue this matter in the coming months on the Council.</p><p>  The situation in Syria is a source of deep concern to all of us.  President Assad's speech on 6 January was extremely dispiriting and offered nothing to the Syrian people in terms of ending the violence and repression and the long nightmare inflicted on them.  The priority for all in the international community must be to bring about an end to the violence and promote an overall political settlement, leading to genuine change and transition.  The European Union has been very active in highlighting the appalling human rights situation within Syria and making the case for accountability.  It has also contributed substantively to urgent humanitarian efforts.  Ireland has joined 25 other member states in endorsing a letter by the Swiss mission in New York to the President of the Security Council formally asking for a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p><p>  On the Iranian nuclear issue, Ireland is fully supportive of the twin-track approach, namely, negotiations combined with sanctions, being pursued by High Representative Ashton on behalf of what is known as the E3+3, consisting of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia and China.  It is very much in Iran's interests to engage seriously in the negotiation process and address the very real international concerns.  I hope we will see a more positive Iranian attitude in the next round of negotiations which is likely to be held in the coming weeks.</p><p>  I expect that developments in Mali, the wider Sahel region and north Africa will be a key focus for the Foreign Affairs Council in the period ahead.  The convening of an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week in Brussels in response to the rapidly evolving position on the ground highlights the seriousness with which the European Union views the position in Mali.  It supports rapid deployment of the African-led international support mission in Mali, AFISMA, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2085 and has committed to providing swift financial assistance for the mission.  The European Union also formally adopted a decision on 17 January to establish the European Union training mission for Mali which will be responsible for providing the Malian armed forces with military training and advice.  The mission is expected to be launched by mid-February at the latest.</p><p>  During the Presidency Ireland will work to promote implementation of the European Union's external human rights strategy, as set out in the EU strategic framework and action plan for human rights and democracy which was adopted on 25 June 2012.  Particular elements of the EU action plan which I hope will be achieved in the next few months include the adoption of EU guidelines on freedom of religion or belief and the development of new EU guidelines on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, persons.  I am pleased the European Union's Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis, will visit Ireland next month and will meet the joint committee during his visit.</p><p>  Ireland is also committed to working for more effective EU action at multilateral level on human rights issues.  This will apply, in particular, at the UN Human Rights Council, to which Ireland was elected for a three year term beginning on 1 January.  As a member state of the Council, we will be fully supportive of the work of the European External Action Service and will help the European Union to advocate effectively and coherently for the robust protection of human rights.  As High Representative Ashton has put it, human rights are the "silver thread" running through Europe's foreign policy.  We will work to ensure the European Union upholds its commitment to peace, democracy and human rights, despite the difficult financial circumstances which prevail.  These values are central to Ireland's foreign policy and will be central to our Presidency.</p><p>  The promotion of arms control through a strong international rule of law is another key foreign policy priority for Ireland and a further area in which we hope to provide support and encouragement for the European Union's work.  One of the major issues facing the international community during our Presidency will be the negotiations on an arms trade treaty which will take place in New York from 18 to 28 March.  Ireland believes a strong, comprehensive and legally binding treaty is urgently needed, one which will prohibit irresponsible arms dealing and further curb the illicit and grey markets in conventional arms.</p><p>  The second preparatory committee meeting in the 2015 review cycle for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty will take place in late April and early May in Geneva.  This meeting will assess the progress made to date in implementing the 2010 nuclear non-proliferation treaty action plan. It will also give states parties an opportunity to begin to look at possible outcomes for the next review conference in 2015.  We will watch very closely developments regarding the proposed Helsinki conference on a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  We hope further preparatory consultations in Geneva in the coming weeks will make it possible for the co-conveners to hold the conference within the first half of this year. </p><p>  We will also have in April a third review conference on the chemical weapons convention.  Ireland will act as EU co-ordinator for the preparations for this conference in The Hague where the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is located.  As recent threats from the Assad regime in Syria demonstrate, we can never assume complacently that these weapons will not fall into the hands of non-state actors or never again be used as a battlefield weapon.</p> <p>For this reason, it is important to ensure that the convention continues to function effectively, and the review conference will be an important event in that context.</p><p> Ireland has an established track record in the area of conflict prevention and we would like to see a reinforcement of capacity for this purpose at EU level.  Building on our successful chairmanship of the OSCE last year and on our national experience of conflict resolution in the Northern Ireland peace process, we have plans to highlight this issue in various ways during our Presidency of the EU.</p><p> Ireland has always been a strong advocate of an efficient and effective UN.  In recent years there has been ever closer co-operation between the EU and the UN in areas such as peacekeeping.  The EU also plays a critical role in the development agenda at the UN.  During our Presidency, we will work for stronger EU-UN relations, especially in the areas of crisis management and peace support operations, and we will work to ensure the EU speaks with one voice in international negotiations.</p><p> I know this committee takes a keen interest in developments in the western Balkans.  Enlargement is a key priority for the Irish Presidency and we will work to facilitate and advance the process for all candidates and prospective candidates.  The Presidency will prioritise a credible enlargement policy based on the principle of conditionality.  Ireland will oversee consideration of the final monitoring report on Croatia and we expect to see Croatia ready to join the Union on 1 July 2013.  For those countries currently in negotiations, the Presidency will work further to advance the ongoing accession negotiations with Iceland.  We will seek to open one or two chapters with Montenegro and push for progress on the rule of law chapters.  Progress on Turkey's accession will depend on the willingness of all parties - that is, the EU member states and Turkey itself - to facilitate this.  We are hoping to open at least one chapter, if that proves possible.  </p><p> The December European Council proposed returning in the first half of 2013 to the possibility of opening accession negotiations for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and for Serbia.  We stand ready to progress these areas during our Presidency, should the council so decide.  The December European Council conclusions also proposed returning, in the first half of 2013, to consideration of the possibility of granting candidate status to Albania and of opening stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Kosovo.  Both countries need to deliver on a number of outstanding reforms.  Their progress in achieving these will be reported on by the Commission and the High Representative.  Ireland is supportive of agreeing to grant candidate status to Albania following a positive report from the Commission and we are hopeful it may be possible to consider this during our Presidency.  Ireland also supports the negotiation of a stabilisation and association agreement with Kosovo and we will do our best to progress this during our Presidency, should the Council so decide.</p><p> Ireland is supportive of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU perspective.  However, the Bosnian Government and political leaders must make real and sustained progress in order to realise this.  While we will not have a direct role to play in the EU's relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina during our Presidency - this is now the responsibility of High Representative Ashton and the European External Action Service - we will, nevertheless, do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration.</p><p> Turning to the EU's development and humanitarian work, Ireland will liaise closely with the High Representative to ensure this agenda is efficiently progressed during the Presidency.  We will have a particular focus on three key issues.  First, we will work with the High Representative, the Commission and the member states to agree an EU position for the 2013 UN special event on the millennium development goals, MDGs.  The Irish Presidency comes at a critical time in advance of the UN special event and as work begins to shape the development framework after 2015, the target date for the MDGs.</p><p> The EU and its member states provide more than half of global development assistance.  Given the EU's central role, we believe it is important that the EU actively engages in the global discussion on the post-2015 development framework with a coherent and credible position.  To facilitate substantive discussion on this and other major development issues, we will, together with the High Representative, host an informal meeting of EU development Ministers in Dublin on 11 and 12 February 2013.  Second, we will use our Presidency to highlight the links between the thematic issues of hunger, nutrition and climate change.  Tackling hunger in the world's poorest countries is a cornerstone of Ireland's development programme.  This focus on fighting global hunger is rooted in Ireland's own famine experience but also in our analysis of the reality of poverty in the lives of people in the developing world.  We will host an international conference in Dublin on April 15 and 16 on the theme of hunger, nutrition and climate justice, with the aim of opening dialogue and debate on these linked challenges.  The conference is being organised in co-operation with the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, MRFCJ, the World Food Programme and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, CGIAR.</p><p> Finally, Ireland will use the Presidency to forge stronger links between emergency humanitarian relief and long-term development aid.  The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters is a major threat to long-term development and to the economic progress of poor people in developing countries.  Large-scale emergencies have occurred every year over the past decade, from the Darfur conflict which started in 2003 to the Horn of Africa food crisis in 2011.  As the number of such crises increases, the need to plan for them as part of our overall development assistance becomes more critical.  Ireland, during its Presidency, will work with its EU partners to build on the progress we have made in forging stronger links between humanitarian relief and development aid.</p><p> I would like to conclude with a few short comments on co-operation with the European Parliament.  The Lisbon treaty significantly altered the balance of powers within the EU institutions and, notably, gave the European Parliament an expanded and strengthened role.  An effective working relationship and a close partnership with the Parliament will be front and centre of our approach to the Presidency.  With this in mind, the Government has invested considerable time and effort in developing our contacts in the Parliament since it took office.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to brief the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs on our Presidency programme and I look forward to engaging with that committee as well as this committee in the months ahead.</p></speech>

Before I hand over to members, who I am sure will have a lot of questions on what is a very comprehensive programme, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on David Cameron's pledge today to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.  He has pledged to hold an in-or-out referendum between 2015 and 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300004#C00300"><p>It was a very significant speech by the Prime Minister, during which he set out a strong case for the importance of the UK's continued and active membership of the European Union, which is very welcome.  Obviously we will need some time to study the speech in all its detail and assess its full implications.  I do not think it is a speech to which we should give an immediate, knee-jerk reaction.</p><p>  Britain's relationship with the European Union poses significant strategic questions for the European Union itself as well as for Britain.  It also poses significant strategic questions for us as a country.  It is important, at the very outset, to make it clear that Ireland's position in, and relationship with, the European Union is not in question.  At the same time, we have a very special relationship with Britain.  We became members of the European Union at the same time.  It is 40 years since we both joined the then European Economic Community, EEC, and we have travelled that road very much together.  Irrespective of where this debate goes in Britain, it is important to recognise that Ireland's relationship with Britain will remain strong.  It is very much the case that Ireland, in any event, will remain at the heart of the European Union but will also remain close to Britain.</p><p>  The Prime Minister set out a roadmap and timetable whereby, after the next general election, if the current Government is re-elected, a referendum will be held at some stage during the lifetime of that parliament.  Ultimately that is a matter for the British people.  Obviously there will be a lot of debate about this but it is important that we are not distracted at this time from what the European Union needs to do.  The priority for the European Union at this time is to improve the European economy, create jobs and address the issues that are particularly urgent in Europe, including the issue of youth unemployment.</p> <p>Whether a young person is living in Glasgow, Genoa or Galway, if he is out of work his priority is to get a job.  That is what the European Union needs to be focused on and this is why the Irish Presidency has made such priorities of stability, jobs, growth, completing the decisions that were already made in respect of the banking union, and other matters which are about supporting and strengthening the European economy.</p></speech>

He noted that this is the seventh Irish Presidency.  The previous six were successful and we wish the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues every success during this Presidency.</p><p>  He remarked at the outset on the need to finalise the multi-annual financial framework.  We hope this can be resolved as quickly as possible.  It is the budgetary framework for the European Union for the coming years.  Naturally, the Common Agricultural Policy is of critical importance to this country, but the review of it cannot be finalised until the MFF is finalised.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate his thinking on the likely date for finalising the MFF and the Common Agricultural Policy review?</p><p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste expect to finalise a trade deal with Canada during the Presidency?  Will he indicate how far advanced these negotiations are at present?  Are there any particular sticking points in those negotiations?</p><p>  There has been much speculation on when the European Union and the United States will be ready to commence discussions on a US-EU trade deal.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give some indication of the likely timescale?  There was a suggestion in the media that Mr. Cameron planned to use the UK chairmanship of the G8 group to advance the agenda of a US-EU trade agreement.  Has the T&aacute;naiste been talking to his British counterpart about these proposals and how they might work?  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate how the talks on a US-EU trade deal can be progressed when the European Union is considering a data protection regulation that could make it more difficult and costly for businesses to transfer data between the European Union and the United States?  Has this subject been a matter of discussion and dialogue with the T&aacute;naiste's colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality?</p><p>  On a local note, I raise an issue relevant to the constituency I represent.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline how he plans to work with the British Government to make the G8 summit in Enniskillen, a town close to my home, a real cross-Border event?  It comes at a time when we hold the Presidency of the European Union and our neighbour, Britain, holds the chair of the G8.</p><p>  The briefing note correctly stated that the General Affairs and External Relations Council is largely driven by current events.  The T&aacute;naiste correctly referred in detail to the many trouble spots and said he was keen to give these troubled areas a higher profile.  We wish him success with this and I welcome the fact that a special meeting of the council was held last week on Mali and the difficulties that have emerged there.</p><p>  We are all aware - the T&aacute;naiste has referred to it himself - that Ireland's record on peace support and peacekeeping is second to none.  Our status in this regard has been recognised in the EU through the leadership roles Ireland has played in the EUFOR missions to Chad and the Central African Republic and in support of those who were fleeing the war and famine in Darfur.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline or expand on how we can build on this record and how we can play a leadership role in developing the EU's support of the UN?</p><p>  I welcome the fact that there will be a major conference on development in Dublin.  Will the T&aacute;naiste elaborate on his priorities for the April meeting and how it fits in with the millennium development goals?</p><p>  There is seldom mention nowadays of the World Trade Organization talks or the possibility of a plenary session.  This is critical not only for trade but for the developing world, although it sometimes tends to be left out of the equation when we discuss the absolute need for development and assistance for impoverished countries and the developing world.</p><p>  I imagine all members of the committee received correspondence today on EU enlargement, which the T&aacute;naiste has outlined as a key priority for the Irish Presidency.  There is some disappointment on the part of people who take a particular interest in Bosnia that it does not feature more specifically in our Presidency work programme.  We have had a long record of association with that country and with peace support operations there.  In addition, refugees came here in the 1980s and 1990s from Bosnia.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate why that particular accession issue is being left to the former EU High Representative there, Paddy Ashdown?  I understand he addressed this committee and he spoke about the dangers to stability in the region if the Bosnian issue is not given more attention and if there are not greater efforts to give some momentum to its possible accession to the European Union.</p></speech>

Perhaps he can give short answers, because there are many members who want to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300005#D00400"><p>I appreciate that.  Deputy Smith will be aware that the Commission initially made a set of proposals for a multi-annual financial framework or European budget for 2014 to 2020.  Ireland supported those proposals.  There were considerable differences among member states, some of which sought a reduced European budget while others wanted the Commission budget enlarged or in some cases an enlarged budget overall.  Within that, it is fair to say there were probably 27 specific positions of member states with differing priorities.  The Cypriot Presidency proposed a negotiating box.  Subsequently, the issue was taken on by President Van Rompuy, who made a set of proposals to a European Council meeting in November following consultations with member states.  The proposals involved significant reductions to the Commission's original proposals.  President Van Rompuy has been engaged in further discussions with heads of State and Government.  He briefed the Taoiseach and me when we met in Dublin a little over a week ago to discuss the progress of those talks.</p><p>  The European Parliament must approve the budget, and therefore there is also the issue of negotiations as it goes through the European Parliament.  I will attend the European Union Latin America summit later this week.  Present Van Rompuy will also attend and I expect to hold a discussion with him on the state of play of the proposals.  We hope he will be in a position to make a further set of proposals to the European Council meeting scheduled to take place on 7 and 8 February, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Smith that we need to get the MFF agreed as quickly as possible to clear the way for the discussions that must take place subsequently on the Common Agricultural Policy and other agenda items.  Approximately 70 tranches of legislation will arise from the conclusion of the MFF and it will be our responsibility as the Presidency holder to take these through the European Parliament.</p><p>  We have made a priority of negotiating trade agreements as part of our Presidency package on the jobs and growth agenda.  If trade agreements with the United States, Canada, Japan and other strategic partners are concluded, there is potential for the GDP of the European economy to grow by 2%.  There is considerable potential for economic growth but there are difficulties.  Deputy Smith asked about the prospect of a trade agreement with Canada.  There are issues arising which are of concern, including some with regard to beef and access to the beef market.  A high-level group was due to report before Christmas on a possible trade agreement with the United States.  It is due to report shortly and we hope it will be possible for the European Union to get a mandate to progress a trade agreement with the United States based on that.  Interestingly - this relates back to the Chairman's question - Britain shares Ireland's wish to see these trade agreements progress, because it is in our economic interest to do so.</p><p>  We are in touch with our British counterparts in respect of their plans for the G8 summit in Fermanagh.</p> <p>Obvious issues arise of which the Deputy will be aware and which will need to be discussed bilaterally.  It shines a light on the country and I hope it will have a positive outcome.  On the development issue, our Presidency is taking place at the same time as the UN special event on the millennium development goals.  Preparation for this event includes the informal meeting of development Ministers which will take place in February and which will be hosted by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  We are joint organisers with the Mary Robinson Foundation of an event which will bring together the themes of hunger, nutrition and climate change.  These are the areas which our development programme emphasises.  We will continue to have an active role in peacekeeping.  Our focus is European Union and UN co-operation in this area.  A seminar will be held in Ireland on this subject.</p><p> Bosnia-Herzegovina has an EU perspective but the Bosnian Government and political leaders in Bosnia must make real and sustained progress in order to realise this.  The lack of progress on reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially when compared with their neighbours, is a matter for real concern.  Ireland encourages Bosnian leaders to continue their efforts to find a solution, but it is for them to find agreement because it cannot be imposed.  While Ireland will not have a direct role to play during our Presidency, which arises from the provisions of the Lisbon treaty and the EU's relationship with Bosnia-Herzegovina, we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on their path to EU integration.  The road map agreed by Bosnian leaders last summer still stands, although some deadlines have been missed.  Nevertheless, it provides an agreed outline for getting to the point where an application for EU membership can be made.</p></speech>

What new actions will be taken during the Irish Presidency on youth unemployment?  Foreign and security policy is the main focus but I ask him to deal briefly with this topic.  The T&aacute;naiste stated previously that youth unemployment is a priority issue across the EU.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste has stated that Ireland will continue to pursue the issue of the Middle East peace process in the coming months.  How does the T&aacute;naiste plan to push this agenda?  What has been the effect of the outcome of the Israeli elections on the peace process?  The settlements were an issue during that election campaign.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to human rights in Syria.  He made the case for accountability and a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  Will the outcome be successful?</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about sanctions on Iran.  He hopes for a more positive attitude in the next round of negotiations to be held in the coming weeks.  Is it known how the sanctions are impacting on the Iranian people, particularly the poor?  There are reports about an economic downturn in the country.  The difficulty seems to be that the Iranian Government admits it is involved in uranium enrichment but not for weapons production.  On the other hand, the EU and others are of the opinion that the opposite is the case.  There seems to be very little information but we know that the sanctions are having a serious impact.</p><p>  Will Irish personnel be involved in the establishment of an EU training mission to Mali?  I refer to the event that occurred in Algeria.  We send our condolences to the families of those who died in those circumstances.  Will the T&aacute;naiste revert to the committee with a report on what happened in Algeria?  I refer to Stephen McFaul's account of how he escaped.  The response of the Algerians to the crisis is worrying.</p><p>  Herman Van Rompuy proposed a cut in the EU aid budget by 11%.  What is the Irish response to this cut?  Will this matter be raised at the next Council meeting in February?  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the negotiations on an arms trade treaty.  He said that he hopes also that it will be possible to include ammunition within the scope of the treaty.  I ask about spent uranium shells and the effect of same on populations in many of these regions.  He also said that as this review cycle proceeds, Ireland will look increasingly to the nuclear weapons states to demonstrate that they are serious about fulfilling their commitments to disarm.  Will the T&aacute;naiste recommend that the Israeli Government be asked to sign up, considering the favourable status it enjoys within the EU on this matter?</p><p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to elaborate on the point in his opening contribution about conflict prevention and mediation:<blockquote>Building on our successful chairmanship of the OSCE last year and on our national experience of conflict resolution in the Northern Ireland peace process, we have plans to highlight this issue in various ways during our Presidency of the EU.</blockquote>Perhaps the Taoiseach might elaborate on that area.</p></speech>

I wish him and the Government well for the Irish Presidency.  I note his mature political response to the suggestion by the Conservatives in Britain that they will have a referendum to pull out of Europe.  It is very clear that not only are most member states are disturbed at this development but so also is the United States of America which has issued stern warnings that it regards it as a retrograde step by Britain to even consider pulling out of Europe.  The US would rather see Britain remaining as a strong member of the EU.</p><p>  In his capacity as Minister with responsibility for trade, it is important that the T&aacute;naiste states loudly and clearly that Ireland is well used to having plebiscites and referenda on European treaties.  Time and again we have supported the treaties.  It may have been necessary to have a second vote on some occasions but we have always proven to be very loyal and supportive members of the European community.  In that context, given the important role of foreign direct investment in the world economy and given the nature of Ireland as an open economy, I trust the T&aacute;naiste to highlight at every opportunity to the world - particularly those non-EU countries seeking to make investments - that Ireland is in for the long haul within the European community and that we would welcome all forms of foreign direct investment to further the investment prospects of those who take the chance with us.</p> <p> I do not know whether the T&aacute;naiste has already congratulated Benjamin Netanyahu who has just won the general election in Israel, albeit in a weaker capacity.  I understand that some gains may have been made by the centre-left parties, which would be extremely progressive in the context of Israel.  A weaker coalition might temper Mr. Netanyahu's attitude to the role of Israel in the Middle East.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste's intention to engage with the new Government with a view to pursuing on behalf of Europe and Ireland the need to establish serious negotiations with the Palestinians within the region to bring peace?</p><p> We mentioned Algeria, which is one of many countries in north Africa confronted by terrorism by fundamentalist Muslim groups.  Countries across the region such as Mali, Mauritania, Niger and northern Nigeria, around the region of Kano where massacres have been reported, are also confronted by it.  There is a common thread regarding those carrying out their terrorist gangster activities from Algeria across the Sahara and into these various countries.  Can the T&aacute;naiste assure me that while the French saw their role as stalling the growth of terrorist movements in Mali, we will argue very strongly with both the Nigerian and Algerian Governments, which have the most powerful armies in the region, to work under the guidance of the African Union in conjunction with the UN to stymie and stall the growth of terrorism in that region?</p><p> I am delighted the Irish Government is taking a supportive stand on the candidate status of Albania.  I suppose we will be able to look at the outcome of its election process this year with a view to assessing its further determination to change with a view to entering the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300007#F00200"><p>The Chairman asked a question I intended to ask to which a very clear and authoritative reply was given by the T&aacute;naiste, namely, the proposal for an "In-Out" referendum by the UK Prime Minister.</p><p>  I will refer to a few things in the T&aacute;naiste's speech.  He referred to the conclusions of last May regarding the implications of the Israeli settlements.  I would put that in the context of the unprecedented and alarming expansion of those settlements and the commitment given by Mr. Netanyahu to do this in east Jerusalem, which would have serious implications for the possibility of a two-state solution.  In light of that, I wonder how this country can use the opportunity of the EU Presidency to put real pressure on Israel, particularly where one will have a weakened coalition Government or a strengthened centre-left.  The T&aacute;naiste took a very courageous and principled stand regarding settlement goods.  Will there be any action on that issue, particularly from the T&aacute;naiste, during our Presidency to advance the policy he announced of urging a ban on settlement goods in line with international law?  </p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the multi-annual financial framework.  Given the fact that the aid programme, particularly development aid, may experience a disproportionate cut in light of our commitment and very good track record in this area, to what extent will the T&aacute;naiste be able to use the Presidency to at least secure the level of existing funding if there is any possibility of using our position to ensure it remains as it is?  </p><p>  This committee was addressed in very passionate and moving terms by people in respect of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has taken an interest in that and we have passed resolutions concerning the wars and sexual violence and its use as a military weapon.  The motion about violence has been passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I have a substantial motion down at the moment and it looks as if there is all-party agreement but we have not received the nod from the T&aacute;naiste's Department.  We hope it will be a unanimously passed with all-party agreement.  Will the T&aacute;naiste be able to indicate fairly soon the attitude of the Department on this, which I imagine will be positive?  I believe the T&aacute;naiste also received communication from Oxfam on this subject but I gather he has not had an opportunity to reply to the letter yet.  </p><p>  My second last point relates to climate change.  At the talks in Doha, only a small number of EU countries - Germany, France and Denmark - made new climate finance pledges for 2013, while Ireland did not do so.  Can the T&aacute;naiste reassure us that we will give a climate finance pledge and, if so, when will this be?  </p><p>  My final question relates to biofuels, which many of us were na&iuml;ve enough to think were a solution to many problems, particularly energy.  They have had the unintended consequence of displacing people, particularly poor communities, in developing countries.  Will we use our Presidency to ensure the Commission's proposal on indirect land use change is strengthened and adopted so that the greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect land use change can be included in the calculation of the carbon footprint of all biofuels?  I think I asked six questions.  </p></speech>

I will start with Deputy Crowe's question on youth unemployment because there is no doubt that it is the big social and economic issue Europe must address.  Getting young people into employment means growing the European economy, which is why we have put a very strong emphasis on completing the Single Market.  There is a range of dossiers that remain to be completed in the Single Market that are being taken forward by the individual Ministers in their capacities as chairs of their various Council formations.  They include mobility of pensions.  There is one on a professional qualifications directive, while there is work being done on the digital Single Market, including e-signatures and cyber-security.  Specific dossiers and legislative proposals in these areas are being taken forward.</p><p>  The second issue concerns trade and I have already spoken about the potential for trade to grow the European economy.  The third issue is the completion of the decisions made in June on a compact for jobs and growth, which we want to see progressed and implemented and will be driving forward.  The fourth issue concerns proposals specific to young people.  A set of Commission proposals have been produced and will be dealt with by the Minister for Social Protection in her capacity as chair of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council.  A proposal for a youth guarantee to which we attach a lot of importance and to which the Minister for Social Protection hopes to get agreement, is included in that.</p> <p> On the Middle East peace process, it is hoped that, in the aftermath of the US presidential election and the elections in Israel, there will be an opportunity to make progress.  It remains to be seen whether the government formed following yesterday's elections in Israel will take a different position from that which has been adopted up to now.  If it does not do so, the question of external pressure will come centre stage.  A critical aspect in this regard will be the role the European Union will play.  Regrettably, Israel effectively is implementing certain settlement plans, which will render a two-state solution impossible.  The European Union must respond to this action.  That is why I hope that during our Presidency the Foreign Affairs Council will return to the conclusions reached last May on such settlements.  I hope it will also consider events in the region and whether meaningful discussions are under way in reaching a settlement.  We must respond in whatever way we can to what is taking place.  One of the options the Foreign Affairs Council may be obliged to consider is placing a ban on the importation of products originating in the settlements.</p><p> Ireland is now a member of the UN Human Rights Council.  In conjunction with our Presidency of the European Union, our membership of the Council is going to be important.  We will certainly ventilate our views on the action plan on human rights agreed last June.</p><p> The sanctions on Iran were introduced with a view to bringing that country to the negotiating table.  They had the effect of doing so, but when one gets to the table, one must negotiate.  There have been a number of rounds of E3+3 discussions and while there has been a great deal of talk, a satisfactory outcome has not been forthcoming.  This is a matter in respect of which we want to see progress being made.  We are very vigilant with regard to measures which might have a disproportionate impact on the Iranian people.  I reiterate, therefore, that the purpose of the sanctions was to bring Iran to the negotiating table and encourage it to negotiate.  The issue of its right to develop a peaceful nuclear energy programme is not in question.  However, that development must take place under the provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to which Iran is a party, and involve full implementation of the IAEA's safeguards agreement.  </p><p> The issue of Irish personnel serving on the EU training mission to Mali is being considered by the Minister for Defence.  If it is proposed that Irish personnel serve on the mission, the Minister will bring the matter to the Government.</p><p> In the context of heading 4 of the European Union aid budget, reference was made to cutting the budget.  It is important that we get matters right in this regard.  The proposed cut relates to the Commission's original proposals which we support.  They made provision for a substantial increase under heading 4 and in the context of the development aid budget of the European Union.  President Van Rompuy's current proposals would still involve an approximate increase of 8% in the European Union's overall budget for development aid.  They also make provision for a 2% increase in the European Development Fund, outside the main budget, and, at the request of the UNHCR, for the removal of the emergency aid budget from the main budget.  Again, there is a significant increase proposed in respect of the latter.  I am very familiar with these figures because I was involved in a lengthy discussion on this matter this morning with Mr. Bill Gates in his capacity as head of the Gates Foundation.  We are working closely with it in the context of our development programme.  Mr. Gates was very interested in being updated on where the discussions on the European Union budget stood.  These discussions are extremely significant because the European Union provides approximately 55% of the total world aid budget, making it the largest single contributor.  What happens with the European Union's budget is, therefore, hugely significant.</p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe also inquired about conflict resolution.  Ireland's experience in this area feeds into our commitment to prevent conflicts.  During our 2004 Presidency of the European Union we organised a major conference on conflict prevention and the role of civil society.  We have been consistent in the attention we have paid to this topic.  We will, of course, build on the lessons we learned in respect of this matter during our chairmanship of the OSCE.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne referred to the importance of trade, a matter on which I commented.  We are operating in a globalised economic environment and very much focused on attracting inward investment to encourage job creation.  We are also focused on promoting exports and trade out of Ireland.  Irrespective of the debate that takes place in Britain on its relationship with the European Union, we will be making it absolutely clear that Ireland's place is within the Union.  We will provide that certainty in this regard for investors and potential investors.</p><p> On the situation in Mali and the wider Sahel region, the European Union underlines the importance of maintaining stability in the region and on ensuring there will be no negative repercussions for neighbouring countries.  We have, therefore, reiterated our commitment to supporting Mali's neighbourhood states within the framework of our strategy for the Sahel region in order to strengthen their security and development.  The High Representative has been asked to present a Council decision immediately in order that an EU special representative for the Sahel region can be appointed rapidly.  It is vital to do everything possible to curb the growth of terrorism in the region.</p><p> I take the opportunity to roundly condemn the recent terrorist action in Algeria, namely, the seizing of hostages.  Some of the hostages were Algerians, while many others were from different countries.  Included among their number was an Irish citizen, Mr. Stephen McFaul.  The people involved were working at a particular installation which was seized by terrorists and their lives were put at risk.  Unfortunately, many of the hostages lost their lives.  I express my sympathy and that of the Government to the families of those killed.  We are still receiving reports on what actually happened in this instance, but it is clear that it was a very difficult situation.  When we have completed a comprehensive examination of the facts, it may be possible to make an assessment of what occurred.  There should be no doubt, however, that responsibility rests with the terrorists who seized the hostages.</p><p> I agree with Senator David Norris on the alarming nature of the building of settlements by Israel.  I have referred to the conclusions reached in this regard last May.  The issue of settlement goods will obviously have to be considered when the Foreign Affairs Council carries out its review of the conclusions.  As the Senator will be aware, I have referred to heading 4 of the European Union's multiannual financial framework, MFF.</p> <p>The issue of the DRC is under consideration by my Department and I expect it to be before the Foreign Affairs Council.  The Senator asked about climate change and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is handling those discussions.  He is in Brussels and I spoke to him earlier.  I might pass and get a letter for the Senator on the matter.</p></speech>

In consideration of that, I will ask only one question on the millennium development goals.  The next six months will be critical in developing a framework for the period after 2015.  There is a need to prioritise MDG 3 and MDG 4, relating to gender equality and empowering women, and child mortality.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste is planning a conference in April on hunger, nutrition and climate change.  Those are sustainability issues and such issues cannot be extracted from population issues.  We should prioritise family planning for the poorest women in the world.  It tends to be forgotten and regarded as something nice to do as soon as we have solved world hunger.  However, we will never solve world hunger if we do not deal with the population issues and give women some control over their fertility so that they can plan their families and space them in a way that is consistent with their ability to feed their children.  The reality is that it underpins the achievement of every other goal.  Healthy women mean healthy families.  Healthy families mean productive families.  Productive families mean productive societies, which is what we want to achieve.  I note the T&aacute;naiste is having an informal meeting in Dublin with the High Representative next month.  That may represent an opportunity to get across the importance we attach to family planning and those millennium development goals.  They should be an important part of targets within the new framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300009#H00500"><p>I take the opportunity to wish the T&aacute;naiste and his Government colleagues well in the next five to six months, which will be a critical time for Ireland and for the European Union.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's initial response to today's speech by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron MP.  We have our views on that and of course we cherish our relationship with the United Kingdom.  It is important to state that it is an evolving situation and our views on the matter will form over the coming months and years.  The responses I have read from employers in Britain have been largely negative about the proposition to be put to the British public after the next general election if the party in power at present returns with an overall majority.  It was good that the T&aacute;naiste took the opportunity to reaffirm and restate Ireland's commitment and determination to be at the centre of decision-making in the European Union because it is in our interest and in the interest of jobs, and our economy and society.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste said that Ireland had joined 25 other member states in endorsing a letter by the Swiss mission in New York to the president of the SECCO formally asking for a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  What is the status of that at the moment?</p><p>  I join the T&aacute;naiste in condemning terrorist activities in Algeria.  I commend him and his staff on the support they provided to the McFaul family during what was clearly an extremely difficult time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300009#H00600"><p>I also give the T&aacute;naiste my best wishes for the next six months ahead.  Wearing my AWEPA hat, I ask about the development aid budget.  I hope the various NGOs, which have been very concerned about what they saw as a real possibility of that budget being cut, are reassured by what the T&aacute;naiste said today that it is not being cut and will, in fact, increase.  It must be a priority for us that the poorest of the poor do not suffer in recessionary times.</p><p>  We have previously discussed the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion.  The policy document makes reference to VAT fraud etc.  A recent conference in Malawi addressed this area.  I acknowledge the work that Christian Aid and the Debt and Development Coalition have done.  We need to be a very strong voice in stating that we are not facilitating, allowing or contributing to multinationals not paying their just taxes in African countries and thereby robbing African countries of the benefits from their resources.</p><p>  I refer to the arrest and detention in Zimbabwe of the human rights activist Mr. Okay Machisa, who, I understand, is being held in leg irons at the moment.  Some years ago he brought to Ireland a photographic exhibition showing the violence associated with the previous elections in Zimbabwe.  President Higgins opened the exhibition.  A number of organisations support the call for this gentleman's release from jail.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to encourage our ambassador to South Africa, who presented his credentials in Zimbabwe, to be a supporter of free and fair elections in Zimbabwe when they come.  I know he is interested in promoting trade, which is fine, but we are not seen to be a presence at some of the human rights trials taking place in Zimbabwe.</p><p>  On enlargement, there is considerable support to encourage Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Kosovo.  There seems to be an attitude of letting the Bosnians look after themselves.  There is a real fear among analysts that within 20 years Bosnia and Herzegovina could be lost to both Serbia and Croatia.</p><p>  We talk about conflict prevention.  This is the group involved with human rights issues for prisoners in Northern Ireland.  We have been there and we are scheduled to meet the T&aacute;naiste.  It is unfortunate we were not able to meet before Christmas as the T&aacute;naiste had planned.  We need to look at what is happening in our own country.  There are issues in the North that are undermining the Good Friday Agreement.  They have been allowed to fester for nearly three years.  People, whose licences have been revoked, are in jail and no charges have been brought against them.</p><p>  In all our discussions and priorities we should include people with disabilities.  They do not get a heading and were not included in the millennium development goals.  We could be a voice on that issue.</p></speech>

He has a particularly heavy workload.  It is interesting that a recovery country is driving the recovery of Europe as he said in his address.  I very much welcome the commitment to putting investment in sustainable jobs and growth at the top of the agenda.  Is there anything that the T&aacute;naiste hopes to achieve during the six months that might be a game changer and might have an impact in Europe and in particular in our country given our high level of unemployment?  Are any innovative ideas being explored?</p><p>  The situation in Syria is of grave concern to us all.  While there is obviously agreement in EU countries on what needs to be done, does the T&aacute;naiste envisage any significant breakthrough being made in this conflict during the Presidency?  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any plans to drive some initiatives that might make a difference?</p> <p> I join with colleagues who have raised the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina's prospects within the EU.  I very much welcome the statement that this country is supportive of Bosnia and Herzegovina achieving membership eventually.  Would it be possible for the T&aacute;naiste to outline in more detail what the political leaders in Bosnia must do in order to make progress and assist their membership application?  There is grave concern that within a short period the country will face years of drift, division and further conflict unless there is more support for them within the EU.  Most committee members would wish that this country would not alone be supportive but would be seen to be so and helpful to the situation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well.  No doubt we will have further engagements during the course of the Presidency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013012300010#J00200"><p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste and Government well in the Presidency.  This country has an excellent record when holding the Presidency of the EU.  I hope our efforts on this occasion will at least emulate past performances in that regard.</p><p>  In the context of human rights the T&aacute;naiste referred to the adoption of EU guidelines on freedom of religion or belief and the development of new EU guidelines on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, persons.  What specific initiatives are involved under each of the headings?  We recently heard from the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, about the threat to homosexuals in Uganda and the committee discussed the persecution of Christians in Nigeria, across the Middle East and in other countries.  We also have discrimination against Christians within the EU.  It is much more subtle but, nonetheless, it exists.  I would like to see such discrimination rooted out.  I am interested in hearing what exactly the T&aacute;naiste is doing in that regard.</p><p>  I wish to follow up on a point made by Deputy Mitchell on sustainability and population planning.  It is a significant issue in Africa in particular.  I expect family planning education is a significant part of it.  However, I am also aware that sometimes family planning and reproductive health are euphemisms for abortion, which is one of the greatest infringements of human rights.  In America, 500,000 abortions take place every year and in Britain it is 200,000.  That is a significant issue.</p></speech>

I wish to relate it specifically to a point made by the T&aacute;naiste on his engagement with Bill Gates today.  The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is involved in measures involving the euphemisms to which I referred.  Sometimes in the western world we are inclined to impose values.  We have significant challenges such as crime levels, including murder, drug addiction and suicide.  I am concerned about imposing western values on Asian or African countries.  I urge that we would be careful in our policies and the approach we take and with whom we align ourselves.  It is not just all about money.  There should be an ethical and moral underpinning of the policies we pursue.</p><p>  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste &ndash; a former active member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, PGA, in the House &ndash; on the support he and the Government have given, and in particular our representatives in the UN, to the negotiations on the arms trade treaty, ATT.  It is imperative that the treaty is concluded and agreed in the March meetings.  I give the T&aacute;naiste every encouragement although I am aware that he does not need it as he is motivated to deal with it himself.  I like the suggestion that it would be possible to include ammunition as part of the ATT.  That would be a welcome development because much of what is happening in the arms trade is ending up in the hands of people who use it for the most foul of human rights violations, in some countries often even against their own people.  I applaud the T&aacute;naiste in that regard.</p><p>  I wish to endorse a point made by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan on Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It is good to see that we are actively pursuing countries, in particular in the Balkans where Europe failed so miserably to deal with issues there 20 years ago.  I am pleased that we are now working to get those countries to become part of the European Union.  Bosnia has to some extent been left behind.  I accept there are political and other difficulties in the country, but the accession of Croatia will have economic consequences for Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The High Representative, Mr. Inzko, when he addressed the UN Security Council recently, said Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot afford to continue falling further and further behind other countries in the region.  He said the consequences of that would be dire economically, socially and politically.  Mr. Paddy Ashdown, who was the first High Representative, who did so much in the early stages of the peace process there is on record as saying that the policy of the international community in recent years has been utterly disastrous.  He said Europe absent-mindedly found itself being the instrument for the realisation of the plans of Karadzic.  I ask that we would give some leadership during our Presidency to try to make progress on Bosnia and Herzegovina that I hope would lead to a situation where it too can be a suitable candidate for joining the EU in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>

Ireland is strongly committed to the achievement of both of those goals.  That is why one of the major initiatives in the development programme is the SUN, scaling up nutrition, programme.  It is based on the first 1,000 days of a child&rsquo;s life, including the time spent in the womb, which is critically important.  I have worked closely, for example, with the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, on it for the past two years.  We are pleased the programme has now been very much mainstreamed in the UN system and is very much a cornerstone of the initiatives that are now being taken to address hunger and nutrition.  I expect it will form part of the conference we will have in April.  Similar to the approach taken to addressing hunger, in respect of gender equality we are focused on supporting smallholders in Africa where 80% of smallholdings are headed by women.  We are actively working on the capacity of smallholdings to sustain families, households and to generate income for poor families.</p><p>  We make no apology for supporting family planning programmes which liberate women, protect their health and in many cases protect their lives.</p> <p>That is an area in which we collaborate with the Gates foundation and it was one of the issues I discussed with Mr. Gates in reviewing the programme and the joint work we were doing.  In that regard, we do not often see results in development work.  Results can be very slow in coming through.  One of the issues on which the Gates foundation is focused is the eradication of polio which has now been eradicated in all but three countries of the world.  There are no more cases in India and the figures are down in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria.  One of the issues we discussed was the prospect of driving on to completely eliminate them.  This is now an achievable objective for the development programmes of countries such as Ireland, the European Union and a foundation such as the Gates Foundation.  We are seeing results from the development programme.  In the review of the millennium development goals we must see where we are and what more needs to be done.  There will be a special event at the United Nations in September and, as we hold the EU Presidency, we will prepare, in so far as we can, a co-ordinated European Union position, given the scale of its contribution to development funding.</p><p> On Syria, a matter raised by Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Gerald Nash and Senators David Norris and Michael Mullins, this is an issue that is very much at the top of the agenda for the European Union Foreign Affairs Council, as I expect it will be for some time.  The first aspect to consider is the scale of the slaughter.  The estimate, to date - some say it is conservative - is that 60,000 people have been killed, 600,000 have been driven from the country into refugee camps and 2 million have been displaced from their homes.  It is a huge humanitarian crisis.  </p><p> We continue to support the work Dr. Brahimi is doing and I had an opportunity to meet him here just before Christmas.  We were pleased to be able to host the meeting he was able to have with Secretary of State Clinton and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, in the margins of the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting.</p><p> Of the things we need to do - it is one of the reasons Ireland is among the countries taking a lead position in calling for the reference of what is happening in Syria to the International Criminal Court - the message must go out loud and clear to those responsible for the slaughter in Syria and those directing it that there will be a day of accountability for what they are doing.  I am not immediately optimistic, however, that the Security Council will make that reference because we know about the difficulties at the Council in getting agreement on these issues, but the fact that a very large number of countries, including 25 of the member states of the European Union, are looking for this reference sends a clear message to those responsible that their day will come to account for the slaughter taking place.  I hope it will have the effect of causing it to be reduced.</p><p> I thank the members who complimented the staff of my Department on their handling of the kidnapping in Algeria.  I am delighted that Mr. Stephen McFall is free and well, but, unfortunately, many of his co-workers were not so lucky.  The accounts he has brought home of what happened are chilling.</p><p> On the European aid budget mentioned by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, the figures I quoted are still very much in play.  There has been no agreement yet on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  The 8% figure I mentioned is the latest proposal on the table, but it has not been agreed to.  We will not have a budget until we have agreement, but I did not want the message to go out that the current state of play represented a reduction.  It does not, but we are still a distance from agreement.</p><p> On the tax issues involved, Ireland is opposed to tax avoidance and evasion.  We are fully compliant with internationally agreed standards on tax transparency.  There is a wider issue in respect of tax matters that must be addressed at United Nations, European Union and multilateral level and we are committed to engaging in that regard.</p><p> On the issue of Zimbabwe, we will have it looked at by the embassy and our ambassador in Pretoria.  On the issue of Bosnia raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and Senators Michael Mullins and Jim Walsh, regarding the issues that need to be addressed, as I mentioned, a road map was agreed to by Bosnian leaders last summer.  That is the outline to get them to a point where they can make an application for EU membership.  Among the issues involved is a requirement to bring the constitution into line with the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.  Once credible efforts have been made in that regard the European Council will consider final ratification of the stabilisation and association agreement.  There is also the issue of the establishment of an effective EU co-ordination mechanism to ensure the country is able to speak with one voice on European Union matters and can make the best use of EU pre-accession assistance.  Once these issues have been addressed it may be possible for Bosnia-Herzegovina to submit an application for membership, but I emphasise that we would like to see progress made on this issue, as the Irish Presidency does not want to see Bosnia-Herzegovina left behind.  We encourage movement and will work to that end.</p><p> Senator Jim Walsh asked for specific initiatives in the context of freedom of religion and beliefs and LGBT rights.  We will be seeking consensus on an extension of a strong, independent mandate for the European Union rapporteur on freedom of religion and beliefs.  In respect of LGBT rights, we will be working towards the development of new EU guidelines on the rights of LGBT persons.</p><p> I agree with Senator Jim Walsh on the need for a strong arms trade treaty.  There is a strong sense within the international community that a comprehensive and robust arms trade treaty is within reach.  A final conference will be held in March to agree to such a treaty and the European Union is now finalising its approach to the negotiations.  Ireland will work with its EU partners and other like-minded countries to reach agreement on a treaty that will provide for the highest possible standards.</p></speech>

The joint committee will hear from two organisations and two individuals.  On its behalf, I welcome Dr. Derek Freedman and Ms Linda Latham.  From Doras Luimn&iacute; I welcome Ms Patricia Stapleton, anti-trafficking officer, and Ms Okeremute Okeregha, legal officer; and from Gay Men's Health Service, I welcome Mr. Michael Quinlan, manager, and Mr. Daniel McCartney, researcher, Gay Health Network.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear from the representatives of each organisation and individual who will make opening remarks for five minutes or thereabouts, as we have received the submissions, which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p><p>  Before we begin, I draw attention to the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I ask everyone to switch off his or her mobile phone.  Leaving it in silent mode is not good enough because it interferes with the recording system; therefore, it should be switched off completely.  </p><p>  I invite Dr. Freedman to make his opening statement.  I understand he is making a Powerpoint presentation.</p></speech>

I have been in genito urinary practice in Dublin for close on 40 years in St. James's Hospital and my practice in Ranelagh.  I have spent most of my time in my practice in Ranelagh.  </p><p>  Essentially, we have a lot of data and information on sex workers but very little on clients, which is obvious because it is difficult to get to study them as a group.  I see clients as patients, but who are they?  Everybody is represented - it is the man in the street, from Members of the Oireachtas to down and outs.  There are no exceptions, which is something we have to bear in mind.  The issue impacts on the entire population.   </p><p>  Hooking up, as it is called in the United States, is easy through the Internet, media, mobile phones and parlours.  There is very little happening on the street now compared to when I started in practice, partially because of the Irish weather but also owing to the Internet and mobile phones, as people work out of apartments and hotels. </p><p>  A question one might ask is: why do people go to prostitutes?  Sometimes they go out of curiosity but alcohol is probably the biggest factor.  People go out, drink too much, struggle on their way home, go down streets where prostitutes may be available or go into so-called night clubs.  Sometimes we see big groups; this was particularly the case when the construction boom was at its height, during the builders' holidays after Christmas, and trips to Thailand were common.  The committee will be aware of how plasterers work as a team.  On one occasion a full team came to me and said to me they had been to Thailand.  It also happens at stag parties.  However, alcohol remains a common denominator.  </p><p>  Another group may suffer from sociophobia; they cannot make contact and meet people and do not have the necessary social skills.  They may be very good in other social contexts, but when it comes to being intimate, they do not have the ability to make the jump to be close to somebody.  </p><p>  Loneliness is another factor.  People can be very lonely and have nobody to contact them.  Once they start, they can become addicted.  I see quite a number of people each year who admit they have become addicted to using prostitutes and sex workers, the Internet and so on.  They need a particular intervention to help them.  </p><p>  There is also the occasional person who is a sociopath, somebody who has no concept of the consequences of his or her behaviour.  One could ask why this is the case when sex is so readily available in Dublin.  One only has to go to Temple Bar, Kilkenny or anywhere else-----</p></speech>

Sometimes they are just seeking comfort.  I do not know if any of the members of the committee has seen the Visconti film, "The Leopard", in which the prince deals with social change in Italy - Sicily - at the time of Garibaldi.  In his family there is complete coldness.</p> <p>At the end of the film, he walks down town to a woman whom he obviously visits frequently and who actually talks to him and gives him comfort in times of stress.  We must appreciate that many people do receive comfort.  Many of the girls and men say much of what they do is not just providing sex but actually giving comfort to people.</p><p> There is a social stigma and a barrier associated with the use of sex workers.  People do not feel it is the right thing to do, but when they break that barrier, there is the potential to be hooked.  We are probably most interested in the public health consequences.  The reality is that sexually transmitted infections are rare among the thousands of clients of sex workers I have seen during the years, particularly those who use sex workers from western Europe, North America and Australia.  One is safer with a professional than a gifted amateur.</p><p> Where there has been contact in South-East Asia, eastern Europe or Africa, in particular, there are substantial risks.  The consequences in practice are anxiety, stress, guilt, remorse and a great fear of infecting a spouse or partner.  This can be overwhelming or disabling.  On occasion, we have had to have patients admitted for psychiatric care because the stress, anxiety and remorse was so overwhelming.</p><p> When a patient comes to us, our aim is not just the elimination of infection.  The WHO has a much wider perspective on sexual health that involves the enhancement of the expectation of a good and full sex life.  Our aim in checking for infection is merely the technical one; the real aim is the preservation of the marriage, relationship or family unit.  What we never want to happen is for a stupid drunken night out to destroy a family unit.  We try to identify underlying causes such as addiction, sociopathy, inadequacy and alcohol, but we do not want to destroy the family.</p><p> In that context, one of the subjects of debate is the concept of criminalising the client.  One must think extremely carefully before doing so.  It would certainly make our rehabilitation work much more difficult.  If people are not only fearful of infection but also of a criminal charge, the consequences for their health, particularly their psychological and psychiatric well-being, could be immense, especially since there are inadequate health service resources to deal with the actual problems we face rather than anything else.  We all like solutions, but we sometimes like simple solutions and believe certain approaches are obvious.  However, at the hard end of an STD clinic life is much more like a scrambled egg.  There are many things going on and the simplistic solution does not work.</p><p> We need to set boundaries for both the client and the sex worker to protect both.  We must protect the client from the pushers and the sex worker from the serpents, the pimps.  That is the context in which we should examine this problem and the surrounding legislation.  We must seek to protect people from harm, be it caused by oneself or others.  It is well recognised that trying to eliminate sex work or prostitution, irrespective of how broadly one defines it, is really trying to take away something that has always been part of society.</p></speech>

The point I am making quite clearly is that sex workers are professionals and look after their business.  They use protection and infection through them is rare.  Studies of sex workers carried out extensively in many countries have shown that when a sex worker acquires an infection, it is much more likely to be acquired from a boyfriend or pimp than an actual client.</p></speech>

I have no specific data and I am speaking from experience of having seen many patients over a long period.  I do not always believe what I am told, but I always screen for the full set of infections to ensure nothing is missed.  Many people come to see me who have paid for sex but who would certainly be hesitant to admit it.  Most say they picked somebody up at a bar or club, or another place of that nature.  I have been to many bars and clubs and certainly never been picked up or received an offer; therefore, one must certainly take what people say with a pinch of salt in any walk of life, particularly when one is taking a sexual history.</p></speech>

I have discussed this with him before and I do not accept quite a number of his basic premises, particularly the idea that because prostitution has always existed in society we should somehow be persuaded against criminalising the purchase of sex.  All sorts of human behaviour has been around for a long time but it does not stop us from seeking to regulate, restrict or prohibit it where we feel harm is being done.</p><p>  Dr. Freedman said he did not think it was a good idea to criminalise the client exclusively, but under the 1993 Act, although the purchase of sex is not an offence, clients are criminalised in other ways.  Doras Luimn&iacute; will make a presentation on the targeting of clients by the garda&iacute; in various operations they have had, notably in Limerick but elsewhere too.  That is already there.  Is Dr. Freedman's objection to the exclusive criminalisation of the client?</p></speech>

We are looking at the Swedish model.  Some of us visited Sweden, saw it in operation and spoke to many of the stakeholders.  We were very impressed by it.  We were impressed not only by the enormous benefit it has provided to former sex workers, who had been the sellers of sex, but also to the positive good in society.  I was struck, in particular, by what we heard about Swedish law enforcers.  When they arrest a client for the purchase of sex - they are not arresting the seller anymore because the sale of sex is no longer criminalised, so she is protected by the law in a way that she is not here - they also offer the client social services and support mechanisms to deal with some of the issues raised in Dr. Freedman's presentation which may have motivated him in seeking to buy sex.  It is not just a criminal procedure.  They have built into that supports to try to prevent reoffending by the client, which I thought was impressive.  It is not all criminal justice in that there is another motivation to it too.</p><p>  The main point is that the Swedish approach protects sellers of sex - the sex workers - from the harm and exploitation that many people who work in the front line say is inherent in the act of prostitution, and I am looking at Ms Linda Latham's presentation.  Harm reduction models such as those advocated by Dr. Freedman and others, under which one does not criminalise the purchase of sex, sidestep that fundamental issue.  Is the act of prostitution itself harmful and exploitative of the mostly women involved in it?  I am sorry; that became a very long question.</p></speech>

I am strongly in favour of decriminalisation.  What I was trying to put forward was the concept of setting boundaries of what is and is not acceptable.</p><p>  The Swedish model is very attractive, as presented in Sweden, but this is not Sweden and this is not Swedish society.  Swedish society is different and is very controlled.  In terms of STIs, for instance, there is compulsory notification.  If one catches chlamydia, one's doctor must make a list of all one's partners, which is then notified to a public health authority.  It then becomes part of the public remit.  That is the type of very tight control that exists there.</p><p>  Senator Bacik is implying - it would be an absolutely marvellous idea - that if clients are taken into the system, they would be helped to deal with their problems.  Since we are doing so poorly at protecting our children, I do not think I could see resources being applied to protect the clients of prostitutes at this time.  This would be a very idealistic thing.  I deal with people on the ground who have problems, and we have to face that.</p><p>  In a presentation made here in the autumn, people from Sweden said they were happy that they had virtually eliminated street prostitution.  We have done that here through the mobile telephone, the Internet and the Irish weather.  When I was thinking about this, I googled the words "Stockholm" and "escort" and got 2 million hits, so the problem has not been eliminated or dealt with in Stockholm.  I never did see many people come back to me having had sex worker exposure in Scandinavia at any time, and there certainly has not been any sort of change.  One sees the odd one and they are readily available.</p></speech>

It probably came from a different perspective from that to which we have been exposed in regard to the Norwegian or Swedish model, which is also in place in Iceland and other countries.  This committee is trying to garner evidence to see what we can do about the problem.  There are dark sides, such as the terrible situation of women being trafficked for prostitution and the safety of women in many instances.  We do not have the Swedish model or the Amsterdam model; in one sense, it is a sort of underground and turn-a-blind-eye model.</p><p>  What would Dr. Freedman say to the committee, which has no particular agenda, on the introduction of laws or regulations which would make it better for society?  Does he feel a Swedish model is unlikely to work?  Would he suggest what is done in Amsterdam and other cities, where the industry is very transparent, workers are registered and so on?  What could we do to stop the terrible trauma and crime of trafficking women and the exploitation of women?  How can we protect women without damaging the workers?</p><p>  I accept some of what Dr. Freedman said in regard to the effect on men who have addictions or psychological difficulties.  I am not saying I condone it, but Dr. Freedman, as a medical person, has dealt with such people.  What should this committee do to make the situation in Ireland better?</p></speech>

Senator O'Donovan has hit precisely on the correct points in that what we should be looking to do is to protect people from harm - in particular, to protect sex workers from exploitation and trafficking - and to protect under-age people.</p> <p>We must put our resources into helping these people develop their lives into something different from sex work, which is a short cul-de-sac in anybody's life.  We need to be sensitive in order to protect and acknowledge the dynamics of why people become sex workers.  We need to ensure that if the clients of sex workers become exploitative or violent or display confrontational behaviour, they feel the full weight of the law and society upon them.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presentation and I appreciate that it is a perspective the committee needed to hear.</p><p>  With regard to protecting people in the sex industry, does Dr. Freedman advocate the legalisation of prostitution?  I do not necessarily mean the Amsterdam model, which is the most noteworthy legalised version.  Does he advocate legalising prostitution in a similar manner?</p></speech>

As Members sit here they are focused on legalisation and the law, but I deal with and see human beings and human behaviour.  The law sets barriers and protection and that is what the committee needs to do.  The Amsterdam model would be totally inappropriate for Irish society.  Heavy criminalisation would be equally inappropriate for the occasional person who needs or desires the services of sex workers, where no harm is done.  We all seem to think that prostitution, in neon letters, equals exploitation and degradation.  It is my feeling and understanding over the years that prostitution has a much wider context.  We all prostitute ourselves in some ways, or rather for different advantages and different things.  Some do it for money, some do it for sex and some do it for advantage.  It is all part of the wide spectrum of human behaviour.</p></speech>

He brought a different perspective to the debate when he outlined what motivates the clients of sex workers.</p><p>  As Oireachtas Members, we have been lobbied and received many representations on this subject.  Obviously we have received representations from organisations who work on the front line with prostitutes and sex workers.  We have also had representations from immigrant groups, women's groups, domestic violence groups and trade unions.  All of them have asked us to understand that it is unacceptable for a man to purchase the services of a woman, that it is exploitative, and that it cannot be described as work under any international definition of work.  Dr. Freedman gave a compassionate assessment of what motivates individuals.  In contrast, according to the organisations I listed, sex work is a cause of profound injustice and exploitation and is a global challenge for all parliamentarians and societies.  What are Dr. Freedman's thoughts on the matter?</p><p>   My understanding of the Swedish model, although I may be wrong, is that where a man - or a woman, which happens in much rarer circumstances - is caught purchasing sex, he or she has the option to make an admission and receive a fine, thus avoiding court.  Therefore, the name-and-shame element or disruption of the family does not happen.  Only one case has ever gone to court and the rest made an admission and received a fine.  </p><p>  There is another aspect.  When we met practitioners such as the police and social services, particularly the latter, their approach was to offer men assistance with what they defined as a problem in the form of counselling.  This was to ensure that the client, who is almost always a man, can understand why he needed to avail of the services of a sex worker.  What does Dr. Freedman think of both issues?</p></speech>

I heard an interesting plenary talk at a meeting of the International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections, IUSTI, in October by Professor Sevgi Aral, who had studied in the Ukraine.  Her report was interesting and the findings were stunning to me.  She reported that rather than being recruited by pimps, the girls approached the pimps asking to be put on their books because they wanted to work.</p> <p>There is not one universal model.  The workers do not fit the stereotypes.  The way some of the girls who were workers spoke at the meeting in the Department of Justice and Equality in October was not talk of being exploited.  I do not believe that all of the workers fit into this stereotype.  There is a much wider spectrum of people doing sex work.  Some people may be doing it and not even know in certain social contexts.</p><p> The second point refers to what the Deputy described as happening in Stockholm.  About 20 or 25 years ago, during a World Health Organization fellowship in Stockholm, I saw the way the systems work there, and they are admirable.  It was very interesting.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s in particular there was tremendous social support.  In the hospitals in Sweden I saw some of the worst cases of deprivation, including cases of skin ulcers and frostbite, that I have ever seen, because people who had fallen through the network had fallen to the ground and there was no support.  If someone was in the system it was fantastic but if he or she fell out of the system it could be much worse than anything one could imagine.  I would be afraid the same thing would happen here.  When I was in Sweden we saw the wonderful clinics, the systems and the contract tracing but if someone fell out of that system he or she could be lost.  I am afraid the Deputy may have been shown the system but perhaps not what happens in the apartments, hotel rooms and so on.  There is a much wider context.  It may not be quite as ideal as what he was shown, and nothing I have heard from my colleagues who work in STI clinics - which are at the hard edge in terms of seeing people who avail of services - tells me there has been any major change.</p></speech>

In the course of proceedings he may have answered some of my questions.  I ask him to forgive me in advance for that.  It might sound discourteous to ask a question which the doctor has already answered.</p><p>  Dr. Freedman made reference to the idea that were we to criminalise the purchaser of persons for sex, it might impel some kinds of vulnerable unfortunate - what we might call sad types - to harm themselves in some way.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Freedman favour such social messaging?

She attended regularly and there were no problems other than a significant infection.  She met somebody and stopped working, and her family were outraged because they had become used to the money.  What happens in some cases is that while some of the clients are addicted to the sex, some of the workers become addicted to the money.  This is not a case of one simple answer fits all.  There are so many strains and threads of human behaviour that work through this; the purchase of sex for money is just one manifestation.  I remember reading an article in The Observer many years ago about a wife who discovered her husband was using sex workers.  She asked him what was going on and then said she would go with him.  She went with him and suddenly realised that the sex worker was talking to the person, putting the person on a pedestal and making him feel good.  She bailed out rapidly and it gave her a considerable insight into relationships.</p></speech>

However, neither do they use the term "sex worker" because they believe it sanitises something which should be socially discouraged.  It tends to use the term "a person in prostitution".  I was wondering whether the term "sex worker" implies some kind of attitudinal neutrality?</p><p>  Does Dr. Freedman believe that in the effort to combat trafficking there is none the less a strong argument that if we criminalise the purchase of sex we inhibit a certain category of people from going with persons in prostitution because they now know that what is going on is illegal?  However one deals with it, whether it is a case of the Probation Act or some kind of merciful sanction to take account of the vulnerability or inadequacy of some of the clients Dr. Freedman describes, making it illegal in itself might help make the country a colder house for traffickers.</p></speech>

That could have some practicality in currency, but it is exactly what I was saying about protection and the setting of a boundary.  That would have some currency in my mind.</p><p>  I concur with what the Senator says about the use of the term "sex worker" or "prostitution".  People sometimes use the word "promiscuity", but what does that mean?  Is it twice a day, three times a year or four times a night?  There is no definition.  It is a pejorative term and it would be much nicer if we had other ones.</p></speech>

I am anti-trafficking officer with Doras Luimn&iacute;, a migrant rights NGO based in Limerick.  I am speaking from the perspectives of our outreach work with those in prostitution in Limerick and our case work with victims of trafficking.  It is a two-pronged approach.  We thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.  Doras Luimn&iacute; is an independent NGO working to support and promote the rights of migrants living in the Limerick area.  Doras Luimn&iacute; is also a member of the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.  We work on integration, advocacy, immigration advice and support, racism and anti-trafficking.  </p><p>  From our experience, the majority of women who are engaged in street prostitution in Limerick are migrant women.  Our multi-agency outreach initiative was formed in 2011 amid growing concerns about the increase in on-street prostitution and the visibility of migrant women in Limerick.  Additionally, the need for support became apparent due to the marginalised and stigmatised nature of the work and the lack of support via mainstream services for those engaged in it.  Our concerns for this cohort are shared by other service providers in the Limerick area.</p><p>  Outside Dublin, Limerick has recorded the highest number of detections of prostitution and brothel-keeping in the Republic.  We have encountered mostly migrant eastern European women in the course of our outreach in Limerick City.  The indoor sex trade, as advertised on escort websites, consists of Irish, European and non-EEA nationals.  Arguably, prostitution is very complex.  The reasons people become involved are varied.  However, we will not expand on this today as I believe this has been well covered in previous sessions.</p><p>  Our concerns are shared by other local organisations and we relate them to the committee briefly as follows.  Upward of 90% of women working in on-street prostitution in Limerick are migrant women.  Some of the women appear to have little or no English and have trouble communicating the most basic information to non-customers.  The women involved appear to be quite young, between the ages of 18 and 24, and sometimes we guess they are younger.  There appears to be a high level of transnational organised crime involved in the prostitution industry in Limerick.  Some women have worked in several European countries prior to working in Ireland.  This increases our concern in regard to trafficking and the likelihood that they were trafficked as minors.  High levels of mobility are indicative of human trafficking.  We know that those who organise prostitution use different means to control women or coerce them into selling sex, varying from subtle manipulation to outright extreme violence.  The families of these women often enter into an agreement with the suspected traffickers whereby the girl or woman involved is brought to Ireland and is then in a position of debt bondage.  These women continue to be criminalised by the existing legislation.  Penalties are usually in the form of a fine.  We have had cases of migrant women from non-EEA countries - mostly Brazilians and Africans - who are involved in off-street prostitution and advertise via web-based escort agencies.  Through Operation Quest in 2012, one woman came to our attention as a victim of trafficking.</p><p>  We believe, in light of the above, that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 has had an adverse affect on the people who work in prostitution, mostly women.  The prostitution industry has changed considerably since 1993, with most prostitution being organised through the Internet and mobile telephones.  We are aware that migrant prostituted women in Limerick work in both on- and off-street environments.  Their business is a combination of Internet trade, via websites such as Escort Ireland, and the street trade, often through the organisation of criminal gangs.  The minority of Irish women we have encountered appear to be drug users and operate by themselves or with their partners.</p><p>  As the committee is probably aware, the Garda in Limerick responded to on-street prostitution in 2011 by launching Operation Freewheel.  Some 27 men were arrested under the 1993 Act for solicitation.  This operation is still ongoing.  Due to its effects, street-level prostitution has decreased somewhat in the past year.  However, the indoor sex trade continues to flourish and indoor prostitution in Limerick is considered to be rampant.</p><p>  Based on our experience, we recommend the criminalisation of the buyers of sex in line with the Swedish model.  This appears to have had the necessary deterrent effect, as evidenced in Limerick in the past year.  It would also have the effect of deterring families from consenting to exploitation and trafficking of their daughters, wives, sisters or mothers.  If a country is not seen as a soft touch for prostitution and sex trafficking it will become a less attractive destination.  We recommend increased penalties and custodial sentences for persons who profit from the organisation and control of prostitution - pimps, landlords and those who recruit women abroad for the purposes of prostitution.  We also recommend that those who work - who are mostly women - should be decriminalised, as they are the ones who are prostituted.  The level of vulnerability and exploitation cannot be overestimated.  We recommend the establishment and funding of exit programmes for those seeking to exit prostitution.  The habitual residency condition and immigration policy should not have a negative impact on established and funded exit routes out of prostitution; they should not hinder a victim from accessing such programmes.  Currently victims of trafficking are housed within RIA accommodation, which is highly unsuitable.  </p><p>  Arguably a disconnect exists in the public consciousness between how society has traditionally viewed the prostituted and how it views those who buy sex.  For example, the prostitute is considered deviant or immoral, while those who buy sex have, until recently, simply remained anonymous.  This is the inequality that is inherent in prostitution.  This was evident in the public response to the recent Operation Freewheel in Limerick, which meant that local garda&iacute; had to defend their work and actions.</p><p>  Criminalising the purchase of sex would have a normative effect.  It sends the message to the public that by treating human beings as commodities one is committing a crime.  We believe that this will have a deterrent effect on prospective buyers.  It could also serve to shrink the industry, making Ireland a less desirable destination for human trafficking.</p></speech>

We are particularly interested in the experience in Limerick, where there has been a recent targeting of clients by the Garda.  While Ms Stapleton said that had no effect on indoor prostitution, has it had an effect on on-street prostitution?  Has it had the effect of driving prostitution indoors?</p></speech>

I know from speaking to garda&iacute; regularly through our outreach work that it did have the effect of decreasing the on-street trade, because people have become more cautious.   The women who work on the street also work off the street; they advertise both online.  The chances are it already exists in both areas.  What we see on the streets is only a small percentage of what is actually happening in the entire sex trade in Limerick.  We do outreach only one or two nights per week and it has only a very small effect.  We know the sex trade is booming every day of the week - daytime, lunchtime, all times.  We believe that what we see on the street is only a small proportion of what is going on.  I do not know if the operation has driven it indoors; I think it was already indoors.</p></speech>

I note Ms Stapleton said that 90% of the women working in street prostitution are migrant women, many of whom appear to be young and some of whom appear to have little or no English.  Can she say anything about that blurring of the line?  Is there a clear distinction?</p></speech>

Only three elements are needed to prove trafficking.  Some of the women we have met who have worked in on-street prostitution appear to have quite a lot of autonomy.  However, we know that many of the women are from one particular country and one particular area, and how long they have been in the country is indicative of their autonomy.</p> <p>Some of the women appear to have little or no English and we are very worried about them, as they are particularly vulnerable.</p><p> In respect of the line being blurred, we meet some women who have been exploited horribly and had very negative experiences but who nevertheless do not satisfy the criteria to meet the trafficking definition.  The definition of trafficking must be broadened at some point to reflect the complexity of what drives people to migrate.  We have met women who have been exploited for seven years in Limerick who would not consider themselves to be trafficked persons.  They support families and travel back and forth, but the fact remains that they are exploited and must hand over some of their wages.  Some of the women who come to Ireland do so to repay a debt by agreement between their families and the traffickers.  That to me is trafficking, yet it is not defined as such because the women can travel and have freedom of movement.  It is, therefore, a tricky and nebulous matter.</p></speech>

Is there an increased demand on foot of the normalisation of pornography and the appearance of prostitutes in television programmes and films?  If so, would a public awareness programme by, for example, the HSE be useful to challenge people's behaviour by asking them to think about its impact on their own families, as well as to think about where a person has come from, why he or she is in the relevant circumstances and whether he or she might be part of a criminal organisation?  For years we drove around without safety belts, whereas now no one would take that chance.  Behaviour can be changed.  Would a campaign be useful to challenge behaviour and reduce demand?</p></speech>

Most of the women we have encountered via outreach services have been aged between 18 and 25 years.  We have often wondered if some were younger, but garda&iacute; in Limerick are very aware and active in ensuring where women are present on the streets that no one under age is being exploited.  Generally, women are not much older than 25 years; therefore, it is an issue which involves young women.</p><p>  I agree that demand has increased owing to the normalisation of pornography.  The increased use of technology, including mobile phones and the Internet, is a huge driving force.  There is normalisation via pornography, films and myths, but the issue is more complex than this.  Public awareness campaigns are very important and should target those in schools and at third level.  Workshops, for example, could be used to get people to think about these issues and what prostitution actually is and where people come from.  That is the way forward.  Awareness-raising is fundamental.</p></speech>

Why does she think that in Limerick there is such a high level of prostitution compared to other cities?  She pointed out at the beginning of her presentation that there were significant levels of prostitution in Limerick.  I remember the Garda operation of approximately two years ago.  I spoke to a businessman in the vicinity of the location of the swoop and he was of the view that come 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., he could not do business owing to the fact that the streets were filled with people looking for prostitutes and involved in the prostitution business.  Why Limerick?  Is there a particular reason?</p></speech>

I am from Donegal North-East where there have been a number of well publicised cases involving brothels and prosecutions.

What is Doras Luimn&iacute;'s response to the issues raised?  Does it tally with what it finds from the women with whom it works?</p></speech>

A criticism of our existing legislation is that while a woman on her own in her own accommodation can sell sex legally, a number of people co-operating cannot, which puts women involved in prostitution in danger.  They are much safer working with one or two others in a house.  What is the Doras Luimn&iacute; view of these two criticisms?</p></speech>

There is a certain amount of violence inherent in prostitution and the level in Sweden before the legislation came in was the same as it has been since.  It cannot be eradicated.  It is about harm reduction, rather than harm minimisation.  One cannot ever get rid of the violence.</p><p>  It is very unfair that one person can work alone, while two persons working together are seen as running a brothel.  It is very problematic.  We see in Limerick that people work in pairs and are safer when they do.  For example, one could take a licence plate number if there was a problem.  From what we can tell, however, brothels in Limerick are not run by independent sex workers but by gangs.  For that reason, I do not know how to answer the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I attend in a personal capacity, but my knowledge and experience have been accumulated in the past 13 years in my professional life as a clinical nurse and manager of the HSE's women's health services and through my master's thesis research on the inadequacy of harm reduction measures in relation to prostitution.  I make this presentation and my views public with the greatest of respect for women's differing perspectives on entry into the sex industry and with an understanding of the complexity of the issues that affect many women.</p> <p>I do not propose to speak for women but rather to convey to the committee my considered thoughts on how my long experience and study of prostitution have affected my analysis and directing of services to women involved in, and seeking to exit, prostitution.</p><p> To put the services available to women in prostitution in context, our service is the sole dedicated provider of health care to women affected by prostitution and to victims of trafficking into the sex industry.  I planned and implemented the statutory health and social care plan for victims of trafficking in 2009 as part of the Department of justice's anti-human-trafficking unit action plan and, with my team, holistically cared for those women for several years before the unfortunate division of the two teams.  We now have two care teams, one for women in prostitution and one for victims of sex trafficking.  My work caring for victims who are trafficked into the sex industry here gave me an understanding of the whole sex industry, with all its horror, control and abuse, and at the same time was the most rewarding work I have ever done in my nursing career.  What I learnt helped me to direct the women's health service and adopt a holistic health care management approach.  This enables women to attend in a non-judgmental environment to their health care needs, including full sexual health checks, smear tests and contraception, and we make referrals to and liaise with other local hospitals as necessary.  As part of our health promotion work, outreach staff give information on a range of issues including sexual health, safety, Garda liaison, safer sex and condom use, needle exchange and drug treatment referrals to specialist centres.  We do outreach in the evenings on the streets and give out information and safety packs there too.</p><p> As a health care provider I believe it is imperative that we respond to the needs of women.  My participation in conducting interviews for the Immigrant Council of Ireland's globalisation, sex trafficking and prostitution research and my weekly work demonstrates that many women need and require intense support in planning a route out of prostitution.  I am pleased to say that concurrently with our harm reduction services we run a three-step exiting plan that creates the opportunity for life planning and gives a focus to planned and supported access to further training and development.  In this regard we rely on and are grateful to Ruhama, which develops with our service users the practical skills that empower and enable women to make positive changes in their lives.</p><p> At one of the last clinics before Christmas, a woman with whom I had no particular relationship other than a rather curt and functional one, as determined by her, came in and said "I won't see you any more in the new year because I'm going home."  I put my hand to my heart and said "I am so pleased for you, so pleased."  She began to cry and we hugged one another and I wished her well for the rest of her life.  I really wished her a new beginning, a new chapter.  I could see for the first time there was a truthful exchange apart from our curt medical concerns over the past number of years - an acknowledgement of what she was about to leave behind and relief for her at the potential for a normal life.  I know well that she may not face an easy transition and only now that she has escaped the life will she begin to reflect and weigh up over the years to come the impact of prostitution on her.</p><p> I strongly recommend that a routes-out strategy be adopted and formalised with the key players who work with women in prostitution and with women themselves.  Here we could jointly consider and utilise previous research on the barriers to exiting prostitution and bring about a standardised referral procedure and a funded statutory and NGO pathway.  All my years of work and observation convince me that this is crucial.  Many of the issues that prevent women from exiting are related to financial hardship and disadvantage.  Provision and consideration of some of the following would greatly help those seeking to exit: some form of social welfare payment or financial assistance; medical cards; free counselling; transitional safe housing; a review of the very restricted 19-hour work permits for students; direct access on referral to, and support from, certain named agencies who work with women in prostitution, such as our organisation and Ruhama; and training courses and schemes that may lead to employment opportunities.  When I took over as manager of this service I visited Glasgow and was introduced to city councillors and politicians who had implemented the policy view that prostitution is a form of violence against women.  I also visited services such as Base 75 and its routes-out partner.  They run a two-pronged service approach: harm minimisation, which includes all sexual health services, and a routes-out programme.  It is not an either-or situation.  It is possible to run the same service with two different aspects, which is crucial.  Over the time I have been observing women I have felt that we are not offering adequate services.</p><p> We partnered Scotland on the dignity programme between 2009 and 2010 and visited five countries to observe and analyse models of good practice in care for victims of trafficking and women in prostitution.  The Scottish system is very straightforward in acknowledging the harm and the reality of prostitution but very constructive and strong from political to service level in dealing with the issue.  We also visited Sweden, which underpinned my inspiration.  I was greatly encouraged to see how a state's response to the global phenomenon of prostitution and sex trafficking could change social attitudes and dramatically reduce the incidence of prostitution and trafficking.  The conversations we had with and the things we learnt from people such as Anna Skarhed, the Supreme Court judge mentioned last week, on attitudes to prostitution, gender equality, and the implementation of Swedish law criminalising the purchase of sex were truly inspirational.  The experience of the Swedish rapporteur on trafficking and the work of the prostitution unit, which I took time out of the schedule to visit and discuss services with, were very useful and practical.  The Swedish approach, which comprehensively addresses prostitution and sex trafficking, is holistic and makes sense to me as someone working in this area.  Policies, backed by legislation with which most committee members are by now familiar, include education and awareness campaigns in schools and society in general; criminalising the buyers, exposing them publicly and imposing fines; outreach for men buying sex and programmes addressing those issues; and comprehensive services for women involved in the sex industry, including victims of trafficking.</p><p> Ireland has already implemented a well-thought-out action plan for victims of trafficking, comprising State and NGO participation in the anti-human-trafficking unit.  Educational interdepartmental structures have been put in place over recent years.  Measures taken to tackle sex trafficking could easily be piggybacked onto these structures, including measures to highlight the damage prostitution inflicts on girls, women, families and society.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel but rather adapt measures or services to include the needs of women affected by prostitution.  I was very disappointed, when the anti-human-trafficking unit was set up, to find that it focused only on sex trafficking.  To me it did not make sense that we were not covering the whole issue of prostitution and sex trafficking, because it is all one industry, the sex trade.  The needs of all of these women are very similar, irrespective of their entry into the sex industry, as they have been exploited and often suffer the consequences of prostitution, such as trauma and violence, health impacts, and a need for counselling, money and safe housing.</p><p> I would like to draw the committee's attention to the health impacts of prostitution.  In our weekly clinics and in our research with the Immigrant Council of Ireland we analysed approximately 70 patient files and found significant numbers of related illnesses and infections, including chlamydia, bacterial vaginosis, candida, herpes, positive smear test results related to human papillomavirus - the wart virus, hepatitis, syphilis, cystitis, pain on intercourse and intermittent bleeding.  These are regular occurrences at our clinic.  Every week we see these diagnoses.  Our staff also regularly deal with issues such as slipped or burst condoms, crisis pregnancies, sometimes terminated with medication bought on the internet, sexual and physical violence, drug use and homelessness.  We have no specific data on the psychological impact of prostitution on women as, unfortunately, we have no counselling service, but from my professional assessment it is an area of great need, and great skill is required to rehabilitate many women affected by prostitution and sex trafficking.  I refer to the work of Judith Herman in my submission document and her in-depth analysis of mental health implications, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, for women involved in the sex trade.</p> <p>If poverty, early sexualisation of girls and boys, drug addiction, unstable school attendance and difficult family backgrounds are such risk factors for entry into prostitution, as demonstrated by much research, including the 2004 Home Office study Paying the Price, and as we know from our experience in women's health services, then surely we have an obligation to tend to those social injustices and address local concerns.  We must also tackle the demand for sex, which further perpetuates exploitation by legalising the sex industry, permitting people to buy sex because they can afford it and it is okay to do so.</p><p> I have met hundreds of women over the years in clinical practice for whom the indicators and risks are apparent.  It has become blatantly obvious to me that it is unethical and unjust to sanitise and legalise an industry driven by financial gain and demand for sexual gratification at the expense of others.  I have met women whose lives have been devastated, women who have felt they are no longer good enough to be a mother to their children.  I recall one woman in particular who felt her child was better off with her sister.  I have met women who sacrificed so much to earn money to send home for all sorts of reasons.  Of course, there are women who earn money out of prostitution and claim they are fine with it.  I respect that opinion and wish them well.  However, in my clinical experience observing women at different stages over a long period, I can see changes in many women's personalities.  The bright and bubbly people who first attend saying all is fine are gradually flattened and numbed by the experience.  If any one of the committee were to engage with the social histories and trauma of the women who have been trafficked or involved in the sex industry, they too would sense the violation.  Recently, I attended a sexual health conference on the impact of early sexual experience on young persons.  It was suggested that we ask at what age a person had first had sex.  I thought about using that question in my practice instead of asking when my patients had first started in prostitution.  I recently did so with a young transgender woman who answered that it was at ten years of age and that she was homeless and prostituting at 13.  Her mother had had her at 13.  Her friend also said she been 14, and that it was very common in their country of origin for girls to be pregnant at 11 and 12 years.</p><p> It has been suggested that if prostitution were decriminalised for women and the purchaser of sex were criminalised, that would make it harder for women.  I believe the opposite.  By decriminalising women we will be relieving them of the pressure they are now under to be covert and they will not face court cases for prostitution-related offences as they do now.  They would be encouraged to report violence, robberies and rape without fear of retribution or further incriminating themselves.  They would not face fines, imprisonment or deportation, and would be able to access services such as women's health services and obtain full support to exit prostitution.</p><p> I am all for an open and diverse society that welcomes those of different sexualities and genders as well as affording all boys and girls the opportunity to reach their maximum potential freely and without coercion or exploitation.  In my opinion, the sex industry does not offer that.  Rather, it is a corrupt, harmful and demoralising experience.  I hope for all those affected in Ireland and in other jurisdictions that there will be a better way forward.</p></speech>

It becomes okay to buy sex and a laddish or studdish opinion seems to well up.  We need to be more effective in educating people about this, asking if it is okay and highlighting the harm it causes women.  I see women who have been harmed by prostitution week in, week out.  What impressed me in the Swedish case was that they did a general campaign educating young lads and girls about these harms.  Previously, users of prostitution were called studs, but they are now called losers.  Social change is possible with proper education campaigns.</p><p>  We have noted many cases of South American women.  They have a study visa that allows them to work for 19 hours a week.  However, that prohibits them from looking for alternative types of work because it would not be enough to sustain them.  While I understand this is tied into immigration legislation, perhaps, for particularly vulnerable groups such as these women, some leniency could be considered.</p></speech>

This sums up the harms Ms Latham has observed in her clinical practice.  I am also interested in her point that it is not a case of either/or.  Clearly support needs to be given to exit strategies and routes out, whatever legal model for the regulation of prostitution is adopted.  Will she expand on the current model, under which trafficking is singled out for particular criminalisation?  Ms Latham stated that the sellers of sex she has observed are similar, irrespective of their routes into prostitution.  The question of blurring of lines comes up.  Is it hard to distinguish between those who have been trafficked and those who have not but are in prostitution?</p></speech>

Often one can clearly see the difference in different presentations.  One does not know the definite fact until one is told by the person.  Very few such women have presented to us.  Of those who did, some of them had escaped from brothels with STIs.  It was clearly evident that they had run out and they had clearly been trafficked.  What is difficult now is that they have to go through the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, to become a suspected victim of trafficking.  We looked at UK models of social care for women who were trafficked and in prostitution, and there was a far more participatory role in determining that.  In my experience, the harms caused to women in prostitution are similar whether they have been trafficked, are controlled or freely chose to enter it.</p></speech>

They themselves are giving us the history of that.  Therefore, we can see their vulnerability and that they are already predisposed to any sort of exploitation.</p><p> The case of the migrant women, who make up the majority of the persons who come into the clinic, is very different.  We saw 360 women last year.  Almost 100 of these were on the streets and the rest were women working indoors in prostitution.  Some 93% of them were migrant women.  Clearly, they have poverty issues.  What I thought was that their aspirations would suggest they were seeking to find a way out and to improve their standard of living in some capacity, to get a home and education for their children and an income for themselves.  However, often there are layers to their situation and they are funding families and relations back home as well.  Therefore, the pressure is enormous on them to stay within the sex industry, although that may not have been their original plan.  They may have thought they would do it for a period and then get out of it.  That is often what we hear, but then five, six or seven years later they are still there. </p></speech>

This year, for the first time, our African cohort has reduced significantly.  Previously we saw a lot of this happening.  There were certain antibiotics that could be bought over the Internet and many women told us they had taken them.  Sometimes, the termination by that method was inadequate and we had to refer women to the maternity hospitals for completion of the termination.  Therefore, its extent was significant enough to make an impact on us.  I suspect we do not even get to hear about half of it.  However, it was more frequent among the African community than we have witnessed here before.</p></speech>

I put this to the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland representative here last week, but I will now put the question to Ms Latham.  Does she think there is a way we could legislate to facilitate those women who, according to Dr. Freedman and others, want to remain in prostitution and to provide a service?</p></speech>

I am not speaking for all women, but considering all the options available to them, if some women wish to take the option of continuing in prostitution, decriminalisation would leave them in a freer position than they are currently to continue in prostitution.</p></speech>

One of the criticisms of the Swedish model is that it drives women underground, because the men who purchase sex are criminalised.  Therefore, decriminalisation for women is not a better scenario for them, because the user is criminalised.  The argument made is that it puts them in more danger in terms of what they do.</p></speech>

Fundamentally, it is not legal to prostitute here.  Currently women still come in to our services.  They come from all over the country, not just from larger towns - a great presentation was made on Limerick - to Dublin to access services.  Men who have to buy sex must be able to find women.  It is easy to locate these women and I do not feel the "underground" argument carries any weight.</p></speech>

I would welcome Ms Latham's opinion on what is available in this regard currently and on what we could do to improve it.  Will she expand on that?</p></speech>

However, it does not have to be one or the other.  Our service has most direct access to women working in prostitution and women who say they have exited prostitution.  Therefore, our service is more involved with women who work indoors, week in and out.</p><p>  I believe we need a joint model of partnership between services like Ruhama and ourselves, that really works in partnership.  From our experience of trafficking, I saw that when the services worked together and grouped their expertise and set up a clear referral path, it worked.  If we do not make it part of our policy or do not say we will do something, it does not happen.  I have been a long time in the clinic running the service and for a long time I felt we were not offering enough to these women.  It has made a big difference that now all the staff offer all women an opportunity to avail of the service.  We do not have the scale or expertise to deal with all of this, but we refer to and work with Ruhama in that regard.  A joined-up statutory pathway would make a significant difference.</p><p>  However, we must consider the prohibitive factors that stop women exiting prostitution, such as money.  They have no money.  A couple of months ago one woman left the building crying.  She thought that when she came into us that would be it and she would be out of it with what we could offer.  However, we had nothing to offer her.  We had no home to send her to or anything.  She needed money, so she had to go back out again that very night, despite having made the leap of faith that she was getting out.  We had no social welfare payments to pay out.  She cannot come to us if she is not in prostitution any more.  These are the issues we need to consider.</p></speech>

I have been involved in HIV and Aids and LGBT issues over 26 years.  Mr. McCartney is a researcher and represents the Gay Health Network.  He has worked and studied global health at TCD and is currently working with the international planned parenthood federation as HIV programme officer.  We thank the committee for inviting us to this meeting.  I would also like to acknowledge the attendance of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, at the conference which covered this issue last October.  I was delighted he stayed for the whole day and heard directly from former and current female sex workers.  It would be great if this committee could arrange a similar meeting with sex workers.</p><p>  We hope the reference report we have submitted and this presentation will help provide some understanding of the complex issues with regard to commercial sex work, men who have sex with men and disabled people availing of commercial sex, dealt with in chapter 8 of the report. </p> <p>We request that members take time to read the report in its entirety.  As men who have sex with men and commercial sex are both taboo subjects and seldom discussed, the report is welcome.  </p><p> In 1993 the law which criminalised homosexual men and that relating to the availability of condoms were both changed.  These changes were the direct result of campaigning and rulings of the European courts but also the health implications relating to HIV.  In 1992 the then Eastern Health Board established the Gay Men's Health Service, GMHS, which remains the only statutory service for men who have sex with men.  The GMHS provides an STI clinic, counselling and support and education and prevention programmes among men who have sex with men.  Over 9,000 men have registered with us, of whom some 15% reside outside County Dublin.</p><p> The GMHS is a member of the Gay Health Network, GHN, which was founded in 1994 and leads the way in HIV prevention and awareness of sexual health for men who have sex with men.  The Gay Health Network runs the Man2Man campaign in partnership with the HSE.  Many HIV and LGBT organisations are members of the network.  Last year the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and the former Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;isn Shortall, launched campaigns relating to stigma and discrimination.</p><p> In Ireland there is a high incidence of HIV and other STI infections, particularly syphilis and gonorrhoea, among men who have sex with men.  In 2011 and early 2012 the health promotion surveillance committee reported that up to 40% of all new HIV infections were among men who had sex with men.</p><p> The GMHS's involvement in the area of male sex work began as part of its outreach work and contact with various agencies and groups from 1997 onwards.  It helped to establish networks and produced many reports.  In 2003 we made a presentation to the Hidden Stories Conference in Stockholm.</p><p> As a health and social administrator and manager, it is important to raise some of the issues concerning the introduction of new legalisation.  I was going to use a large brush to highlight that a whole section of people and situations were being painted with one brush.  This approach is unsustainable and misleading, especially when it seems to be portrayed that only men buy sex and that they only purchase it from women.  In Ireland there are three studies highlighting that men who have sex with men buy or sell sex.  We are presenting the more recent European MSM Internet survey, EMIS, which shows that there is a significant number of gay and bisexual men and men who do not identify as gay engaged in buying and selling sex in countries throughout Europe, including Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Daniel McCartney" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013012300013#O00200"><p>The EMIS of 2010 was the largest such survey ever conducted.  Of the over 180,000 respondents across Europe, approximately 7% indicated that they had bought sex from another man, while in the region of 5% stated they had sold sex to another man within the previous 12 months.  Some 4% indicated that, while abroad, they had paid men for sex.  A further 2% said they had received payment while abroad.  In the case of Ireland, the Real Lives survey conducted in 2004 and the EMIS of 2010 of over 2,600 respondents show that between 9% and 11% of men who had had sex with men were involved in buying or selling sex.  In the EMIS 4.7% of men who had had sex with men indicated that they had paid for sex, while 4.1% said they had been paid for sex.  Men who have sex with men in Ireland live in all parts of the country - with almost half residing in Dublin; up to one quarter were not born on the island of Ireland; just over two thirds are only attracted to men, while three quarters identified themselves as being gay.  The survey also showed that three quarters were not in a steady relationship, while 6% of those who had been paid for sex and 8% who had paid for sex were in a relationship with a woman.  The locations where these men were most likely to meet for sex included websites, saunas and bars, while they were much less likely to meet in public places.  Most importantly, 44% of those who had been paid for sex had not been tested for HIV.  This compares to a figure of 28% for those who had paid for sex and had not been tested.  This was also greater than the figure for the overall survey, namely, 38% of those sampled had never been tested for HIV.  The position on sexually transmitted infections was similar.  In that context, some 50% of those who had been paid for sex had not been tested, while 38% of those who had paid for sex had not been tested.  The overall figure in this regard for all of those sampled was 42%.  Significantly, men who have sex with men who had been paid for sex were less likely to access services for a variety of reasons, including stigma.  These data appears to agree with international experience to the effect that sex workers often find accessing services such as HIV and sexual health services difficult owing to real or perceived stigmatisation on the part of health workers, a general social stigma or discrimination within society.</p><p>  Men who have sex with men who buy and sell sex are very much part of the gay and bisexual male community and are, therefore, difficult to distinguish.  Both groups access the GMHS and other sexual health services.  Each group has significant health needs in the context of HIV prevention and sexual health.  Access to support, sexual health and support services, including information, condoms and lubricants, is vital.  Reports show that those who use services and are tested are more informed and inclined to look after themselves.  Introducing further legislation would inhibit this and make it more difficult to access services or supports.  Legislation may delay people attending, especially if they have symptoms or if they are obliged to search out what facility they can attend for STI services.  In addition, they would be reluctant to discuss or make disclosures about the type of sex in which they engaged.  Legislation would also directly affect the statutory notification process.  I refer in this regard to the syphilis notification form which requests information on commercial sex.  Furthermore, legislation could create a further stigma and impede the destigmatisation process advanced by the National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC, and the HSE-Gay Health Network programme.  </p><p>  All of these issues are covered in various Irish, European and international reports, including the UNAIDS report 2012, the recent WHO guidelines and the final report of the UNDP Commission on HIV and the law, which was published in 2012.  I strongly urge the committee to review these reports, all of which call for decriminalisation of sex work and the establishment of laws to protect against discrimination, violence and other rights violations faced by sex workers.</p></speech>

These are all added to if the individual involved is living with HIV.  The HSE report, LGBT Health: Towards Meeting the Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People, published in 2009, outlines the effects on people's mental and physical health as a result of discrimination, violence and marginalisation.  Men who have sex with men who sell sex and men who buy sex from men can certainly experience homophobia and stigma.  Further sanctions could and would add to this rather than create a situation where we can engage with people.  If we are really concerned about a section of society being exploited, used or abused, should we not set about organising, training and empowering sex workers and offering them support and services in order that they might enhance their lives, rather than taking their livelihoods away?  Criminalising the buyers would also directly affect the sellers.  For example, in order to make a case, evidence would be required and sex workers' activities would have to be monitored.  How would such evidence be collected?  Who would police gay bars, saunas, cruising areas and the relevant websites, not to mention those for heterosexual men and women who wish to buy and sell sex?  Would various groups be charged with following and spying on sex workers, seeking sexual health records and so on?</p><p>  Another hidden group is that which comprises disabled people who already experience difficulties in respect of sex and sexuality.  Commercial sex services for these individuals are very much taboo.  However, there are many reports, etc., on disabled people buying sex - from women - an activity in which they have been facilitated by local authorities and carers in Britain and elsewhere.  Could these people or their carers be classed as being criminals?</p><p>  The most important issue for health and sexual health support services is the provision of a confidential and non-judgmental service.  Such a service must be confidential in the context of those who use it.  We do not have a social work service similar to what is provided in Sweden, where the social worker's job can be to observe and control sex workers or people living with HIV.  Even during the criminalisation period in Ireland, the relevant law which had been introduced by the British in Victorian times was seldom, if ever, used.  Unlike their counterparts in Britain, homosexual men in Ireland were not arrested.  It must be noted that this was not because there were no pretty male officers in the Garda ranks.  It appears that it was just not the done thing in Ireland.  When HIV and AIDS became an issue in Ireland, gay saunas were not closed.  However, those in Sweden were.  Creating a "them and us" scenario leads to stigmatisation, whereas accepting that people selling sex can be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or heterosexual males and females and that those who buy sex can also be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or heterosexual males and females might lead to the provision of better services and supports.</p> <p>In 2003, at the Hidden Stories conference in Sweden, Katarina Lindahl, the chair of the service and a feminist, spoke about being involved in the discussion about penalising men who buy sex, which has been the case since the 1970s in Sweden, though we forget the law has been in place for such a long time.  She stated:</p><p>Today RSFU does not approve of the current law in Sweden though I see a very positive effect emerging from the discussion.  The focus has shifted from only seeing the women to talking about the extremely important role on the demand side.  This has to be addressed but criminalisation cannot do this.</p><p>I have a November 2012 report from the Swedish Board of Youth Affairs, a government-funded body, which revealed that in Sweden in 2012 more than twice as many young men as women sold sex.  According to the study, 2.1% of Swedish males aged 16 to 25 years said they had prostituted themselves in 2012, compared to 1% of women.  While in general young men almost exclusively sell to men young Swedish men sold sex to both men and women.  Half of the clients of both male and female prostitutes aged under the age of 26 were also aged under 26.  This was in 2012 after the law had been in place for a number of years. </p><p> In 2003 Ms Lindahl stated:</p><p>It has been said a punishment is important because it gives a clear norm about what is not acceptable in our society.  But we know there is already a strong stigma related to prostitution and to the people involved.  Stigmatisation is never a good thing if one claims to support the individuals concerned.  Stigmatisation is only a way to draw a line between us and them.</p><p>In Ireland we have only begun to challenge stigma in regard to HIV, and also to challenge homophobia and bullying.  We must ensure we do not hinder this work.  </p><p> I want to take away the large brush I was supposed to bring with me and replace it with a number of small brushes.  Perhaps then we will realise that legislation to control adult sexuality and consensual sex is more complex than is thought and, perhaps, is not possible.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for the presentation and pay tribute to the work of the Gay Men's Health Service and the Gay Health Network in tackling homophobia and discrimination against people with HIV.  It is important to make that point.</p><p>   I will focus on legislation and the approach to take.  I am reminded that some people have said we should not say the Swedish "model", rather the Swedish "approach", because this has already been adapted for use in other countries, and other jurisdictions such as France and Ireland are looking at it very seriously with a view to adapting it.  Nobody suggests it is a one-size-fits-all model that should not be tweaked to fit any particular society.  Does that approach not have some benefit, however, from the point of view of the arguments Mr. Quinlan made about decriminalising those who sell sex, thereby destigmatising the people engaged in the sale of sex?  I am interested in that point and raised it before.</p></speech>

One thing that occurs to me is that were there six people present who were sex workers there might be a really important element to the discussion.  I have looked at all of this and really cannot understand how the one can be done without the other; how it is possible to criminalise the one and decriminalise the other and vice versa, without looking at the issue of the adults who consent to have sex and thereby get into this situation.  All I know comes from the reports I have read.  We are talking about the Swedish model because the committee has stated that its members visited Sweden.  I would have asked the committee to look at the models in Australia, New Zealand and other countries and to consider how we might adapt those too rather than look at only one model.</p><p>  I would consider how we might protect both parties.  </p></speech>

Coming here I was surprised that the Swedish approach is the one that has been spoken about most.  I thought that, at a minimum, the committee would look at what recently happened in Canadian legislation where the laws are quite similar to those in Ireland.  I believe a stronger example would be the New Zealand model, which is more a form of legalisation and regulation.  With regulation, however, I am completely against the mandatory HIV testing that New Zealand had originally included in its model before retracting it.  That is the kind of idea I would consider.</p><p>  The one report that has not been raised is that published by the global commission on HIV and the law which was organised by the United Nations development programme.  It does not focus only on public health but looks a range of different issues.  There are also some working papers that were submitted as part of this worldwide consultation on issues of criminalisation elsewhere, not only in sex work.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinlan's final comment was on adults and consensual sex, whether those adults are paying for it or otherwise.  I am looking at the consensual point.  Is a person being consensual if he or she is forced into this work simply because there are no other opportunities?  Is one consensual if somebody else is controlling one's actions, for whatever reason?  I accept Mr. Quinlan's point that we have focused greatly on the female in prostitution, for very obvious reasons.  Mr. Quinlan has attended the committee to represent men who have sex with men.  I am trying to get my head around this.  In the early part of Mr. Quinlan's presentation, which I cannot quote because the battery in my laptop has died, he stated that part of the lifestyle of men who have sex with men is to purchase sex.  Am I right about that?  Similarly, did Mr. Quinlan state that some men who are in heterosexual relationships may wish to purchase sex?</p></speech>

It was good that we were asked to make the presentation.  I included references to many reports and these are also embedded in the other report I made, which covers the whole range of different issues.  Even now, as I look back over certain points, I can state there is a whole range of men who buy and sell sex - all for different reasons.  The men who buy sex are also affected by homophobia and the stigma that relates to men who are gay or bisexual.  Some of these men are autonomous.  The context is not that men who have sex with men will automatically go and buy sex.  That is not what I am saying.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for their presentation.  I will be honest.  I read the submission and it was the first time I have encountered this part of the sex industry in the context of the discussion we have been having.  It is very useful.</p><p>  What percentage of the overall sex market is homosexual?  A rough idea will do; I just want to understand the market.  </p> <p>What percentage of individuals would be trafficked?  Is the number of men being trafficked lower than the number of women?   I presume it is but is the figure available?  Is pimping commonplace with men offering sex to other men?  In the context of the discussion, I understand the dilemma and we will probably face the same dilemma in reaching a decision on the Swedish approach, as Senator Bacik has correctly called it, when we present our report to the Minister.  The dilemma is whether to criminalise the users and thus release the providers to choose to avail of the support which clearly they require and are not being offered coherently.  Perhaps there is an attempt to offer the kinds of support they require but clearly we are not doing enough.</p><p> I think I need to do a great deal more reading on the issue of trafficking, which I hope to do in the next few weeks.  Do the witnesses have a view on the Swedish approach to the solution of the problem?</p></speech>

A series of meetings were held in Dr. Steevens Hospital and we drew up the document, Such a Taboo - Service needs for males in prostitution in Ireland, 2001.  I ask the members to read it.  It shows up the different needs of the different areas, such as what is needed about providing services for men engaged in sex work.  I used to have four outreach workers in the Gay Men Health Service, but I have none now because of the reduction in service as result of cutbacks.  We conducted the first survey of male sex workers some years ago.  The difference between then and now is the changes that have taken place.  The profile of the men who sell sex has changed a lot.  Even I was surprised at the Swedish findings at one level but not surprised at another level.  People are more confident now about their sexuality.</p></speech>

Within the HSE, we have separated trafficking from prostitution.  It was moved from the women's health project to a separate service.  I think that speaks in itself.  Representatives from the Garda attended the conference last year and trafficking was separate from sex work and prostitution.

We have found that men who came to Ireland as asylum seekers experienced abuse and so on when they were travelling.  That is because they were coming from countries in which a person could be killed if he was gay.</p></speech>

Even if one had a meeting on that it would be difficult to come to a consensus.  From the ITRA study, the figures could be 113,000 men who buy sex from women, in the MSM community one could be talking about numbers in the region of 2,500 men buying sex or just over 2,000 men selling sex.  It is not a small population.</p><p>  I think people have an image in their head of what a prostitute or sex worker is but when it comes to men who are buying or selling sex, one can forget about the preconceived ideas because it is not simply the person on the street.  That is the reason I was afraid about the brush.  </p><p>  People need to stand back, they need to go other countries.  I would like members to visit MSM sex worker services and also women's services in Britain and then, by link, look at the way services are provided in Sweden and Australia.  Rather than limiting the exploration to the Swedish model we should look at the model in the whole that can provide service and support.</p></speech>

What we heard in the presentations in the past couple of days is that a number of people want to leave the life of prostitution, whatever the length of time they have been engaged in prostitution, and as we have heard from a number of different groups, there are services available to help them.</p><p>  In Mr. Quinlan's opinion how many of the 2,000 men he knows who are selling sex wish to exit this way of life?

The men I know who are sex workers, but not all of whom admit to being sex workers, continue to work into an older age.  The reason they stop is because of their age.

I am very struck by the disparity there appears to be between women's and men's stories.  When one listens to presentations from Ruhama and others who work with women in prostitution, one does not have to look long before one hears stories of misery and exploitation.  I wonder if that is because organisations such as Ruhama are dealing with people at the level of psychological well-being, exploring their past, looking at it as a social problem.  I wonder if there is any equivalent effort to try to understand what brings people to the place in which they are selling themselves or purchasing other people in the context of sex.  Have people explored this behaviour at the level of people's psychological and mental health to consider whether there is a social problem and that people who need care are not being cared for?</p><p>  My second question is the same question I put to Dr. Freedman; do the witnesses agree as a matter of principle that the sale or purchase of sex from another person is anti-social?  Would they support public expenditure, for example, on campaigns to discourage such activity as a matter of principle, whatever about the important work they do in working to secure people's health on an individual basis?</p></speech>

There are people who engage in sex work on an occasional basis or they fall into it by accident, through poverty or addiction.  This includes men who have sex with men.  A fair number of men would have been thrown out of their homes and made homeless because they were gay.  They ended up in the park or out and about.  Some men who were addicted to substances came into sex work and were paid a fair amount at the beginning but they could be exploited in the sense that if the buyer found out they were addicted he could reduce the amount of money he paid.</p> <p>In some areas, there is no doubt there is discrimination, but it is less visible in Dublin than in the past.  It is a phenomenom that is probably not talked about, that is, women selling sex.  There are cases - men have talked about it - in which they have found a way to make money.  I know gay men who go out cruising and, suddenly they meet someone who asks if they are buying.  The instigator is not the man going out to buy sex but the person who comes up to him in a cruising area and asks, "Are you buying sex?"  All of that happens in the MSM community.  If a law is brought in, the question is: how can it be implemented?  I was so surprised by the policeman from Sweden at the conference last year.  They were practically talking about telephone bugs and listening outside the door.  The only way they could get the buyer was to monitor the seller.  Although they said they were decriminalising the activities of sellers, they were still monitoring them.  Social workers were controlling them, especially if they had children.  Therefore, it is not as easy as introducing a law.  I was asked about the law, but I cannot come down on one side or the other as I am employed by the HSE.  However, I cannot see it working.</p></speech>

One of the things that struck me about this discussion was that we should be talking about this issue in schools.  We should be talking about human sexuality and LGBT issues.  We need to talk about how people engage with each other, but we need to be very careful.  I refer to some of the recent posters used.  There was an image of what was supposed to be a sex worker, which can stigmatise sex workers.</p></speech>

There are strong parallels between this aspect and what happened when we criminalised sex between men.  There are strong parallels between that argument and the issue about sex workers.  We should not criminalise the private sexual behaviour of consenting adults, including voluntary sex work.</p></speech>

What I am trying to tease out is whether it is an acceptable part of it, or something that is hidden?  For example, if a heterosexual seeks a prostitute but does not want his wife to find out about it, it happens underground and is not acceptable to many.  Is the buying and selling of sex more acceptable in the gay and bisexual community?</p></speech>

Some of it was based on class and whether one was a drug user.  The other day President Obama spoke about the Stonewall riots, but who would have thought that people who had fought against oppression for three days were gay, drag queens and sex workers?  In the history of the LGBT movement there has been a close association between men and women sex workers.  In London, for instance, the police used to arrest the women sex workers.  If they were carrying condoms, they were under threat; therefore, the men would carry the condoms, while the women would carry jars of Vaseline.  That was one of the associations between them.  Within the community and the broader community, in many cases, sex workers, in particular women sex workers, feel safer among members of the gay community and have taken part in LGTB pride events.  Who is able to say who is the buyer and who is the seller?</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for the invitation to present to it.  I will provide it with an overview of my professional background and outline the key challenges I see for the company in the next few years, as well as my role as chairman in addressing them.</p><p>  I grew up in New Quay in north Clare, a village near Ballyvaughan in the heart of the Burren.  I went to secondary school in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, after which I studied law in University College Dublin.  I qualified as a solicitor in 1979 and specialised in corporate tax law for one year.  During this time I became an associate of the Irish Institute of Taxation and obtained a diploma in applied finance.  I later became an associate of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.  Following a period as stagiaire with the European Commission in the Directorate General for Financial Institutions and Taxation in Brussels, I returned to general practice with Moylan and Company, solicitors, in Galway.  During this time I also tutored part-time in taxation law for the Law Society of Ireland.</p><p>  I always had a strong interest in business, corporate and commercial matters.  With a view to pursuing such interests, I joined Guinness Peat Aviation Group plc, GPA, in Shannon in 1988 and remained with the company for 14 years.  In 1988 GPA was the world's largest aviation company with Mr. Tony Ryan at the helm.  It dealt with the purchase, leasing, financing and sale of aircraft.  I worked for the first few years in the treasury department and was responsible for the financing of aircraft.  The company then had corporate credit facilities of US$6.5 billion with circa 135 banks and was buying aircraft at the rate of two a week from manufacturers.  It was a hectic and fascinating time.</p><p>  In 1992 the GPA initial public offering, IPO, failed and the company went into crisis.  At this point GPA had liabilities of approximately US$12 billion, including bank debt.  I became part of a small management team which was tasked with the complete restructuring of the company.  This was an extremely onerous and difficult task which took many years to complete, involving extensive stakeholder management, downsizing, refinancing, the sale of non-core assets, development of new business, mergers and acquisitions to achieve scale, taking in Texas Pacific Group as a shareholder and, ultimately, the sale of the company.  GPA repaid all of its creditors in full.</p><p>  The GPA diaspora has played a significant role in establishing Ireland as a world leader in aviation leasing and financing.  During my time in GPA I held various senior management roles, including chief legal officer, followed by head of the commercial department.  In 1997 I was appointed a non-executive director of Aer Lingus and in 2002 and 2003 offered several other non-executive director roles.  In the past ten years I have gained extensive board and corporate governance experience.  In 2009 I was appointed chairman of Bord G&aacute;is and my other current principal board directorships include Total Produce plc since 2006 and also One51 plc since 2012.</p><p>  In May 2012 the Government made the decision in principle to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and merge it with a restructured Shannon Development.  Two task forces were established to advise on how best this could be done.  In June 2012 I was appointed chairman of the Shannon aviation business development task force.  Its mandate was to seek out new opportunities for an independent Shannon Airport and evaluate the feasibility of creating an international aviation centre of excellence in Shannon.  The chairs of the two task forces reported during the five month period to a steering group which was co-chaired by the Secretaries General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and attended by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, as well as senior officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  My task force issued its report which included several detailed recommendations in November 2012.  The overarching conclusion and recommendation was the separation of Shannon Airport from the DAA by December 2012, followed in a second phase by its combination with a restructured Shannon Development, to occur by July 2013.  On 31 December 2012 Shannon Airport was separated from the DAA under the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004.  New legislation is required to deal with its merger with Shannon Development.</p><p>  In the course of my task force's work we met over 100 stakeholders, including local councils, public representatives, international airlines, aircraft manufacturers, indigenous and multinational businesses and educational institutions.  My colleagues and I on the task force were repeatedly struck by the level of stakeholder support for a reinvigorated Shannon Airport, not just as an airport but also as a broader centre of aviation excellence.</p> <p>It is important to emphasise that what my colleagues and I repeatedly heard was not romantic nostalgia for Irish coffee and thatched cottages but a measured appraisal of the global opportunities in aviation and a recognition of how Shannon Airport was well situated to grasp and benefit from these opportunities.  The task force's report sets out an ambitious vision for Shannon Airport, grounded in its strengths and validated by our discussions with industry stakeholders.  The Shannon business plan was externally validated by KPMG on behalf of the steering group and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p> I am genuinely excited at the opportunities I see for Shannon Airport, but of course I recognise the challenges.  Perhaps it would be useful if I set out some of the key challenges I anticipate and which have been identified in recent months.  The first is the appointment of a CEO.  It will be the task of the new entity to develop both the airport and its property assets, sustainably grow annual passenger numbers and create an international aviation services centre.  This involves bringing together the airport and Shannon Development into a new entity that combines and builds on the best of both.  For this to succeed, we must ensure the new organisation has the necessary leadership at CEO level to develop Shannon Airport on this broad basis.  The recruitment process for a CEO is under way and the timely and successful conclusion of this search is one of my immediate priorities.</p><p> A second challenge is the appointment of a board.  A relatively short-term challenge for the Shannon Airport Authority and, ultimately, the new Shannon entity is the appointment of an effective board that can provide guidance and support for the CEO and the management team and to ensure there is good corporate governance.  The new dynamic in Shannon means that we require a strong, cohesive, committed and internationally experienced board.  The board will also have an important role in the transfer and integration of the property portfolio and employees from the restructured Shannon Development.  The appointment of the new board is a matter for the Minister and under way.  It will be a central part of the chairman's role to lead and manage the board and ensure there is strong communication and transparency between the company and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p> The third challenge is to increase passenger numbers.  Shannon Airport's trajectory in recent years has been away from commercial sustainability.  That trajectory must be halted and reversed in order for the airport to attain the profitability and growth of which it is capable.  The committee will know that Shannon Airport's passenger traffic is made up of terminal passengers, in other words, people who start or end their journeys at the airport, and transit passengers, mostly in military aircraft making refuelling stops.  In 2012 Shannon Airport recorded a total of 1.4 million passengers.  Of this total, 90% were terminal passengers, 6% lower than in 2011.  The remaining 10% were transit passengers.  Transit traffic was down over 50% on the figure for 2011, reflecting principally the reduction in United States troop movements to and from the Middle East.  Overall, Shannon Airport traffic was down 14% on the figure for the previous year.</p><p> The fall in terminal traffic is disappointing, but we see grounds for cautious optimism in 2013.  A number of airlines have announced new Shannon services for the coming summer.  United Airlines will operate a Shannon-Chicago route, US Airways will serve a Shannon-Philadelphia route, while Aer Lingus will add a Shannon-Faro service to its existing network.  While these new services are very welcome and I am confident they will be successful, they are not sufficient.  The airport's focus must be on developing commercial passenger numbers to a sustainable level.  We must reach a sustainable equilibrium, where our revenues will be in line with our costs.  The task force's report sets out the aspiration of reaching 2.5 million passengers within five years.</p><p> There is no silver bullet for Shannon Airport.  In order to increase passenger numbers, it will have to attract a range of airlines on short and long-haul routes and also airlines making transit stops en route to North America.  We are in discussions with a range of airlines and a number of these discussions are particularly advanced.  The committee will understand I am unable to be more precise for reasons of commercial confidentiality.</p><p> In discussing the challenge of growing passenger numbers at Shannon Airport there are a couple of points I would like to make.  First, when we talk about 2 million or even 2.5 million passengers a year, this is considerably less than in the relatively recent past.  In 2006 and 2007 over 3.5 million passengers used Shannon Airport.  Of course, we live in different economic times and passenger growth needs to be on a sustainable basis.  Shannon Airport must, however, grow its passenger traffic.  It does not follow that this is necessarily to the detriment of other Irish airports.  We are all aware of the importance of balanced regional development.</p><p> We are not going to focus solely on outbound traffic.  We will also focus on the development of inbound tourism and seek to attract tourists for the benefit of the wider region.  We will work with the tourism authorities and tourism industry stakeholders as part of a collective development of Ireland's profile to maximise the number of inbound tourists.  We see another part of our growth figures coming from responding better to the needs of Shannon Airport's natural catchment.  Business people in the mid-west need connectivity and would welcome a wider choice of routes direct to the main European cities.  Having these direct services is one way of enhancing the business attractiveness of the whole region.</p><p> The fourth challenge facing us is to continue to reduce costs.  As I said, the airport will have to reach a sustainable equilibrium, where our costs will be in line with our revenues.  We will be working hard to boost revenues, but we also have to look carefully at our costs.  The task force's report notes that the new Shannon entity will have to deliver conspicuous value for money, whether by winning new airline business or attracting new industry.  This will require a competitive cost structure.  The airport's cost base is currently higher than that of its industry peers, partly because of its reduced traffic levels.  Productivity improvements and flexible work practices can help to reduce this disadvantage.</p><p> The fifth challenge facing us is the development of an international aviation services centre and the development of a wider property portfolio.  I passionately believe in the potential of Shannon Airport as a successful and sustainable airport but also as the location for a major global aviation cluster.  This would both anchor the existing industry and attract jobs which would otherwise not be created in Ireland.  Our job is to articulate the vision and build the momentum to achieve this.  That means we need to sell Shannon Airport and the opportunities it offers.  We need to attract businesses and airlines and give people a reason to fly to and from Shannon Airport and we need to develop our wider property portfolio and work with existing businesses.  We will also work closely with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to win new job creating investments, boost opportunities for our existing businesses and develop our property portfolio.  Shannon Airport has advantages as an aviation cluster that competing locations abroad do not have.  It has ample space and a skilled workforce.  Some 1,600 people already work in aerospace companies in and around Shannon.  Therefore, this cluster is not being created from nothing.  Shannon Airport already has strong links with the aviation leasing community.</p><p> I have enumerated five challenges and with the Chairman's permission, I would like to mention a final one.  I will then be happy to take questions.  </p><p> I have spoken about the task force's meetings with stakeholders in Ireland and abroad and the enthusiasm and support expressed for the plans to reinvigorate Shannon Airport.  One further challenge facing us is that of winning buy-in from people and businesses who want to believe but who have perhaps witnessed the decline of Shannon Airport during the years.  My task and that of the CEO, the board, the management team and the staff of the new Shannon entity will be to create the foundation for this belief.  It will be a privilege for me to become chairman of the new Shannon entity and work with the board, the chief executive and the staff in the company.  My goal as chairman will be to manage and lead the board in an effective and efficient manner to achieve our stated objectives.  I look forward to the challenges ahead.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to appear before them today.  I am happy to respond to questions they may have.</p></speech>

Before I call on members, there is one area she did not seem to cover, that is, the number of people employed at Shannon Airport.  Will there be redundancies and job losses in the context of the new structure being put in place?  How does Ms Hynes propose to deal with this issue?  Obviously, Shannon Airport is now only operating at half the capacity at which it operated some years ago.  Are changes in work practices required?  Will Ms Hynes outline to the committee the proposals made in this regard?</p></speech>

There is no intention to reduce the number of jobs; rather, the intention is to grow the pie and increase passenger numbers.  The airport caters for just 1.4 million passengers, but it has the capacity to cater for 4.5 million.  The target is to achieve a figure of 2.5 million.  What will be required in this regard is significant cost efficiency.  We need to grow revenues and passenger numbers and have effective work practices.  We will work with our staff to this end.</p></speech>

As there is significant interest in this issue, there are many Members present.  We will allow members of the committee to put their questions first and we will then move on to take questions from non-members who signal that they wish to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300005#E00100"><p>I wish to extend a very warm welcome to Ms Rose Hynes, who clearly outlined her deep understanding of the aviation sector and also of Shannon, particularly in the context of its geography, hinterland, etc.  When she referred to her role with GPA and the capacity of the latter to repay all of its outstanding debts, I immediately thought she might like to take on a role with the IBRC or one of the pillar banks.  We will certainly be supporting Ms Hynes's appointment because she has the skillset that is required for the position.</p><p>  As Ms Hynes indicated, she was involved in the preparation of the business plan.  The latter is certainly ambitious and I wish her well with its implementation.  The plan refers to increasing passenger numbers at the airport by approximately 500,000 during the next 12 to 18 months.  Will Ms Hynes outline the type of strategy she would envisage being deployed in order to achieve this increase?  The proposal also envisages an amalgamation of the property assets of Shannon Development and Ms Hynes referred to the necessity to appoint a CEO who will have the capacity to deal with both aspects.  Since the primary business here relates to driving traffic through the airport, will she indicate the type of organisational chart she would put in place?  What other key skills will it be necessary to bring on board in order to chase the inbound tourism business that will be vital for the future success of the airport?</p><p>  The Chairman referred to job losses so I will not comment on the matter.  Ms Hynes will be well aware, from recent commentary in the newspapers, of Ryanair's intention and desire to take control of Aer Lingus.  Comments made in the past few days indicate that this now appears more likely than was the case some months ago.  Does Ms Hynes have any thoughts on this matter?  Are there any plans she would deploy in the event of there being a lack of competition in the Irish aviation sector as a result of the merger of the two airlines?  Would such a merger impact in any way on the strategy she developed in the preparation of the business plan?</p><p>  In the context of the development of the cargo sector, Ms Hynes will be familiar with the report of the mid-west task force prepared by Mr. Denis Brosnan.  Sections of that report were liberally referred to by one of the parties in government in the run-up to the most recent general election.  The party in question placed a great deal of emphasis on the development of a cargo hub at Shannon.  As Ms Hynes is aware, some proposals were made in the past in respect of Lynx Cargo.  Does she have any views on this matter which she would like to share with the committee?</p><p>  I wish Ms Hynes well in her new role.  I know she will bring a particular vitality and focus to the work of the airport.</p></speech>

As stated earlier, some of these discussions are at an advanced stage.  If, when it was in existence, my task force was of the view that it was going to make any recommendations in its final report, it tended to get ahead of those recommendations in order to give them momentum.  As a result, we engaged in discussions with many airlines in respect of increasing passenger numbers.  This gave matters a particular momentum.  We did not want to leave behind in a report a set of recommendations which might or might not have been implemented.  We created momentum for the recommendations and gave some of them a good nudge forward.  The discussions to which I refer are, therefore, more advanced than would otherwise have been the case.  As already indicated, passenger capacity on a number of different routes to the US will increase by 23% or 24% this summer.  We are starting from a very low base - 1.4 million passengers - and, therefore, any increase is going to be significant.  Our strategy is that there is not one particular answer in respect of this matter but rather that a range of opportunities must be pursued.</p><p>  We are also working hard to see what might be done to increase transit traffic.  In that context, we are working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of giving freedom rights to airlines from other countries to stop at Shannon before travelling on to the US.  As already stated, a range of options - rather than just one - must be pursued.  The first challenge we face is to arrest the downward spiral.  After that, we must stabilise the business and then grow it.  As the Deputy will be aware, I cannot state exactly what we are doing but discussions are well under way.</p><p>  On the question of appointing a CEO, he or she and the management team will have all of the relevant experience.  Deputy Dooley will probably have seen the job advertised in the newspapers last weekend.  The person who will be appointed to the position of CEO will have an experience and a track record.  He or she will also have the vision and appetite to take on a challenge.  He or she will be someone who wants to make a name for himself or herself, particularly as doing so is a possibility in this instance.  We will be obliged to fill gaps in the management team and it will be the responsibility of the CEO to identify and fill those gaps.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the existence of such gaps is inevitable.</p><p>  I will not comment on the situation regarding Ryanair and Aer Lingus, particularly as it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  I will also not engage in hypothetical speculation on the matter.  We are considering this issue but it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on it.</p></speech>

The task force did very good work on that matter.  We have identified this as one of the main areas in which Shannon can grow.  The Deputy referred to Lynx Cargo.  Representatives from the latter are coming to visit us next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300005#E00500"><p>I welcome Ms Hynes and thank her for her presentation.  She is obviously very eminently qualified for the task ahead.</p><p>  Ms Hynes pointed out the challenges and opportunities for the airport.  She referred to the 14% decline in passenger numbers, the 6% decline in terminal traffic and 50% decline in transit traffic.  Ms Hynes indicated that the challenge for the new authority is to increase passenger numbers to 2.5 million and she suggested that what Shannon will do to achieve this will not be to the detriment of any other airport.  Shannon's immediate competitors are Cork Airport, Kerry Airport and Ireland West Airport Knock, which is located in the part of the country in which I live.  The catchment area relating to Cork and Kerry airports comprises a population of 1.2 million or 1.3 million and the number of people who live in the catchment area of Ireland West Airport Knock is 800,000.  In other words, these three airports are located in quite a small area.  How will it be possible for Shannon to increase passenger numbers to 2.5 million without affecting those other airports in a detrimental way?  I am not stating that there is anything wrong in this regard but I fail to see how what is envisaged can be achieved without there being an impact on the other three airports to which I refer.  How would Ms Hynes respond to the accusation that the debt write-off of &euro;100 million places Shannon in a very favourable position and will lead to those other airports operating on a very uneven playing field?</p><p>  What is the position with regard to reducing costs?  I understand that for each passenger who passes through Shannon, there is a cost of &euro;6.  The equivalent cost at Ireland West Airport Knock is 87 cent.  Does Ms Hynes accept these figures?</p> <p>Where are the opportunities arising for cost reductions?  What is the reason for the decline of 14%?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Hynes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300006#F00200"><p>I will deal with Deputy O'Mahony's first question about the catchment area.  There are two types of airport in Ireland, the three State airports at Cork, Dublin and Shannon and the regional airports.  Shannon Airport is both an international and a transatlantic airport.  It is one of the two transatlantic airports in Ireland.  This is one area in which we are already working.  We have secured an increase in our passenger numbers for the coming year and years.  Shannon Airport is different to Knock airport in that it also has connections to the Heathrow hub.  When I said that it does not necessarily have to be to the detriment of other airports, of course competition will mean that we will compete with the other airports.  We will compete with Dublin Airport.  Many people in Shannon and the immediate surrounding area drive to Dublin because they cannot get the flights from Shannon.  I want to be able to say to those people that they need to be able to travel from Shannon.  Nobody was complaining when Shannon had 3.5 million passengers.  Now  Shannon Airport figures are at an all-time low and it is trying to grow back up to those figures.  Shannon's current position is unsustainable.  It must stop the decline because Shannon's own position is under threat.</p><p>  We are considering a range of options.  Shannon Airport is owned by the taxpayer and an intervention was imperative.  The reason for the decline in passenger numbers relates to five years ago.  Passenger numbers declined by 50% in those five years.  The first reason was a change in the economic climate.  Second, Ryanair pulled out of Shannon.  They were the two factors that caused the decline in the past five years.  In the past year there has been a decline of 14% in traffic.  This is attributable to two factors.  The first factor has been the cloud of uncertainty hanging over Shannon as to whether the airport would separate.  The State Airports Act was enacted in 2004.  Everybody has been talking for ten years about whether Shannon Airport would separate from the others.  The Booz report was published 18 months ago.  The cloud of uncertainty exists.  I have spoken to various stakeholders over the past five to six months.  I have been told that nobody will do business with an airport which has a cloud of uncertainty hanging over it.  On that basis we discussed deals with many airlines but none was prepared to do a deal.  They fear the unknown.  That uncertainty has been eliminated now.  It is important for Shannon Airport to get on its own feet.  As I see it, this is not about Knock and Shannon; it is about the recovery of Shannon and about stemming the losses there.  Shannon Airport was part of the DAA group which had group rules on the basis of one size fits all.  That did not work to Shannon's advantage.  Shannon needs its own focus.  I would say that this situation plus the uncertainty were the primary reasons for the decline in numbers, particularly in the last year.</p><p>  I will deal with Deputy O'Mahony's question about costs.  Because of the situation in which it finds itself, Shannon Airport must look at its costs.  There is not a business in Ireland that is not looking at its costs.  We are already examining work practices and every area of costs.  This is an imperative from our perspective.  On the question of a level playing field, I will not comment on Knock because I am not here to talk about Knock, I am here to talk about Shannon.  It was necessary that the intervention be made.  What has been happening in Shannon has been going on since 2004.  The question was asked as to whether Shannon or Cork would separate.  There has been uncertainty about Shannon.  The downward trend in passenger numbers and in overall revenue meant that something had to happen.  There is no package available for Shannon.  The State decided to reorder its assets with regard to the three State-owned airports.  This is a restructuring and a reordering of State assets.  I do not see it as anything other than that.</p></speech>

I do not see it like that.  I agree that it is important to see growth at Shannon.  I have an interest in my local area.  My question was about the overall situation.  Cork Airport is a State airport as well.  I am looking at the global picture and I wonder what will be the situation in 20 years' time.  What airports will exist in Ireland then?  What infrastructure is required to maximise the potential for the country?  I have an interest in Knock airport but I want to hear Ms Hynes's vision for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Hynes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300006#F00400"><p>That is a very good point.  We are endeavouring to do something wider than just the airport.  We are trying to grow an international aviation services centre at Shannon, as I said in my opening remarks.  There are many reasons for this policy.  Ireland has a very strong position in the aviation industry.  More than one in five of the managed aircraft in the world is managed or owned out of Ireland.  We must build on that situation.  Those businesses are here and we can do it.  Ireland needs to anchor its aviation community.  If Ireland does not do that, someone else will eat our lunch.  I refer to a headline yesterday in a Canadian newspaper, The Globe and Mail , "Ireland Defends Aircraft Leasing Crown as Asia Rises".  This is not about Knock or Shannon or Cork; this is about Ireland.  It is about what Ireland can do to protect what it has.  Places like Singapore are trying to eat our lunch.  We need to anchor what we have and we need to build on it.  Approximately 40 aviation-related businesses are currently located in Shannon, employing 1,600 people.  That is more of an aviation cluster than what Singapore had when it began.  Singapore is copying our tax policies.  We are either going to let them eat our lunch or else we are going to fight back.  In my view we need to fight back.  They are writing about us even in Canada so it is important from our perspective in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300006#F00500"><p>I thank Ms Hynes for her presentation.  I note her curriculum vitae which is very impressive.  She outlined the reasons for the dramatic drop in passenger numbers over the period, such as Ryanair pulling its services.  I assume the strategy will be to attract back some of the people who pulled out over the years.  I will not comment on the issue of Knock versus Shannon.  It is argued that Knock airport has a bigger catchment area than Shannon Airport.  Is this a stumbling block?  The committee has been informed by people making presentations about Knock airport that its catchment area is bigger and this is the reason for the increase in its passenger numbers.  I ask for Ms Hynes's opinion on this matter.</p><p>  We are informed there had been an imbalance in the apportionment of subventions, with more going to Shannon than to Knock.  It is impossible to imagine that the subvention to Shannon would be cut off.     </p> <p>It will be needed in the coming years even though technically it is independent. </p><p> In regard to the military use of Shannon, I am curious about the board's input in monitoring such use.  While the number of military aircraft landing there has decreased does that have a huge monetary effect?  Is there any indication of the amount of employment for which it is responsible?  The Shannon business plan was mentioned.  Will the witness please outline some of the ideas in the plan, given that everyone is seeking to attract industry to the airport?  I am aware that services available in Shannon could be expanded.  The same issue arose in Dublin Airport which had many services for aircraft which eventually collapsed to the point where there are very few services there now.  What is the scope for expanding such services?</p><p> On the issue of the debt write-down, while it was never going to be paid, has it created a better environment?  Has the write-down been positive or is it a book saving issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Hynes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300007#G00200"><p>The job at Shannon is a major challenge.  There is nothing easy about it and there is no guarantee it can be achieved.  However, we have an ambitious plan.  I do not apologise to anybody for having a high ambition for Shannon.  The danger is not that we aim too high and miss our goal but that we aim too low and achieve it.  The Deputy asked about the debt write-down.  There was not actually a debt write-down.  Shannon was part of the DAA group which had debt.  When Shannon was separated from the DAA group, the debt remained with the DAA group.  Therefore, the DAA group is responsible for the debt.  That deals with that issue.</p><p>  In regard to subvention, Shannon is one of the three State airports.  For State aid reasons, Shannon must make its own way in the world.  It is independent, it is a commercial semi-State company and is not entitled to receive subvention.  The reason Shannon was separated from the group was to allow it take on the challenges.  Shannon, as part of the group, was in danger and was going only one way.  </p><p>  On the issue of military traffic, we will do what we can to grow military traffic.  There is a certain slice of the pie at any particular point in time, depending on US troop movements to various places, and we will certainly do what we can to increase our share of such traffic.  In regard to a Shannon business plan, there is no silver bullet for Shannon and there are many opportunities to be explored.  The issue is not about passengers alone.  The bigger point in respect of Shannon is the creation of an aviation centre of excellence which will not just be about Shannon.  Currently, Shannon is an important driver for the mid-west region but it could become an important driver for Ireland if we can achieve that goal.  The big picture for Shannon is much broader than passenger numbers.  It is not a picnic, it is a serious challenge and there is no guarantee it can be achieved.     </p></speech>

I am delighted to see a woman at the head of the authority.  Her CV is very impressive.  While Deputy Ellis has touched on the military issue, was there an over-reliance on the military side of business?  When business was easy, was there was a laissez-faire attitude? That may not have been the case.  I am aware that Shannon Airport is very strong in the Irish psyche.  We would certainly want to promote and do everything we can for Shannon Airport.  From a safety point of view, Shannon is extremely important.  I do not recall the particular incident but a couple of weeks ago there was an emergency landing at Shannon which was the only airport at which the aeroplane could land.</p><p>  The passenger experience at Shannon is extremely good.  What type of passenger is Shannon Airport trying to attract?  Is passenger traffic mainly business or tourist or a mixture of both and how is it intended to increase passenger numbers?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300007#G00500"><p>I wish Ms Rose Hynes well in her role which is hugely important not only for the mid-west region but the whole western region.  Following on from two earlier comments, there is a need to look at Shannon Airport not in the context of a transatlantic route from the mid-west but as the only transatlantic route from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  That has been lost in recent years to the detriment of the airport.  A former Member made a prophesy that the rabbits would be running around in the airport at Shannon.  Had the Government not done what it did, there would be a wildlife sanctuary on the runway.  I wish Ms Hynes well in that context.</p><p>  On the issue of military traffic, the irony was not lost on me or on other Members, given that some political parties have had a field day protesting outside Shannon and then expressing concern at the jobs that might be lost as a result.  Is it only the US that uses Shannon for that purpose or are other countries interested because obviously the issue of jobs is hugely important?</p><p>  Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited has a huge landbank across the region, which includes a considerable amount of County Limerick.  For many years, west Limerick has fallen off the radar in terms of inward investment and job creation due to the mixed relationship involving IDA, local authorities and Shannon Development in regard to the landbank.  Given that the landbank will be transferred to the ownership of the company, how does the witness envisage the board providing itself with the necessary expertise to ensure it is properly utilised?  What level of expertise should be brought on to the board to ensure that happens?  We in County Limerick, north Tipperary, Offaly and parts of Clare do not want to find that the emphasis is on the Shannon free zone and the rest of the region and its landbank is left there for buachall&aacute;n.</p><p>  In terms of private sector involvement, I am aware the company advertised for a CEO last week.  Is the chairperson designate anxious to have such involvement in the board membership and in the chief management positions?  To break the mindset at Shannon, given the fall in passenger numbers from 3.5 million to the present level, how important are the backgrounds of those who will be in management positions to drive the airport forward?  What level of expertise and experience is it envisaged those people would bring to the table?  I wish the witness well.  This is not about one airport over another.  I am based at an equal distance from Cork and Shannon but Shannon Airport is hugely important to maintain a transatlantic emphasis from Cork to Donegal.  </p> <p>Furthermore, I urge the authority to look to emerging markets in the Middle East and beyond.</p></speech>

She has travelled to the United States from Shannon Airport in the past ten years but while arranging her last trip she got everything mixed up.  Despite this, she was very complimentary about the airport, which was gratifying.</p><p>  We will attract all types of passenger and want to improve the passenger experience for everybody.  Shannon Airport is largely uncongested and represents an easy run for passengers.  One can park outside the door and go in and out easily.  It is the customer who decides where he or she will go.  To us, the customer experience is what is important.  We will offer the best experience we can and focus on customers, thereby winning as many as we can.  It is not just a case of competing with other airports; it is about the customer deciding.  The customer will ultimately go where he or she wants and where the best deal and experience are to be found.  We want the customer experience to be memorable for the right reasons.</p><p>  With regard to over-reliance on the military, the maximum number of military passengers in Shannon Airport has been approximately 340,000.  Therefore, there has not been an over-reliance on them.  We have sought the business and it has been important.  Military traffic has been in the DNA of Shannon Airport for many years.  It is important and lucrative and we will certainly target as much of it as we can get.</p><p>  On the question of safety, Shannon Airport is unique in that it is the only 24 hour airport in Ireland.  For this, it does not receive an immediate reimbursement.  In the task force report we have said we need to keep this under surveillance, as it is important to us.  As the military traffic uses the 24 hour service, it makes sense to remain open.  With regard to Deputy Patrick O'Donovan's comments, I have not yet seen any rabbits.  We intend to increase the volume of military traffic, but we will consider trying to attract traffic from other areas, as the Deputy suggested.</p><p>  With regard to the land-bank and the people required to manage the new operation, the restructuring of Shannon Development will occur in the next six months and the legislation will be dealt with.  During that period it will be decided exactly what lands and properties will be transferred.  A number of the people in Shannon Development dealing with the properties will be transferred also.  As I stated, we will be seeking to fill gaps in our management group once we see what our full complement of staff will be following the exercise.  Members may rest assured that we will work with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to ensure the region will benefit.  The very intention of putting Shannon Development and Shannon Airport together is to enable both entities to achieve their full potential to the benefit of the region, not otherwise.  I will certainly play my part to ensure the region will benefit.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Ms Hynes is present primarily to talk about increasing passenger numbers and making Shannon Airport viable again.  Anybody in the west would welcome this in principle.  My focus is very much on one aspect of Ms Hynes's excellent presentation in which she referred to Shannon Airport being used as a terminal and said she wanted to increase the number of passengers entering the country.  This, in a sense, counters the concerns about existing catchment areas within Ireland.  Obviously, the growth in numbers will require an increase in the number of passengers from overseas.  What plans are there at this early stage to attract more passengers from markets that are already reasonably well developed such as the German market?</p><p>  I understand commercial sensitivities prevent Ms Hynes from answering certain questions.  That said, it seems one of the key areas concerns Ryanair.  The relationship Shannon Airport has had with Ryanair has been somewhat fraught during the years.  How does Ms Hynes envisage that relationship panning out during her term of office?  It seems it could be a key driver for bringing more people into Ireland.  The problem is that the increase in tourist numbers in recent years, modest as it has been, seems to be centred almost exclusively on Dublin and surrounding counties.  It is not filtering into the west.  In spite of there being a very developed tourism infrastructure across the west, including counties Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Leitrim and Donegal, we are not gaining from the increase.  Many family-owned businesses in the tourism sector are actually struggling and will obviously be looking on Shannon as an international airport.  It is very deep in the psyche of the Irish people.  That is why I would like Ms Hynes's views on increasing the number of passengers coming to Ireland from some of the developed tourism markets.</p></speech>

I thank her for her presentation and wish her well in her endeavours for Shannon Airport.</p><p>  With regard to the dramatic fall in the number of passengers which plummeted from over 3 million in 2007 to 1.5 million at present, I am worried about the reliance on transatlantic passenger traffic.  Tourists from the United States and Canada are now selecting destinations in South America, including Peru and Colombia.  This has been a growing trend in the past two to three years and it is very worrying for the Irish tourism industry.  What efforts will be made to counteract this?  Can we increase passenger numbers, given this phenomenon?</p><p>  I read the report on freight and cargo.  Shannon Airport only attracts 10% of the cargo trade, while 90% of exports leave from Dublin.  Some years ago the former CEO of Shannon Development Mr. Liam McElligott met the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and another individual to propose that Shannon Airport become an international flight hub concentrating exclusively on the freight market.  Geographically, the airport is in an ideal location for this.  Mr. Bertie Ahern asked whether there was a model to draw on.  There was not; in this regard, Mr. McElligott was ahead of his time, as there was considerable potential.  Owing to possible implications at political level involving the Dublin Airport Authority, for example, the proposal was never advanced.  I ask Ms Hynes to consider reviving the proposal with her board.  At any given time the vast majority of freight appears to be transported by air.</p><p>  As part of a delegation, I attended a meeting some 12 months ago with the former US ambassador, Mr. Dan Rooney.  In a discussion on Irish economic circumstances I raised the issue of Shannon Airport and other airports along the western seaboard, including the regional airport in Kerry.  Mr. Rooney stated Shannon Airport had great potential to be an international freight hub.  Perhaps Ms Hynes might consider having 50% of its business based on freight and 50% on passengers.</p> <p>Perhaps this would ensure the future viability of the likes of Kerry Airport.  We could develop it into one similar to Knock airport and could perhaps get more international traffic with the development of the runway and so on.  Perhaps there should be a sea change in our thinking in regard to these aspects of developing Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

I was going to mention cargo but Deputy Fleming covered that.  Ms Hynes has a very ambitious plan and a very challenging job to increase passenger numbers and I do not expect she will get those numbers overnight.  There will have to be a steady increase.  She will report through the Minister on, I hope, increased passenger numbers at Shannon Airport.  Will she give us some idea on whether there is a critical mass of passenger numbers on which the survival of Shannon Airport depends?  How will Ms Hynes look at alternative business?  Deputy Fleming mentioned cargo and there is miliary aircraft maintenance and so on.  Essentially, is there a plan B for Shannon Airport if the minimum targets are not met?</p></speech>

Ryanair was in Shannon Airport when we had high passenger numbers.  It is still an important customer of Shannon Airport and we have a number of Ryanair flights.  We have a very good relationship with Ryanair and we are in discussion with it as well as with a number of other airlines.  We will be seeking to increase passenger numbers in Shannon Airport, both inbound and outbound.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned the German market, in particular.  Without giving the game away, I can confirm to him that we are already in discussion with the German market in regard to inbound flights.  Passengers coming into Shannon Airport will go up and down the west coast.  They are more likely to stay on the west coast than if they came into Dublin Airport.</p><p>  We do not intend unsustainable growth with Ryanair.  That was an issue in the past.  We will not go there again.  We have to learn from the problems of the past.  We certainly see passengers travelling up to and down from Dublin.  We will certainly target those passengers.  </p></speech>

It seemed to me from the arguments put forward at the time that Ryanair's relationship with Shannon Airport was to do with landing costs.  I am curious-----</p></speech>

I am just saying that the cost factor seems to be a major one if there is a difference, as outlined by Deputy O'Mahony, between say Knock and Shannon airports.  Obviously, it is an area at which Ms Hynes will have to look.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Hynes" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300009#J00700"><p>I am not going to get into comparing Knock and Shannon airports.  We will do everything we can to cut our cost base and to work on that.  We know we have to do that and we have to try to get it into line with, or as close as we can to, our peers.  That is a big task and a big challenge but we will do it.  That is already under way.  We are certainly going to do what we can to increase passenger numbers but, as I said, it will be inbound and outbound.</p><p>  Shannon Airport is an international and a transatlantic airport.  Its transatlantic catchment area is from one side of the country to the other.  It is the only transatlantic airport on the west coast.  I see areas where we can work together in terms of inbound traffic and in terms of the western seaboard and what we can do.  There are areas where we can work with the tourism authorities for the benefit of all.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming referred to South American and Canadian traffic.  We will certainly work with the tourism agencies to see what we can do.  This year with The Gathering, it is really important for us to attract as many travellers as we can from throughout the world, but in particular from the US.  We are certainly working on that and are very focused on it.  </p><p>  In terms of the cargo hub, that is something the task force recommended and at which we are actively looking.  We see it as very important.  Over the weekend, I read about the volumes of cargo going through Foynes in Deputy O'Donovan's area-----</p></speech>

There are very high volumes going through Foynes as well, so we intend to join the dots in regard to all of that.  The greatest volume of cargo traffic leaving Ireland leaves in lorries and trucks.  It does not leave Ireland by air.  We are looking at that and are working with the Irish Exporters Association.  In its recent report, it was very positive in regard to the opportunities for Shannon Airport.  We are right in there following that.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Harrington, we have an ambitious plan.  He asked if we had a plan B.  One always has a plan B but I will not tell him what it is.</p></speech>

Obviously, her job is very challenging.  She spoke about an all-time high of 3.5 million passengers to 1.4 million this year, so there is a task to be done.  Connectivity is extremely important for an island nation.</p><p>  I have a few questions but I would like to comment briefly on the situation which has been emerging from Knock and Kerry airports.  It is extremely important that Knock, Shannon and Kerry airports work together for the benefit of the west of Ireland.  We have seen a huge surge in traffic to the east coast of Ireland.  The area of balanced regional development is extremely important.  I listened to the debate on an Adjournment matter in the Seanad last night.  I hope the Member who made that complaint to the European Commission might consider his position because it is ill-judged and it would be in the best interest of the whole of the west of Ireland if we all worked together.</p><p>  Nobody spoke about the customs and border protection pre-clearance facility put into Shannon Airport a few years ago at a cost of &euro;20 million.  It is now in Dublin Airport as well but it is totally under-utilised.  It was one of the first such facilities in the world outside of an island off the coast of Venezuela.  This facility was put in place in the interest of corporate traffic and scheduled traffic.  It is currently being used by British Airways and a number of others.  Will Ms Hynes comment on the role of this in regard to corporate jets because it is an important area in the Middle East?  Many corporate jets cross the Atlantic on a daily and weekly basis.  How much of that traffic can Shannon Airport capture because I know it has been tried in the past and, unfortunately, we do not have the volume we should have in that area?   </p><p>  Ms Hynes spoke about scheduled flights and transit traffic.  During the year of the 3.5 million passengers, we were over-reliant on Ryanair and some of the previous speakers referred to that.  Ms Hynes said we have learned from the past.  I hope we have done so because we saw Shannon Airport go down as a result of Ryanair dropping services from the airport.</p> <p>Will Ms Hynes comment on the importance of the transatlantic business for Shannon Airport and how she intends to increase it?</p><p> I was pleased to hear that the airport is in negotiations with a German airline.  A hub destination for Shannon is especially important for business people and I know that the airport had a connection to the hub in Paris previously.  How important is this for Shannon, London Heathrow Airport aside?  The London Heathrow connection is important, but it is important to have an alternative hub in mainland Europe as well which would fulfil the role Ms Hynes has adverted to with regard to tourism, business and connectivity to other areas.  I realise other speakers wish to raise the matter and that it is important.  Therefore, I have no wish to go over questions that were asked before on the US Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance facility and transatlantic traffic.  That is decidedly important for Shannon and always has been.  How does Ms Hynes intend to increase business in this area, especially in the year of The Gathering?  I realise she has referred to the new services coming in, but what are the other areas where we can increase traffic from the mainland?</p></speech>

I am a Deputy representing Limerick city.  Shannon Airport is synonymous with the city and is very important to it.  I wish to take up a point on transatlantic business made by Deputy Breen in the discussion on what Shannon Airport brings.  We need a counterpoint to the east side of the country.  Shannon Airport brings the transatlantic option which the other airports do not have, but they are complementary.  I agree with Deputy Breen.  What marketing resources will Ms Hynes put into play to market the airport and promote the pre-clearance facility in order that Shannon Airport can become a transatlantic international hub?  The way I see it, a rising tide lifts all boats.  I am keen to concentrate on the distinguishing features of Shannon Airport over other airports along the western seaboard.</p><p>  What is Ms Hynes's vision?  If I were to ask her what she envisages for five years' time, how does she see Shannon Airport and the region in respect of the reorganisation, re-energising and reincarnation of the airport?  What would she like to see?  What does she expect to see?  How will all of this benefit the region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1134" speakername="Tony Mulcahy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300010#K00300"><p>I congratulate Ms Hynes and I pledge my support to the Shannon project.  I have lived in the town for 35 years and I have watched the decline of the airport as it has occurred dramatically during the past ten years.  I fully agree with Ms Hynes that the challenges are global, but they bring global opportunities as well.  I take advice from a friend of mine on the aviation industry.  He has informed me that there is a good deal of opportunity abroad, and my questions centre on this issue.  One problem is that in general we tend to focus on passenger numbers and the numbers coming through the airport.  There is no question that these numbers are important, but the Shannon project is about greater proposals, and I call on Ms Hynes to address some of these.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donnell has probably hit the nail on the head in his question about a vision for where we should be in five years' time.  Specifically, will Ms Hynes comment on the aviation overhaul and maintenance industry and where she envisages it will be?  Where will the aircraft leasing and support industry be?  What will feature in the growth of industry and the industrial estates in the area?  What role will the IDA and Enterprise Ireland play?  Will they have a direct involvement in the board?  I believe that could be important.</p><p>  Deputy Breen raised the issue of expansion of the pre-clearance passenger and cargo facilities.  How does Ms Hynes envisage these coming together?  I believe all of these issues are more important than passenger numbers, because these areas are where the real job growth lies.  If Ms Hynes delivered an increase of 10% in jobs in the industrial estate that would be an extra 900 jobs, but if there were a 10% increase in jobs in the airport that would represent only 23 more jobs.  It stands to reason that we should concentrate on the industrial base and where we can tie into it.  We have a considerable aviation base at the moment but we need to take on the international challenges.</p></speech>

It is clear that she has a vision and an ambition for the region.  I have every confidence that Ms Hynes will make Shannon Airport a success.  Something had to happen and I believe this is the best outcome for Shannon Airport and the region.</p><p>  I have been taken by Ms Hynes's ability to bring people and organisations on board.  It is clear that the region and people involved in businesses and tourism welcome what has happened in Shannon and look forward to the project getting under way.  I have raised this subject with Ms Hynes in a private capacity.  I believe we need to build on what has been done.  There should be regional meetings throughout Ireland at which Ms Hynes could outline her vision for the airport and where she sees it going, and to get buy-in from stakeholders and those involved in tourism and business to sell the message about Shannon.  This could be done in an international sense as well to get key people involved in the airport.</p><p>  To build on the progress to date there is a need for reform, and people must support the airport and its endeavours in future.  I see a role in this regard for an entity underneath the board.  The board should be tight and focused and have people with an appropriate background and knowledge as well as a vision and an ambition for the region.  I look forward to the appointment of the board.  I am keen to hear Ms Hynes's view on the need for a forum.  There should be a set of regional meetings in order that she can outline her vision and the vision of Shannon Airport for the region and, principally, to get buy-in from industry and people in tourism throughout the country, especially those along the western seaboard.</p><p>  I do not intend to go over ground that has been covered before, but one issue has been raised already.  There are questions about the business plan.  I believe it is ambitious but achievable.  Will Ms Hynes nail down the question and outline to people how it stands up and how it will work?  It is clearly achievable for the airport to increase passenger traffic by 1 million in the coming years, and the development of the international aviation services centre is a key part of this.  It is a key selling point.  It has the capacity to increase the number of jobs and growth in the region.  Does Ms Hynes envisage job announcements in the near future from companies that are coming on board?</p></speech>

A combination of Shannon Airport and a restructured Shannon Development could be successful.  What would success look like in five years' time?  The aim and ambition is to have passenger numbers of 2.5 million or thereabouts, to have created a cargo hub and a transit passenger hub and to have gone much of the way towards an international aviation services centre.  That is what I envisage for five years' time.  None of this will happen overnight, but in a three- to five-year period I believe we will see things happening.</p></speech>

It will take five years to achieve it.  It will not occur overnight because it depends on infrastructure.  One of the first things we need to do is to develop an integration plan, because a land bank is being added to the airport, giving us more than 1,000 hectares.  Such an integration plan is necessary and possibly we will push out air side.</p> <p>One looks at all of that and then one determines what one can build.  Someone asked about private investment and we will be attempting to attract private investment, on a joint venture basis, for new businesses at Shannon.  That is the game plan for the next five years.</p><p> On the question of the forum, I am all for collaboration.  Unless we collaborate, we will not get this done.  This is not about any one airport or any one place.  To me it is about Ireland Inc. and about the entire west coast, in particular.  We must all work together to achieve this.  I am certainly open to collaborating with others, including competitors at other airports.  We need to grow the pie here.  We must look at the big picture.  I am in favour of collaboration, whether it is called a forum or something else.  I certainly intend to collaborate because this will not be done otherwise.  No solo run will get this done.  We must collaborate.</p><p> The composition of the board is a matter for the Minister and as I said, that process is under way.  The Minister will decide who is appointed to the board.  I agree that we must get buy-in from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and, indeed, they were involved in the task force.  I have had meetings with the CEOs of both organisations in the last month and we intend to continue those discussions and to work with them closely because they are the people who will be charged with delivery of the jobs.  We have to work together because it is not going to happen any other way.</p><p> Customs and Border Protection, CBP, is a hugely important facility for Shannon and, as was said already, Shannon is the only place outside of the Americas where it exists.  I agree that it is under utilised and a big part of our marketing campaign will focus on increasing its usage in the business travel sector.  The corporate jet market is wide open.  The small island of Malta set up a task force in 2008 which looked at the worldwide aviation market and determined that Malta should target the corporate jet market and it has done quite well in that regard.   Malta is an island that only measures 25 km by 17 km and is about the size of one of our counties.  We cannot let those guys eat our lunch.  We have to go after that market.  The Maltese also looked at what Ireland was doing in aviation in general terms and copied some of it.  This is not about one Irish airport versus another but about the international competition.  We will certainly be going after the corporate jet market and indeed, that is one of the recommendations of the task force report.  The report also recommends examining the possibility of establishing a separate registry for corporate jets and we are currently in discussions with the Irish Aviation Authority on that.  We have set up a working group on the issue.  The more we can do to attract people and the more we can do to market Ireland to the corporate jet market the better.  I have no doubt we can increase our share of that pie.</p><p> Transatlantic traffic is hugely important, especially in the context of The Gathering this year.  We intend to push that market more.  As I have said, we have already got increased capacity for the summer of this year but that is not enough.  We are going to push this and get more capacity.  That, again, increases the pie for Ireland Inc.  </p><p> Creating a hub for transit passengers is another recommendation of the task force report.  Heathrow is very important in this regard but we must develop another hub outside of Heathrow and we are working on that at the moment.  </p><p> I agree that the rising tide can lift all boats.  A question was posed about the distinguishing features of Shannon.  It has the longest runway in Ireland, is one of two transatlantic airports on the western seaboard and has connectivity to Heathrow.  It has many firsts and has a history of innovation.  That spirit of innovation is alive in Shannon but it has under-utilised infrastructure.  It will have a land bank of over 1,100 hectares which is really important.  There is already a cluster of aviation activity in Shannon and that cluster is greater than what places like Singapore, Dubai or Hamburg had when they started.  We have 40 aviation-related entities employing 1,600 people, including Shannon Aerospace and GECAS, which is one of the largest aviation companies in the world.  We must look after what we already have.  Shannon has a huge history of innovation.  Aer Rianta International was born in Shannon.  The airport has a good future but the challenge is enormous.  We must all work together on this.</p><p> I hope I have addressed all of the questions and points raised.</p></speech>

I grew up and attended primary school in Saudi Arabia and returned to Ireland for my secondary education, boarding at Rathdown School, Glenageary, and subsequently at King&rsquo;s Hospital School, Palmerstown.  I graduated from UCD in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in business and legal studies.  I also completed a certificate in marketing and French and was subsequently employed by the British Potato Council in Oxford as an export marketing executive.  The British Potato Council is a semi-state body funded through levies from the potato industry.  I was promoted after two and half years to the position of export manager.  My main responsibility during the course of the two roles was the management of external international consultants.  These consultants managed the public image of British seed and consumer potatoes through media management, trade shows, seed growth trials and government relationships.  The target markets included Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Turkey and Lebanon.  The experience of managing and directing diverse independent consultants and projects will be of use in my role overseeing the work of MCIB.</p><p>  I represented the British Potato Council on the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs export industry committee, which was a forum to co-ordinate the international activities of a diverse range of British food and cultural promotional bodies and to promote excellence in exports through the annual export awards.  The committee also offered a forum to discuss any difficulties encountered in international markets.  I completed my employment in the British Potato Council in a consumer marketing role, promoting the industry to consumers in association with retailers and potato processors.  I had budgetary responsibility in all of these roles, ensuring that limited resources were applied to gain the maximum or greatest result.</p><p>  I returned to Ireland in 2003 and commenced retraining as a barrister-at-law.  During my training I worked as a legal executive for Aidan Collins, an independent solicitor, and subsequently in the commercial litigation department of McCann FitzGerald.  These were support roles which focused on legal research and case preparation.  In essence I was responsible for distilling legislation and case law into key principles and clear and concise summaries.  I graduated from the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns with a merit and was called to the Bar in July 2005.  While devilling with Caroline Cummings, BL, in 2005, I obtained experience in criminal law and judicial review.  I gained further experience in 2006 while devilling with Marian Moylan, BL, and Carrie Jane Canniffe, BL, in family law and commercial law.  I have a civil law practice based in Dublin and I predominantly work in the areas of judicial review, commercial law, personal injuries, family law and employment law.  </p><p>  In the area of judicial review, I have provided legal opinions and drafted proceedings on behalf of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na challenging the procedures in disciplinary investigations.  I have also provided legal advice to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office on challenges by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to decisions on the Garda compensation scheme.  One of the cornerstones of the Irish Bar is the fact that barristers are independent and can represent the State and those challenging the State in different cases.  My commercial work has included advising on contractual and negligence disputes and representing large financial institutions in debt recovery proceedings.  I have also successfully enforced foreign judgments pursuant to Council regulations and the Lugano Convention.  I have represented clients and insurance companies in a range of personal injuries actions, including physical and psychological injuries.  I have also advised clients on bullying and harassment claims and employment contract disputes.  I recently managed a team of barristers in a large electronic discovery process for a commercial funds dispute.  I was a member of the family Bar working group, which was tasked with exploring the role of alternative dispute resolution in family disputes in December 2007.  This included assisting in the drafting of a response to the report of Dr. Carol Coulter on the family law courts.</p><p>  In 2008 I was appointed by the arbitration committee of the Bar Council to two working groups to assist in preparations for a conference of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration and a conference for young arbitration practitioners.  These working groups were established to market and promote the involvement of practitioners in the conferences.  Following an interview process I was then selected by the arbitration committee to intern at the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in New York.</p><p>  During my time at the Bar, I have taught law to a range of students who have varying levels of and requirements for legal knowledge.  I currently tutor on the diploma in legal studies course in the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns.  I also tutor on the barrister-at-law degree course, which concentrates on practice and procedure.  I have developed and lectured an introduction to law course for final-year engineering students in UCD, which includes law of contract, tort, legal systems and health and safety legislation.</p><p>  My experience, while diverse, will meet some of the key skills that are required in this role - namely, objectivity, independence and a focus on fair procedures.  I was informed of the possible vacancy in the membership of the MCIB in September 2012 and submitted my curriculum vitae to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for consideration.  I am grateful to the previous chairman, John O&rsquo;Donnell, BL, and board for the excellent work they did in setting up the MCIB and establishing the current procedures.  I am also grateful to Martin Diskin, J&uuml;rgen Whyte and Margaret Bell for taking time to discuss with me the workings of the MCIB and their vision for the future.</p><p>  The MCIB was established pursuant to the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 and Statutory Instrument No. 276 of 2011, European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 2011.  Its function is to carry out investigations of marine casualties involving Irish vessels or taking place in Irish waters.</p> <p>The result of those investigations is to ascertain the cause of the incident in order to enable the MCIB to make recommendations to the Minister.  The reports can sometimes make for difficult reading.  The recommendations in them assist in preventing the repetition of such incidents.  At all times, the paramount focus of the MCIB is to assist in the promotion of a culture of safety in the water.</p><p> The assignment of blame or fault does not fall under the remit of the MCIB.  It is important that this essential feature of its remit continues to be promoted.  It is necessary for the efficient management of investigations that those who are interviewed in the course of individual investigations understand that their purpose is purely to ascertain the cause of the incident.  This promotes openness, which could otherwise be a difficulty.  It is important to keep in mind that a whole village or community will have been touched by some incidents.  A further key statutory provision is the independent nature of the MCIB, which enables it to criticise the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport if and when required.  Independence in respect of a relationship with the industry is also important.  I have no connection with the marine industry.  Therefore, I am unlikely to be conflicted in any situation.</p><p> It is clear that the MCIB has very qualified investigators and knowledgeable board members.  I see my role as providing independent leadership and guidance to ensure fair procedures are followed in the course of investigations.  The prompt and accurate publication of reports is essential to the work of the MCIB.  That will remain a key focus of its work into the future.  In essence, this follows on from the procedures that have been established over the last ten years.  The most recent published annual report of the MCIB, which relates to 2010, gives a useful comparison of marine casualties from 2002 to 2010, as well as fatality trends during that period.  It is heartening to see a downward trend in fatalities in most categories, although the worrying increase in recreational craft fatalities reminds us of the need to communicate with those who are not necessarily working in the marine industry but enjoy the benefits of our access to water-based activities.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for their time and patience this morning.  If I am fortunate enough to be appointed as chairman of the MCIB, I look forward to working closely with the other board members and the investigators to ensure the MCIB continues to be run in an efficient manner and the paramount requirement of safety at sea and in our inland waters is promoted.</p></speech>

It is a statutory obligation.  They are keen to ensure the industry can see that the MCIB is a purely independent body, the sole function of which is to ascertain the cause of an incident.  There appears to be a trend in other accident investigation arenas whereby there is a fear that the information and evidence accumulated can be used in litigation processes.  That is not the reason for the existence of this board.  It works purely to put recommendations together and thereby facilitate the Minister in ensuring such incidents do not occur again or do not occur as frequently.  That is the vision that I see and that the other members see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300013#N00400"><p>I welcome Ms Cassidy and congratulate her on her nomination as chairman designate.  I have had the sad duty of reading MCIB reports on many occasions in recent years.  Many of those involved in the incidents investigated in the reports were friends or acquaintances of mine.  Ms Cassidy is right to suggest that the reports often make for distressing reading.  I hope the professionalism shown by the MCIB in the writing and publishing of its reports will continue under Ms Cassidy's stewardship.</p><p>  I would like to ask a few questions.  Ms Cassidy seemed to emphasise independence as a key factor throughout her presentation.  I welcome the fact that she does not have a connection to this country's marine industry or to the leisure, sea-fisheries and commercial sectors of our small marine community.  It is depressing that, as an island nation, we do not look towards our maritime resource in the way we should.  If Ms Cassidy had a prior involvement with the marine industry, I have no doubt that a conflict would eventually arise.  I welcome that aspect of Ms Cassidy's character.</p><p>  It is obvious that many of the recommendations made by the MCIB in recent reports have been viewed with great seriousness by the relevant Departments, and rightly so.  Does Ms Cassidy have a view on the role of the Health and Safety Authority in marine issues?  In my opinion, the Marine Survey Office should be the lead authority when it comes to safety at sea.  What does Ms Cassidy think about the possibility of the Health and Safety Authority getting involved in such matters?  Does she have a view on the use of personal locator beacons, which would allow casualties to be recovered quickly or, in the case of an unfortunate tragedy, bodies to be found?  If not, will she develop a view on it?  There are some compatibility issues with such devices at the moment.  It is something the MCIB could take a view on.  I do not suggest it should comment on their use in individual incidents, but perhaps it could make some kind of recommendation for the future.</p><p>  I appreciate that Ms Cassidy is just beginning her work in this role, but I would like to ask her about one aspect of the recommendations of the MCIB about which I am concerned.  Over the years, public representatives have constantly commented on this in the context of health and safety legislation.  Is there a danger that we are gilding the lily in terms of health and safety legislation?  I do not want to take it to an extreme, but the obvious way to prevent casualties at sea is to avoid going to sea.  A balance can be struck somewhere in the middle of that.  Would Ms Cassidy be conscious of the concern that many of the MCIB's recommendations might overstep the mark?  If they restrict this country's engagement with its marine resources, which is already quite poor, they will make things even more difficult.</p></speech>

I have not yet considered one or two of the matters he raised.  As he is aware, I have not yet started to work with the board.  I have met some of the members of the board, however.  I would like to respond to the concern expressed by the Deputy about the possibility of gilding the lily.  I understand there is always a fear that if we go too far, we will end up telling people to stay on land, or to stay in a seat and make sure it has four legs.  We do not want to tell people not to move.  Having read some of the MCIB reports, it seems to me that the recommendations that are made are sensible.  Mr. Brian Hogan, who is the board's head surveyor, has a great deal of experience in the marine industry.  For that reason, I believe flights of fancy will be taken down.  I suggest that the management of the board has a role in ensuring recommendations are sensible or can be legislated for.  While I am not offering legal advice to the board, I hope my background in law will give me a realism in the world, even without my knowledge of the marine industry.</p> <p>Therefore, we would not be over-recommending but we would be making recommendations that are sensible and which we believe could improve the situation in both the marine industry and with regard to leisure craft.</p><p> With regard to the Health and Safety Authority getting involved, the recommendations go to the Minister and they can result in a code of conduct or further regulation or statutory instruments.  I believe it would be for the Minister to make the decision as to who would be the overriding authority in ensuring compliance in those situations.  I have not had a view with regard to directly engaging with the Health and Safety Authority and I do not believe that, under the legislation, I or the board would, in fact, have that ability, although I will take that on board and I will investigate it.</p><p> In terms of general policy, my view from reading the legislation is that the board's role is to merely look at the incidents and for recommendations to flow from the incidents and from the causes of incidents.  I do not believe there is a power within the board to make general policy recommendations outside of the reports on the incidents that have happened.  That would be my current stance in regard to the personal beacons that were mentioned, although, obviously, if that arose in a situation and it was a recommendation that would have been of assistance, then there is no difficulty in the board making a recommendation flowing from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300014#O00200"><p>I thank Ms Cassidy for her presentation and wish her all the best in the job.  Increasingly, we are seeing recreational casualties.  On the face of it, casualties have reduced in recent years but that could easily change if we get warm weather or the weather changes.  What Ms Cassidy said about health and safety crosses over into that and, with regard to Ms Cassidy's role, I was interested in hearing more in terms of whether, given the MCIB is there to make recommendations, it would make recommendations in regard to each incident, particularly those involving recreational craft.</p><p>  With regard to the powers of the board, while it examines incidents and makes recommendations, has it any further role beside that?  How many people are employed in this area?  Does the board have the equipment necessary to follow up on these incidents?  How in-depth are the investigations?  If incidents are examined and recommendations made, there has to be research and someone has to provide the statistics and explain exactly what has happened.  How in-depth is that?  Does this include recommendations in regard to the emergency services such as the helicopter services if, for example, they did not respond?  Is there a role for the board to state that, for example, it feels the emergency services were very poor in a given situation?</p><p>  I know it is a part-time board and Ms Cassidy might tell us how often it sits.  In terms of the North-South links between the two different areas, does the MCIB have a linking role with its counterparts in the North and does it share information with regard to incidents and best practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-23a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliona Cassidy" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013012300014#O00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The investigations arise out of each incident so a report is created for each incident and, if it is appropriate, a recommendation flows from that.  With regard to the question of a further role, the board is there for the investigation of marine casualties, and this has quite a broad term within the legislation, so it does not necessarily require a fatality or the sinking of a ship.  For example, a boat running aground would be deemed an incident, and the board may then decide to investigate that.</p><p>  With regard to employees and proper equipment, we have access to the surveyors and investigators of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and they wear an MCIB hat when they are investigating in that particular situation.  Therefore, they go in not to assess whether regulations were followed or whether there was compliance, but to ascertain merely the cause of the incident.  Within that, they can involve the Garda, they can interview and they can look at the vessel involved, depending on the type of incident.  I do not believe there is any issue with regard to proper equipment or access to surveyors.  Over the past two years, an independent surveyor list has been put together so, if it is inappropriate for some of the surveyors who are within the Department to investigate a particular incident, we have independent surveyors we can call on in that situation.  Again, I do not believe there is an issue with regard to our access to the appropriate expertise required in the investigation of reports at this time.</p><p>  With regard to the potential for querying or criticising the emergency services, our independence is pure so if it means we are criticising the Department, elements of the Department or the regulatory authority in regard to marine incidents, we have the power to do that and, where it is appropriate, we will do that.  That will not change under my stewardship.</p><p>  The board sits on 12 separate occasions during the year and, as Deputy Ellis rightly pointed out, it is a part-time board.  Those board meetings are to assess whether there are any new incidents that need investigation, how ongoing investigations are proceeding and what needs to be done next, to ensure the publication of reports as and when they are completed and to ensure they have been commented on by those who may be adversely affected by them.</p><p>  In regard to North-South links, I have to admit I am not sure of the position.  I can come back to the committee with an answer but I am afraid I cannot give members any information in response to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Her presentation answered many of the questions we might have had because it is so thorough.  As Deputy Harrington said, the theme of independence is coming through loud and clear.  I note also that Ms Cassidy actually applied for this job.  In the past there would have been situations where people were head-hunted or friends were appointed, so I want to note and welcome the fact that Ms Cassidy's independence is copper-fastened by the fact she applied for this post.</p> <p>She mentioned that she sees her role as independent to ensure fair procedures are followed in investigations.  If she believes fair procedures are not being followed, what powers does she have and what action can she take to ensure that procedures are fair?  Does the board's role differ when it is investigating incidents involving international vessels compared to cases involving Irish vessels?  Does it liaise with international bodies at that stage?</p><p> Ms Cassidy and Deputy Ellis mentioned leisure boating accidents and the dangers involved in leisure boating because it may be less controlled than other forms of boating.  Is that a problem?  </p></speech>

As the board sits once a month and we get updates on the progress of a particular investigation and the drafting of the report, we can manage how that situation is arising.  A report will not be published until it has been viewed by those regarded by the board as being potentially adversely affected by the findings.  I think of fair procedures in terms of the judicial element.  The board could be subject to judicial review in, for example, seeking to prevent the publication of a report or the manner in which a report has been compiled and published.  I would ensure that during the course of the investigation, the drafting of the report and the publication period fair procedures are followed that ensure everyone is asked the appropriate questions and has an opportunity to make comments on the draft report prior to publication; I would ensure that those are carried out effectively and within the legislation.</p><p>  The legislation states that a vessel under our remit is one registered or located in this State, including Irish waters.  If an international vessel is in Irish waters when an incident occurs, we are in position to carry out an investigation if we think it appropriate.  One can see how broad it is.  The Asgard, unfortunately, sank in French waters but the board still carried out an investigation into that vessel because it was registered with the State.  If the incident happens in Irish waters, we have the opportunity to make a decision as to whether it is appropriate for us to carry out an investigation.  </p><p>  There appears to be an issue with recreational and leisure boating activities because there might be more people who have decided it is fabulous to have access to the water, which is great.  We have such amazing facilities in that respect.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has issued codes of conduct relating to leisure activities that are quite clear and contain photographs and examples of specific things that people should do.  It could be that this message has not got very far and needs to be promoted because it is a worrying trend.  The fishing industry and other commercial vessels seem to have taken on board the potential issues that have arisen in terms of certain incidents and we need to make sure we can get that message out to the general public which is likely to be using the speedboats, yachts, kayaks and open rowing boats.  </p></speech>
