    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee with Mr. Watt and colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the issues set out in the invitation letter.  I am joined by Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, and Mr. John Palmer from the central budget office in the Department.</p> <p>  Our last official forecasts were in budget 2017 and our next official forecasts will be published next week in the draft stability programme update, or SPU.  I understand the committee has already invited the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to discuss the draft SPU in more detail.  In budget 2017, we forecast real GDP growth would be 4.2% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017.  Since then, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has published quarter 3 and quarter 4 returns which showed that the second half of 2016 was much stronger than had been assumed.  It is reasonable to expect the figure next week to improve to between 4% and 4.25% for this year.  In fiscal terms, budget 2017 forecast an outturn general Government deficit of 0.9% of GDP for 2016.  The forecast for 2017 was for a general Government deficit of 0.4% of GDP.  With regard to these deficit forecasts, the excessive deficit procedure, or Maastricht, returns were submitted to EUROSTAT by the CSO on 31 March and are now subject to the standard clarification process.  These figures are confidential but some matters already in the public domain give an indication of the likely direction for the outturn for 2016.  For example, the general Government balance is adjusted each year for VAT accruals.  VAT received in January and February as collected by businesses in November and December of the previous year is accrued back to the previous year, 2016.  As we know that VAT for January and February this year is about &euro;400 million more than for the same months in 2016, it is reasonable to expect that the general Government deficit for 2016 will be lower than the 0.9% forecast last October.</p> <p>  Looking at the first quarter of this year, taxes have come in at just under &euro;11.5 billion, which is some &euro;350 million, or nearly 3.5%, up on the first quarter of 2016.  However, this is below profile by &euro;280 million, or approximately 2.4%.  Based on these figures, it is unlikely that we will be adjusting our revenue forecast for 2017 in the draft SPU.  Indeed, we do not normally adjust forecasts on the basis of first quarter data.  Revised forecasts for 2018 out to 2021 will also be included in the draft SPU.  As I noted already, the Minister will be here to present these next week but it is anticipated that the macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the outer years will reflect increased levels of external uncertainty.</p> <p>  The Department has assisted the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny and this committee since it has been set up.  My officials have been available and responded to all requests for information or assistance received.  This will continue as anything that increases knowledge of and the level of informed debate about fiscal and budgetary policy is to be welcomed.  Obviously, engagement will be driven primarily by the annual budgetary calendar.  We have offered to brief the committee each quarter on Exchequer returns, to provide members with a presentation on the results and to answer questions members may have.  There will be other events involving the Minister and the Department such as the SPU, which the Minister will present to the committee next week, and the macroeconomic forecasts in advance of the budget which Mr. John McCarthy will present to the committee after the Irish fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has endorsed them.</p> <p>  I understand that there is progress with regard to the establishment of a parliamentary budget office.  While there have been suggestions over the years that an independent budgetary office should be established, the Minister said in response to a parliamentary question in February 2015 that he was coming to the view that the proposal should be considered in depth.  The focus at that time was on independent costings of alternative budgets from Opposition parties.  Since then, the OECD has published its review and, based on this, the Oireachtas has decided to widen the remit.  However, costings will remain a critical component.  Both Departments have provided a costings service for election manifestos for many years and, more recently, for the annual budget.</p> <p>  The Department produces a huge amount of budget relevant information each year.  Late last year, we circulated a list with links and also provided a copy of the publications to the committee secretariat.  We will continue to forward the links to each publication to the secretariat as soon as they are available.  Assimilating this information and having it to hand in a format that enables the Oireachtas to carry out its functions is a key challenge.  A parliamentary budget office will potentially have a critical role to play in answering this challenge.  We will continue to share all the information we can with the parliamentary budget office and the committee to facilitate this.  A memorandum of understanding between the parliamentary budget office and the Department on the sharing of information and operational modalities will be important as the office is developed.  I thank the committee for this invitation and my colleagues and I will do our best to address members' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#B00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee alongside my colleague from the Department of Finance, Mr. Derek Moran.  I am joined by Mr. John Kinnane and Mr. Robert Scott from my Department.  In particular, I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my Department can assist the work of the Committee on Budget Oversight in carrying out its duties.  I begin by emphasising my Department's role in the recent improvements that have been made on budget clarity, oversight and engagement.  The medium-term expenditure framework provides Departments with greater clarity regarding available resources and better planning in the provision of key public services.  Moreover, the whole-of-year approach to budgeting facilitates greater engagement with the Oireachtas and shifts the focus on budgeting away from one single event in October.</p> <p>  More information than ever before is now available relating to how public resources are allocated and utilised.  A number of key milestone events facilitate the publication of detailed information during the year.  The summer economic statement outlines the overall fiscal stance while the national economic dialogue facilitates a robust exchange of views from various stakeholders, including members of Oireachtas committees, on the competing economic and social priorities facing the Government.  The mid-year expenditure report publishes the pre-budget baseline for departmental expenditure, represents the starting point for examination of budgetary priorities by the Oireachtas and identifies areas where expenditure pressures may arise.  Allocations for the coming year are subsequently published in the expenditure report on budget day, with three-year multi-annual ceilings in addition to details of specific budgetary measures.  The Revised Estimates Volume, published in December, details the specifics of the coming year&rsquo;s allocations and also provides the public and Oireachtas committees with convenient at-a-glance information on what services are being provided.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced his intention to go further in this regard with a new performance report to provide more timely performance indicators to sectoral committees than is currently possible through the Revised Estimates Volume.  It is expected this new initiative will be published this month.</p> <p>  The prudent management of expenditure has played a significant role in the stabilisation of the public finances, with a reduction in the underlying deficit from 11.5% in 2009 to less than 1%, projected, in 2017.  Economic conditions have improved markedly in recent years, and increases in expenditure over the past three budgets have been prudent and sustainable, averaging just 3% per annum.  As the committee is aware, the management of the annual Exchequer funding provision allocated to Departments is governed by the rules detailed in public financial procedures.  On an ongoing basis, managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and his or her Department, and measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets are met.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular communication with all Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall expenditure parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles, and there is regular and timely reporting to Government on these matters.  This information is published monthly as part of the Exchequer statement published by the Department of Finance.  As the year progresses, year-end spend can finish ahead of profile.  Explanations for this include forecasting issues and higher than anticipated numbers in demand-led programmes.  In addition, policy decisions taken by Government can increase expenditure over and above that forecasted in the Revised Estimates Volume.</p> <p>  I turn now to the specific topics raised by the committee in its invitation letter.  To set out the expenditure performance for the first quarter of the year, gross voted expenditure to the end of March was &euro;13.599 billion, which is &euro;130 million below profile, with gross voted current expenditure &euro;155 million below profile and gross voted capital expenditure &euro;26 million above profile.</p><p>At this stage, there is no evidence of any significant emerging pressures which may have significant implications for the achievement of expenditure targets for 2017. </p><p> The finance function in each Department and corresponding Vote section in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform monitor emerging expenditure trends closely on an ongoing basis.  This is to help ensure that there is early identification of areas of expenditure pressures.  This means that early action can be taken to ensure that overall expenditure levels at Vote group level are fully consistent with Voted allocations and overall expenditure targets are achieved.</p><p> I would like to reiterate my Department&rsquo;s intention to be engaged with the committee to the fullest possible extent.  My officials have made themselves available to the committee on numerous occasions and I will ensure that this continues in order to assist with the work of the committee.</p><p> I am aware the Committee have been considering their information needs to discharge their mandate.  I would like to address these suggestions in turn.  As previously mentioned, the timely expenditure information already published as part of the Exchequer statement contains detailed information on current and capital expenditure by Vote group.  This is publicly available and my officials would be happy to engage on any issues related to expenditure performance on a monthly or quarterly basis.  The orders of reference for the committee refer to a situation where significant variations from the expenditure profile could impact on the overall fiscal position.  The Exchequer statement provides information to facilitate such an assessment and could be enhanced by advising the committee of the reasons for any substantial variances that could negatively impact the end-year position.</p><p> The committee has highlighted the issue of potential expenditure risks and I would like to address this in regard to Voted expenditure.  A fundamental principle of the medium-term expenditure framework, MTEF, is that responsibility for meeting expenditure needs within agreed envelopes is a matter in the first instance for the relevant Department via reprioritisation or procedures such as virement within Votes.  This is necessary to avoid an expectation that emerging issues need to be addressed through increases in expenditure allocations.  Another important consideration in reporting potential expenditure risks is the Government&rsquo;s prerogative in terms of decision-making.  This includes expenditure priorities and choices inherent in allocating increased funding resources to any spending programme.</p><p> In regard to the committee&rsquo;s query on the main drivers of expenditure, the most well known of these relate to demographic pressures such as the provision of additional teachers or a larger number of citizens qualifying for the State pension.  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, staff within my Department conduct regular analyses of such trends in order to inform the setting of ministerial expenditure ceilings published in the expenditure report.  The detailed analyses of demographic trends are available on our departmental website.  As a result of the ongoing work, an amount of &euro;45 million was provided for these issues in 2018.</p><p> Another key driver is staff numbers.  There has been significant recruitment in front-line areas in recent years with almost 18,000 or 6% additional staff recruited since 2013.  Public sector pay is another issue for which provision has to be made.  An allowance has already been factored into the budgetary arithmetic for 2017 and 2018 to take account of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, LRA.  Recommendations from the Public Service Pay Commission are expected in the second quarter of this year and following this the Government have committed to begin talks on a successor to the LRA which will obviously have implications for expenditure over the medium term.. </p><p> My Department has increased both the quantity and quality of its engagement with stakeholders on expenditure matters in recent years.  I am confident that the level of information currently available provides a very strong basis for an analysis of expenditure performance.</p><p> I would like to express my appreciation once more for the opportunity to speak to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#C00200"><p>Like many people, I was slightly surprised at the fall-back in income tax and related revenues in the quarterly returns.  While I appreciate that the first quarter is a little too soon to be able to make a reliable forecast for the rest of the year, there are specific questions I wish to ask about it.  There has been very welcome news about the continuing rise in the number of people employed and the continuing fall in the level of unemployment.  Is there a reconciliation between the numbers of people in employment and the income tax revenues under the principle headings of PAYE, income tax, USC, PRSI and so on?  Is that part of the work of either or both Departments?</p> <p>  There are a few issues which may partly explain the fall in the actual figures significantly behind profile at this early stage of the year.  Counties such as Donegal have reported a 5% or 6% fall in tourism.  The drop is generally agreed to be due to Brexit and the sterling exchange rate.  The fall in tourism is similarly evident in some other parts of the country.  There is much worry in the tourism sector that the trend could continue.  </p> <p>  Another potential reason is that there may have been a very large development of the shadow or grey economy so that while there are a lot of extra people at work, they are not fully accountable for PAYE or other labour tax purposes or contributions.  One guideline in that regard is the PRSI figures.  Are the figures in line with expectations or behind target?  </p> <p>  Third, it is possible that the phenomenon of bogus self-employment which has been a factor in the Irish economy is expanding.  This would mean many more people who would traditionally have been employees now being classed as contractors, assistants, operators or whatever.  They are deemed to be self-employed but they are not.  I would like to know what happened to the report into bogus self-employment which was being worked on by both Departments with the Department of Social Protection.  Why has it never been published?  I commissioned it when I was Minister for Social Protection.  I am sure it is long since finished but, notwithstanding the fact that I have asked many questions about it, it has yet to see the light of day.</p> <p>  Perhaps our statistics or tax and revenue systems are not capturing the contribution being made by people who have immigrated to Ireland, not necessarily returning Irish emigrants.  </p> <p>  It is quite worrying that this fall-back should happen.  One of these Departments is involved in sensitive wage negotiations.  What do the witnesses think may be contributing to this?  It is important in terms of forward financial planning and the remit of this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#C00300"><p>It is a long question.  I will try to answer as much of it as I can and perhaps my colleagues can assist with anything I have missed.  The Deputy is correct that the softer first-quarter performance of income tax in particular is something that we need to be alive to.  The first quarter tends to be unreliable because that is when P35s, refunds and end of year tax returns are completed.  It is a little more unstable than other quarters.   The figures are not worrying but they are puzzling.  We have looked at the performance.  It is interesting that over the first quarter, PRSI has performed about 7 % year on year.  PAYE has performed at about 6.5% which tallies with the growth in employment and earnings growth.  The shortfall results from non-PAYE sources, mainly the USC.  That raises a number of questions.</p><p>We have done some analytical work in partnership with the ESRI, which was published in the last fortnight.  It looks at how elastic these taxes are.  We do this on a regular basis for forecasting purposes.  Generally, we find that with income taxes for every 1% increase in earnings income tax grows by 2%.  That would be the elasticity; sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less.  We performed a detailed analysis, again jointly with the ESRI, showing that this holds for PAYE very strongly.  When taken with schedule D, the average elasticity is still around 2% but it is actually significantly lower for USC at about 1.2%.  For every 1% increase in income there is a 2% increase in income tax, but only a 1.2% increase in USC.  Some of this has to do with the structure; the rate progression is much slower and it makes it more stable.  As the economy slows down, while we do not get a big pick up when the economy grows then we would not get a big drop as it slows.  There are pluses and minuses.  This is one part of it.  We have done a back-forecast as distinct from a forward forecast and it reconciles some of the gap on USC that has emerged over the last 12 months.</p><p> We are also looking to see if there are other aspects of USC that make it different to income taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department are putting in efforts to try to explain it.  Some of the more obvious structural differences in USC is that on return to employment a person can retain their medical card for up to three years.  It means that they are capped in how much USC they will pay, which is at the middle rate I believe.   They still pay at that rate for a combination of three years no matter how their income increases.  Given the employment generation over each of the last three years, and if we accumulate that USC rate figure, it may be acting as drag on it.  We are at the early stage of looking at this, but together with the elasticity it may explain some of the performance issues around that.</p><p> Reference was made to people coming in and out of employment, especially from abroad.  Members will have seen in the report that the Revenue Commissioners are in the process of a consultation to modernise the PAYE system to give more real-time information.  This will be a huge help in making adjustments to tax in real terms and given data for that.</p><p> With regard to the self-employed I understand that the report initiated by the committee and the Minister is due for publication shortly.  I will come back to the committee with a timeline on that.</p></speech>

I am not sure about the impact of sterling on tourism.  On the reconciliation with VAT we see that VAT is still doing quite well but we do not get the level of disaggregation to give us a real-time insight into it.  It might, however, be worth looking at that aspect.  Is there any query I have missed?</p></speech>

There are data published by the CSO in the labour force survey.  The committee will be familiar with the quarterly labour force figures.  These figures break down the total employment into the number of employees and self-employed.  Up until the fourth quarter of last year there was absolutely no change in the share of self-employed as a percentage of the total.  I am familiar with the arguments made that this may be one of the explanatory factors.  Up until the fourth quarter of last year, however, it does not seem to be an issue but I guess we might find out more when this report is published.</p></speech>

T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam agus phl&eacute;igh an Teachta Burton c&uacute;pla ceann de na h&aacute;bhair.  I wish to dig a bit deeper on the taxes, in particular on PAYE and the USC.  Mr. Moran spoke of the elasticity and the different rates and I would like to go into that a bit deeper.  One of the clear ways that we may be underestimating the USC is around the return to work and the retention of the medical card in certain circumstances if a person was eligible for social welfare provisions in the preceding year.  Is the Department considering breaking the link and would those cases be based on income alone as opposed to a medical card for a person who returns to work? When the measure was introduced it was for a different reason.  Is any consideration given by the Department in that regard?</p></speech>

When one looks at this situation for analytic purposes, we look at how to explain the behaviour of the tax.  Policy is what policy is and we work within that framework.  The analysis tries to understand why one element of a charge on income behaves differently to another charge.  One of the things that must be done is to identify what characteristics are different between the taxes.  To some extent we will fix the issue of elasticity in the next forecasting round and we will be using a lower elasticity for USC projection, but we also look to see if there are other structural aspects and what modulation must be done within the forecast.  It is strictly a forecasting issue.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moran have any indication of the cost of the tax foregone as a result of that rule?</p></speech>

One must look at the differences between the structures in the tax system and ask if the effect is due to the cumulative effect of very strong employment growth where people may be returning from the live register and retaining benefits.  This would work its way out over time as the entitlement ends after three years in certain circumstances.  We are just trying to get an analytical handle on why certain elements of the tax base are behaving differently to other elements, even though they are charged broadly on the same income base.</p></speech>

Income tax is up by 1.4 % in its profile and USC is down 3.9%.  USC is not linked to income tax in all cases, but a large proportion is linked.  How could we be behind by nearly 4% in terms of profile?</p></speech>

All elements such as DIRT, professional services withholding tax and those smaller elements of income tax are behind profile.  It is not just USC.  USC is not the biggest part of it.</p></speech>

Some of the taxes such as life assurance exit tax, which is put into the income tax pot, is down for the first quarter by approximately &euro;25 million year-on-year according to Revenue.  Schedule D is a little behind.  DIRT - which we are expecting - is &euro;33 million behind.  It is a combination of some of these smaller taxes being behind and then USC coming in lower than anticipated.  Obviously, given the budgetary package, we were expecting to have reduced revenue in USC this year but the loss rate from the package is running higher than had been anticipated.  This is why we shall do this piece of work with Revenue to try define the characteristics of that and see if there are any reasons that can be clearly identified.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the first quarter figures, and we take those figures with all the caveats that have already been mentioned.  Mr. Moran has said that the Department is puzzling over that.  Are corporation tax receipts for the first quarter also puzzling the Department given that this figure is 25% behind profile?</p></speech>

The lumping nature of corporation tax means that the variation from one month to the next, especially in the lower target months, is not significant.  I would be far more concerned if we saw big shortfalls as we go through May and June, which are big payment months.  The capacity for that to be picked up as a change in the reporting of payment dates by a small group of companies is quite significant.  This is why I do not believe that it being behind profile would raise concerns.  If we saw a repeat in May and June then, needless to say, it would perhaps be a more serious concern.</p></speech>

This time last year income tax was also behind profile and it came in at the end of the year pretty much there or thereabouts.  As the Secretary General mentioned earlier, the first quarter is a little bit messy in terms of reconciling P30 and P35 and so forth.  We will monitor it but I would not read too much into it at this stage.</p></speech>

The lumpy nature of the corporation tax is probably best shown by the fact that ten companies paid 40% of the entire corporation tax.  I have been screaming about this for a long time.  Are the witnesses concerned about the volatility of corporation tax or the risks associated with such a large amount of tax in small firms?</p></speech>

The Department has published its concerns about it in the past two or three years.  The top ten companies paid approximately 41% two years ago.  It has come back a little bit to 37% last year.  That is a feature.  Big profitable companies tend to pay the most corporation tax.  In the UK the Sa&iuml;d Business School analysed UK corporation tax and found that 1% of companies paid 80% of corporation tax.  The Revenue Commissioners' analysis of what 1% of companies would pay would be very similar here.</p></speech>

We are talking about ten chief executive officers, CEOs, making a decision and there would be a huge hole in the bucket if they made that decision here and we would have serious austerity.</p></speech>

I know concern was expressed, particularly in 2015, about the sudden step change in the level of corporation tax.  When we have the data, the Revenue analysis always suggests that there was an aggregate improvement, an overall profitability reflected in it.  The national accounts measure of profitability showed that there was a big step change in that as well.  It has been maintained in the base.  The growth rate in 2016 was approximately 7.5% and we are projecting more normalised levels.  I always keep an eye on is the fact that corporation taxes generally contribute within a range to the overall Exchequer take.  It is between 10% and 16%.  Certainly we are at 15.5% but we are within the normal range.</p></speech>

The net fiscal space that was available for the coming budget was approximately &euro;0.5 billion.  Has the Department altered the projections on that?  Will we see something significantly different?  The Department surprises us quite often.  It came before the committee last year and told us it was &euro;1 billion and a week later it was &euro;1.2 billion.  Will we get another pleasant surprise next week where the fiscal space has increased again?</p></speech>

We will do that as part of the summer economic statement, SES.  Part of the reason for that is to have the maximum amount of information so that we can get a number that is less volatile and less subject to those external data inputs that we need to actually make it work.  We do take inputs in making those calculations from the European Commission.  People like me and Mr. Watt who have to draw the strands of this together are never happy where there is uncertainty.  Two years ago, and there was some confusion about this, when the Commission was setting the structural objective it was moving around all the time.  We needed it to fix in the spring on a number that we could prepare a budget towards.  For example, the deflator is the average of the spring and winter forecasts, so we interact with the Commission in the autumn trying to figure out its deflator so that we can apply it to the fiscal space measure.  It will fix that in May which takes that uncertainty out of it.  In many respects we produce a figure based on the data that we have at a point in time.  To make that figure less volatile we will produce it in June as a part of the SES, when we have some of that additional external input.</p> <p>  Some of the changes float from the national accounts, which are only ever published in July and are agreed with EUROSTAT in terms of what the expenditure base was.  That is not done until the end of September.  There is a volatility built within it.  We do our best to get it as stable as possible.  Some of the changes will help with that.  </p></speech>

There was also an issue with the full year cost of some of the budgetary measures, the Revenue Commissioners had made revised Estimates as to what the full year costs would be.  Our intentions are to provide as much information as possible.  We can never rule out, unfortunately, that there may be changes.  There might be other issues on the investment side this year.  There could be something that we just do not anticipate.  We do in good faith put the information out and stand over it as best we can but there is always the potential at the last minute.</p></speech>

While we look at the increment from budget to budget it is a not insignificant sum but in the overall size of the budget it is not as significant.  The estimation of it, and the team has gone through it, the number of variables and the uncertainty is significant in respect of what is potential growth in real and nominal terms and the CSO is revising real gross domestic product, GDP, and deflators in calculating the nominal GDP every quarter and every year so it is very difficult.</p> <p>  The Department also has to calculate the gap between where we are now and the structural balance in order to calculate the convergence margin to adjust then the potential growth.  The medium-term objective is structural term so it is unreservable so there are calculation issues which adjust.  There is enormous complexity.  While everything is done to reduce the possibility of surprises it cannot be ruled in the future that changes will be made from mid-year to budget day to take account of things that may change.  That could go in the other direction.  It could be downward rather than upward adjustment. </p></speech>

The exception taken by this committee, which monitors these issues, is to the fact that it was revised within a week and jumped 20%.  That was not the first time it happened.  It happened in the same way the previous year.  We will tease that out.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Watt tell the committee where we found the &euro;120 million for the pay deal, the &euro;50 million for the garda&iacute; and the &euro;59 million that will be required for the continued suspension of water charges to the end of the year, that is almost &euro;230 million?  Will that money be found within the allocated resources because the Estimates are out, it is additional money that was not there at the time or additional commitments that were not factored into the budget. </p> <p>  We were told not to worry about it at the time, which is a complete and utter insult.  I thought the Minister's performance before this committee really devalued this committee.  I have lost a lot of faith in the committee if the Minister is going to treat it like that when a deal is struck, and I have no problem with the deal, by telling the budget scrutiny committee not to worry, we will find that.  That is ridiculous and it would not be tolerated in any other jurisdiction and should not be tolerated here.  There are commitments which have to be found from current resources.  Can Mr. Watt enlighten the committee about where that money is coming from out of this year's allocated resources? </p></speech>

The &euro;50 million for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was addressed in the Revised Estimates.  There was an increased allocation to the Department of Justice and Equality to reflect that.

The different components of the Department of Justice and Equality have to stay within the allocation that is set out for them.  They are running &euro;8 million below the profile.  They spent &euro;578 million for the first three months and that is marginally below so, in effect, they are on profile.  The variance is marginal.  Their job is to stay within their allocation for this year and we will see how the year pans out in terms of how they do that.</p> <p>  On the &euro;120 million, which was the Government's response to the implications of the Garda deal under the Lansdowne Road agreement and to provide space to discuss the future of pay determination, the Government decided to bring forward the payment from September 2017 to April 2017.  That will increase the budget requirement and the Minister before this committee and previously said that is a matter that will be looked at during the course of the year, as the budget evolves.  A figure of &euro;120 million is an important number but, in the overall scheme of things, we will see how we can accommodate that, given the differences between the budget allocations and the actual emerging positions for Departments as the year progresses.</p></speech>

Will the number of home help hours be cut or perhaps we will not renew some Garda cars?  Will we cut social supports or community schemes?  Savings have to be identified somewhere, savings which the Departments were not able to identify last year.

Previously we had issues around flooding, where the country was subjected to a very significant storm and there was a lot of damage.  The Government responded to the calls from every single Deputy in the House and lots of people outside the House to allocate more money.  The Government decided to commit to allocate additional money to local authorities.  At the time the Government stated it would consider how to fund the allocation during the year, as the budget evolved.  A Government needs the flexibility to be able to make decisions during the year and find the money over time and to adjust its budget accordingly.  It is an enormous budget.  The budget is set in October but the world moves on, and now six months after the budget was set, issues have changed and we are addressing them and trying to find solutions that arise.  As the Minister said on the previous day, the Government decided for policy reasons to bring forward the welcome pay increases for public servants and we will see during the year how we will fund that additional commitment.</p></speech>

I agree with everything Mr. Watt has said.  There needs to be flexibility and one needs to respond to things, but I am sure our role - Mr. Watt can correct me if he has a different opinion - is that when Government needs to respond fiscally to an issue or a demand, we should scrutinise it.  As I have said, for every euro one spends in one area, one must take it from another area.  We may support that idea or we may not.  I have no idea and this committee has no idea of where the &euro;120 million will come from at this point in time.  We hope it will come from efficiencies or something similar, which will not impact on people or front-line services.  However, we have no clue.  We have not been given an indication of where it is coming from.  Does Mr. Watt have an idea of where this money will come from at this point in time?</p></speech>

As the months proceed, we will be able to discuss in more detail how the position is emerging.</p> <p>  The options for the Government are clear.  The Government can make a policy decision to save money elsewhere.  A demand-led scheme might deliver savings, a capital project might slow down or might not be delivered on time, or there could be other efficiencies.  There could be a variety of changes.  The Government might decide to have a Supplementary Estimate if the House supports it in the autumn and then the allocation will be increased.  There are a variety of different options available to the Government.  We shall see as the year progresses how we deal with it.  </p> <p>  I do not think this is a new or startling development.  This happens every year.  It is unusual in as much as it is a high profile policy decision that the Government took in respect of public sector pay, so in that sense it is different.  Every year things emerge between budget day, Revised Estimates and then as the year progresses, and the Government is flexible and adaptable in terms of policy choices and options in order to deal with the consequences of that.</p></speech>

Does Deputy Doherty think the Government faces a changed budget position in respect of a budget line before it knows all the other things that will happen during the year and announces that it will fund that change from money in one place, when there are hundreds and thousands of moving parts in the budget?  No government or company operates on that basis.  If there is such a significant material change to the budget that requires corrective action in order to keep the budget on track, that is obviously an issue that the two Ministers and the Government would have to decide, because that is different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#F01500"><p>I mentioned three areas, Garda pay, the pay deal for public servants and water charges.  I raised this with the Minister on budget day because I expected this would be the outcome.  These issues amount to close to a quarter of billion euro.  In the next budget the net fiscal space will be half a billion euro.  This is not an insignificant sum.  I have no doubt that this will be accommodated within the budget because it is quite large.  That is neither here nor there, but the point is that I am on this committee to do a job.  My job is to scrutinise the expenditure and where tax revenue is being raised.  It is not a case of making a decision the following week.  It is three months since this decision was made.  It was done in January.  I would expect that officials and the Department would have an indication that they will have to delay a capital project, withdraw a scheme or delay the starting of a scheme to try to trim the costs.</p> <p>  In terms of the Garda pay deal, it was very clear that &euro;25 million extra had been allocated and &euro;25 million had to be found from the Department.  We have no indication where the &euro;120 million from the pay deal or the &euro;59 million forgone in water charges will be found.  Will it be found from one or two or every single Department?  Will it come from capital or current expenditure?  We have no idea.  It is really difficult, and I am speaking personally, to come to a budget scrutiny committee meeting when one does not have the information to scrutinise or when one puts questions on the position from January to date, and we do not have the information.  That is not a reflection on the officials.  I have listed to Mr. Watt and Mr. McCarthy provide information.  I have put genuine questions on the things that I believe we have to do.  God forbid, we might find out.</p><p>The history in this State is that we scrutinised it afterwards.  We dealt with the expenditure of the State after it was spent.  We find out six months later that the Department took so much from the mental health budget or the hospital services budget to pay for that.  That would not be acceptable, and we would be asked by the public what this committee was doing when our job was to scrutinise these issues.  That is the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#G00200"><p>I want to follow up on that.  We had the notion that the Department was just asking questions.  We want answers.  This is an independent budget scrutiny committee.  Its establishment was part of the reforms that came about to try to stop the last financial crash and we are not getting answers.  Mr. Moran's Department representatives came in here a week before the budget and said that the fiscal space was &euro;1 billion but on the day of the budget it became &euro;1.2 billion.  An additional &euro;200 million was magicked up out of nowhere on the morning of the budget.  What is our role in terms of asking interest groups to come before this committee to present their case and for us to make an assessment of that case when in terms of an additional &euro;200 million, it is as if the Taoiseach went out and bought a lottery ticket?</p> <p>  Public service pay was done on the hoof.  We had a Garda deal bringing forward aspects of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  As I look at the various Department figures, all of them are more or less on profile, which is a tribute to everybody, but in terms of the room to find that kind of expenditure, it will come from making choices within Departments.  That means cutting other programmes.  This is a budget scrutiny committee and if we are to work to the role of this committee, we have to make an assessment on that in terms of choices that will be made within Departments so that when the witnesses' colleagues in line Departments come before us, we can put that to them.  That is the frustration felt by the members of this committee.  We are either an ornament or part of the budgetary process and until we start getting answers, and using the answers to the questions we are asking to make our contributions to this debate, I will continue to be frustrated.</p> <p>  I want to raise a couple of other issues.  Regarding yesterday's figures, we focus on income tax in terms of corporation tax, excise tax and across all the headings they are behind profile.  For instance, excise tax is down &euro;244 million on 2016; it is &euro;91 million behind profile.  Corporation tax is down &euro;134 million on 2016; it is &euro;180 million before profile, and we have gone through the income tax.  Mr. Moran explained that by describing corporation tax as being lumpy etc. but is it not time to change the profile modelling system?  Ten years ago, the Department of Finance was getting its forecasts completely wrong and that was an element that should have been addressed in terms of the position post-crisis.  Are we moving back into the space where the Department's forecasting models are not reflecting what is happening in the economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#G00300"><p>On forecasting, the overall tax takes came in on or just ahead of the forecast.  In terms of the numbers, if they fall within an estimated forecasting margin of 1% or 2%, the numbers either side of that are quite big.  Can we be happy with the figures, and particularly the March performance?  No, we cannot.  It is a cautionary note.  This is not a good performance and we have to scrutinise that as we go forward.  We have spoken about income tax and corporation tax.  The Deputy may recall that last year we had a very big surge in excise because the tobacco industry was taking stuff out of bonds in advance of the introduction of plain packaging, which ultimately did not happen, and we got a very big uplift in receipts in that year.  There is a distortionary effect in that which makes both the year on year forecasting and the profiling quite difficult.</p></speech>

Pursuant to the line Deputy Burton was following, are we noticing a trend in specific areas in the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#G00500"><p>It is product by product rather than county by county.  The brunt of it is taken out of bond.  It gives us that level of insight.</p> <p>  VAT over the quarter is strong.  Profiling is imperfect.  We had the example of the pre-purchase of tobacco last year in advance of the introduction of plain packaging and we get a distortion and try to work our way around it.  There is always the risk of profiling being wrong.  Generally speaking, tax forecasting falls within a reasonable bound of statistical error.  It is very easy to talk about the abstract.  If it is on the negative, there are fiscal implications but it is a forecasting exercise.  We are taking information now and predicting the future compared to the trends in the past.  As Mr. Watt mentioned earlier, even GDP data is revised for five, six and seven years after the initial Estimates.  We have to continually adjust for that.  The point is to keep it continually under scrutiny and to review it in a root and branch way every few years.  In terms of the elasticities, so to speak, of the ESRI, part of the joint research programme is to examine those very issues, give time to the analytical piece and look at the reason the income tax base is behaving slightly different across its components.  Does Mr. McCarthy want to say anything on the forecasting side?</p></speech>

We took a huge international hit about our own growth figures last year.  The term "leprechaun economics" was branded, which did not do our profile any good and caused difficulties in terms of our relationship with the EU.  What has the Department done to manage those lumpy bits, to use Mr. Moran's own phrase, out of our growth figures to ensure we can have some sort of a credible presentation on the current state of our economy?</p></speech>

It is particularly important in terms of other countries looking in and trying to get a handle on the Irish economy, which structurally may be different from other economies with which they are familiar.  Does Mr. McCarthy want to add anything to that?</p></speech>

It is highly distorted by the multinational companies, the globalisation process and issues that are evolving over time such as so-called contract manufacturing and so forth, which is production that takes place elsewhere but from a statistical perspective is included in the Irish accounts.</p> <p>  The figures are compiled to the highest European and worldwide standards.  However, they must be treated with a certain health warning in an Irish context because of the multinationals.  To give the Deputy an example, approximately five or six firms account for approximately one third of exports.  If something happens in one quarter and it happens on the first day of the next quarter it can raise huge issues.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that we took a bit of a reputational hit on foot of the 26% growth figure.  The 26% figure was compiled to the highest standard but it was due to the operations of a very small number of firms.  The so-called expert group, which was chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank, has come up with a new indicator which will take out some of these multinational practices.  The retained earnings of redomiciled firms and the depreciation of the capital stock owned by foreign firms will be excluded.  </p> <p>  This measure will give a better indicator as to the level of living standards in Ireland and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has also committed to publishing indicators that exclude some of the more volatile components of investment, exports and so forth in order that we and others who look at these issues can get a better handle on where the economy is in the cycle.</p></speech>

The average payment to date is approximately &euro;15,000.  I should say refund rather than payment because it is a refund of tax paid.</p><p>People have been taking the 4,700, multiplying it by 15 and getting a larger number.  At the end of the day, we do not know how many of the applicants will proceed and get a mortgage or buy a second-house instead.  The cost to date is approximately &euro;8 million.

It will not be constant.  The number of applications has slowed down significantly.  We are picking up many people who would have been eligible from the second half of last year as well.</p> <p>  Like some other expenditure, this is a demand-led scheme.  Our best estimate at the time was a cost of &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million.  We are running at a spend of &euro;8 million after the first quarter.  The average or the quarter's number could be multiplied by the 4,000.  It will fall within a range.  There may be pressures over the 15, but it is too early to say.

Is there a concern that much of the job creation that has been trumpeted is low wage and part-time?  This relates to Deputy Doherty's point.  If people are still entitled to benefits, are we driving a low-wage model of job creation?</p></speech>

That in itself is not driving wages down.  One of the positives from the employment data over recent quarters is the extent to which jobs are now full-time ones rather than part-time ones.  Some job creation early on might have been part-time, but there has been a great deal of migration from part-time into full-time.  Mr. McCarthy is closer to the data than I am.</p></speech>

We have received several depressing presentations on the state of capital infrastructure, be it roads or public transport.  The Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, presentation some weeks ago was particularly depressing.  We will be spending less on our road network in 2025 than we were in 2008.  Spending on road maintenance, never mind new road projects, will be &euro;400 million behind where it should be by 2020.  Deputy Ryan will probably discuss public transport, but we are ignoring the potential value of public private partnerships, PPPs, as regards roads.  The TII has been told that it cannot use the PPP model for road projects.  We have not engaged with the Juncker capital plan in terms of the money that it makes available.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Watt or Mr. Moran engaging with the EU on relaxing its fiscal rules for capital projects?  Such projects seem to be coming to a standstill.  TII's pipeline will dry up by 2018.  That means that, even if extra funding were to become available, the pipeline will not exist.  It takes seven years to get a road project from commencement to being on site.  Many factors are conspiring against our capital infrastructure at a time when it is creaking.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that and the rules and how are their Departments engaging with the EU on relaxing fiscal rules in terms of capital expenditure?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#H01700"><p>The Government has set out its capital spending plans.  This year, there has been a 10% increase on the 2016 allocation.  Last year, the Government announced an additional &euro;5.2 billion of spending over and above the previous plan.  It has allocated half of that spending to housing and we are engaging in a consultation process with Departments to discuss where the remainder of that money will be allocated.</p> <p>  When considering infrastructure, it is useful to start with an assessment of the quality of our infrastructure.  The Deputy used various terms like "dire", "chronic" and so on, but what is the assessment of our airports, sea ports, motorway network, gas and electricity?  No one would deny that there are issues with housing and public transport in Dublin and the issues with health infrastructure, schools and so on are known.  When demanding infrastructure, one needs a realistic and fair assessment of the quality of current infrastructure that is based on supply and availability relative to demand now and into the future.</p> <p>  The Government is in a process of consulting on how the additional funds will be allocated.  That will lead to an increase in spending across various areas that will be decided upon over the next six months.  The Minister's intention is to make announcements on budget day.</p> <p>  Regardless of what rules or fiscal framework we have, there is a limit on how much we can spend.  We should not just focus on the quantum of capital, but also on the need in question, how we are addressing it and the nature of projects.  Previously, we built infrastructure that was not required.  Whatever we do in future will need to address a clear need and the infrastructure must generate a benefit.</p> <p>  I do not know about TII saying that it cannot undertake PPPs or that PPPs are off the table.  Most of the motorway network has been built in partnership with the private sector.  There are various tolling schemes and schemes that do not involve tolling but are funded by unitary payments, which are fully funded by the taxpayer.  Hybrid models have been used.  PPPs remain a liability to the State and are not necessarily off-balance sheet.  The unitary payment is paid every year.  Based on the projects that we have supported, the liability to the State is between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion.  PPPs spread the cost of funding over a period but do not eliminate the cost to the Exchequer.  A liability remains.</p> <p>  We have a programme of PPP works in place in primary health care, schools and social housing.  The Minister would be open to discussing whether any of the potential road projects could be funded through PPP or a mix of PPP and tolling.  All funding opportunities are being explored.  When deciding on whether to fund something from the Exchequer directly in the traditional way or via PPP, we need to determine the best value for money for the Exchequer.  It is debt on the State's balance sheet, so we need to determine the best financing and cost approach to funding our capital needs.</p></speech>

I am making the general point that, if one considers infrastructure in its totality, it should be acknowledged that there are positive aspects.</p><p>We should recognise the fact there has been significant investment in parts of our infrastructure which are now yielding significant benefits and providing fantastic services to people.  That is the point I was making.  I am not suggesting for one minute there is not a need to increase investment in the road network.  Of course, we are familiar with the numbers.  We know the debate.  Those debates are ongoing and they reflect the fact we have a fairly dispersed population and an enormous road network, which is expensive to maintain and to improve.  The debate is taking place on where the funding goes over the next while.  There is a consultation process and we are engaging in how the funding should be allocated.</p></speech>

It is bang on profile at present.  Mr. Watt mentioned, in his interactions with Deputy Pearse Doherty, that we can come back and look at the revised figures but, actually, we cannot.  The Department of Health must act within its own resources if it goes over the expenditure allocated this year.  The Department of Health is on target.  Does Mr. Watt anticipate any difficulties in that Department in terms of expenditure for the remainder of the year?</p></speech>

Within the Department of Health, as the Deputy will be aware, there is a large number of demand-led schemes.  It is difficult to forecast the demand activity in the hospitals or the demand for medical cards, but the expectation is that we will remain close to or within budget this year.</p></speech>

At the last meeting of the Policing Authority the deputy commissioner was asked why he had not appointed the staffing needed in the communications unit in Castlebar and he answered that they had only just got the authorisation and were to advertise.  That had been recommended by the Olson report on changing Irish policing.  Similarly, the Garda Commissioner, during questioning on the breath test issue, stated that she had only just received authorisation to get her executive team in place and that was part of the reason the Garda it effectively took three years to address some of the figures.  Will Mr. Watt briefly summarise for me, because I am not up to speed on it, the authorisation process?  I am aware we got rid of the employment control framework.  Is there a role for Mr. Watt's Department?  I recall him stating previously that we have to start thinking in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight about where we would save, not only about what we would spend?  Is there a mechanism in the Garda, where several hundred staff retire every year, for it to decide that instead of replacing them, it would prioritise putting in place the communications team in Castlebar?  Why did it take it a year and a half or two years to get authorisation to advertise for a job?</p> <p>  My second question relates somewhat to the Garda in that it seems one of the big problems there is around digital management and digital systems.  The PULSE system clearly is not fit for purpose.  Has the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looked at states such as Estonia or Finland which have introduced a digital identifier system which could be used in the health, justice and education systems and which would bring significant efficiencies and savings?  If we are looking for savings as well as expenditure options, that seems to be one mechanism which would achieve significant efficiencies and perhaps benefits in terms of our overall expenditure system.  We would have a much easier job in the drawing up of budgets and the assessment of what is happening.  Has Mr. Watt considered the introduction of such a system or where are we in terms of an overall State management of digital information which would be audited and traceable so that, for example, Garda could take a photograph of a scene which would go immediately into a system which is auditable, traceable and avoids all this incredible paperwork?  I believe Department is still responsible for the digitalisation of the public service.  Has Mr. Watt looked at what Estonia or Finland has done in that regard?  I will put those questions first and then come to Mr. Moran on the tax side.</p></speech>

There is a significant increase in the resources now available to provide additional services within the justice family of Votes, in particular the Garda Vote.</p> <p>  Within the employment control framework under the delegated arrangements that have been in place for a number of years, the Garda itself can decide the allocation of resources.  If the budget is there, it can recruit.  For very senior positions, there is a restriction that they have to undergo an approval process with the Department of Justice and Equality and, ultimately, ourselves.  I will come back to the Deputy in respect of the communications unit in Castlebar because I am not exactly sure of the details of that and what has been the delay.  There has been ongoing discussion between the Department of Justice and Equality, ourselves and the Garda about the nature of recruitment, open recruitment and the types of skills mix that are required within the Garda, but I will come back to the Deputy specifically in regard to the Castlebar matter.  Overall the Garda has delegated authority and sanction to recruit up to a certain level.  With the senior levels, there is a different process in place.</p> <p>  In regard to ICT, we have in place the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  We now have an office within the Department and it is involved in a number of issues.</p> <p>  Perhaps we could provide a separate briefing on such issues as digital identifier and verification to Deputy Ryan.  There are a number of provisions in place which we have been building on.  There is the public service card and the data behind the public service card.  There are now 2.5 million people who have a public service card.  Two weeks ago, we launched myGovID, which, in effect, is the online version of that.  If somebody has gone through public service card verification, in other words, the SAFE 2 process, he or she can now apply for a variety of different schemes online through myGovID on the basis that he or she will have a digital password.  In effect, his or her PPSN number and a digital password will be the way in which they will access public services in the future.  The plan is to increase the number of people with the public service card who have gone through SAFE 2 and then, over time, increase the digital offering through myGovID so that more services are available so that people can renew their driving licence, passport, access various social welfare services, etc.  That is on the basis of, in effect, the digital verifier the Deputy is talking about.  It is the public service card, the SAFE 2 process and the verification process that people have to go through in order to access things.  That programme of reform in regard to data sharing, safety of verification, etc., is ongoing.  We would be happy to provide the Deputy with more detail on where we are now with our plans for the future in regard to that.</p></speech>

The statistics on what they were doing showed twice the amount of activity in one not insignificant area.  It is a slight concern in terms of assessing that we need 800 garda&iacute; when we do not know what the garda&iacute; are doing.</p> <p>  In terms of the digital identifier, myGovID, we are good at such matters as driving licences and the Revenue Commissioners, but when it comes to the likes of the PULSE system we are clearly inadequate.  For example, they are opening ledgers in Garda stations.  I would make the point that such lack of digital information is influencing all our decision making.</p></speech>

We established this office a number of years ago.  We are now investing and implementing the various reforms.  I cannot speak about the ins and outs of the Garda and the extent to which its processes are modernised and renewed and the extent to which it has embraced ICT.  Within the Civil Service of 37,000 staff, we have spent the past number of years implementing a suite of applications based on SharePoint, ePQs, eFOI, eSubmissions and eRecords, and by the end of next year we will have all Departments and 37,000 staff using these processes.  It depends of the part of the public service.  I cannot speak for the Garda.  The Garda Commissioner is obviously talking about further initiatives in ICT and the digital transformation.</p> <p>  If the Deputy wants to have a detailed discussion about the progress that has been made, I am happy to have that discussion but it is not fair to make these general statements that we are not embracing this or that.  Of course, the system can always improve.</p><p>That is what we are about but I will be very happy to set out for the Deputy in detail the progress we have made in the Civil Service and in respect of the digital offering we are providing citizens in terms of the external stuff.</p></speech>

I will come back to it.  It is a separate issue but it is relevant, as I said, because what has been exposed in the breath testing story is that it took three years to collect information.  When we did, we found the level of activity was half what it really was.  That has exposed a real problem within the Garda.</p> <p>  With regard to the senior positions, the Commissioner said it took her a long time to set up her executive team.  In a critical reform area, where we are spending an additional 5% in pay, or whatever was in the pay agreement, and putting in 800 garda&iacute;, we do not even have the executive team in place, according to the Commissioner, to work out what is happening within the force.  We had such an experience here.  Going through the same process, it took us six months to get a senior adviser for our budgetary advisory office.  To my mind, that was unnecessarily long.  We agreed the process a year ago on the back of an OECD recommendation.  It took four or five months to proceed to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in November.  There was then a four- or five-month row over whether the officer would be an assistant secretary or principal officer.  Therefore, we find ourselves putting in the advertisement a year after discussing the matter at the D&aacute;il reform committee.  It will be a year and a half by the time the person is appointed.  This committee will not be able to do its work as effectively because of the nature of our budgetary process, which starts now and runs to October.  We will start kicking only in October.  The Garda would seem to have had the same experience, according to Deputy Commissioner Twomey and Commissioner O'Sullivan.  Are we happy that the process of senior-level appointments is taking a year and a half?</p></speech>

I will be very happy to provide the Deputy with the information on how long it takes us to issue an approval to fill a vacancy when the letter is sent to us, and how long it takes for the advertisement to be placed in the paper and for the person to be appointed.  That issue has been addressed so there is an opportunity to recruit somebody.  The issue was tied up with a variety of other issues and discussions that were taking place between the Oireachtas Commission and our Department.  There was not a specific relationship and there were other issues that complicated the matter.  It normally does not take that long.  Obviously, in the case in question there was a new office.  An issue arose over the drafting of the terms of reference, the scope of the job, the grade and so on.</p></speech>

I could not disagree more with Deputy Calleary on what our investment priorities might be.  It would take too long to address it now.</p> <p>  I have two questions for the Department of Finance.  The information I seek may be publicly available but I would just like to be given a sense of it.  I found the information we got last year from the Tax Strategy Group very useful.  It was based on very good, detailed analysis.  We did not follow through on the diesel issue and dropped it like a political hot potato but there was still a useful outlining of the issue.  Do we know at this stage what issues the Tax Strategy Group will be considering?  Are we expecting a similar type of report in June or July?  Are there issues that are due to be considered?  What is the broader context within which tax strategy is decided?  I recall from my time, in 2008 and 2009, the tax commission setting the wider perspective on our wanting to widen our tax base and generate tax efficiencies.  The Tax Strategy Group seems to be doing useful work but is there a broader context within which the strategy is set?</p> <p>  The second question I have is on the latest tax figures.  Is there any assessment from the Department of the ongoing exchanges on EU taxation rules on corporation tax, the common consolidated tax base, reporting and transparency in corporate tax auditing?  Lord only knows what US President Mr. Donald Trump will do on the tax side.  In its modelling of where we are going in regard to corporation tax, has the Department assessed whether the European changes will increase our corporation tax revenue, or are there risks on the other side given the American position?  What is the modelling?  How does the Department make its forecast, particularly on the European developments, which we know are happening and are real or in train?</p></speech>

I will come to that in due course.  It is great to hear that the output of the Tax Strategy Group is still of value.  It has been doing its work fairly unanimously for a very long time.  I spent nearly a decade as head of tax.  The group goes back to the fundamentals and looks at each tax head annually and sometimes poses fairly fundamental questions for the purpose of discussion and framing debate.  I do not believe one could say anything in the analyses is a specific policy proposal but it poses the questions as to what happens if one equalises diesel and petrol, what it looks like and what it means?  The group surfaces those issues and will continue to do that.  Since it has a more strategic focus, it allows one to bring forward issues that may not be topical in the public policy debate.  It allows them to be tabled in a manner such that people can develop their thoughts on them over a period of time.  It serves a very good purpose.</p> <p>  I anticipate the papers will be of an equal standard.  We have been publishing these since the late 1990s but they have got very little attention-----</p></speech>

The Department is very happy with that.  It adds value.  As one examines the papers over the coming years, one will see the issues evolve in them rather than representing big changes.

I am being honest.  At this stage, the guys are sitting down to start to develop the framework of what might be in the questions.  We deliver the information in July.  The issue of equalisation and its implications will be there or thereabouts.</p> <p>  In terms of corporation tax, the group will examine how the world has changed since last year in policy terms and what that might mean.  At European level, the CCCTB proposal is one of those proposals that has been around in various iterative forms for a very long time.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas took a view that it stood outside subsidiarty and sent a view back to the Commission in that regard.  The Oireachtas was not alone because seven or eight other Parliaments did the same.</p> <p>  With regard to vulnerability &ndash; this will go through the normal process at a European level, which is, to say the least, slow - one of the concerns is the base, which is supposed to be easier of the two pieces.  The base, as published, would significantly reduce the Irish corporate tax base.  It would actually cost us money.  Therefore, it is not something one would welcome in and of itself.  I believe there will be a very long process of discussions.</p> <p>  With regard to US tax reform, we had not seen anything yet.  We do not have a true sense of what that might be.  If one were to have asked me six months ago, I would have said it would most likely look like a deemed repatriation of profits whereby the US would bring money back in from multinationals abroad on a one-off basis, involving a sort of amnesty bringing money in to help with the capital plans.  I believed we would see some sort of rate reduction in the headline rate.  To be honest, a number of months in, we do not have a clear picture of what it would be.</p> <p>  Major economies such as those of the United Kingdom and United States, both of which seem to be saying lower tax rates with broader bases are a good thing, seem to be pursuing a policy very much like the one we pursued for a very long time.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, in itself.  We will watch both very closely.  As of yet, it is unclear where that will land.</p></speech>

Our job is to scrutinise the work leading up to the budget and analyse the previous budget as we go on.  It is a new committee and we are still feeling our way through this.  There is a suggestion that simply asking a question amounts to scrutiny but we need to get answers as well.  I know the point was made that it is not a new thing and that something would happen during the year that would necessitate additional funds being allocated somewhere, but what is new is our committee and the work we are doing so it must fit in somewhere.  This means an adjustment on all sides.  I have a concern that we should all reflect on our roles in this and that the wrong attitude might be developing on all sides.  We are here to work together to achieve certain outcomes.  This involves a certain level of respect on all sides to members and witnesses who appear before the committee.</p> <p>  In respect of the issues raised by Deputies Calleary and Doherty regarding the &euro;200 million that appeared in a very short timeframe, speaking as an Opposition Deputy, it makes our task of putting together an alternative budget impossible.  We cannot do that if we are operating off a completely different amount of money.  While things can change at certain periods, it is the timeframe of change with which members have a difficulty.  We did flag that quite early on.  </p> <p>  The fiscal space has been touched upon and I do not want to revisit it.  In terms of capital investment, it appears that the UK takes a much longer-term approach, looks at a 30-year capital investment plan and reviews it every five years.  Have the witnesses considered the idea of a national infrastructure commission with a 30-year plan being examined that will transcend different D&aacute;la&iacute; and go beyond a five-year term?  Could Mr. Watt tell me whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has access to the necessary expertise to engage in this type of long-term planning?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#L00300"><p>I will answer the last question regarding the capital investment plan first.  The tradition has been to have five-year plans so a Government sets out an allocation for five years.  Beneath that, Departments, commercial semi-State bodies and agencies would have longer-term plans.  For example, ESB Networks will have a ten, 15 or 20-year plan for the development of the network and other sectors.  We have never published something that went beyond that.  What we are doing now in the two processes I discussed involves the Government deciding how to allocate this additional space available for the next term of years.  There is also a commitment to have a longer-term plan - I think it is ten years but it might be more appropriate to have a 15 or 20-year plan - where we would set out in more detail the plans across the different sectors indicative allocations envelopes, but also to look at a capital plan in a different way.  The concern in the past has been always been that the capital spending plans are divorced from spatial or land use plans.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is developing a national planning framework and we are now working on this longer term plan.  A really important issue that we will address over the next period is the extent to which those plans are actually linked and formalised and that spatial development drives the capital plan because in the past, we published them but they were not connected.  We are committed to planning infrastructure and spending over a longer period than was the case previously, which was more medium term.  We now have a much longer-term timeframe of between ten, 15 or 20 years.</p> <p>  We have no issue with the question of whether there is a role for an infrastructure commission but, ultimately, it is the Government that will decide the allocations.  The Government is not in the business of outsourcing policy responsibility to other bodies.  Ultimately, that body will be subject to enormous pressure from every vested interest in the country whose sole objective is to get more money for capital projects at the expense of the taxpayer so the extent to which that would be useful is something we are considering.  Within our Department and the system across all the different Departments and the different bodies and agencies that support those Departments, we are happy we have the capacity and expertise to be much better at longer-term planning for infrastructure provision.  As we develop the current plan, it is something we will come back to and are happy to do that.  </p> <p>  In respect of the Acting Chairman's comments about working together, we are here to help members and facilitate the committee in any way possible and we have said so.  We have engaged with the committee and provided vast amounts of information.  There is no comparison between the amount of information that is now available in terms of the budget process and what we had five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  It should be acknowledged that the way we budget is much more open, transparent and accountable than it ever was.  The engagement with Oireachtas committees is much more extensive, as is the amount of information provided.  This should be acknowledged by the committee.  On the basis of us working together, we are very happy to engage with the committee in terms of how it discharges its mandate.  Officials from my Department have provided an incredible amount of information and will make themselves available to deal with the team that is there in supporting the committee.  We are happy to continue that in any way the committee thinks appropriate.</p></speech>

We certainly acknowledge the vast amounts of information that have been provided.  Deputy Doherty's question concerned the fact we are still searching around for details as to how a decision taken in January was taken and where the money was found.  If there is extra expenditure in one area, it is fair for a budgetary scrutiny committee to ask where it is coming from.  These are the questions we must ask.  The point was made that when we do go back to the public, we will be asked why we did not question that and who we asked.  In his opening statement, Mr. Watt said that more information than ever before is now available.  I suppose this is why we are asking why &euro;200 million was found so close to budget day if all this information is there.  I am sure Mr. Watt will acknowledge that working to such a tight timeframe made our job quite difficult.  It meant our alternative budgets were not very useful at that point.</p></speech>

We fulfil this role in respect of parties and Deputies.  We cost proposals so that people understand that if people are making a comment in a debate or on Private Members' motion, there are cost implications.  We are very happy to ensure that we know exactly what the cost is and, ultimately, have a debate about where that could be funded into the future.  We support that role at present.</p></speech>

As Mr. Watt said, the budget-specific information that is available is vast compared to what it used to be.  I said in my opening statement that one of the issues for the committee relates to the capacity to digest that.  The parliamentary budget office will help that.  Having a memorandum of understanding between the Departments and the parliamentary budget office in terms of that interaction will help hugely.  I am very pleased with some of the interactions.  Things like the tax strategy group were a minority sport but having them discussed in this type of forum gives them a currency at a more fundamental level.  It is not about choosing individual policy items.  It is about looking at the core structure and this is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Tax expenditure is expenditure under any other name.  Voted expenditure gets scrutinised at a level which tax expenditure, traditionally, has not been subjected to.  The Department brings far greater attention to what the costs would be.  We set out our tax expenditure guidelines, start to produce a tax expenditure report setting the various costs of that and try to ensure that when a tax expenditure is introduced, there is a drop-dead date - there is an evaluation requirement.</p><p>When we hit the bad times we found that we had huge massive amounts of expenditures that we had to wheedle out of the way, I believe it was &euro;1.5 billion over a couple of years.  We should not allow that to develop because submissions must be rational and sensible.  People who present themselves here and who lobbying for change must be challenged around why the change is being done and what is the cost.  It is as much about cost as expenditure terms of voted expenditure with consideration being taken of revenue foregone, even if that aspect is a little less easy to see.  I welcome that level of engagement and it can only be positive with respect to the scrutiny of proposals.  We always have the risk of people coming in and telling us that tax expenditure can be self-financing or that it will effectively cost nothing.  That is nonsense.  Has Mr. Watt thought of it as being inappropriate?</p></speech>

Every week there are demands for new services, pay increases, capital projects and members have heard a flavour of this here today.  Every day in the Oireachtas there are demands for more and more of everything.  Every lobby group wants to spend more money on everything and reduce taxes.  It would seem that the demands are infinite and obviously resources are finite.  This is the reality of the budget spending challenge.  The tax challenge faced by Mr. Moran and the spending challenge faced by us and our respective Ministers are happening all the time.  There are never ending demands for expenditure on absolutely everything.  Within our managing board, from week to week we would-----</p></speech>

We have had issues about public sector pay, which Deputies have been discussing at the end of last year and early this year.   That is now in a process and is something we will return to when we get to May, June and July.  There are also issues around capital spending.  There are various legal cases the State is managing and we have provided some information on some of those.  These could lead to an increase in spending in the future.  There will be proposals in regard to policy changes, ideas, projects or other issues across the board, which could impact upon the allocation.</p> <p>  The main task of our job, within the year and certainly from budget to budget, is to ensure that those demands and suggestions for spending are met within the allocations set out.  New initiatives and proposals are considered in the context of the next spending round.  We are now in the process of preparing that.  To answer the question, in effect there are pressures and demands across all areas, all Votes and all aspects of public expenditure all of the time.  From week to week there are certain issues that will bubble up and will need to be addressed, but it is a never ending, constant part of the process of managing the implementation and execution of the budgets and preparing for the next budget round.</p></speech>

It is very important that there is consistency between the two Departments around the approach to it.  We set the limits and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister does the allocations within those limits, but we must have a unity.  We ensure we work very closely, especially the central expenditure evaluation unit and the central budget unit within the two Departments.  We have ensured this over the past number of years and it is a very strong relationship.</p></speech>

One of the events I was attending was with the Union of Students in Ireland who were putting forward their strong opposition to student loans as a way of funding third level education into the future.  Do either of the Departments have any ideas on a way forward in that regard? I was also questioning the Minister about it.  There may be an extra &euro;360 million spending from the employers and from the Department of Education and Skills but has there been any long-term planning around our grossly under-funded third level system - particularly since 2011 - and how it could be maintained to a high level into the future? The media gets very worried when our universities drop out of the top 100 lists.  The students have told us that in countries such as Germany where there is State funding the colleges seem to be very close to the top of the lists.</p></speech>

He is aware there is a consultation process about that, which I presume was the motivation for the Union of Students in Ireland talking about this issue.  We want world-class universities and we want the best education for students who go through the process.  Year on year we see an increase in the number of students going in to third level education.  I believe the last data shows that 70% of the leaving certificate cohort is going on to third level broadly defined across the institutes of technology and post-leaving certificate universities.  If this increase continues it presents an enormous challenge and the taxpayer pays for it, along with all the other competing demands.</p> <p>  If students are to make a greater contribution, now or in the future with some deferred loan system, there are many issues around the pros and cons of that system.  There is a debate to be had around the extent to which employers may contribute more and employers benefitting directly from the improvements in human capital.  A consultation paper has been set out and the two Ministers concerned are very interested in hearing the views of different sectors of society around how the system could be funded.  If the numbers of students keep on increasing and the costs to the system keep going up it creates an enormous challenge in how we fund it.  The average undergraduate course costs &euro;10,000 or &euro;11,000 and the student contribution fees are &euro;3,500.  Half of the students are on grants and as the Deputy is aware the fees are waived.  There is enormous support in that regard.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education and Skills are concerned about the sustainability of the system.  A debate needs to be had about how it can be funded in the future.</p></speech>

I know it only exists since the last Government, but has the Department of Public Expenditure and reform taken tax expenditure seriously enough?  Recent reports show that, for example, the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit which has operated over the period of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is costing up to &euro;1 billion in taxes foregone each year.

The difficulty in the past has been that expenditure was put on the books and then left there without evaluation.  As recently as last year - or the year before - we completed a review of the R&amp;D tax credit.  One of the objectives of policy is to get the R&amp;D tax credit spend for Ireland up to 3% of GDP and we are currently well short of that.  The R&amp;D tax credit contributes to this spend.  It is just one example.  The evaluation of the measure showed that the credit makes a positive contribution.  We will come back to it in a few years' time to look and it again.  It cannot just be there as a passive measure that rolls on, which was a feature of-----</p></speech>

Every time we introduce a new expenditure we try to include the provision that it will last for three years and before it is extended it must be reviewed.  We are trying to make sure that most of the major expenditures are reviewed every three years or so.  It depends on our capacity to get around to all of them.</p><p>It is treated much more as an expenditure line and it is about getting value out of that expenditure line.

Observers remain concerned about exactly what is its strategy at present and whether it should be moving faster to address this huge chunk of 34% or 40% of our national debt, which we will have to refinance at that particular time.  Does the Department share any of these concerns or is it happy enough to see the NTMA proceeding the way it is going?</p></speech>

They have been flagged well down the line.  Going back four or five years, when the economy was not performing as well as it is now, this could have been an event, but we have turned around and it is hoped we will balance the budget next year.  We are not adding to the stock of debt in the way we were.  There would be downsides if there was a change in ECB policy and policy rates start to drift up or if the economy softened and we started to borrow.  The NTMA's strategy is well hedged against this so I am confident in its plans.</p></speech>

We have been debating Brexit and the start of negotiations yesterday and today in the D&aacute;il .  Is it a natural result of our fears of what might happen?</p></speech>

There are things we better need to understand, for example, income tax.  PAYE grew by 6% in the first quarter and PRSI grew by approximately 7%, but USC and the rest of income tax was disappointing and we must better understand why this is.  On the excise side there are distortions because of the pre-funding of tobacco withdrawals last year.  Corporation tax is very lumpy.  Another point on first quarter data is we have the P35 season and tax refunds.  The first quarter is not the best judgment point.  If we see the same at the end of the next quarter it will be a cause for far deeper concern but at present I do not think we would change anything.</p></speech>

Retail sales figures increased by more than 6% in January and February.  Thankfully, unemployment has continued to decrease and was down to 6.4% in March.  All of the soft data from purchasing managers' indexes, PMIs, are very strong.  There can sometimes be a delinking of some of the macro data and fiscal data.  They are never one to one, particularly on a quarterly basis.  I do not think as yet we are seeing a Brexit impact with regard to the macro numbers or on the fiscal side.</p></speech>

The report stated that out of 160 foreign banks located in Ireland, which are generally in the remit of the IFSC, approximately 120 of them had a corporation tax rate at or below 6% and some of their tax rates fell as low as 2%.  Ireland is shipping quite a lot of reputational damage, notwithstanding the very detailed participation in the OECD BEPS process.  It is very difficult to understand, because service companies such as banks do not make anything and push money around.  They have a low tax rate, which is very competitive internationally at 12.5% and which is very defensible, but we have a report that fairly reliably indicates the vast majority of these companies pay between 2% and 6% corporation tax on their profits.</p> <p>  The tax strategy group was mentioned, and earlier in the meeting, before I had to leave for a while, it was stated the Department found the recent tax returns for the first quarter, whereby overall income tax came in below par, to be very puzzling.  The Department must surely be puzzled by this phenomenon with these companies.  They do not necessarily have a lot of capital investment.  I do not know whether they have a lot of intellectual property in Ireland or shipped here from abroad or whether they have other mechanisms but I am at a loss, particularly because of my accounting experience, to understand how a low 12.5% rate can be reduced to between 2% and 6%.</p><p>This could potentially cause serious damage to Ireland's reputation at a time when we need friends.  The Brexit negotiations are going to be incredibly difficult.  All sorts of people will be coming along with their requests in quite complicated negotiations.  How does one approach this kind of study?  Has the witness engaged with the authors of the study?  The Minister for Finance tells me that he has finally asked some officials to meet the authors of the study.  How does one address this?</p><p> In terms of the overall leadership roles of the two Departments in respect of the public sector, has each carried out a detailed Brexit impact assessment and, if so, can the findings be shared with us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017040500002#O00200"><p>In terms of the report, the Deputy is correct that Oxfam has been invited in to meet officials in order to go through the analysis to get a better handle on it.  On an initial look, it appears as if some of the estimations of profits are based on filings for items and subsequent calculations made which have nothing to do with tax.  A number of years ago we asked Seamus Coffey to look at the Revenue files on tax returns and to calculate what the effective corporate tax rate would be.  His analysis showed that it was somewhere in the range of 10.5% or 11%, which is much closer to the 12% that has been presented.  We are bringing Oxfam in and we do need to get behind it.  We also need to understand the analytical work behind it and how those rates are determined before anything else can be said.  I agree that these things are damaging to our reputation.  It is not just one thing, but a drip feed of many things.  That is why it is important to make sure that the factual position is established.</p> <p>  On the Brexit impact assessment, my colleagues on the economic side have been involved very heavily with the ESRI and, indeed, published a Brexit impact analysis some time ago.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy can say more about that.</p></speech>

The piece that was covered most was the impact on the economy more generally of different scenarios, for example, a soft exit or a WTO-type arrangement.  I can show the Deputy the simulations after the meeting.  We have put this in the public domain but for the information of the committee, if we were to have a WTO-type situation it would take about four percentage points off the level of GDP, so the economy will grow but not at the same pace.  This is relative to baseline.  It would reduce the level of employment by about two percentage points, with a mirror image increase in unemployment, and would add approximately one percentage point to the deficit every year so that over a ten-year framework the debt ratio would be up by about ten percentage points.  We carried out that analysis.  We do not know which scenario is most likely at the moment, but we have looked at the three different scenarios.</p></speech>

There are approximately 20 e-mails, which have not been released under FOI, concerning the preparations being put in place to prepare for customs posts on the Border because of the potential for customs between the North and the South.  The Department of Finance is not the only one; Revenue has also written to the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Is this something about which the committee should be concerned?  What type of resources is that drawing from the Department?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has stated that there will be no return to a hard Border and we operate within that framework.  At the same time, Revenue must look at all the contingencies.  Off the top of my head, of the value of trade coming in and out of Ireland, 98.5% goes out through channels other than back and forth across the Border.  I do not want to minimise this, but it is a very small part of that framework.  There will have to be adjustments in terms of the UK as a third party, but most of the activity is based around Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and the airports.  That is where the volumes go.  I am not familiar with the FOIs, so I cannot comment.</p></speech>

That profit covers three months and would have been accounted for in last year's tax receipts.  Do we have any indication that we will see a recurrence of that next year?  The expected revenue from it was &euro;50 million, but we see that NAMA made a preliminary payment of &euro;158 million for three months.  That is just one institution.  Is there any indication from the Department on what has been profiled against that?

The question is whether NAMA has indicated that it is going to change its behaviour?  If one was to project NAMA's payment over the full year - and it did not pay over the full year because the changes only kicked in on 6 September - it would have had to pay around &euro;600 million in tax to the State.  It may have to do that again, unless it has changed its structures.  Has there been any indication to the Revenue that those structures are changing?</p></speech>

There is an agreement in principle.  The leaders of the political parties will be meeting with the Taoiseach in the next couple of days to agree a terms of reference.  As the Minister said yesterday, the Department of Finance is likely to be subject to the terms of reference.  The commission and the Department will each do their own work.  It is a serious issue when a commission of investigation is set up and it could potentially draw quite a large amount of resources from the Department.  How is the Department prepared in terms of resource allocation to deal with the commission of investigation and the budgetary issues we are dealing with, and also the Brexit issues that were mentioned, along with the other unknowns that exist.

Petition No. 24/16 from Mr. Thomas Mackey is on the criteria used to qualify for a primary medical certificate.  It is proposed that we invite the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, to appear before the committee to discuss the issues raised in the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is No. 36/16 from Mr. Neil Tolan, which proposes that a regulator be set up for the gambling-gaming industry.  It is proposed to correspond with the Department of Justice and Equality and request that it outline a proposed timeline for the introduction of a new executive agency that will act as both the licensing authority and regulator for the gambling sector and to keep the committee updated on any progress in this regard.  It is also proposed that we forward the response from the Department to the petitioner and that the petition will remain open to await the outcome of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 38/16 from Ms Abigail Mulligan to stop the use of Depo-Provera in Ireland.  It is proposed, following consideration of this matter, that we forward a copy of the response from the Health Products Regulatory Authority to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is No. 01/17 from Mr. Oisin Turakhia on the responsible service of alcohol.  It is proposed that the committee further examine the issue and write to the petitioner to request that he produce further evidence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is No. 03/17 from Mr. Brian Houlihan on a public consultation on the feasibility of developing a hemp industry.  It is proposed that the committee correspond with Teagasc and request an update on recommendations from the 2009 future of the industry study on the development of a hemp industry in Ireland.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is No. 04/17 from Mr. Frank Considine on equality for school secretaries.  It is proposed that the committee forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is No. 13/17 from Ms. Tara O'Sullivan on making the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding an extra 30 minutes.  It is proposed that we invite officials from the Department of Education and Skills and State Examinations Commission to appear before the committee to discuss how the mock examination papers provided by commercial suppliers to schools will be scrutinised in advance of sale to schools.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I am sure many students leave an examinations hall and have conversations in bike sheds and so forth on aspects of the paper and whether they would have been able to answer question X, Y and Z if they had been given more time.  Many of us will have had similar conversations during our junior and leaving certificate days.  We should laud Ms O'Sullivan for taking time to correspond with us on the issue.  It will be worthwhile to have a further discussion with officials from the Department and show them that someone has taken the time to think about how this issue impacts on students.  Examination should not be shoehorned into a specific time, particularly in English where students should be allowed to demonstrate their skills in creative writing and discussing prose and poetry.  It is welcome that someone corresponded with the committee on this matter.</p></speech>

A young student has taken time to correspond with the Oireachtas to highlight flaws or an unfairness regarding the time afforded to students to complete examination papers.

On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and Ms Naomi Kennan, policy officer at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children; Mr. Terry Dignan, CEO and Ms Karla Charles, policy officer at Empowering People in Care, EPIC; and Ms Cliodhna O'Neill, director of policy and Ms Catherine Ghent, solicitor, from the ISPCC.  Ms Carol Anne Coolican and Mr. Keith Walsh from the family and child law committee of the Law Society of Ireland will be joining us.  I thank all the witnesses for attending today and extend a welcome to their colleagues in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask all members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting, as well as adversely affecting television and web streaming.  Any submissions or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I understand the witnesses will make a short presentation, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee on the heads of the Bill.</p><p>I invite Dr. Muldoon to make his opening statement.  We will then take opening statements from EPIC, the ISPCC and the Law Society of Ireland in that order.</p></speech>

Today we are discussing an extremely important piece of legislation that will have a major impact on the experiences of thousands of vulnerable children and young people in Ireland.  Before outlining the view of my office in respect of the general scheme, I would like to briefly outline the work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, OCO.<br/><br/>The OCO is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  We examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies.  We are independent and impartial, acting neither as an advocate for the child nor as an adversary of the public body; we respect and promote local complaints procedures, and we aim to achieve systemic change that addresses the root causes of complaints.  <br/><br/>In my work, I am statutorily obliged to consider the best interests of the child and to give due consideration to the wishes of the child, in accordance with age and understanding.  I also have a statutory remit to promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children.  This involves a number of actions, one of which is to advise on legislation, as I am doing today, and my advice is always informed by my obligation to promote children&rsquo;s rights.<br/><br/>Since our office was established, some of the most powerful and effective work we have done has been in hearing the voice of young people through consultations.  We carried out the &quot;Big Debate&quot; around the children&rsquo;s constitutional referendum, and we created <i>A Word from the Wise</i>, a collection of personal stories based on complaints we received and which we then presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Only last month, we published a report on scoliosis which included the powerful testimonies of three young people who had experienced significant delays before undergoing scoliosis surgeries.  What we have learned in our work is that young people have a lot to say, they can have great insight, and most important, their views about decisions that affect them almost always add to the success of the outcome.<br/><br/>I very much welcome the general scheme because the establishment of a nationally organised and managed guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL service at a statutory level is a crucial step towards ensuring that children and their rights are placed at the centre of judicial proceedings affecting them.However, in order to ensure that the national GAL service is child-centred, independent, accessible and transparent, I am recommending a number of amendments to the scheme as it stands.<br/><br/>Legislation that informs reform of the current system needs to be underpinned by recognition of guardians <i>ad litem</i>as being first and foremost a service for children to give effect to their constitutional and international rights.  It appears that the general scheme is based on an understanding of guardians <i>ad litem</i>as being primarily a service to the courts, with the function of providing support to the courts when they deem it necessary to inform their decision making.  This in no way reflects the reality that implementing the rights of children in judicial proceedings is not a choice for adults, but an important legal and constitutional obligation that must be fulfilled.  We must ensure that access to a GAL is first and foremost the right of a child affected by judicial proceedings, and then secondarily a service for the courts.  <br/><br/>It is our view that the optimal approach to putting in place a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is to establish and properly resource an independent statutory body.  Such a body would be given powers to establish a panel of guardians <i>ad litem</i>who can be appointed by a court in proceedings covered by the legislation.  A single, State-funded agency would ensure greater consistency across Ireland.  It would be independent and would provide a means to recruit, train and select GALs.</p><p>This system would allow for GALs to be employed on a salary and the legal costs of solicitors representing GALs to be better controlled.  It would also provide a means for quality control and oversight of the service.  This is in line with practices in England and Wales, where guardian <i>ad litem</i>services are managed by a non-departmental public body, which is accountable to the Secretary of State for Justice, known as the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, CAFCASS.<br/><br/>The establishment of an independent statutory body is important as the general scheme, as it currently stands, would allow for the procurement of a national service by a private body and would largely result in the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>for a long period of time, with all rather than the majority of GALs operating under the auspices of one external agency.  The establishment of an independent statutory body with the broad responsibility for providing children with access to independent representatives would also future proof the legislation, which is crucial.  It would ensure that it has the capacity to work towards fulfilling Ireland's international obligations to promote the rights of children involved in all judicial proceedings, not just in child care proceedings.  Although the process of setting up an independent statutory body will clearly involve challenges, these can be overcome by forward planning and engaging with all the necessary stakeholders.  We should also make use of the learning available from Northern Ireland, England and Wales regarding the establishment and operation of such a model.  We can even improve on that.<br/><br/>In commenting on the general scheme, it is also important that I add my objection to those already made regarding Tusla continuing to fund the GAL service.  It is essential that this service remains fully independent as GALs will be working closely with Tusla and we cannot allow a risk of blurred lines to exist.  In legislating for a statutory GAL service we must ensure that it is done correctly from the beginning.  The highest standards of governance should be targeted and achieved.<br/><br/>I have touched on the main recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, but we have also made a detailed submission to the committee.  Members will see that our contribution is driven by the need to remember, at all times, that the children who are availing of GAL services can be extremely vulnerable.  The proceedings themselves can be long and complex, and the decisions made have profound and lasting implications for the young people involved.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>can play an important role in arguing for the necessary supports and therapies for children.  However, there is currently no consistency in the appointment of GALs or in the extent to which courts hear the voice of the child in child care cases.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project found that of 1,194 District Court cases reviewed over the period from December 2012 to June 2015 on average a guardian <i>ad litem</i>was appointed in 53% of cases.  A GAL was appointed to children in 79% of cases in Louth, but only 13% of cases in Galway.  The lack of transparency and structure is an issue.  The role a GAL plays must be set out clearly.<br/><br/>This legislation is very welcome but it must provide a child centred and rights based service.  In drafting this long called for and extremely important legislation it is essential that we bear in mind Ireland's obligation in respect of children's rights and the progressive realisation of those rights.  It is particularly relevant this year, the 25th anniversary of Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and also in light of the children's referendum which recognises children's rights at constitutional level and clearly establishes the duty of the Government to protect and vindicate those rights through its laws.  Of particular relevance in this context are Articles 42A.4.1 and 42A.4.2, which provide that in the resolution of child care proceedings brought by the State and proceedings concerning adoption, guardianship, custody and access the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration and the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  In its concluding observations on Ireland's children's rights record in 2016 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, CRC, recommended that measures should be taken to ensure that the effective implementation of legislation recognises the right of the child to be heard in relevant legal proceedings.  This legislation is a vital opportunity to do that.  There are approximately 6,500 children in care at present.  We must strive to ensure that the views of all those young people are properly represented and that we push forward to consider the opinions of all young people involved in legal proceedings.<br/><br/>Finally, in drafting this legislation the rights of children with disabilities, children with mental health issues and the rights of children of all ages and of all abilities must be considered.  The CRC highlights that non-verbal forms of communication, including play, body language, facial expressions, drawing and painting, should be used so children can avail of the opportunity to demonstrate understanding, choices and preferences.  I thank the committee for inviting me to address it today.  I am hopeful that, following consultation with the relevant stakeholders and with a clear focus on the rights of the children involved, this can be a very progressive legislative measure to provide for some of Ireland's most vulnerable children.</p></speech>

EPIC, empowering people in care, is a national advocacy organisation that works with children and young people in care with care experience.  The work of the advocate is to support the child, to allow the child to understand issues affecting him or her, to access information and to access the entitlements they have.  All of our advocates are professionally qualified and experienced child care professionals.<br/><br/>We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical issue of guardians <i>ad litem</i>with the committee in the context of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017.  EPIC&rsquo;s position is that every child involved in legal proceedings requires a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is a crucial aspect of the system that the child&rsquo;s best interests are represented in any court proceeding that will have an impact on the child&rsquo;s life.  It is important to note that such proceedings can be very intimidating and confusing to a child.  This is especially true for children in care, for whom court proceedings can determine their separation from their parents, siblings, community and the extent of their contact and access to their birth family.  EPIC believes it is crucial that all children involved in legal proceedings have a right to have their voice heard and have their best interests represented.  We also recognise that guardians <i>ad litem </i>can be appointed for a limited period of time.  Children involved in care proceedings should have the support of both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and, where possible, an independent advocate with whom they have had time to develop a trusting relationship.  We are encouraged that the joint committee has dedicated time to examine the importance of the voice of the child and we are grateful for the opportunity to put forward the opinion that children with care experience or in care must have entitlement to both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and, where possible, an advocate. <br/><br/>Guardians <i>ad litem </i>and advocates provide different yet complementary support to children in care.  While guardians <i>ad litem </i>will outline the child's wishes and feelings and defend the child&rsquo;s best interest, the role of the advocate is solely to support the child in having his or her voice heard.  This is a particularly significant distinction given how disempowered children can feel in care proceedings where decisions are being made about their interests and future.  Due to the difference in their role, guardians <i>ad litem </i>in some cases may only have had the opportunity to meet the child on a limited basis and only when proceedings are in being.  Guardians <i>ad litem </i>might have a trusting relationship with the child in some instances, but not in all cases.  This is especially significant for children in care, which is why we are drawing the committee's attention to the importance of having an advocate who will have the opportunity to engage with the child before, during and after the court proceedings.<br/><br/>Children in care are a particularly vulnerable cohort.  They often struggle to build relationships and trust with adults.  Advocates will always have the opportunity to build a relationship with the child over an extended period of time and position themselves as a medium to long-term support on whom the child can count.  An advocate will encourage the child to speak where possible or will accurately represent their views in care proceedings.  The relationship between the child and the advocate is further strengthened by its voluntary nature.  The child chooses to work with the advocate, whereas in many cases the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is court appointed.  We have successfully supported children and young people with care experience in large part because of the time, effort and expertise that advocates devote to developing this trusting relationship.  In EPIC&rsquo;s opinion, guardians <i>ad litem </i>and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system would benefit significantly from working in collaboration with advocates, where possible, when representing a child in care proceedings.  Furthermore, it is the child at the centre of these proceedings who will ultimately benefit from a closer collaboration between an advocate and a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. <br/><br/>We welcome that the best interests of the child is highlighted as paramount in child care proceedings.  EPIC&rsquo;s opinion of the proposed legislation is twofold.  First, we welcome the regulation of the GAL service to ensure consistency in practice, adequate oversight and structured complaint procedures.  This is especially welcome given that there are currently significant geographical inconsistencies in a child&rsquo;s access to a court appointed guardians <i>ad litem</i>and such a lottery is unacceptable.  Further, it is our duty to promote the right of the child to have their voice heard in matters that affect them.The proposed regulation of the GAL in head 5, subhead (1), insists that &ldquo;while the Guardian <i>ad litem </i>will hear the child&rsquo;s views, and have regard to them, in formulating his-her report for the court, the GAL will advise the court ... on what is in the best interest of the child.  S/he is not constrained by the views of the child ...&quot;.  While we understand that this is consistent with the guardian <i>ad litem&rsquo;s </i>mandate, children, and especially children in care, would benefit in some cases from having access to both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and an advocate in court proceedings.  Our opinion is that it would be beneficial to both the child and the court if a formal structure was put in place to enable better collaboration between the child and the court through having a relationship between the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and advocates, where possible.  This collaboration would be facilitated by the establishment of a single guardian <i>ad litem </i>service that would be open to the possibility of advocates being appointed alongside guardians <i>ad litem </i>for children in care.</p><p>To conclude, EPIC believes that the legislation is a positive development.  However, the current proposal is in danger of diluting the voice of the child by limiting the child to a witness status.  This does not, in our opinion, give appropriate or adequate weight to the voice of the child in respect to court proceedings in a manner that is consistent with Article 42A of the Constitution, which states, &ldquo;in all proceedings ... in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.&rdquo;  It is our contention that the key to ensuring the child&rsquo;s voice is heard is through structured collaboration between guardians <i>ad litem</i>and advocates.  The voice of the child must be central to that process and must inform court decisions during child care proceedings.  If the voice of the child is absent, the court will not be in a position to make a fully informed decision.  We feel this is critical to the vulnerable cohort of children in care.</p></speech>

We sent some follow-up information after our last appearance on cyber-safety which I hope members found useful.<br/><br/>We are delighted to be here to discuss this important and long-awaited legislation.<br/><br/>The ISPCC has been calling for reform of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service for a number of years.  We have many concerns, some of which are addressed in the heads of this Bill and some of which are not.  I want to briefly refer to these.  What the legislation should do is give effect to the constitutional amendment which recognised and affirmed the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and, in this case, particularly in a situation where they are vulnerable.  To some extent, it does this and to a large extent it does not.  Our primary concern in calling for reform over many years is that the current system is unregulated and while there are many examples of good practice among existing guardians <i>ad litem</i>, there are no recognised professional standards to which all guardians must adhere.  Further concerns have been that the current system lacks statutory guidance on function, eligibility criteria and payment structures, to the detriment of children.  The new Bill must address these deficits and, to some extent, it does so, and these are the positive aspects of the Bill.  However, some of the proposals still fall short of best practice standards and there are key improvements we feel are needed to ensure that children's voices are heard and their rights truly vindicated, which is the purpose of the legislation.<br/><br/>We make several recommendations.  We recommend that the reformed guardian <i>ad litem</i>system requires a shift in focus from that outlined in the new legislation, that is, from assisting the court in decision making to clearly meeting the State's obligation under Article 42 of the Constitution and Article 12 of the UNCRC to ensure children's rights are vindicated within the courts system, particularly in child care proceedings.  The State, through legislation, must ensure appropriate measures to allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to ensure full participation and realisation of a child's constitutional rights.  This is a concern we have in regard to the heads of Bill, as outlined.  We do not believe the right of the child to be provided with a guardian should be restricted, and I would echo the comments of my colleague from EPIC, who said all children should have access to a guardian.  We believe a comprehensive and independent service cannot be achieved if it is funded through Tusla and that an alternative mechanism should be followed.<br/><br/>We welcome the establishment of a single national service, the proposals on management and structure and the fact the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be defined in legislation.  We are less thrilled at how the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is defined in legislation, and my colleague Ms Catherine Ghent, a solicitor who has advised the ISPCC on this topic, will speak shortly on that.  To give a little more detail, while we believe the establishment of a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>system is to be welcomed, it must achieve what is outlined in Article 42A and the voice of the child must be heard.  In order for the voice of the child to be heard in our courts system, however, it must be effectively advocated for within the courts system.  This can only be achieved where the status of guardian <i>ad litem</i>in proceedings is equal to that of others who are appearing in court.<br/><br/>I was at the excellent Barnardos conference yesterday and it must be congratulated for holding such an excellent event.  It was remarkable how many people who work within the courts system, including judges, spoke of their concern in regard to this item within the legislation whereby the role of guardian has been restricted to that of a special type of expert witness who advises the court on a child's interests and views but who is not party to proceedings.  It was notable how many people talked about the removal of the ability to cross-examine, which is a diminution of service to children when compared to the existing system.  It is a crucial role for guardians and their legal representatives to be able to question what happens in court.  To remove that in this legislation would, we believe, be a retrograde step.  Ms Ghent will address this shortly.<br/><br/>As EPIC has said, every child should have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  With regard to the funding structure, for the purposes of independence we do not believe this national system should be funded through Tusla.  We believe there is a conflict in this regard and we believe it should be taken out and funded through a separate mechanism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Ghent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#D00300"><p>To pick up on that point, it is very important to ask what is the role of the guardian and what we do when we go into court.  I am a solicitor who represents guardians and I sometimes represent children.  A guardian is the representative of a child before the court.  It is not just someone who goes to the child and says, &quot;What do you think about this?&quot;  That is a role which would not be appropriate.  Children need advocates before the court and we all know the effect when they do not have one.  They need regulated professionals who have expertise and who will say: &quot;I am determining what is in your best interests.  I am going to promote and listen to what you say.  I am going to put that before the court and I am not going to put it in a passive way.  I am going to advocate for you.&quot;<br/><br/>The constitutional amendment recognised children as rights holders on their own behalf and it did not diminish or specify any limits on the children's rights.  In fact, for the first time, it gave constitutional backing and a constitutional impetus for children's rights to be the paramount consideration.  That has been recognised in the key judgment given by Mrs. Justice Baker last year in regard to what this actually means, where she said that even within the existing statutory framework, the guardian is the representative of the child.<br/><br/>In that judgment she also said the child is entitled to the full panoply of rights in terms of fair procedures.  What does &quot;fair procedures&quot; mean?  This was established in the <i>re</i>Haughey case, where someone went before a tribunal and what was at stake was their reputation and reputational damage.  Within that context, which we also see in the Charleton inquiry, people are entitled to cross-examine and to put their client's case before the decision making body.  What I am really worried about is that in diluting and diminishing, and in the extraordinary step of removing the right to cross-examine, we take away from children the rights which have been constitutionally identified as pertaining to people, not just in court proceedings, but before tribunals where reputational damage is involved.<br/><br/>Mr. Justice McMenamin has acknowledged the fundamental impact of a care order on a child.  That is what we are talking about.  He said that in cases where the decision and the consequences are so profound for the child, we need to protect their constitutional rights.  I am an advocate for the child before the court and, therefore, I need to cross-examine on their behalf and I need to be able to bring appeals on their behalf.  Mrs. Justice Baker said those rights as previously identified in terms of fair procedures are actually enhanced.  I question how the removal of the right to cross-examine, which is a fundamental right which applies to other citizens, is compatible with the key decision as to what representation for children looks like, even within the limited statutory provision as it stands.  In fact, I think they are not compatible.<br/><br/>I was involved in a case a number of years ago where a father was subsequently convicted of rape of his child.  When we went into the court in the care proceedings, he looked for access.  The judge told us that he had a right of access to his child and, despite the fact his very young child was saying &ldquo;I am terrified of him, I do not want access&rdquo;, the judge granted it.  The HSE at the time did not appeal that.  We appealed it on behalf of the child.  The Circuit Court judge expressed her serious concern and stopped what could have been a really abusive process for the child.  Recently, there has been a case where the parents fled from another European jurisdiction.</p><p>There are legal remedies in a European context under regulations.  The Child and Family Agency, CFA, did not spot that this was a case where the child should have been returned to the jurisdiction which had most information in regard to the child.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>was appointed.  The guardian <i>ad litem </i>instructed me and I immediately highlighted that this was not the right jurisdiction to deal with this.  That became very clear.  The case has become very sad and difficult and the level of tension is very concerning.  The child now has a sibling born in a different jurisdiction in respect of whom there are proceedings in being.  The sibling could be adopted in that jurisdiction and the child in our jurisdiction may not have any contact with them.  We are seeking to stop siblings being split up.  In circumstances where the CFA did not do that, the ISPCC is that child's only voice.  <br/><br/>We have cases before the courts at the moment.  There has been a certain limited backlash to the referendum.  Certain judges have taken the view that they are at the vanguard of parents' rights and they have to protect parents' rights.  At times, it is quite difficult to get the voice of the child heard before the court.  For example, in cases where a child has been beaten to the extent that injuries are apparent, where they have scars or have been scalded, certain judges determine that this is severe physical chastisement and that the child has not been assaulted.  If those cases were before the criminal courts judges would have to find that assault was committed.  Where would those children go if they did not have the ISPCC to tell the judge that that is unacceptable and that the judge has a responsibility to vindicate and promote children's welfare?  <br/><br/>That is the seriousness of what we are dealing with and that is why I am asking the members of the committee to question if the provisions of this Bill are constitutionally compatible.  How do they give effect to specific identification of the constitutional rights, which we all said was appropriate and necessary?  In terms of looking at the constitutional rights and giving effect to Article 42A, it is not passive.  It should not be allowed to sit there.  There is an obligation to promote.  How can that be promoted if the child is given a lesser status in proceedings than parents or the Child and Family Agency?  We have serious concerns in that regard which I would like to be addressed.</p></speech>

The Law Society's function is to assist, advise and use its experts and expertise to get the best legislation and to provide the best outcomes for children.  Its members appear on every side of the argument in the District, Circuit and High Court in regard to child care matters.  A considerable amount of expertise and time has gone into this submission.<br/><br/>My name is Keith Walsh.  I am chair of the society&rsquo;s family and child law committee and a family law practitioner based in Crumlin.  I am joined by my committee colleague, Ms Carol Anne Coolican, who is managing solicitor of the Legal Aid Board in the law centre in Tralee and has extensive experience in the subject under discussion this morning.  <br/><br/>The Law Society family and child law committee is composed of experts in the family law area who are dedicated to improving the practice of family law for the public and those involved in the family law system.  I would like to recognise the dedication of a number of our committee members who have contributed to today's paper and and who are here today:  Sin&eacute;ad Kearney from Byrne Wallace Solicitors, Denise Kirwan from Comyn Kelleher Tobin in Cork, Geraldine Keehan from Augustus Cullen Law in Wicklow and Dublin and Cormac &Oacute; Cul&aacute;in from the Law Society.<br/><br/>Our submission, as drafted by our committee, has been furnished in advance to committee members and provides further details and recommendations in respect of some of the heads proposed in the Bill.  The society is available and interested to engage with the committee and Department officials in improving the Bill.<br/><br/>At the foremost and core of consideration of the general scheme is the amendment to the Constitution in respect of the voice of the child in legal proceedings.  All considerations must flow from this simple tenet.  Rather than provide a section by section commentary on the scheme, we wish to highlight three issues that impact on the intention of the scheme.  <br/><br/>The first point is that there is a constitutional right for the child's voice to be heard.  That means the current scheme will need to be amended so that there is an obligation on the courts to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The scheme, as drafted, gives a discretion but not an obligation to the Circuit and District Courts on such appointment.<br/><br/>The second point is that it is imperative that an independent agency manage the guardian<i>ad litem</i>service.  This should be an independent non-departmental body which is also independent of the parties, including Tusla.  This is the approach adopted in our neighbouring jurisdiction. <br/><br/>The third point is that the scheme as drafted would be greatly enhanced by the specific inclusion of the criteria to be assessed in determining the best interest of children.  This is set out in section 31 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in regard to cases involving children in private law matters.<br/><br/>The society has made 12 recommendations in regard to the general scheme, relating to some of the following points: the necessity for a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service; the necessity for greater clarity of roles in respect of service providers; a recommendation for comprehensive criteria for establishing the best interests of the child, head 5; and a strengthening in regard to the qualification of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, head 7.  The society recommends the introduction of a fee structure for both guardians <i>ad litem</i>and their legal representatives; regular audits of files and accounts and clarity on the discretion of the courts, head 8; and finally, the society is advocating for careful consideration in relation to the provision of information to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and reports prepared by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>for the courts, heads 10 and 12.<br/><br/>The society and practitioners working at the coal face of child and family law welcome the Bill.  However, the test of the commitment will be the degree to which resources and professionalism are brought to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>infrastructure and that the policy objectives are appropriate from the outset.<br/><br/>Ms Coolican and I are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I fully endorse that this should not be attached to Tusla.  That would be a very dangerous step.  I made it quite clear when Barnardos attended this committee that we would be making a very serious mistake by having this service attached to and monitored and funded by Tusla.  We would be creating more problems than we would be eliminating.</p><p>I agree that to remove the ability for someone to cross-examine would be another very serious issue for our children.</p><p>What is meant by the qualifications of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  Are they legal qualifications or other qualifications?  How would the process of creating that monitoring board who will take on the guardians be undertaken?  Who will form the initial body that is going to monitor, examine and oversee these guardians?</p></speech>

That is being echoed by all parties.</p><p>What are the qualifications of guardians <i>ad litem </i>that are currently working in the service?  I ask that so that we have an understanding of where we are coming from and what we are trying to achieve.  I would like to hear what the Ombudsman for Children thinks about the role of the advocate in their collaboration with guardians <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>At the moment it is a geographic dolly mixture, if one is fortunate enough to get a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is not a statutory obligation and it depends on where one is located.  I am concerned about the role of advocacy.  One only gets to meet one's guardian <i>ad litem</i>prior to a court proceeding.  Would it not be important for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to have built up a relationship with the child in advance so that there is trust?  I would like to hear the views of others in that regard.<br/><br/>In terms of the role of Article 42A and expanding the voice of the child, in what respect is that not addressed in the Bill?  Where should it be addressed?  I am looking for recommendations in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#F00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is an interesting area of law.  I wish to clarify a few issues.  In some cases the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is the only voice for the child and it is most important that the child's voice is heard on all occasions.  The criteria for the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>are outlined.  They include education, experience and professional qualifications.  Transparency in terms of the appointments is important.  In 2016 we spent &euro;16 million, which is a significant amount, and we need value for money given the view of the public about gravy trains and the cynicism people rightly have in some respects.  The current <i>ad hoc</i>arrangement must be put on a statutory basis.</p><p>The witnesses might not have the answers to the questions I wish to pose in two areas.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act has been enacted and further elements of it remain to be introduced by the Minister.  It provides a statutory framework.  As I understand it, the legislation concerns adults.  Is there any possibility of expanding the legislation to include children or are we double-jobbing?  If it is not broken, why fix it?  Could we not add to that legislation rather than starting over again?</p><p>It is extremely important that we have the capacity to care for all children, especially given the cases of Grace and Mary and what has emerged in that regard recently.  We believe those children do not have the capacity to express their views but I suspect they would if we gave them an opportunity.  That ties in with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act as well.  We talk about giving children a voice and a child who is capable of forming his or her own views.  What does that mean?  Is it a criterion of intellectual ability and does it include verbal and non-verbal communication?  Some children who did not have a voice have been let down horrifically by society but we probably need to delve deeper, give them a voice and listen to them a bit more.</p><p>I am involved in a case currently concerning six children, of whom we know, with mental health issues, who were sent abroad in recent years.  They were seriously disturbed young children.  Is it intended that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would be assigned to them to represent them in mental health tribunals?  I am not sure whether that would be the case as such tribunals are very rare for children but to represent their views in general.  What has happened has been horrific.  The children have not been kept safe.  They have not received treatment but have been incarcerated.  That is something I am investigating further.  There does not seem to be any oversight from the Mental Health Commission or any statutory body in this country when we export children because we do not yet have the facilities here.  Would guardians <i>ad litem</i>be appointed in such circumstances?  If children go outside the State what would the remit be of the guardians <i>ad litem</i>?  What would their responsibility be in such situations or are they allowed to take responsibility for children in this country who have been sent abroad for treatment of significant, difficult and challenging mental health issues?  I thank the witnesses for their contribution on this interesting area concerning children.</p></speech>

They were the current qualifications of GALs, the role of the advocate - the Ombudsman for Children should reply to that - and the gaps in Article 42A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#F00400"><p>From our point of view, we are not necessarily prescribing the qualifications but we do think it is too limited to limit it to social work and psychology.  Our whole idea is that every child should have a GAL available to him or her.  Therefore, one is looking at someone who needs to have expertise in infant observation, mental health issues and a range of issues.  Keeping the qualifications open is important.  That is something that needs to be discussed in terms of how one would allow that but, for example, there are fantastic barristers who were formerly teachers and a range of youth workers could also be involved.  We must look at the issue on a wider scale.</p> <p>  The way we see it in terms of linking it with advocacy is that a GAL is somebody who will hear and listen to the voice of the child, respect that voice and present it as the advocate for the child.  The GAL is crucial.  If there is an independent advocate such as EPIC, Empowering People in Care, that adds to the situation enormously but the idea is that one would have somebody who would automatically ask the child where they are coming from and what they want and then allow that to be represented in the court system so that there is an absolute certainty that the child has their voice heard.</p> <p>  Ms Ghent touched on the issue in the sense that there is no way you or I would not be allowed into a court to give our point of view.  We would have representation, including a barrister and all sorts of support yet the child who is at the centre of all those issues has been kept silent for so long.  There is always the possibility that a child will come back at a later stage and say they were not represented, that their voice was not heard and those responsible are culpable because the child was sent to a secure care facility or was not sent to a foster home.  We are really letting down children enormously in this situation.  The idea is that the GAL is that voice, but it is the voice of the child through the GAL in the courts system and they have to be able to be represented at the court table exactly as every other party in that system is.  At the moment the system is set up for adults not for the child, and the child is passive.  The idea is that children should not be passive.  We need to give children a voice and hear it.  That is the way I see it at this moment in time.  I will ask my colleague to respond about the question on Article 42A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Kennan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#F00500"><p>To pick up on the main discrepancies between the general scheme and Article 42A, one of the key ones is that Article 42A says that the court "shall" so it is not may.  In some cases it says the court shall ascertain the views of the child and give the child who is capable of forming views a voice.  We could all agree that very young children, including infants and children with disabilities, are capable of forming views.  It is not about whether they are capable of expressing views.  We need to support them to find their voice through both verbal and non-verbal methods.  It is not a discretionary constitutional obligation, it is a constitutional imperative to listen to all children in court proceedings that affect them.  It is not resource dependent; it is a right that children have at a constitutional level to which we must give effect.</p></speech>

There is a constitutional imperative that the voice of the child must be heard and, according to our submission, head 8 must be amended so that there is not a discretion but a mandatory obligation for the appointment of a GAL.</p></speech>

On the qualifications piece, we did not speak to that specifically but in relation to the wider scale we are open to that in terms of it being broadened but the key thing for us is that there will be professional standards and there will be membership of a professional body.  What is listed in the heads at the moment is CORU, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which is appropriate.  Continuous professional development, CPD, standards do not exist at the moment.  If somebody is employed within Barnardos, for example, it has standards in place for the service but none of that is on a statutory footing, which is the key issue.</p> <p>  In response to the question on the role of advocacy, especially in terms of what is in and what is not in, I will refer to Ms Ghent, but our primary concern relates to head 5.</p></speech>

One cannot and would not have that limitation in respect of any other party.  I did not say that if a child was a party in his or her own right, there would be no question but that those rights applied and the limitation of the role in head 5 and the issues in head 6 would not arise.  That is important if a comparison is being made.</p></speech>

They should be broadened to include a wide range of potential qualifications.<br/><br/>On the role of the advocate, we are simply saying that in these proceedings we have one opportunity to hear the true voice of the child.  We have referred to the fact that this is a very alien and intimidating environment for children where their voice may not come through the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is our duty to the child to make sure we hear absolutely what his or her view and opinion is.  In those cases where it may be difficult to do this, the advocate can play a supporting role in ensuring the child's views and feelings are heard and made known.  <br/><br/>It might be interesting to introduce the voice of the child to the proceedings of the committee.  I would like my colleague, Ms Charles, to give the views of one child who was sent out of the State through court proceedings.  The child did very well, but these were their views on being involved in the case.</p></speech>

When we asked what happened to the usual rights they would have if detained under mental health legislation here, namely, access to a tribunal and having the decisions reconsidered, we were informed that the institution abroad could dispense with them.  We raised serious concerns about this, which resulted in our advocating on the child's behalf for a reference to be sent to the European Court of Justice.  That had not been done and both the Attorney General and the Child and Family Agency opposed it.  Through that reference, the European Court of Justice set down certain conditions which had to be fulfilled.  The system is not perfect.  The issues that have emerged in the case of St. Andrew's have caused huge concern, but we would have even less regulation if we had not insisted on reference to the European Court of Justice which indicated that the concerns we had raised were also concerns for it.</p></speech>

I do most of my own advocacy work in the High Court and bring in barristers when I need them.  The children I represent need that facility.

The discussion is very interesting and I concur with everything that is being said by my colleagues.  <br/><br/>The Barnardos conference yesterday on guardians <i>ad litem</i>is to be commended.  The Minister has said she is taking a child-centred approach to these reforms.  We have a couple of quotes from young people involved in court proceedings where guardians <i>ad litem</i>have been appointed, particularly from a child who was sent overseas.<br/><br/>One of the key points is that we want children to be part of the decision-making process, not passive recipients.  Where possible, we want to hear directly from the child.  Where it is not possible for a child to speak directly, or through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, other means should be used such as play, as the office of the Ombudsman for Children stipulated.  <br/><br/>One child said when they were told they were going to court: &quot;I thought we were in big trouble.&quot;  That is a key indictment of the scary situation and intimidating process a young child faces on hearing the word &quot;court&quot;.  Any previous experience he or she has had has probably been very negative.  It is an intimidating process for an adult, let alone a child.  Another child said she had been told she was going to court but &quot;it was never me, it was always them.&quot;  The child was not part of it.  The adults were speaking around her, at her and to her.  The person who was sent abroad was a very talkative, chatty individual but said very little because she was unprepared.  </p><blockquote>I kept my mouth shut.  That was not like me.  I did not say a word.  I felt completely silenced.  I should have been able to say what I needed to say but I couldn't.  Take the time because that could make the difference between feeling silenced or having my voice heard.  </blockquote> <p>These quotes give the committee a flavour of what young people are going through.  We would be very happy to follow up on it.  We could even arrange for some young people who have experienced guardians <i>ad litem</i>to meet directly with committee members.  We would have no problem doing so.  We would like to keep this conversation open.</p></speech>

Tusla cannot do it as that would be a complete conflict of interest.  It needs to uphold standards.  Solicitors are accountable to the Law Society of Ireland.  Everyone is accountable to his or her professional body, which is absolutely appropriate and has to be done.  Standards have to be set.  We would really welcome it because I have experienced different standards.<br/><br/>What Ms Charles says about the voice is the guardian <i>ad litem's</i>job, to explain to the child and reassure him or her.  I had a conversation with a guardian <i>ad litem</i>on that issue, saying a child thought courts had judges who dealt with baddies and jail sentences.  She had to say to the child in question that it was about hearing the child, that the child should not feel under pressure and that if the child did not feel they could go, they could write a letter or tell the guardian <i>ad litem</i>who would do it.  That reflects the need for standards, preparation and accountability in order that if a child has a bad experience, the question of why it happened will be raised and examined by a regulatory authority.  There is a complaints mechanism, oversight and regulations, which is very important.</p></speech>

There has been some discussion regarding the need to provide a consistent service and the fact that certain standards and practices should apply.  I would be interested in hearing the views of Ms Ghent and the witnesses from the Law Society of Ireland on how this might work.</p> <p>  In terms of the regulatory authority, how would a complaints mechanism work?  To whom would people complain?  Who would adjudicate on complaints made against a GAL and the independent service to which reference has been made?</p> <p>  Ms Charles spoke about the experiences of children in court.  Does she have any thoughts on how we might make the experience of being in court less scary for children?  A courtroom is a daunting place for any individual let alone a child.  Should there be special types of court settings?  I know that I have gone a bit off topic by raising this issue.</p></speech>

I tried to write down her comments and listen at the same time.  Can she provide a quick synopsis in respect of the matter?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Lisa Chambers that a court is an intimidating place for a child in terms of the air of ceremony that obtains and so on.  Sick children are afraid of hospitals and people use play therapy to help them view their time in hospital in a more positive light.  Have play therapy or other methods been explored to enable children have a more positive experience in court?  Therapy could be provided over three to five weeks, particularly as cases can take some time to reach the courts.  I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

The Minister will be coming before us after this session and we will put some of the points raised to her.  We have reached the stage of discussing the heads of the Bill.  We hope that the points that have been made will influence the direction of the legislation.  That is the point of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon suggested that amendments might be tabled.  Do the witnesses wish to suggest specific amendments?  Ms Ghent recommended inserting in head 5 a measure that would allow someone to advocate on a child's behalf, for example.  Any recommendations would prove useful to us as they would allow the legislation to be strengthened on later Stages.</p> <p>  From what the witnesses said, I understand that there are constitutional issues with the heads, as drafted.  I mean that they do not fulfil the rights of a child under Article 42A in that the word "shall" rather than "may" is used in respect of hearing the voice of the child..  I shall pursue the issue of ensuring that all children have access as opposed to leaving the matter to the discretion of the courts.  I would like to hear how we can strengthen the position in that regard.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon made a point about non-verbal children and those with disabilities, as did Senator Devine, and Deputy Neville spoke about using play therapy, etc., to alleviate the stress associated with going to court.  Will Dr. Muldoon elaborate on how the court might hear the voices of children who are not in position to express their views verbally.  Obviously, communication would take place via the GAL who, I presume, would have some way of communicating with the child.  Do we need to include anything in the legislation in this regard?</p> <p>  I want to discuss with the witnesses, mainly with those from EPIC, the benefits of having an advocate as opposed to a GAL.  At a previous meeting, we heard from Barnardo's about a child and it seemed that the GAL did an awful lot more than sit in court.  He or she explained things to the child and there was an element of the GAL advocating on the child's behalf.  Can a GAL fulfil the role of an advocate?  Is there a need to have an advocate?  Perhaps the other witnesses can answer my questions.</p> <p>  In terms of heads 3, 5, 6 and 8, there are specific things that we, as a committee, should recommend in order to ensure that the legislation is as strong as possible.  We would welcome the help of the witnesses in terms of these matters.</p></speech>

We have had a very good discussion.  I shall make three observations on specific heads and then I shall make some general observations.</p><p>In terms of head 6(6), we have had a lot of discussion on the cross-examination of parties.  There is a clause to the effect that the GAL may not request specific professional assessments for the purposes of preparing a report.  This seems to place a restriction on GALs, which should not exist.  It may well be the case that a GAL could believe that a professional assessment is required but it would not be in the best interests of the child.  I ask the witnesses to address the matter.</p><p>I shall not go into great detail on head 7 because it has already been discussed.  This proposed provision needs to be improved.  Perhaps the list of professions could be broadened.  We should also tighten up of the manner in which the persons involved in the carrying out of GAL obligations and work are regulated, monitored and trained.</p><p>I am curious as to why head 8 is weak and thin when it comes to children who are subject to voluntary care orders.  Perhaps this is an oversight or a weakness in the legislation.  Such people are also in need of representation by guardians <i>ad litem.</i></p><p>On a more general note, both today and perhaps a month ago, during pre-legislative scrutiny, the strongest message to come back relates to the need for an independent statutory body that would not fall under the remit of Tusla.  As much as an actual conflict of interest, the perception of a conflict of interest is important.  We must ensure that children and their advocates had confidence in the system that they encounter.  I understand that Tusla is not particularly enthusiastic about the idea of monitoring or managing this service.  I understand that Tusla recommended in its submission that the service could be located in the Department of Justice and Equality.  My instinct is that it would be better to locate the unit in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am interested in hearing the comments from the witnesses on the matter.</p><p>I support some of the observations made, particularly those from the Law Society of Ireland.  All of the contributions shared the theme of calling for a stronger obligation to provide a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to represent a child.  The Law Society of Ireland made the very strong point in paragraph 2.2 of its submission that family should include people who act <i>in loco parentis. </i>The committee should consider that issue.</p><p>In terms of EPIC and advocacy, should the role of advocate have a legal basis?  Is the role an operational matter relating to how the GAL service should be structured?  Should the committee insert a definition?</p><p>My final points are on cross-examination.  How can we resolve matters in this regard?  Should we remove the proposed section?  Should we remove the prohibition on cross-examination?  Can the matter be resolved through the use of the tandem model that exists in the UK?</p><p>Is there any possibility that if we remove the section there will be a conflict between legal representatives and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  Could they be at cross-purposes?  I am keen to get a sense of it.  If the provision is faulty or may create difficulties, how do we resolve it?</p></speech>

I wish to make some comments before the deputations come in again.  When answering the questions, please keep specifically to this legislation as opposed to straying into other legislation, something we could tend to do.</p><p>I wish to make three brief points.  As I said the last day, I have a major issue with the costs.  The costs are astronomical.  Can anyone before the committee set out the number of children who have availed of guardian <i>ad litem</i>services in the courts last year?  Is it possible to get a figure?  A total of 6,500 children are in State care but the vast majority have not have availed of the service.  I am unsure of the answer.  Can the deputations direct me?  How can I find out how many children have received the service?</p><p>The cost is &euro;15 million per annum.  By comparison, the cost of running the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is in the region of &euro;2 million and it gives a voice to hundreds of thousands of children, potentially.  The other service gives a voice in the courts but it is extraordinarily expensive.  That is a major issue.  It goes back to the issue of qualifications that has been addressed by many members.</p><p>The representatives from EPIC suggested we should have both.  Perhaps we can turn that on its head.  A good advocate would give the child adequate voice.  Does a child need to have a barrister-at-law representing him in the courts?  I am not so sure.  I am not convinced of that.  As I said the last day, we are giving a voice to children in court when we cannot get speech and language therapy for these same children who are in the care of the State.  Trying to get speech and language therapy is an uphill battle, although that gives them a voice in everyday living.  I appreciate the importance of giving them a voice in court, but we have to keep it in perspective in respect of the cost.</p><p>Another issue relates to the numbers.  Someone referred to the children in voluntary care.  Many children are in voluntary care.  If a mother puts her child in the care of the State, there is no court case or at least it is not contested.  That is one situation.  In other situations where children are given to care until they are 18 years of age, that does not arise.  I am curious about the real numbers as opposed to the broad numbers being put about.</p><p>Mental capacity has been addressed by several people.  I have some first-hand knowledge of this.  Some children in the care of the State can be up to seven or eight years of age and may have no ability to speak for themselves or explain what would be in their best interests.  That issue has to be addressed and recognised in this legislation.  We need to consider the age factor in respect of when a child can make an input into what is best for him or her.  Would an advocate work in that case?  How important is it to have legal representation?  Will the deputations explain why barristers are involved in so many of these cases?  That is what is driving the costs up to what I consider to be extortionate rates.  The total cost is &euro;15 million, an extraordinary figure by any standard.  I look forward to the responses.  Does Dr. Muldoon want to start?  We will continue along that way.  Please be conscious that these will probably be your closing comments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Naomi Kennan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#J00400"><p>I wish to pick up on what the Deputy said.  Our view fits into the adaption of the broader system in the sense that all professionals working with children should be specialised and trained in children's rights.  In particular, this means a knowledge of children's rights and the legal context within which they are working.  It also means knowledge of areas such as child development, skills-based training in communicating with children of different ages and maturity as well as listening to children.<br/><br/>Reference was made to in-depth legal training.  We need to maintain the focus on the fact that guardians <i>ad litem</i>are not acting as lawyers when they are in the court.  They are not acting as social workers either.  We are keen for this to be recognised as an individual specialised profession and for those involved to receive training to be guardians <i>at litem</i>.  Part of this involves understanding the legal context within which they are working.<br/><br/>We need to see a broader adaption of the judicial system.  The need for this is recognised internationally and within Ireland.  Yesterday, Freda McKittrick from Barnardos called on all stakeholders to establish an expert group to look at how all judicial proceedings in which children are involved could be made more child-centred, in particular to ensure the views of children are heard.  That is something we really need to look at.  We need specialised courtrooms and professionals as well as a general adaption of procedures and practices and a recognition that this is necessary to ensure they are not intimidating or excluding children, whether in practice or reality.</p></speech>

I think we can go a long way to make it easier for children.  That is a key point.  Yesterday, Fred McBride of Tusla said he would engage with the inter-agency working group.  The judges are happy to do that as well.  We can find many ways to do it.  Examples in medicine show how we have come a long way in allowing children to find comfort in difficult situations.  We can make our court systems and environment better.  We can ensure the professionals who work there are better equipped to work with children.<br/><br/>Reference was made to non-verbal expression.  That is part of the reason we are keen for a wider expanse of professionals.  We can hear the voice of a child, no matter what the age or disability and no matter what issues are going on, once the right person is working with him or her.  It may take a little longer and it may take some time, but I believe it is worth it.  Often, we have seen cases where it can take six or 12 months of being in and out of court.  During that time we can really get a chance to work with and learn about a child and bring forward the voice in a proper way.<br/><br/>A question was asked about numbers.  I believe there is a shortage of data in that respect.  The transcript from two weeks ago suggests 1,600 guardians <i>ad litem</i>were available to the children not in voluntary care.  That leaves approximately 6,300 in care.  Approximately 50% of them have access to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The figure that seems to be abroad is 1,600.  Again, that is a guess.  This is one of the benefits that will come from the new independent agency.  We will be able to know who got the service, why and when.<br/><br/>Our vision is that this agency will be built up.  If we set ourselves a target of putting forward the best possible agency, we can make it available for all the children with issues across court services.  Non-voluntary care would be available to them.  It would help children who have mental health issues and children with disabilities.  It would operate across the range.  We have a range of opportunities now.  Other Bills have mentioned special reporters or experts.  This service could provide all of these in one setting.  There is a great opportunity to be a world leader in this field.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to specific amendments.  They are in our submission.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in respect of the comment on a conflict of interest.  The perception is crucial.  It is the most obvious thing.  Let us suppose we came back in ten years to look at a case and a child made the case that he was not looked after properly.  The first question is who the paymaster was and whether there could have been a conflict of interest.  It would be difficult to prove that there was not if the two representatives in court are paid by the same paymaster, though Tusla.  That would make it difficult to have a perception of fairness.  It is not impossible, but it would make it extremely difficult.  If we can fix it now, it makes more sense to go in a different direction.<br/><br/>Reference was made to high costs by comparison with speech and language services.  Undoubtedly, we need to work on both areas.  We need to ensure resources are available for all the children who need speech and language support as well as any advocacy within their world.  Children in foster care have extraordinary advocates working for them, whether parents or foster parents.  They fight hard for the rights of the children.  They need to be assisted through economic social and cultural rights becoming part of our constitutional rights.  We need to know that children in foster care have an advocate, voice, parent, foster parent or social worker who can help them.  The children in the Courts Service need guardians <i>ad litem</i>now.  It should not be a case of either-or.  We need to find a way to make it work better.  This new system should allow the money that is being spent to prevent further cases.  It should allow children to have a better voice and provide better solutions for them.<br/><br/>This is the whole idea.  We bring them into the system ant they give us their sense of it.  In that way we will improve the outcome for them.  That is the essence of this.  That, in turn, should reduce the long-term harm done to children by listening to adults talk about what the child needs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Dignan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#J00700"><p>I will start with the point made about the guardian <i>ad litem</i>versus the advocate.  I want to make our position clear.  We believe that the experience and qualifications of the advocate can be an additional resource for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, especially when it is time specific.  Guardians <i>ad litem</i>are appointed at the beginning of care proceedings.  The advocate may have a long relationship with the child and family and may be able to give insight into the background of the child or issues relating to or affecting the child.  This can allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to move out of the blocks more quickly in terms of representing the child as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<br/><br/>The Chairman raised a point about the legal representative.  There are cases - it is always case specific - where the advocate may be more than adequate.</p><p>There have been situations where a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is representing in one case and an advocate in another so there is the potential to do that.  Ms Charles will speak to the fact that as it stands, all children are required to be made aware of EPIC as an advocacy service for them.  We welcome that and want it to continue.<br/><br/>In respect of training, we agree with the Ombudsman for Children and the other speakers here that it should be broadened to look at a range of opportunities to bring people in from education, social care and so forth.  We feel that once those people come into the service there should be training that is specific to the requirements of that particular role.  We would recommend that an advocacy module be part of that, which would overcome that.<br/><br/>In respect of the perception of conflict of interest, we feel the voice of the child and what is in the best interests of the child are often not the same thing.  Where the best interests of the child lie in taking the child out of the home, the child may want to be with his or her parents for whatever reason.  That needs to be addressed to see how that could work.  Again, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>advocate could work on that, as can the legal profession in terms of determining the outcomes of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karla Charles" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#K00200"><p>I will not repeat what Mr. Dignan has said.  I will deal with the structures at which the Courts Service of Ireland is looking.  The service took submissions last year or possibly the previous year regarding structures and ways of making a court setting more child-friendly.  That is in motion and we are involved in that process separately.  This is something we can discuss at another stage.  It is an intimidating process that can be much improved.<br/><br/>I will not repeat what Mr. Dignan said about the advocate versus the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I would add that it is the current right of every child in care to be made aware of our service but it is a voluntary involvement on the part of child and involves requesting an advocate.  An advocate would never be appointed where a child did not want one.  In respect of the ability of an advocate versus a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, sometimes there may be a need for both while at other times there may only be a need for an advocate.  It is very much case dependent.  It should be part of the remit of the independent body to look from a cost perspective and in conjunction with the child at the best way to represent that child in court proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliodhna O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#K00300"><p>We will try to get through as much as possible.  To be honest, I have lost track of who has asked what so I will just go for it.  In respect of the independent body, the key point is that form should follow function.  We need to look at what this independent body needs to do and then determine the best mechanism to achieve that.  What everyone believes this body needs to do has been pretty clearly described here today in terms of professional standards, regulation and keeping the independence, so it should be looked at in that context.<br/><br/>In respect of the Chairman's point about costs, I should have mentioned at the outset that the ISPCC does not provide any services related to this and our interest in it purely relates to the policy in law and strategic matters.  I concur with the Chairman about costs and concerns about costs.  It is great that this committee and other committees keep an eye on that in respect of value for money for the taxpayer.  It is important to remember that value for money is not just about money.  It is also about value and what value is got for children in respect of particular services.  I have no doubt that costs could be contained better in a new system.  However, it is not so much about questioning the role of the lawyers but ensuring there is equality of status for children in court proceedings so the children have the right to be represented and that right exists.  That would be one of our concerns regarding the independence of the function.  It is very important it never comes down to cost.  It does not come down to cost for adults so why should it be the case with children?  That is an important point to make.<br/><br/>In respect of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, I am not the world's leading expert on the topic but my understanding is that this legislation is about determining decision-making on the basis of the functional approach.  It is quite a specific approach and that is supported by the National Advocacy Service.  It is quite a different mechanism and I am not sure how useful it is in this context.  There are some parallels but this service must be a specialist service, particularly for children, for the reasons my colleagues have outlined.  Ms Ghent has some points she wishes to raise.<br/><br/>A number of people raised a point about cross-examination.  It might be worth mentioning that under head 6, which states that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>may not cross-examine parties or witnesses, it is our understanding that this means the guardian <i>ad litem</i>or his or her legal representative, so there would not be a conflict between the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and the legal representative.  Where required by a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, a legal representative is instructed by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>on behalf of the child so there would not be a conflict there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Ghent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#K00400"><p>I would love the committee to sort out legal costs because the fact that a few have driven up costs extensively impacts on the perception of the kind of work I do and the kind of guardians I represent who are not getting paid that kind of money.  If I wanted to do that, I would go off and do commercial law, so I would really like that to be sorted out.</p> <p>  In respect of qualifications, I am not qualified to attend a child in care review, look at documents and say what I think is best for a child.  I am not qualified to go to a child who has been abused and approach them in a way that would not trigger trauma for them.  My function as a lawyer is to take instructions and advocate before the court, but I really feel that I need someone who is properly qualified.  In respect of very young children who cannot verbalise or children with disabilities who cannot verbalise, I would like someone who is qualified to interpret that.  Clearly, that qualification exists.  In respect of the point about getting reports, sometimes we have sought reports to see how we can best elicit the views of that child.  It is very important that this function continues.</p> <p>  I accept the point about trying to get resources.  It should not be a conflict because what is at stake in child protection is the fact that children could be sent home.  They could be left in a situation where they continue to be abused or neglected.  We know that ongoing abuse and neglect has consequences.  It generates mental health problems and involvement with the criminal justice system, and that generates costs for us all.  It needs to be run in parallel.  We have gone into court saying that the child I represent needs this service and I make no apology for this.  The issue relating to voluntary care is that there are no court proceedings in respect of it.  We have seen the devastating consequences for people who are in care and are left for years with nobody looking at their case and nobody advocating for them.  I take the point about resources, but we as a society need to say that we are going to provide resources, that where the risk is that a child could go home to suffer abuse we will make sure this child has the best possible chance, or where there is a proposal to take the child away from their parents when they should be at home, that they need somebody to advocate for that.</p> <p>  In respect of cross-examination, as I said at the outset, I represent the child through the guardian.  If that was brought into the legislation in terms of the child being a party through the guardian, we would not have that discrepancy in terms of the child and parties having those full constitutional rights.  They could not be denied if that was the case.  In any event, the judgement of Ms Justice Baker, which said very clearly that they are entitled to those fair procedure rights, must be taken into account.  We definitely welcome the greater certainty and would certainly be willing to work with any members afterwards to try to address this problem.</p> <p>  In respect of severe chastisement, clearly, the Oireachtas did significant and very valuable work in removing the defence of reasonable chastisement.  This was in the context of an assault on a child.  You could deal with a judge who does not have that experience or who has never had it happen to them and he or she cannot go there.  Sometimes it is really easy to feel sorry for a parent because his or her circumstances may have led him or her to become a parent who cannot engage with his or her children in an appropriate way.  This is why it is very important that we are able to come in on behalf of the child and say that.</p></speech>

We are very happy to engage and make further submissions if required.  We would have a concern that, as drafted, the Bill is open to constitutional challenge or even referral by the President.  I refer in particular to head 8, which I spoke about previously, that deals with the discretionary and mandatory remit of the courts in the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<br/><br/>In terms of head 3, we have some reservations that, as drafted, there are proposals in the short term to appoint a certain agency and other options may never fully be explored.  We have a concern about that particular head, as articulated in our submission.<br/><br/>In terms of the qualifications, we have specifically mentioned that we believe the guardian should have seven years' postgraduate experience, five of which would be in child protection, and preferably with management experience.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is a dual one, first, to establish the views of the child and, second, to indicate clearly to the court what is in his or her best interests.  The best interest principle is enshrined in private law proceedings for cases of custody, access, guardianship and adoption, and the children in those very vulnerable situations should also have those rights.  It should not be a case of making flesh of one and fowl of another.  The best interest principle set out in the private law legislation should also be set out in the public law legislation.  We will make further submissions to the committee.</p></speech>

The clerk has advised me that a report was made to the Committee of Public Accounts on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a lot of work on the breakdown of the costs.  The report is available for information purposes.  In summary, a total of 1,600 children availed of the service last year at a cost of &euro;16 million which works out at &euro;10,000 per child to give them a voice in court.  Many of the children only had one court case.  I do not say children should not have a voice in court but the costs are not proportionate.  That is the final word of the Chair.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance today and their participation at the meeting.  I also thank members for their co-operation.

The general scheme of the Bill provides for the extensive reform of existing <i>ad hoc</i>guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements in child care proceedings.  Before going into the detail of the general scheme, I want to highlight a number of the key positive aspects and features of the reform proposals.</p><p>First and foremost, there will be a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in all child care proceedings.  Where the court decides not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it will be required to give the reasoning behind its decision.</p><p>A nationally organised, managed and delivered guardian <i>ad litem</i>service will be established.  The service will be responsible for providing guardians <i>ad litem</i>for the courts and will support the professional practice and development of guardians <i>ad litem</i>and monitor their performance.  It will also be responsible for making legal advice available to guardians <i>ad litem</i>through an in-house legal facility and arranging legal representation for a guardian <i>ad litem</i>where it is deemed by a service provider to be required.  The role and functions of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and the qualifications and experience required to act as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be clearly defined.  These are major changes in parts of the reform process.</p><p>In conjunction with reform in this area, my Department is progressing a review of the 1991 Child Care Act in its entirety.  The detailed review includes identifying areas which need to be revised or updated to reflect current practices and respond to current needs.  It also includes the examination of a number of potential new areas for development, for example, the inclusion of principles underpinning the revised Act, including explicit reference to the principle that all those involved in child care proceedings should promote and uphold the rights of the child.  My Department has been engaging with Tusla and intends to commence a comprehensive public dialogue very shortly to inform this important review.  It will be working with the Children's Rights Alliance in that regard.</p><p>With regard to the importance of guardians <i>ad litem</i>to the court and children, it is important to acknowledge that they perform a very important function in child care proceedings.  They are an invaluable source of advice for the courts and also a great support for the children and young people involved in these proceedings.</p><p>I am taking a child-centred and a child rights based approach to the reform of current guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements.  My focus is on ensuring all children in child care proceedings will have the opportunity to have their voice heard through having access to an independent guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The emphasis in these cases is on what is in the child's best interests.  The first area of focus is on hearing the views of the child.  One of the key objectives of the national strategy for children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making published by my Department is that young people will have a voice in the courts and the legal system.  One such mechanism for hearing the views of the child in public law cases is the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Under current arrangements, the appointment is made where the court considers this to be necessary in the interests of the child and justice.  This is entirely at the discretion of the individual judge.  As this approach has resulted in the uneven appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i>across geographical areas, I want to ensure an end to inconsistency.  The approach I am taking is that there will be a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for all children in child care proceedings.  Where the court decides not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it must openly state its reasons for not appointing one, which might include choosing to hear the voice of the child through a direct meeting between the child and the judge in chambers.  This presumption in favour is not intended to be a criticism of the judges <i>per se</i>but to enable consistency for children throughout the country.  This approach will help to ensure more children across the country will have the services of a guardian <i>ad litem.</i></p><p>As members are aware, the second key reform is the establishment of a nationally organised, managed and delivered guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, separate from Tusla.  The purpose of the service will be to enhance the decision-making capacity of the courts by operating a well managed, high quality and cost-effective service in the best interests of children and young people.  The new service will be established initially by means of public procurement to facilitate speedy reform.  I will be the contract holder for the service and my Department will closely monitor its effectiveness and efficiency so as to inform its further development and final positioning in a new or existing reformed public body.  Although I will be the contract holder for the new national service provider, Tusla will make periodic block payments to it for guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs in accordance with the terms of the contract.  Care has been taken in the general scheme to ensure the independence of the service and its guardians <i>ad litem</i>from Tusla by stating explicitly that the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is independent in the exercise of his or her functions and that Tusla will not exercise any governance or oversight of the service provider or the performance of individual guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  This will limit any perception of a conflict of interest or lack of independence on the part of guardians <i>ad litem</i>or the national service.</p><p>The role and functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be clearly set out.  They will have two functions, first, to inform the court of the child&rsquo;s views and, second, to advise the court of what, in the professional opinion of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, is in the best interests of the child.</p><p>The current absence of formal qualification requirements and experience standards for those who wish to act as guardians <i>ad litem</i>is being addressed.  Those who wish to work as guardians <i>ad litem</i>in the future will have to have qualifications in social work or psychology and at least five years' experience in the area of child welfare and child protection.  They must also supply a vetting disclosure document as provided for under the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012.</p><p>Under the proposals, access to legal representation will be more transparent and formalised.  The national service provider will be required to provide in-house legal advice for guardians <i>ad litem</i>and will organise legal representation with expertise in care proceedings for guardians <i>ad litem</i>where the service is satisfied that the circumstances of the case warrant it.  This approach will not remove the ability to engage legal representation which will be paid for by the State but which will regulate it in a way that is more cost effective, while still providing for the child&rsquo;s rights to be vindicated.  While this proposal will enhance governance, it is not a cost-saving exercise.  It is about providing the best service for the courts and children to ensure the child&rsquo;s best interests will be served and that children&rsquo;s views will be taken into account in child care proceedings.  We hope the intended approach will result in an increase in the number of appointments of guardians <i>ad litem</i>, with an attendant increase in expenditure on guardian <i>ad litem</i>fees and expenses and a reduction in spending on external legal advice.  My aim is to refocus current expenditure in order that resources will be available to meet the increased guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs by reducing the current spend on legal costs.  I anticipate that the reforms will lead to substantially reduced legal costs.  This will come about through the provision of in-house legal advice by the national service provider and the introduction of standardised legal fees for a national panel of legal representatives for those cases in which legal representation for guardians <i>ad litem</i>is required.</p><p>While every effort will be made to introduce these reforms within existing resources, I acknowledge that some expenditure could be required.  Should this happen, any additional funding required will be quantified and sought by me in the context of the Estimates process.<br/><br/>My Department is carrying out a number of steps in parallel with the work on this Bill, including the preparation of requests for tender documentation for the procurement of a national service provider.  It is intended that the new service will be evaluated over time.  Other options can then be examined, as appropriate, including, for example, establishing the service within the proposed family court system or as a separate public body or placing it within existing statutory structures.<br/><br/>The proposed legislation has been designed to address the deficiencies in the current guardian <i>ad litem</i>service that have been acknowledged by all interests.  It is vital that we put in place a well organised quality-assured cost-effective national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service as soon as possible and I am committed to achieving this.  My Department and I will work intensively to implement it as soon as the Bill is finalised and enacted.<br/><br/>I look forward to our engagement which my officials will support.  I know that the committee has listened carefully to other representatives and taken their views into account in its analysis.  I assure it that it is my absolute intention in the light of our ongoing discussions to have the best Bill and service possible in the most efficient and speediest manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#N00200"><p>I will begin by qualifying what I intend to say.  There are a great many positive things in this legislation.  In many ways, it will leave the area far better regulated and monitored.  However, our responsibility in this committee is to try to work with the Minister to improve it.  The concerns we have heard today and last month from several organisations are in two or three primary areas.  The first concern relates to where the service will be located and how it will be managed and funded.  I recognise the point made by the Minister to the effect that it will be separate from Tusla.  However, it will still be funded from it.  The Ombudsman for Children was before the committee earlier and made the point clearly that it was not only about a conflict of interest but a perceived conflict of interest.  The specific difficulty relates to a party being unhappy with a set of proceedings and knowing that there is the same paymaster for legal representation on both sides.  It is a question not only of Caesar's wife being beyond reproach but also being seen to be beyond reproach.  That is an important point.</p><p>I am also somewhat concerned about the process of tendering for a national service provider as opposed to a permanent statutory or public body.  Corresponding examples include the civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board and so on.  I am concerned that if we were to operate on the basis of tendering, over the course of a decade or beyond we could potentially have a second competition involving a tender followed by a different service provider.  We could see a loss of institutional memory and all that goes with it.  My instinct is that we should have a permanent body funded directly through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I see no reason we should not have such a body.  If Tusla can fund such a body, why can the Department not do so?  It should be permanent.</p><p>A second major issue arises.  Catherine Ghent from the ISPCC was before the committee earlier.  She expressed reservations about the constitutionality of the legislation, specifically the fact that there was no automatic right to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to represent the voice of the child.  While I recognise that there may be circumstances in which a judge might decide that it is not necessary, the decision should be one for the child and whether he or she wishes to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Allowing for discretion in the hands of the judge rather than the child may not be in line with the spirit, whatever about the letter, of Article 42.</p><p>Another major issue relates to head 6, to which there are several aspects, the first of which is the ability to cross-examine.  All speakers expressed strong views on this point and suggested the proposal presented a difficulty that needed to be addressed.  I also believe the fact that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>cannot request a professional assessment is an issue.  It may well be in the best interests of the child.</p><p>My final point relates to a point well argued by EPIC on the potential enhancement of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service under this legislation.  The role of advocates as chosen by children through EPIC and other organisations needs to be safeguarded.  It is not the same as that of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>; it is different in that there is a closer relationship with the child.  It is the view of EPIC &ndash; one I support &ndash; that we need to be certain that the new dispensation ensures both advocates and guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be in a position to work hand in hand in court proceedings.</p></speech>

Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to the ability to cross-examine and referenced a request for a professional assessment.  I did not understand what he said.</p></speech>

From the way the Deputy said it, I thought he meant that it was related to guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  That is fine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#N00600"><p>I thank the Minister.  It is useful that she has come after we have heard the various voices.  Some of her officials were in the Visitors Gallery and would have been able to take notes.</p><p>Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has covered several of the issues involved.  I will return to the question of separation from Tusla.  The various groups which appeared before the committee advocated strongly on that point.  I will try to summarise what they sought.  They called for the Department to be the funder rather than Tusla.  They believe this is necessary and Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined the reasons well.  Since we are only at the stage where we are considering the heads, we are calling on the Minister to consider that suggestion.</p><p>The issue of the constitutional position was raised in the context of there being a presumption a guardian <i>ad litem</i>was needed.  The court will have to explain why it would prefer not to appoint one.  We need to come at it from a constitutional perspective.  Representatives of the Law Society of Ireland quoted Article 42A and made reference to how the views of the child &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;may&quot; be ascertained.  This was inserted into the Constitution following the recent referendum.  It should not necessarily be at the discretion of the court.  If a child believe he or she needs a guardian <i>ad litem</i>or a voice or needs to have his or her voice expressed through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, that should be the priority rather than the views of the court on the matter.  In other words, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be there for the child rather than the court.  It is a fundamental shift in the emphasis on how decisions are made with regard to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>I wish to follow up on another point made by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It relates to the ability to cross-examine.  Ms Ghent said this was taking away a right.  Perhaps it might not apply in all circumstances, but if there is such a right, perhaps the Minister might reflect on whether it is being taken away.  I do not know.  I am referring to the right to cross-examine.  Obviously, Ms Ghent has considerable experience of such cases.</p><p>There was a suggestion that under head 5 one of the functions of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be to advocate on behalf of a child and that an extra function should be included in head 5.</p><p>There was a considerable discussion about non-verbal children and children who found it difficult to express themselves.  The point made was that a wider range of professionals should be referenced in the head dealing with professionals.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister should consider the inclusion of a wider range of professionals on the list of approved guardians <i>ad litem</i>to ensure, for example, that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would be able to communicate with a child who had a difficulty communicating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1428" speakername="Joan Freeman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00200"><p>I am delighted to see the Minister here again.  I am also delighted to hear she will have a child-centred approach to every aspect related to the child, which is terrific.  I am equally delighted to learn that she will be contract holder for this service and will have control over what will happen in this area.</p> <p>  I reiterate that my one concern relates to any involvement of Tusla in this service, and I have said that publicly on a few occasions.  Although the Minister has said that it will have no involvement in the overseeing or management of the service, the fact that it will provide funding is like it having a power trip.  I would like to know what Tusla's criteria will be to make payments.  In the context of this power control aspect that it and the HSE have, and from having been involved for many years, it nearly comes down to the personality, not to what the child or what the service needs.  That is my serious concern about any involvement of Tulsa in this service.  Who will oversee the creation of this national service?  The Minister said that she will be the contract holder.  Will she have a sub-committee that will oversee this, or how will it work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00300"><p>I apologise for being late.  During the past two days we heard presentations from various groups who have an involvement with and a good understanding of our most vulnerable in society.  I would like to pick up on two points.  A representative of Empowering People in Care, EPIC - I cannot remember the gentleman's name -spoke about the role of the advocate.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children endorsed and echoed what he said, namely, that a relationship is sometimes built up between the children and the advocate.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is to inform the court while the role of the advocate is to be the voice of the child.  While there are two voices in term of those roles, they possibly have two different levels of engagement, with one being at the level of the Courts Service when a child is in a court environment.  I do not know if the role of the advocate is set out in the Bill.  What does the Minister envisage to be the role of the advocate, if, for example, a court decides there is no need for a guardian <i>ad litem </i>to be appointed?  It is at that point that the role of the advocate would be involved?</p><p>I wish to ask an awkward question.  All the groups who came before us expressed the wish that the service would not be part of Tusla and they made strong representations in that respect.  They also expressed the wish that Tusla would not be funding mechanism for the service or have overarching responsibility for it.  Tusla is tasked with recruiting our social care workers.  Its was formed to deal with child protection issues.  Why have all the representatives who appeared before the committee in recent weeks said that they do not want Tusla involved in this service?  I did not see its involvement in this service prior to today, but today it is clear it will be involved.  Why has there been that shift?  Why do we not have a belief that Tusla should be given that role?  I know it is a difficult question but it is one that needs to be asked.  It is tasked with role of protecting all children in our society.  That is its role and it is the umbrella organisation in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00400"><p>The answer to the Deputy's question is that we believe Tusla cannot be trusted.  That is the short, unscientific answer.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the committee again today.  I raised earlier the matter of ensuring this service will provide for the needs of children with disabilities, be they intellectual or physical.  The children who may be represented in court may not have the verbal skills of their counterparts who run around the playground with them every day and they may also be more disadvantaged.  The service will need to be able to interpret children's wishes, desires and their story of what is going on in their family or the care institutions.  Does the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service require a subsection, as it were, to provide for the interpretation of a child with disabilities who has poor or no verbal skills?  We referenced previously the horrendous cases of Grace and Mary who did not have a voice.</p><p>I gather that the Minister will quickly set up the procurement process and tender for a service provider to deliver the service.  Those interested, which I imagine will be child agencies such as Barnardos, will respond and submit their costs.  Is there a time limit for that process?  In the interests of the children and the smooth running of the service, it would appropriate that the service would come back under a statutory body and it would preferable if it were set up in that way initially.  Is there a time limit for the procurement process in terms of tendering, the receipt of applications, the selection process and there being a review or an assessment of the service within, say, five years?  Will that process work?  Will we be able to bring the service back under a statutory body within the remit of Government and good governance in terms of it being a public service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00500"><p>All those are excellent questions.  Many of the members have focused on similar issues and I might deal with the issues as distinct from responding to individual members' questions unless a member asked a unique question.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire commented that ideally it would be better ultimately if this service provision was located within an independent body as distinct from there being a tendering process for a national service provider in light of all the arguments he made for that.  Deputy Devine also referred to this issue.  While ultimately that may be the case, and I accept the point in terms of institutional memory and all that would need to be assembled to perform these functions and this service for the children, largely the decision to move in the direction that we are going is to ensure we enable as speedy a reform as possible.  Effectively, it is a pragmatic decision.  There is also the opportunity built into this approach of reviewing the process after a number of years.  The officials might identify that period but I will deal with the members' questions first.  When this service is in operation, there can be a close review and monitoring of it to determine if this is the best way to deliver the service.  We are in a position where extensive reform is required and it is happening on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  We all know what the issues are. We are trying to put in place the provision of a top-class set of services for our children and young people but we may not be able to get to that point as our starting point.  I still believe that this is the best way to proceed in terms of the establishment of a national service provider through a tendering process as distinct from the establishment of a separate body immediately.  Members will be aware that current Government policy is that we must be careful about establishing any further public bodies, but that is the not be the best reason for not doing it because Government policy can always change.</p><p>On the question of Tusla's role in this regard in terms of the operation of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>national service, I appreciate the members' concerns and questions and also those of the advocates in terms of Tusla.</p><p>Let me say a couple of things in that regard and then we can have a further exchange on it.  I emphasised in my opening remarks that I as the Minister am the contractor.  As I understand it, all of the responsibilities and so on that come with that role, including the funding, fall on the Department.  The Department ultimately provides the funding but Tusla administers it.  That is the way I would describe it.  Perhaps officials can help to finesse the detail of that.  Tusla is not funding the service.  The Department for Children and Youth Affairs is funding the service.  Tusla does not have any role, for example, in reviewing invoices in terms of the work or the fees for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, or the establishment of fees for the legal representatives.  The service provider does that.  The decision is that in the interests of efficiency and to fund the service effectively, the Department provides Tusla with the moneys to administer the services but it does not in any way make decisions on the oversight or dealing with individual invoices and so forth.  A member said the Department needs to be clear and to spell out exactly what Tusla is doing and not doing in this regard.  The perception probably needs to be sorted, and what that means is there is no role for Tusla except to administer the funding which the Government provides.<br/><br/>I will ask Ms Fisher to explain it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#P00200"><p>Many members have raised questions on this issue.  I think some of the issues have been raised because the general scheme does not cover some of these issues.  Some of the issues raised were in regard to the detail of the service level agreement and the contract that will be conducted between the Minister and the national service provider.  Obviously we can revert to the committee in assisting it in understanding that.  By its nature it cannot be in the general scheme because that would be very prescriptive and we want to be flexible.<br/><br/>On the question of the payments mechanism, a payments mechanism process of the sort that would be required for something at this level does not exist in the Department.  There is a payments mechanism process in Tusla.  It is akin to a banking system that is not responsible for the actual daily invoices and looking at the quality of the work that is being carried out by the different guardians <i>ad litem</i>or the amount of time they were in court or the actual substance of the invoice. The substance of the invoice and the financial management of that would be a matter for the service provider, which would be monitored by the Department, and that would be very closely monitored under the service level agreement.  We are in consultation at present with the Office for Government Procurement in regard to how best to set it up, and it is advising us very closely on that.  What we have tried to do, as the Minister has been pointing out, is to distance Tusla from the process of being in contact with individual guardians <i>ad litem </i>themselves from the point of view of maintaining the independence of the individual guardians <i>ad litem</i>, while at the same time, given the necessity to speed up and improve the current system as urgently as possible, which we all recognise has deficiencies, to have that payment mechanism, that banking system in Tusla so that it can process the payments.  The service level agreement with the service provider will provide more detail on that and we can come back to the committee as necessary.</p></speech>

I will deal with the issue of whether the child has an automatic right to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, and that being raised in the context of the constitutionality of it.  As I understand it, and I can ask officials to support me, the major shift in the Bill is that there is a presumption that the child ought to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<i></i>Describing it in that way as distinct from another is because it could be the case, given the child's ability in terms of his or her age to make a decision, that the child may not be able to express a preference whether he or she wants a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That is a concern, because in light of the child's age, the child may not be able to make that decision.  To put it in the context of the presumption, if the judge makes a decision not to use the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and instead wishes to have a direct exchange with the child on the child's view as distinct from an exchange with the guardian<i>ad litem</i>, that is also taken into consideration.  I think, and I will ask the officials to elaborate, that the shift is largely that the presumption is effectively the most pragmatic way to ensure the child has that right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#P00400"><p>I would like to draw the committee's attention to head 15 because that might reassure members.  While the general scheme provides for a presumption in relation to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the general scheme itself provides in subhead 1 that in any proceedings before the court under this Act in respect of the protection of a child, the court shall in so far as is practicable give due consideration, having regard to his age and maturity to the views of the child.  That is very strong.  While there is a presumption in relation to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, and that is one thing, in terms of actually hearing the voice of the child, this amendment of section 24 of the Act says the court shall in so far as is practicable give due consideration to the views of the child.  One way of giving consideration to the views of the child is through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and there is a presumption of appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>. The court has to consider the most appropriate means for hearing the child's views.  If in the view of the court the child is of such age, maturity and level of articulateness that it does not believe that a guardian <i>ad litem </i>should be appointed, then the court will have to give reasons that cannot be done.  There is the prescription in respect of hearing the views and then there is the question of how they should be heard.  If there is a presumption of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>being appointed and the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is not appointed, the court has to give the reasons.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

Allowing the guardian <i>ad litem </i>to cross-examine was seen by one eminent judge to give the guardian <i>ad litem </i>a status akin to a party in the proceedings.  That was changing the role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>significantly from being a person appointed to express the views of the child, pass on his or her feelings, wishes and views and give assistance to the court in its professional assessment to having a separate role as a party to the proceedings.  It was seen, if I am correct in this, and we considered in depth something that was said by the President of the District Court that this was akin to giving the guardian <i>ad litem </i>party status.  In such circumstances, giving such status was moving too far away from the express purpose of the Bill of giving effect to the voice of the child.<br/><br/>There always has been since the 1991 legislation a provision to provide for the child to be made a party to proceedings.  As Carol Coulter said in her Child Care Law Reporting Project, this provision is rarely used.  That provision will continue through this Bill as well and the child can be made a party to the proceedings.  Where this happens and legal representation is appointed, the cross-examination will take place.  Given the concerns have been raised and having listened to the various interventions this morning, that is perhaps too nuanced and we may need to clarify that more.  We can talk to the Parliamentary Counsel on that.  We were concerned that the purpose of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>might be diluted, which I totally understand.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made a point about professional reports.  The matter may need to be considered.  The professional reports in the particular head he mentioned relate to the production of the GAL's report to the court.  Where those reports on the child had previously been acquired by Tusla, for example, it was felt that it would be unfair to have the child be the subject of further reports.  There is a head that allows for any issue to be brought to the attention of the court and for the court to request any report that it deems necessary.  Perhaps the provision may be too nuanced.  We need to consider the provision again but we will take on board the views expressed by members.</p></speech>

The whole point with regard to the proposed new system is for it to be different from the current system and to provide clarity in respect of the role of the GAL.  First, it will outline what is the role of the GAL and, second, it will indicate where advocacy begins and ends in the context of the GAL.  We must decide whether it would be better if the GAL was not expressly given the power of advocacy and whether it would be better for that power to be bestowed on a legal representative who would be trained to act as a professional advocate in court.  A firm line on this has not been established.  We must discuss where advocacy starts and ends with the Parliamentary Counsel.  We must have clarity because there is inconsistency when it comes to the function and roles of GALs.  We want to pin all of that down and there may be a way to do so.</p></speech>

It is considered more appropriate to have an independent person to speak as the voice of the child in such proceedings.  It would not be appropriate for Tusla to play the role because it will have instigated proceedings.  The whole point of having a guardian <i>ad litem</i>separate from Tusla is to provide an independent voice to challenge, reason in respect of and analyse the decision.  Were the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be part of Tusla, then the provision would dilute and almost submerge independence.  The whole point of a GAL is to be separate, challenging and independent.

Let us say someone took a case on the basis that a judge exercised his or her discretion not to appoint a guardian ad litem.  Five or six years later, because he or she was not offered the services of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the person might return to court and claim that his or her rights under Article 42A were not vindicated.  What defence could be offered in such a case?  I accept the point with regard to head 15.  The provision could have existed before the referendum.  I refer to the words, &quot;in so far as practicable, give due consideration, having regard to ... age and maturity, to the views of the child.&quot;  The level of due consideration fundamentally changed after the constitutional referendum.  I am of the view, therefore, that a question still arises in this regard.</p><p>On Tusla, the Minister stated that there is an awful long distance to travel.  If we to undertake a fundamental reshaping the entire area, then I do not see a reason not to include the establishment of a body.  This is the appropriate occasion on which to do so.  I still have reservations about using a tender process because I do not believe that this can provide for the permanency and consistency required.</p></speech>

I have quarterly meetings with Tusla and at times in between.  There are huge challenges in terms of the work of the organisation.  Lots of things have come out, and more things will come out, in terms of past practices, etc.  Tusla has embarked on a major programme of reform.  The Department and I will oversee and monitor this.  I appreciate that the public has major concerns in light of different things that have happened.  A lot of these relate to legacy issues, as well as to systemic issues in the past couple of years.  A reform programme has been put in place.  I have also launched a special HIQA investigation.  There is ongoing HIQA monitoring and reports are being compiled throughout the country in terms of where Tusla operates.  We receive these reports and respond to them.  I appreciate that the more general concern has an impact on what we have discussed here.</p><p>In addition to being very clear about what Tusla is doing in this regard, there might also be an important communications piece on behalf of the Department as we move to this new way of provision.  I accept Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's view that perhaps the tendering process might not be the ideal way to go.  However, from a pragmatic perspective, it is the speediest way.  We require reform and we are building a way of monitoring and evaluating that will bring us to where we wish to go.</p></speech>

The GAL could ask the judge to make the child a party.  Deputy &Oacute; Loaghaire referred to due consideration.  That is to provide some latitude.  It is written in that way for the purpose of saying that, with regard to certain circumstances, it might be quite clear to the court that it is difficult for the child to provide his or her views.  Due consideration is something that would have to be weighed by any appeal court or any other mechanism.  Due consideration is almost intangible; it is almost subjective.  I accept that there might be difficulties in that regard but, at the same time, the purpose of this is to provide a situation where the court shall take account of the views of the child and to provide for that with as much prescription as possible, bearing in mind that there will be difficulties for the child to give those views in particular cases.</p></speech>

We have had discussions with the various legal advisers along the way and we will continue to have them.

It would be appointing a GAL for every child for the sake of appointing one, because there are numerous cases where it is not necessary to have a GAL.  There has to be a level in that regard.  This is all about giving effect to the voice of the child.  There is one issue that often confuses me.  In court cases involving a child in care, the person who knows the child best, arguably, is the care giver, who is the foster carer.  Let us say that it is four years later and the court case comes up again to review the child's care order and whether it continues.  There is no means for the care giver to contribute.  Given that this legislation is about giving effect to the voice of the child, have you given any consideration to allowing that for a care giver?  I have not come across where it occurs.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Deputy Gino Kenny, who I accompanied by his advisers, Dr. Peadar O'Grady and Professor David Finn.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statements you have made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask Deputy Gino Kenny to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1299" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017040500002#C00300"><p>I want to explain the rationale for bringing forward this Bill.  First and foremost, this is about trying to alleviate unnecessary suffering.  People may have had prejudged perceptions about the benefits of medicinal cannabis but the situation is constantly evolving into a more enlightened and educated debate.  What has driven me as an elected representative over the course of the past nine months has been the personal testimony of the many people who have found themselves in circumstances not of their choosing.  I have given a commitment, and I will honour that commitment, that in my capacity as a Deputy, I will be their voice in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  The Bill that I published last July provides for the regulation of cannabis for medicinal use and, for that purpose, to do the following: to establish the cannabis regulation authority and the cannabis research institute; to provide for the licensing of the supply of cannabis for medicinal use; and to provide for related matters.</p> <p>  The Bill takes a health-led approach to enabling access to cannabis-based products based on the evidence of the health benefits of doing so.  These health benefits are the effectiveness and greater safety of cannabis-based products than many available authorised medicines such as opioids and benzodiazepines which have serious effects, such as withdrawal, addiction and fatal overdoses.  The Bill supports the drug policy outlined in the current programme for Government, which states: &ldquo;We will support a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drugs use...&rdquo;. </p> <p>  The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 is designed to provide for the regulation of cannabis for medicinal use so that patients can obtain from a pharmacy with a doctor&rsquo;s recommendation a legally protected, secure supply of a quality-controlled cannabis-based product that is effective and safer than many authorised products, especially for pain relief. </p> <p>  The Bill allows for legally protected access to cannabis-based products by patients with a doctor&rsquo;s recommendation in the form of a certificate from their doctor that they suffer from a condition that responds to cannabis-based products.  Labelled, quality-assured cannabis-based products would only be available from a licensed pharmacy.  Importation, production, transport and sale could only be carried out on under a licence issued by a cannabis regulation authority.  Advertising and sponsorship of cannabis-based products would be prohibited.  Sale to children would be prohibited.  A research institute would also be established to improve knowledge about the use of and effects of cannabis-based medicines. </p> <p>  There are now regulations in at least nine countries including four EU countries, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, which specifically regulate access to cannabis-based products for medicinal use.  Many other countries are examining their laws with a view to a more health-based approach in light of evidence of the effectiveness of cannabis-based products and their relatively favourable adverse effects compared with other more toxic authorised medicines as well as the failure of criminalisation to reduce drug misuse in terms of harm or level of consumption for recreational use.</p> <p>  The Bill is based on legislation in the US and EU which attempt to provide legal protection for patients to access a safe supply of cannabis-based products from licensed pharmacies on the recommendation of a doctor.  It seeks to address concerns about the need for more research by addressing the funding of a research institute and the regulation of cannabis products by a regulation authority.</p> <p>  Increased numbers of patients using cannabis-based products instead of more toxic alternative authorised medicines will result in a net improvement in the health of the population as a whole.  This is borne out in the US where increased use of cannabis for medicinal use has coincided with falling sales and use of more toxic drugs and with a consequent fall in drug overdoses, including fatal overdoses.  No overall increase in recreational use has been associated with the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use in the US and youth cannabis use for recreational purposes is actually falling there.  Diversion of regulated products to recreational use, which happens for all authorised drugs with a misuse potential, in the absence of an increase in the overall level of recreational use, does not in itself represent a health concern.  This means that the Bill should not be expected to increase recreational use and should be expected to save lives through reducing fatal overdoses from other more toxic drugs.</p> <p>  There is no record of any fatal overdose of cannabis and this is a very important strength of the safety profile of cannabis.  Doctors and pharmacists should be trusted to advise their patients, as they do with other more toxic medicines, of the risks and benefits, and to recommend caution with populations at risk such as with children.  Nothing in the Bill prejudges professional judgment or attempts to influence how doctors or pharmacists carry out their professional duties.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for the Deputy.  Who will be on the cannabis regulation authority?  What process will be put in place to establish this authority?  Will it be an application process or will its members be appointed by the Minister?  Section 6(1) states: "The principal function of the Authority is the development and maintenance of a regulatory framework for the sale (wholesale and retail), labelling, advertising and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-based products for medicinal use."  In Part 10, section 39 states: "It shall be an offence to advertise or market cannabis or cannabis-based products...".  What issues may arise from this?  Will a television or radio advertising campaign need to fit in within certain parameters as set out by bodies such as the ASAI, or will it be necessary to stick to the same rules and regulations as everyone else?</p><p>Is it expected that all pharmacies will seek a licence or just some?  Will someone using cannabis and cannabis-based products for medicinal purposes need to carry a licence or medical certificate at all times to distinguish him or her from a normal user?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017040500002#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  As someone who has brought forward Private Member's Bills myself, I am aware that a great deal of work goes into drafting any legislation.  I thank them for the time and effort they have put into this, which is very much appreciated.  To clarify the current position, I understand that the legislation in force allows the Minister to issue a licence where a certificate has been provided by a doctor to certify that the use of medicinal cannabis would be of benefit in respect of a particular person's medical condition.  As such, there is a current licence situation in place and the Minister is talking about placing it on a more structured footing.  Would the witnesses be satisfied with a structure set up under current legislation rather than having to go through the whole process of enacting new legislation?  What is the difficulty with the existing legislation?  This is something new in the sense that a licence has been issued in at least one case, but I am not sure if there are other cases pending.</p> <p>  The public debate has been very much to the effect that if the Bill passes, there will be no difficulty with anyone getting cannabis.  There is a misconception.  In the opening statement, it was clearly stated that the Bill allows for legally protected access to cannabis-based products by patients with a doctor's recommendation in the form of a certificate.  The legislation is providing clearly that cannabis will not be available unless a doctor signs off on it.  The perception, on the other hand, is that the Bill will allow people to get access to these products without having had a doctor sign off on that.  The witnesses might clarify that because it needs to be made clear in the public domain.</p></speech>

One family has got access, but it is extremely restrictive.  There is another family which has applied for a licence but, thus far, they have not been successful.  As such, the access scheme under the Minister's remit is completely inadequate at this time.  On a long-term basis, it will not work.  There is also the matter of the grey area between the Minister and the medical profession and, as such, the regime is inadequate.  As to whether many other people will apply, it is possible but the last thing the Minister will want is hundreds of people applying under the compassionate scheme.  It is not workable, which is why I have put the Bill forward.  Its aim is relatively simple: to give people safe access to medicinal cannabis.  Through circumstances which are not of their choosing, many people in the country are already using medicinal cannabis and they should not be criminalised.  It is immoral to criminalise people who are using cannabis to alleviate their suffering or that of their children.  It is the 21st century at this stage and our eyes should be opened as eyes have been opened in the USA and in other European countries.  Enlightenment as to the health benefits of the cannabis plant can only be beneficial.  That is reason I put the Bill forward.  It is not perfect by any means, but I am here to represent the legislation and the many people who could benefit from it.  It is hoped it can go to the next Stage.</p></speech>

Section 32 sets out the requirement for a recommendation by a registered medical practitioner and states:</p><blockquote>Cannabis for medicinal use may only be sold on the certification of a registered medical practitioner, on a form approved by the Authority, that the patient has a condition for which a trial of cannabis or cannabis-based product is a reasonable course of treatment to improve the symptoms or course of the condition.</blockquote></speech>

The key concerns we outline in the section are that there should be an adequate gender balance and that members should have relevant experience.  Those are the only strictures we set out, but if any section of the Bill could be amended to improve access to medicinal cannabis for those who need it, we are wide open to suggestions.  Section 10 is the extent of the provision at the moment.</p> <p>  We were asked about advertisements and the number of pharmacies we envisage applying for a licence.  We hope the majority of pharmacies will apply.  Pharmacies will obviously be free to apply or not.  It is a key stricture in the rationale of the Bill that it does not seek to prejudge or prescribe to pharmacists or doctors what they should or should not do.  If there is a feature of the Bill which does so, it needs amending.  It is hoped all pharmacies will apply for a licence.</p> <p>  Advertising medicines to the public is a dubious and otherwise illegal practice.  Even advertising to the medical profession and pharmacists is a questionable practice, albeit a currently permissible one in respect of other medicines.  That clash might cause a problem for the manufacturer asking to be treated on a like-for-like basis, but it will be a matter of which change we make.  Do we stop the advertising of medications to professionals who should be getting their continuing professional development from proper educational sources rather than from manufacturers and marketers?  As such, the issue of the restriction on advertising might be a matter to be taken up in other areas of pharmaceutical marketing.</p></speech>

In some ways, there needs to be an amendment, as we have acknowledged and acknowledge again today, to restore possession of cannabis for reasons other than medicinal use without a certificate as an offence.  There may need to be further detail as to whether one needs to carry a certificate at all times one is in possession of one's medication, which one would not have to do in any other case.</p><p>The Bill provides for a certificate because we appreciate the past history and concerns about diversion and so on.  It probably would be necessary.  A key element of the Bill is that the certificate not alone gives access through a pharmacy but also gives legal protection against wrongful prosecution.</p></speech>

The prescription is something that a doctor is free to do.  Nothing prescribes what a doctor can or cannot do.  Doctors can issue prescriptions in keeping with their own practice.

There may be some expertise that says they do conflict and therefore would require an amendment, but I am not aware of any.  Doctors' responsibilities are not changed in any way.  All this Bill does is protect the patient from prosecution and enable them to access medicinal cannabis safely, and as a good quality product, from a pharmacy and so on.  Doctors' responsibilities are still their responsibilities.</p></speech>

My major problem with this is the word "medicinal" in the sense that it is a different argument to decriminalisation or rescheduling of drugs.  I want to disclose at the outset that I am a community pharmacist and am registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and, as such, have ethical responsibilities in that regard.</p> <p>  I will try to be brief.  I see this Bill as undermining the current regulatory frameworks, those being the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which are internationally recognised as very competent authorities.  There is no question about their capabilities.</p> <p>  I have heard plenty of evidence from Members connected with this, and I understand that one of the witnesses here is a medical doctor, but there is anecdotal evidence, scientific evidence and sound scientific peer reviewed data.  We do not form rules and regulations in science based on anecdotal evidence or hearsay.  The HPRA is the authority on this - I am not the authority and neither is anyone else in this room - and it has been very clear.  There is a complete lack of clinical and scientific evidence to show safe and effective use.  I know people who have used cannabis recreationally and for pain relief for years.  I am not debating that.  The decriminalisation of drugs is a different argument and we can fight that fight on another day.</p> <p>  I clarified this with the Minister yesterday, and the current situation is that for three conditions - nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, multiple sclerosis, MS, and intractable seizures - people can get access through a consultant neurologist writing a prescription.  I was also reassured that the Minister can issue a licence for another condition if a medical consultant prescribes it for a patient under his or her care.  If I had a pain in my toe and my medical consultant decided that the only treatment for it was medicinal cannabis, there is a pathway there to do that.  Anyone who has a competent, qualified, Irish-registered hospital consultant, who is the person I like dealing with my health care or that of my children because he or she is the expert in the field, and if that person judges that a patient requires this product, there is a pathway to do that.  I would not want anyone listening to think that we were trying to prevent the alleviation of people's pain.</p> <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny said this Bill was about safe access to medicinal cannabis.  That is a shocking statement when the HPRA has said the data are not there.  He also said that we are in the 21st century.  Yes we are.  Years ago, centuries ago, we used to give random bits of drugs to people and see if they died or lived.  We now have in place regulations and procedures for testing and trialling.  To my mind, what this Bill is trying to do is circumvent all of the regulatory arrangements we have which are not there to serve us but to serve the public and to safeguard minors as well.</p> <p>  There are so many issues with this.  There are a huge number of inconsistencies throughout the Bill.  There is inconsistency over the age of what constitutes a minor, which is 16 in one place and 18 elsewhere.  On the idea of a certificate and prescription, we have very strict procedures for prescriptions in Ireland when it comes to different schedules of drugs.  I am using my own words here, but it says that the books would have to be balanced on a monthly basis.  It would be normal procedure that controlled substances would be balanced on a daily basis.  I think it is a 24-hour period.  These things have to happen.</p> <p>  To return to the science behind it and following on from the Chairman's comment about liability, there is evidence that in adults with epilepsy, ingesting or smoking cannabis can reduce the seizure threshold.  As an example, person who has been seizure free for two years takes a particular form of cannabis prescribed by his or her doctor, who might be under pressure to do so, and has a seizure behind the wheel of a car.  This is a practical scenario that could arise.  If that person has a fit and has a car accident, who is responsible?</p> <p>  I am looking at the Bill and have notes through every bit of it.  In one place it refers to the consumer.  If this is medicinal cannabis, the people are patients.  Even on the first page, before regulations, it refers to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister for Health is the Minister with responsibility for this.  I do not understand the certificate.  Cannabis-infused products make an appearance along the way.</p> <p>  Let us say this all happened.  Why would cannabis have any special status compared with any other controlled substance?  We have diamorphine, which has the street name heroin, in the safe.  I have it in the safe in my pharmacy.  I do not understand the logic of dealing with this drug in any other way to any other medicine.</p> <p>  I think it was last week or the week before that I spoke here------</p></speech>

Someone said on social media that cannabis is a natural product and thalidomide was created in a lab.</p><p>The simple fact is that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, applies very strict rules and regulations on drugs licensing to safeguard the population.  When Members of the Oireachtas try to circumvent the regulations for whatever purpose - I am not 100% sure what the purpose of this proposal is - we open ourselves up to creating a dodgy scenario for public health.  I feel very strongly about this matter.</p><p> On the offences a person must not have committed to be eligible to be a licenceholder, I note that a person may not have committed murder but the Bill does not refer to drug offences.  This means a convicted drug dealer who has served time could be a licenceholder.  I do not understand this strange omission as it is obvious that a person with a history of drug offences should be precluded from holding a licence.</p><p> Why would the regulations governing a retail licence be any different from those governing pharmacy licences?  Pharmacies are regulated to an extreme degree by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  It is beyond me that it is proposed to introduce another framework for regulating this area.  The rules on the keeping of records should not be any different either.  I note the definition of a child is different in the Bill.</p><p> The legislation is completely flawed and I am not sure where it will lead.  An issue arises with the use of the word "medicinal" in this context.  As a pharmacist, I have major concerns about the Bill about which I could not speak in any way positively.  Of most concern is section 42 which provides for the amendment of the Misuse of Drugs Act by the deletion of references to cannabis.  This is a major step.</p><p> I am concerned when elected Members try to circumvent the regulatory procedures that have been introduced to serve and safeguard citizens from the dangerous effects of drugs and to promote well-being.  The Deputy used the word "immoral".  This legislation verges on being immoral.  It is inappropriate for people to snigger at an Oireachtas committee meeting.</p></speech>

I congratulate Deputy Gino Kenny on the work he has done as it takes a great deal of work to get a Bill to this stage.  The Deputy pointed out that the legislation may not be perfect.  It can be tweaked on Committee and Report Stages.</p> <p>  Having listened to the points made by the previous speaker, there is clearly a misconception abroad that one shoe fits all.  I and many members of the public seek clarity as to whether the Bill, if passed in its current form, would resolve the case of Vera Twomey.  Notwithstanding that, improvements can be made on Committee Stage to benefit people in future.  I know people who use cannabidiol, CBD, which I have also used.  In the past seven years, I tried every available product for certain conditions, including CBD, and none of them worked.</p> <p>  I support the Bill proceeding to the next Stage for further debate.  However, I seek clarity on whether, in its current form, it would benefit many people.  This matter needs to be addressed because we do not  want to build up expectations.  This legislation is part of a process and sometimes processes take a long time.</p></speech>

The most contemporary report is probably the Barnes report.  Its author, Professor Michael Barnes, will make a presentation on the benefits of medicinal cannabis in the audio-visual room tomorrow.  I hope the Deputy will attend and be enlightened.</p> <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority report on this issue is fatally flawed.  One glaring omission from the report is the issue of chronic pain.  As most people will know, medicinal cannabis is highly beneficial in cases of chronic pain.</p> <p>  Medicinal cannabis programmes are in place in 28 states in the US and 11 countries in the European Union.  Other countries are way ahead of us on this issue.</p></speech>

I take serious offence at the Deputy's suggestion that I should go to the audio-visual room tomorrow to be enlightened.  There is no darkness on this issue, on which I am fully aware of the position.  It is a major issue when an elected Member believes it appropriate or responsible to describe a report by the HPRA, a State agency that is respected internationally, as fatally flawed.  He also spoke about me taking a biased view of the Bill.  I oppose it because it is madness.</p> <p>  Legalising or decriminalising drugs is a different argument.  As I stated, my issue with the Bill is the use of the word "medicinal" and the circumvention of the rules and regulations on the issue.</p> <p>  I have to leave shortly to speak about vaccinations in the Chamber.  Large amounts of taxpayers' money and European Union funding goes into research and science.  There appears to be a gap between the dissemination to the public of research findings and the use of fake facts or what is described as new or independent evidence that is distinct from the evidence provided by the scientific bodies and regulatory authorities we trust.  I am concerned, from a public health point of view, by the Deputy's irresponsible statement that there is a huge body of evidence in support of his position which holds the same weight as the evidence of the HPRA or the regulations of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  My role in this regard is to protect public health.</p></speech>

For the information of the committee, my research interests have included cannabinoids and pain and anxiety in particular.<br/><br/>I have a great respect for the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the HPRA report.  Those involved had a limited amount of time to do the job they did.  On the whole, there are many good aspects to the report.  There is, however, a substantial body of evidence in support of cannabinoids and cannabis to treat chronic pain.  There are at least four thorough, comprehensive and excellent systematic reviews or meta-analyses.  That is the way those of us in science, research and medicine gather together all the primary original research articles that have been done on a topic.  We synthesise the literature and come up with a conclusion based on it.  Whiting <i>et al</i>, Hill <i>et al</i>, McCormick <i>et al</i>and the Barnes report are excellent peer-reviewed published articles in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, JAMA, and other leading international reviews.  Their conclusions are that, on the whole, the weight of evidence is that cannabinoids or medical cannabis or cannabis - whatever we want to call it - has moderate to substantial efficacy for the treatment of chronic pain.  That is where we are at.<br/><br/>The second point is a point of information.  There is precedent in Ireland for the HPRA having approved a cannabinoid product already.  It is called nabiximols or Sativex.  It has been approved for spasticity in multiple sclerosis.  That compound or drug contains tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, and cannabadiol.  It is an oromucosal spray.  We also have a situation where another cannabinoid compound, nabilone, which is a synthetic form of THC, is under Schedule 2 to the relevant regulations in Ireland and can be prescribed.  It is authorised for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea.  Dronabinol is another form of THC which is listed under Schedule 1, but I believe the HPRA report recommended that this classification be reviewed with the possibility to include it under Schedule 2.<br/><br/>We have had some history of the HPRA approving some cannabinoid-based medicines.  The HPRA has left some room for three indications within the latest report, namely, spasticity related to multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as epilepsy.  The report states that chronic pain is the condition that is most researched, and that is true.  Most studies have examined chronic pain.<br/><br/>I will refer back again to the meta-analyses and the systematic reviews.  The body of evidence is substantial.  The studies suggest, depending on which one is cited, moderate to substantial effect.</p></speech>

Cannabis contains many hundreds of compounds.  Most drugs that we approve for pain and other conditions are single molecules, single structures or single chemicals.  Therefore, it is difficult to make a direct like-for-like comparison between cannabis in all its complexity as plant material versus individual drugs that are single molecules.</p> <p>  We also have cannabinoids, which are the components of the cannabis plant.  These include THC and cannabidiol as well as many other cannabinoids.  These are individual molecules and we can look at them.  A like-for-like comparison can be done more easily with these compounds.  That is one aspect that feeds into it.</p> <p>  Another factor is the history of misuse and abuse.  That aspect colours the debate as well.  It is not trivial and not to be overlooked.</p> <p>  These are some of the features of cannabis that set it apart from other medicines, to some degree.  However, some of the drugs used in the pain field, for example, opioids are also subject to abuse and misuse.  A major problem in developed countries and throughout the world is the misuse, dependency and overdose on opioids and so on.  We have already approved drugs that suffer from those limitations.</p></speech>

Is it true to say that the lack of clear pharmacological pathways for the action of cannabis could be holding it back?  Normally, a standard drug interacts with a receptor and elicits an effect.  Where we have something for which we cannot define the pathway, we could have potentially unintended side effects.  I am putting the question to Professor Finn as a pharmacologist.  We could have unintended or unforeseen interactions with other molecules because the tests have not been done.  I am assuming Professor Finn would accept that as a pharmacologist.</p></speech>

One related to a question about the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The point is well made.  In fact, the concentration on the Minister for Justice and Equality reflects the existing criminal law position.  However, we are open to suggestions.  As Deputy O'Connell suggested, we would far prefer if the relevant Minister was the Minister for Health.  We would appreciate any input with regard to an amendment on that line.  We would be very interested in that.</p> <p>  The issue of minors is currently complicated, as probably you well know, Chairman, with regard to the age of consenting to treatment.  It might be something to consider further.  For most conditions, except for mental health conditions, the age is actually 16 years and not 18 years.  However, Deputy O'Connell is quite right to say that 18 years is the legal age defining a child, although under 18 years provided the person is not previously married is the full definition.  Strangely, that is the case since an age will not do it on its own.</p> <p>  We are very interested in any input that amends the Bill to facilitate safe access to good quality cannabis-based products.  We realise no Bill that gets past Second Stage is perfect.  We want the Bill to move to the amendment stage.</p> <p>  Before I address the safety point, I wish to make another point relating to consultants.  Deputy O'Connell brings up a good question.  Why not treat it like other drugs?  As Professor Finn has suggested, there are some reasons cannabis products are not as easy to treat in the same way.  Some jurisdictions have used bodies like the HPRA to regulate the use of herbal products or whole plant products.  It is possible that the HPRA could do so, but it appears that the HPRA may not be in a position to or may not want to do that.</p><p>For any other drug, even restrictor drugs, GPs prescribe.  GPs are registered specialists and, as specialists, we did not see any reason it should be restricted when other drugs that are considered to be risky in whatever way are available to be prescribed by GPs.</p><p> There are many concerns about safety and knowing the physiology, the effects, the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of a drug.  For many drugs that work, particularly in my field of psychiatry, the way in which a drug acts is poorly understood and much of what is put forward as the way in which a drug works is merely theory, which is not particularly well-established.  There is little long-term evidence of risk or benefit for most of the drugs we use.  In the US, up to 10% of boys are on an amphetamine-like drug for which there is no long-term evidence of benefit or risk.</p><p> We are appreciative if anybody wants to raise the standard of safety but I refer to Deputy Buckley's question regarding who would benefit.  In the US, where cannabis is allowed for medicinal use, the sale and use of opiate painkillers reduces as does the number of people who die from overdoses every year.  That amounts to tens of thousands of people.  If those figures are extrapolated for Ireland - we have asked the HSE for accurate figures but it does not seem to have them - we reckon hundreds die of opiate overdoses annually, many of whom are at the top end of the dose trying to relieve their pain, in particular.  Unfortunately, as they increase the dose to try to get more pain relief, they exceed the toxic level and they die.  Nobody has ever died from cannabis use.  One of the answers as to who would benefit is people who are near the maximum of their pain medication and who are thinking of increasing it, thereby putting themselves at risk of overdosing.  Hundreds of people probably die that way every year and, therefore, making an alternative available to reduce the toxic dose will save lives.</p><p> The Barnes report outlines all the people who would benefit if they were allowed access on the recommendation of their doctor.  Professor Barnes has done fantastic work and his report is well worth reading.  Every condition mentioned would be made available for access.  Anyone suffering from those conditions would be able to access medicinal cannabis under this Bill.  The answer to the question of whether Vera Twomey's six-year old daughter, Ava, would benefit is absolutely and categorically "Yes".</p></speech>

Unusually for a medicine, there is no fatal toxic dose.  It has never killed anyone.  That is true of very few medications, particularly alternative medications for one of the biggest areas of use of cannabis medicinally, which is for pain.  Opioids, benzodiazepines and valium-type drugs are commonly used and these are major causes of death.  Cannabis does not cause death, which is the first important aspect to understand about it.  The second aspect to be understood about it is that it has side effects, which vary depending on the balance of the blend that is being used.  Knowing that it does not kill people is important in that while tytrating the dose, which doctors to for pain medications anyway, one starts low, goes slow and builds up slowly.  One of the concerns is that if the dose of many drugs is increased too quickly, the patient may be killed.  This is not a concern with cannabis.  However, all the other side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, somnolence and so on are generally graded low.  When authorisation is applied for a drug, regulators are interested in how common are the side effects.  Such side effects are common.  They are also concerned about their severity but none of these is severe.</p> <p>  The long-term side effects and the particular concern about the development of dependency or psychosis are well described.  Doctors are used to dealing with these concerns.  Doctors who prescriber opioids and benzodiazepines deal with the dangers of dependency and death but also with the concern about the development of mental health problems in people who use their drugs, and they are well used to advising appropriately when there is a population at risk such as young people and so on.  This is the bread and butter of doctors.  Trying to make out the risks and benefits, weighing them up and advising their patients accordingly is something unusual and associated only with medicinal cannabis.  Any medical practitioner will tell one this is what doctors do for a living every day.  There is nothing unusual in cannabis except that it does not kill.  That is quite unusual.</p></speech>

Anybody who does not get that could not access it.  People who suffer from those conditions, as certified by their doctor, should all know that they will be able to access cannabis-based products when this Bill passes.  If a person's doctor says that he or she thinks that person has a condition that would respond to cannabis and is going to recommend it, that person will have a way of accessing it.  Doctors are saying that today.  There is just nowhere to go to access the cannabis.  This Bill would allow for that.  The major obstacle to that is criminal law, not health law.</p></speech>

I have a few questions, answers to some of which may have already been provided.</p><p>For a patient with co-morbidities or multiple morbidities, on multiple prescriptions, where is the evidence to support the case that medicinal cannabis is a safe product or medicine, if it is being prescribed as medicinal cannabis, and that it is safe to use with other medicines for other conditions and co-morbidities?  That is one matter in which I am interested.</p><p>I am also interested in why there is no reference in the Bill to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, since, ultimately, we have a statutory authority that oversees the licensing of health products in this country.  I understand the purpose of the Bill but, at the same time, I believe there has to be some interaction with the agency that is statutorily obliged to oversee that.  It also takes into account people who are on multiple prescriptions, ensuring that medicines are compatible with each other, etc.</p><p><i>Primum non nocere</i>- first, do no harm - is the point from which most clinicians start from.  Reference has been made to how nobody has ever died from an overdose of cannabis.  It would be impossible to say that nobody has died because of use of cannabis in the sense that a person may have contracted psychiatric problems and there may be depression or anxieties which may have caused a situation where people may have died by suicide, for example.  Is there research on that or is it just anecdotal that people could suffer from side-effects from using cannabis in whatever guise?</p><p>There are 750 chemicals in the plant itself and over 100 cannabinoids.  When the witnesses talk about prescribing for a condition, is the whole plant being prescribed or would there be reference to parts of it, whether tetrahydrocannabinol, THCs, or cannabidiol, CBDs?  What would be the prescribing format, particularly as there are so many chemicals and cannabinoids in the plant?  Is it possible to break it down?  Can that be done through pharmacology and, if so, what is the evidence to support that concept?</p><p>The witnesses referenced a medical practitioner.  Every doctor in the country is entitled to prescribe this, like everything else.  Is there any obligation on the doctor to use anything other than his or her ethical conscience when prescribing this product or is there an obligation on him or her to actually see his or her patient?  Would there just be the normal ethical process on the basis of which clinicians in this country operate?  Could the witnesses envisage a situation where a particular medical practitioner would be in a position to prescribe quite a lot of cannabis?  Is there any obligation on medical practitioners to have interaction with patients other than the ethical obligations that are there already through their oath, etc.?</p><p>That is about it.  We may come back to the matter again.  There is a broader debate on where we should stand on the criminalisation or decriminalisation of drugs in general.  If one considers Lisbon and other cities or areas in which decriminalisation of many drugs - not just cannabis - has been tried, one could argue that there is evidence to support us examining that particular concept.  Perhaps we have been looking at drugs in the context of the criminal justice system for too long when we should be looking at them more in terms of the health system.  That is a matter for another day.  Is there any concern that there would be a leakage of the medicinal product out to the broader community?  As we know, these drugs are often supplied through criminal markets because they are illegal substances.  Are there concerns that there could be leakage into that grey, criminal area?</p></speech>

I will be going to the Seanad in a few minutes and so will be very brief.</p> <p>  From a medical viewpoint, we know that cannabinoids bind with receptors in the brain.  Some of those receptors are in the amygdala, which is involved in processing fear, stress and paranoia.  My first question is to Professor David Finn.  Would he agree or disagree that these products could possibly exacerbate paranoia?</p> <p>  I am somewhat reassured that there would be a list of specific conditions for which products could be used.  Am I correct in stating that these could be circumvented in some way by consultants if they deemed it necessary?  Would only consultants be allowed to prescribe or would specialist GPs be allowed to do so?  Every GP on the specialist register, such as myself, is called a "specialist GP".  So would I be allowed to prescribe that?  If so, what safeguards are in place for rogue prescribing?  Would that be covered by this legislation or would it be covered by the Medical Practitioners Act?</p> <p>  Finally, I am struggling to distinguish between certification and prescription.  If a doctor prescribes a product, he or she issues a prescription.  I am struggling to get my head around this because, if the consultant gives a prescription for this product, is this classified as a high-tech product?  Does the patient bring that to the pharmacy and is the product dispensed there or is it bought like a high-tech drug for rheumatology or such?  What often happens is that the consultant would give a prescription to a patient, the patient would come to the GP, and that would be transcribed on a medical card prescription or whatever else.  That is something of a grey area.  Those are my three points.</p></speech>

I will start with the HPRA and cannabis regulation authority proposed under the Bill.  The key issue with the cannabis regulation authority is that the Bill really does not say that anybody cannot do it.  We would be delighted for the functions of the cannabis regulation authority to be carried out by any agency that says it can regulate cannabis-based products.  The information we have is that the HPRA is not willing or able to regulate cannabis-based products.  It is not for us to say if it is and Deputy O'Connell was quite adamant in her defence.  We are not here to criticise or undermine the HPRA but its report does not explain why it cannot do what is done in other countries.  Many other countries have legislation that is almost exactly the same as ours and the number is increasing by the day.  I heard that Argentina has just passed very similar legislation.  Germany passed very similar legislation in January, and so on.  The difficulties in regulating plant-based whole-plant products, as Deputy Kelleher pointed out, are real.  When there are 750 components, those issues of regulation and of distribution for pharmacies and for doctors are real.</p><p>The point is other countries are getting on with regulating that.  It seems that people are so keen that we have a fantastic regulation system they are quite happy to leave it that we have no regulation system at all.  The Bill allows for a regulation system and we should pay more attention to that.  We could and should also pay a lot of attention to the quality and safety of drugs that pass through the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  We have no opposition in principle to any agency were it willing to carry out the necessary functions of cannabis regulation.<br/><br/>The Deputy is right about the principle of first do no harm.  There is a tendency towards using medications first line where other approaches would be better.  That is very true in my profession and there is a backlash against that at the moment.  The level of prescription of psychotropic drugs for mental health problems is enormous.  One of the concerns is very much the one the Deputy brought up, the risk of suicide, which is already a key concern in regard to the medications sadly being used to deal with the risk of suicide and to treat depression, anxiety, psychosis and so on.  I would be more concerned that people would die in falls or crashes.  Many of the reasons people die from medication use it that it affects their ability to function.  Do not use machinery is a common warning.  That really means be careful not to fall, crash, trip or injure or kill yourself in some way.  No drug can be immune from that.  All we can do is try to warn people what precautions they should take if they use this medication.  The difficulty with a lot of pain medications if they are taken daily is that they constantly affect the patient.  There has to be a higher level of concern and precaution, not a lower one. <br/><br/>The prescribing format is an issue for the profession to take on.  Prescribing requires making a recommendation for the dosage, frequency and duration, and usually by what route.  There has been very little discussion of the route issue in Ireland.  It is worth saying nobody recommends smoking cannabis.  It is not a healthy thing to do, no matter the reason one takes it.  For medicinal use there is no recommendation to smoke cannabis.  Vaporising and inhaling cannabis is probably the most useful way and much prescribing for a metered dose is from a piece of vaping equipment, then possibly a <i>pro re nata</i>, PRN, basis whereby the patients monitor their own.  Many doctors do this.  The notion that patients only do what the doctor recommends is not in keeping with reality.  It is not how patients operate or necessarily how doctors operate.  If patients take an antibiotic for a week they should stick strictly to what the doctor has written on the script.  Often, however, doctors and patients have to alter and modify.  Even on a daily basis the patient has to modify the amount of a drug, always with a tendency to modify down.  How prescriptions will work is for doctors and patients to sort out.  The problem in the HPRA report is that there is very little evidence taken from expert witnesses who have experience using cannabis based products.  If I was to make only one criticism of the HPRA's investigation it would be that it asked nobody who had experience using cannabis-based medicines to answer many of the questions the committee is raising.<br/><br/>The leakage issue has been well established in the United States, so far as we know, in the early years after medicinal cannabis has been introduced.  While some medicinal cannabis, the product itself, has been used by people for recreational purposes, there is no evidence that the overall level of use has gone up, which means there is no basis for a public health concern in terms of increased recreational use, which would be a concern and which we do not want to happen.  We would be happy to consider any amendment to the Bill that prevents leakage because it is not the intent.  We have seen from other countries that the level of usage, particularly among young people, does not go up.  The notion that if the product is safe people will be more inclined to use it does not turn out to be true.  Giving good information, labelling, is very important.  To respond to the other Deputy's question, labelling the products will mean describing exactly what proportion of cannabidiol, CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, in particular and up to 50 other of the components it contains.  Most manufacturers are now describing the components in greater detail.  Moving from where we are now to where we will be after the Bill is passed, with labelling, there will be much more information for the users of cannabis products on what they are actually taking.  Therefore, safety will improve.  Usage will not go up.  There is no basis for a public health concern for an increase in recreational use.  It is not there in the scientific literature.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor David Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017040500002#K00300"><p>In response to Senator Swanick's question about the exacerbation of paranoia and the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala in the brain, that is an area we have done a lot of research on in Galway.  The literature on cannabinoids, anxiety, paranoia and psychosis is somewhat complex.  It depends exactly which cannabinoid, which constituent of the plant we are talking about.  There is some evidence that high THC containing cannabis may exacerbate paranoia and, of course, any doctor who would consider prescribing medical cannabis or cannabinoids to a patient would want to take into consideration the psychiatric history of the patient, particularly any history of psychosis or paranoia.  It is likely that if such a history were present cannabis would not be the most appropriate course of action for that patient.  There is evidence that some of the high THC containing products, cannabidiol does not act at CB1 or CB2 receptors but is still present in significant quantities in cannabis may reduce anxiety, paranoia and psychosis.</p> <p>  The balance of THC to cannabidiol, the ratio of the two, will be really critical.  I would concur with Dr. O'Grady's comments on the essential need to label the products correctly and in detail so that the patient and the doctor know exactly what they are prescribing or taking in terms of THC content, cannabidiol content, but also some of the other cannabinoids that are present in significant quantities too.  Many of the 700, or 114, if one likes, cannabinoids are present in very low or trace concentrations and there is a question mark over precisely what sort of effect they may be having on the body and their efficacy.  The mechanisms of action for each and every one of those hundreds of compounds has not been elucidated but we do have a significant body of knowledge around the use of cannabis going back over hundreds if not thousands of years and understand quite a lot about its effects on the body, in the context of misuse, recreational use and more recently in that of medical use.  The possibility of exacerbating paranoia could be dealt with by taking into account the history of the patient.  If there is a history of paranoia or psychosis, it is possibly contraindicated.</p> <p>  As to whether it might precipitate paranoia or psychosis - although the question was not asked, we should maybe talk about this - the evidence is mixed.  There is evidence to suggest there may be a moderate effect of cannabis inducing or precipitating psychosis in those at risk.</p><p>If one starts using it early in life, during adolescence or as a teenager, and perhaps if there is a genetic background or predisposition to psychosis, cannabis likely precipitates psychosis and, potentially, schizophrenia.  However, and Dr. Barnes has written on this and will probably speak on it, with the majority of users of cannabis, either in the recreational or medical setting, schizophrenia and psychosis are not major concerns if the use is monitored carefully and if there is no prior history or genetic predisposition.</p><p> Deputy Kelleher asked about co-morbidities and adjunctive treatment.  Many of the studies on cannabis and cannabinoids have been in the adjunctive treatment setting, where medical cannabis or cannabinoids have been studied alongside the patient taking additional medicine, for example, opioids for chronic pain or anti-spasticity drugs for multiple sclerosis, MS.  There is good evidence from the scientific literature and basic science studies to suggest that there might be some synergistic interactions between cannabinoids and some of the other medicines, particularly the opioids, where the two drugs working together might produce a synergistic beneficial therapeutic effect more so than either drug alone.  By giving lower doses of each drug, cannabinoids and opioids, one might get a greater and additive therapeutic effect which allows one to reduce some of the side effects of both classes of drugs.  That is interesting in terms of drug interactions, which is probably the origin of the question.</p><p> With regard to co-morbidities, the MS patient group has been well studied.  There are multiple symptoms there ranging from spasticity to neuropathic pain and other symptoms.  There is good evidence that cannabinoids and medical cannabis can reduce the spasticity and the neuropathic pain that was experienced by many multiple sclerosis patients.</p><p> I agree with what Dr. O'Grady said about the risks of diversion.  We should continue to monitor studies coming from the US and other countries that have made the move towards legalising medical cannabis, but so far the studies suggest that the diversion issue is not a major concern.</p><p> I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

My understanding is that prescription carries legal implications while a recommendation would not have those implications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peadar O'Grady" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017040500002#L00300"><p>To make a final point, there is nothing that we are aware of in this Bill, and certainly nothing we intended, to affect the rights or duties of a doctor or a pharmacist.  Whatever one is obliged to do in terms of recommendations, prescriptions and so forth is still a requirement.  The Bill protects the patient from unnecessary criminalisation and protects all levels.  Currently, from production to consumption has no regulation.  In terms of production, it is mainly through importation.  There will be little production in Ireland.  That might be an issue in the future but it is not dealt with in the Bill to any great extent.  The Bill seeks to ensure that all of the process is licensed to ensure good quality medical product ends up in the pharmacy, that the product can only be got by a person with a certificate and that the certificate will defend them against prosecution.  Everything the doctor recommends must be based on good medical practice, and that will take a while.  The fact the HPRA did not ask for experts with experience of using medicinal cannabis was largely because there is none.  That is because it is illegal to use cannabis in Ireland.  This Bill makes it legal to use it for medicinal purposes.  If anybody thinks there is a way of amending any part of the Bill, including the certification part, to make access to medical cannabis safer, better or better facilitated, we would be interested in their suggestions.  The certificate is designed to ensure that only people who will benefit will be able to get access.</p> <p>  With regard to how much additional information the doctor gives, of course the doctor will have to see the patient.  If they need to see them for any other treatment, they will need to see them in the same way to prescribe cannabis.  If they do not, they will be dealt with in the same way.  It happens occasionally that people write scripts for drugs that have a street value and those people often end up being stricken from the medical register.  None of those rules is in any way breached or commented on in our Bill.  There is no attempt to change or alter in any way the rights or responsibilities of a doctor or pharmacist.  I cannot emphasise that enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017040500002#L00400"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I also thank my colleagues because I am approaching this from a lower knowledge base, I suspect, than other people present.  I told Deputy Gino Kenny when we discussed this privately that I have no skin in this game, so I wish to give the Bill the fairest hearing and consideration.  Anything that purports to bring relief to people who are suffering deserves serious consideration.  However, I will ask devil's advocate questions, because it is the only way I can understand what is happening here.</p> <p>  It is not usual for campaigns for improvements in the provision of medicines to be as political as this campaign appears to be.  Dr. O'Grady and Deputy Gino Kenny are well known for their socialist political activity and that is absolutely fine.  It does not mean that anything they have said here today is untrue.  However, it strikes me, as an outsider, that it invites scepticism when the push for change does not appear to be coming from the people we usually trust as the arbiters of what constitutes good medicine.  I doubt that Dr. O'Grady or Deputy Gino Kelly will disagree that this is, as it were, a public relations problem for a campaign starting among, and led by, politicians.  The case for the prosecution, unfair though it may be, will be that there is a group of politicians coming from a particular political wing and, critics will say, holding out false hopes for people and gathering another constituency, the better to march forward and so forth.  That is not my view, but the case for the prosecution.  The case for the defence appears to be that the witnesses have spotted something that other countries have noticed but which the medical establishment in Ireland has not yet noticed.</p> <p>  Is Professor Finn free of any political skin in this game?  Is he coming to this as an academic professional?  Has he, for example, received research funding in this area?  I have looked at his biography and it is very impressive.  Has he received research funding for his work with cannabinoids?  Can he tell us about that?  What do his peers say?  Professor Finn is involved in the Irish Pain Society, but what do other people in pharmacology in this country and abroad tend to say?  Is Professor Finn in a minority or in an emerging majority?  He said a little about why things are as they are in terms of the lack of support.  What is the position of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Pharmacy Union on this?  The Irish Pain Society dissented respectfully from the HPRA report and I saw the three circumstances where it says that if permission is to be given, it should be along those lines.  The concern of the Irish Pain Society is that chronic pain is not included.</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to the countries that have made changes, which included Germany.</p><p>Is that on the back of the medical establishments the witnesses have not quoted in terms of their support?  Have the equivalent medical establishments in those countries changed their views or has it happened without prejudice to what they may or may not believe?  In other words, are the recognised bodies in Ireland, namely, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the others I mentioned, out of step with their equivalent organisations in the other countries where this has been legalised?</p><p> Given that the pharmaceutical industry is massive and well-funded, are we talking about legalising products people can smoke?  I think I understood from what Dr. O'Grady said that it is not primarily that but that it is tablets.  Are these tablets made by well-known, recognised pharmaceutical companies?  Are they on sale internationally but not in Ireland or other countries that have not changed the law?</p><p> I am not comfortable with individual cases being mentioned as the lever with which to get change because whatever care and concern one might feel for those cases, one wants to arrive at a decision about the legality of certain products as medicines in a more dispassionate way.  I am concerned that it appears to be a problem that a consultant is required.  Whether a consultant has legal status or not, if there is controversy about whether certain products should be provided or allowed as medicines, and there is controversy, surely one should seek the reassurance that, say, a consultant holding a recognised post would be required to sign off on certain items.  That would appear to be more in step with the precautionary approach one would normally take in such matters, asking as a non-medical person.</p><p> The point was made that since it is not legal in Ireland we cannot know, but does that not point to the need to establish legality for research projects which seeks to establish first whether the case for such medicines is beyond doubt, one presumes on the balance of probabilities?  As opposed to the "legalise and let us see" approach, should we not be talking about providing in law for the carrying out of certain research?  Has that gone on in other countries and has it led to named products emerging onto the market of the kind the witnesses would like to see available across the counter in Ireland?</p><p> I believe the witnesses have no problem with there not being a cannabis regulation authority.  Their case is that this should be regulated like any other drug.  They used the word "certificate" so presumably they have no problem with this being a prescription drug and that it is a defence in law then to say that these drugs are being used on foot of a doctor's prescription.  I presume none of that would be controversial to them.</p><p> Is Professor Finn in total agreement with everything that has been said by his colleagues here, up to and including the case for this Bill?</p></speech>

What is Deputy Kenny's view of comments to the effect that the Bill is immoral and so on?  As I understand the Bill, and I have read it, it explicitly states that it will be an offence for people to use cannabis-based products other than on the grounds set out in the Bill.  Can Deputy Kenny confirm that?  There has been an attempt to suggest that somehow this Bill is a back door for recreational use when, for example, section 14 specifically refers to the prohibition of unlicensed sale of cannabis for medicinal use and the prohibition of unlicensed transportation of cannabis and that all of those things will be offences.  Is it not clear that making anything other than the medicinal use of cannabis, as recommended by a doctor and only when recommended by a doctor, is the purpose of this Bill?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  Second, much of the muddying of the waters in terms of the Bill centred around the question of possible side effects and unintended consequences, the leakage effect and so on.  My question is to the experts.  What is their opinion of the potential of all of those to happen with existing drugs, even drugs sold over the counter?  For example, Solpadeine, which is sold over the counter, has serious side effects and the potential for addiction, misuse and so on yet that product is authorised.  There is also a range of other drugs like anti-depressants and so on which we know are misused on quite a wide scale and potentially have serious side effects.  Is there any reason to believe that there should be a different set of criteria and a higher bar set for cannabis based medicinal products than for those drugs that are already sold either over the counter and have not been authorised or that are sold on the basis of people having a prescription?  Is there any reason to believe that a higher bar should be set for cannabis-based products?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses know of any authorised products that a general practitioner, GP, cannot currently prescribe and that only a consultant can prescribe?  They might tell me what those products are because there seems to be a suggestion here that it is somehow legitimate to say that for cannabis-based medicine we have to have a consultant but for all sorts of other medicines a GP's prescription is fine.  As we know, in the case of Vera Twomey, a GP has prescribed it for her daughter but the legal position is such that that GP's prescription is not good enough, given the legal set up here.  For the benefit of the public and for the committee, will the witnesses tell us whether this bar in terms of a consultant having to prescribe applies to any other medicine?</p><p> With regard to the HPRA report, does Dr. O'Grady find it surprising that there is direct conflict between what it says about cannabis-based products and what Professor Barnes says?  The report says that to date, there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the efficacy of cannabis products.  Professor Barnes says the opposite, namely, that they have "found good evidence for one or more of the cannabis products or 'natural' cannabis in the management of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain; spasticity; nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of chemotherapy; and in the management of anxiety".  He goes on to say: "We have found moderate evidence in sleep disorders; appetite stimulation in the context of chemotherapy; fibromyalgia; post-traumatic stress disorder", and some evidence in dementia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, childhood epilepsy, bladder dysfunction, Tourette's syndrome and so on.  He goes on to say that we need more research in those areas.  Does Dr. O'Grady have any comment on that contradiction?</p></speech>

The UN General Assembly recently commented that the prohibitionist approach to drugs generally was not helpful, to put it mildly, and has affected the way in which this plant and its products have been dealt with.  Otherwise, this might have just been a plant that was discovered to have useful properties and developed in the usual way.  Why is it coming through political avenues?  Because of criminalisation.  That is the shortest answer I can give.</p> <p>  There are many types of products, from vaping to aerosols to tablets.  The variety of products is the reason this requires regulation.  When somebody has a product it should be properly labelled.  The user should know what is in it and have the opportunity to consult with a doctor.  It is worth reminding the committee of what the status quo is.  People are accessing cannabis from street sources and taking it on their own, or growing it on their own.  They are making decisions about how much to take and how long to take it for without any medical consultation.  This Bill would improve the situation.  </p> <p>  I fully agree with the Senator in that the more research the better.  The main reason research has not been carried out to date is illegality and lack of regulation.  We need to regulate products so that they are consistent and can be consistently researched.  We also need to make it legal to research them.</p></speech>

Without a way in which cannabis can be used medically, there is not really an avenue for developing that research.  The amount of research that is necessary to get a drug passed is actually not a lot.  That is why there is provision for a research institute in the Bill.  The two processes, research and decriminalisation, should work together.  If the Senator is saying that one is the horse and the other is the cart, it is not that simple.  I will let Professor Finn respond to the issues about research in more detail.  The major obstacle to research at the moment is criminalisation.  The major obstacle that is removed by this Bill is criminalisation.  We are not telling patients, doctors, pharmacists, manufacturers or anyone else what to do in this Bill.  We are just providing that it is no longer a criminal act as long as it is done in a regulated way, with licences, a regulatory authority and statutory provision to ensure it is done in a proper way.</p> <p>  On having doctors rather than consultants prescribe, I ask the committee to remember that both doctors and consultants are experts.  A need for a specialist consultant to get involved rather than a GP would be based on the skills and knowledge necessary.  However, the big problem at the moment is that people do not have the skills and knowledge.  Saying that only a consultant should prescribe would make sense if consultants were the only ones who had the skills and knowledge to do so.  The stark reality that nobody has the skills and knowledge.  One does not have to be a consultant to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to make that recommendation.

When it came along first, none of the surgeons knew how to do it.  They had to go and train to do it.  A number of years ago I came across a new assessment for children and I had to go and learn how to do it.  People will have to train and acquire the skills and knowledge.  We have to trust that doctors will not make recommendations that are beyond their skills and knowledge.  They are required to act responsibly.  This is where the Medical Practitioners Act, the Medical Council, all of those things come in.

I am saying there is no such specialist in cannabis-based medicine, nor is there any requirement to develop such a specialism.  Nobody to my knowledge, including us, is making any such recommendation.  What we are saying is quite the opposite.  This is an ordinary feature of everyday medicine.  One knows of a treatment and of an application from reading the literature as outlined by Professor Barnes.  One makes a recommendation to a patient that a course of treatment would be good for him or her and one does everything to facilitate his or her access to that treatment.</p> <p>  At the moment, doctors and pharmacists are only prevented from doing so because it is against the law.  This Bill would remove that obstacle.  That is what it is for.  Sticking in a constraint about consultant-only prescribing is not based on any rationale.  It would not make things safer.  It would only serve to restrict treatment.  It would also put work on consultants in the same way that the Minister is trying to approve everything at present.  We would be trying to get a small group of specialists to approve every recommendation for cannabis-based medicines.  It would just be a waste of their time and it is not necessary.  It is a restrictive move that has no other utility.  It is not required.</p></speech>

The cannabis regulatory authority will consist of regulators.  I am presuming some of them will have clinical and pharmacy experience and so on.  Doctors who want to prescribe and recommend cannabis to their patients will just need to train in it and that training should be available here.  This is a constant element of working in medicine.  When we want to upgrade our skills we just get training.  We read a book or journal or go to a lecture, course or conference.</p><p>We do whatever is necessary to acquire the level of knowledge and when we feel we have enough knowledge and we have conferred with our colleagues, we practise.

She completely misrepresented my view but that is for another day.</p><p>I would like to respond to Senator Mullen.  I am a Deputy and I come from a certain political persuasion.  In my eyes, everything is political.  When I get up in the morning, it is political and when I go to sleep, it is political.  That is just the reality of things.  The reason I got involved and put the Bill forward is simple and objective.  Families approached me before I became a Member to ask me if I would champion the idea of medicinal cannabis use if I was elected.  I said I would and I was true to my word.  When I met Vera Twomey in Leinster House last May with her husband, Paul, she outlined her circumstances and one would want to have a heart of stone not to say there is something dramatically wrong with a mother being unable to legally access medicine for her child.  Surely that is immoral.  I was driven by that and I will always be driven by that.  For the many people who could benefit from medicinal cannabis, I will always be driven by their hidden suffering and how they could benefit.  That is my bottom line in being in this building and in getting up in the morning.</p><p>I have no doubt the Bill could have a major benefit for countless people and this is my driving force.  The Bill is not perfect by any means and I am the first to acknowledge that.  There are many reservations about cannabis use and I am educating myself.  This time last year, I had little knowledge about cannabis.  What I knew about it was elementary but I have come to know the science to a limited extent and to know about the people who could benefit.  Many people could benefit.  I refer to the likes of Vera Twomey and the countless others who could benefit.  What drives a women to talk nine days between Mallow and Dublin?  It is the circumstances in which she wants to get medicine for her child.  The Senator should put himself in her shoes.  I would do the exact the same as Vera.  You would do anything for your child.  I am taking the emotion out of this and putting the politics and the science in it.  People should have access in the 21st century to medicinal cannabis.  Many other countries are beginning to put programmes in place.  There are issues with the medical profession in this country, which is cautious.  <i>The Irish Times</i>reported in an article before Christmas that 56% of GPs favour medicinal cannabis use.  I understand the profession is a broad church.  Elements of the profession are probably completely against it, which is fair enough.  Members of this committee are probably completely against it but the reason we are here is to stop the suffering of people who could benefit from medicinal cannabis.  That is my sole purpose in putting this Bill forward.</p></speech>

It has been stated that there is evidence that where medicinal cannabis is made available, it has an impact on the use of other drugs and there is some evidence that use of benzodiazepines, opiates and so on has reduced where that is the case.  Do the companies that manufacture those products feel threatened by medicinal cannabis being made available and potentially substituting for their products given there is evidence that such substitution is happening?</p></speech>

I am not a member of a political party.  I have no association or relationship with any member of the People Before Profit Alliance.  I have been invited in my capacity as a professor of pharmacology at NUIG, president of the Irish Pain Society and as somebody who has worked on cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system for 16 years in the UK and Ireland.  My main motivation is to inform the debate as best I can and provide evidence-based input into the debate.  A question was asked about my research funding.  I have had funding from Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board, the International Association for the Study of Pain, other charitable organisations and peer-reviewed grant agencies.  This is peer-reviewed grant funding from the Government and other agencies around the world primarily for basic science research, much of which has been around cannabinoids and pain.<br/><br/>There was a question about my peers and where they stand on the issue.  It is a complex question and, therefore, there is not absolute consensus.  It may depend on which body of peers one looks to.  A paper was published in the <i>Harm Reduction Journal</i>, by Crowley <i>et al</i>, earlier this year.  It was a survey of Irish GPs and the finding was that a majority are supportive of a move towards authorisation or legalisation of cannabis for medical use and the figure increases if they have additional training in dependency or addiction.<br/><br/>I am president of the Irish Pain Society.  The society represents the health professionals who study, research, education and manage pain.  Our executive committee released a statement recently in which we came out in support of the inclusion of chronic pain as a fourth indication.  The HPRA recommended three indications - spasticity in MS, chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, and epilepsy.  The executive committee feels there is a sufficient body of evidence and a significant unmet clinical need to justify inclusion of chronic pain as a fourth indication.  A paper was also published in <i>The Journal of Pain,</i>which is the primary journal of the American Pain Society, which also supports the use of medicinal cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic pain.</p><p>There is a really excellent review by the National Academies of Medicine in the USA, McCormick <i>et al</i>.  It is hundreds of pages long.  It is an outstanding review and was published in 2017.  That review is authored by many leading experts in the world in cannabinoids and cannabis-based medicine.  They conclude that there is a body of evidence in support of medical cannabis for some indications but not for others.  By and large, those indications reflect and concur with the indications supported by the HPRA, but, importantly, chronic pain is one for which the National Academies of Medicine review says there is a substantial body of evidence.  A number of my peers in the cannabinoid field and members of the International Cannabinoid Research Society co-authored that report.<br/><br/>There are at least two world bodies that meet and comprise experts in cannabinoids, cannabinoid science and cannabinoid medicine.  These are the International Cannabinoid Research Society, ICRS, of which I am a member, and the International Association for Cannabis as Medicine.  In terms of where could doctors go for their continuing professional development and to find information, I guess they could go to those annual conferences.  Those are excellent conferences and they would be a forum to provide continual professional development for doctors and health professionals.  They would not be the only source of such information but they would be good sources of that information.<br/><br/>There was a question around the formulations and tablets versus drops versus smoking versus vaping.  All of these exist and they are possibilities.  One of the complexities is that there are so many different potential formulations and routes of administration, some of which have been researched more than others.  There is a formulation which has been approved by the HPRA.  I referred to it earlier.  It is nabiximols or Sativex, which is a oromucosal sublingual spray in an ethanolic suspension.  Then there is dronabinol and nabilone, which are, I believe, capsules or tablets, as well.  Certainly, I would feel that smoking is not the best way to go.  There are risks of bronchitis and, potentially, lung cancer.  Vaping is probably safer than smoking.  Drops and oils are another option which has been studied, and probably have a more favourable side effect profile, at least in terms of bronchitis, versus smoking.<br/><br/>On the question of research, I am a researcher and an educator.  I absolutely support the need for further research.  That was a strong statement in the HPRA report.  It was nice to see that the HPRA is supportive of trying to create a framework within Ireland to facilitate more research.  As a researcher, I would be supportive of that.  We certainly could do with more research.  I would feel that there is already - the systematic reviews and meta-analysis, particularly on chronic pain, that I cited earlier - a strong body of evidence in support of medical cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic pain and that has moderate to strong efficacy, depending on the study and the type of pain.<br/><br/>I agree one can always have more research.  Two of the limitations perhaps are that some of the studies done are relatively short term and more long-term studies would be useful, and-----</p></speech>

If that is what I understood Dr. O'Grady to say, does Professor Finn agree with that?  Is Professor Finn limited in his capacity to do research because of the legal status of cannabis?</p></speech>

I believe that a process could be put in place and a framework, perhaps to allow for some types of research in the absence of a broader legalisation for medical use.  Maybe the type of research that could not take place unless it was a broader type of legalisation would be population-based research.  Perhaps researchers could do focused and well-defined studies on a small number of patients, if we were granted a licence just for research.  That probably could happen.  I am not an expert in the law on that but I would feel that there probably would be a way to achieve that.  The type of research that looks at population-based effects and the use of cannabinoids or medical cannabis in a larger group of patients across different parts of the country or across the country as a whole probably could not take place.</p> <p>  I was talking about two limitations of the research.  At present, one would be the short-term nature of the studies.  I suppose population-based research gets at that a bit better.  The other limitation would be that some of the studies have used relatively low N-numbers, that is, low sample sizes.  If we are to do studies that include a significant number of patients and a big enough sample size, population-based research can help to achieve that as well.  It depends on the type of research that one is talking about.</p></speech>

I find that odd.  Does Professor Finn?</p> <p>  I have a supplementary question on the comparison between cannabis and other products for pain and conditions for which cannabis may be, or is evidentially, beneficial and how the two are treated in law and in this debate.  Has Professor Finn a comment on this matter?  Would it be fair to say that almost all, or certainly the vast majority, of approved drugs for pain and almost every other condition have significant, even severe, side effects in some or a large number of cases, yet they are authorised nonetheless?  Is there evidence to suggest that any of those side effects is more dangerous in cannabis than drugs that are currently available over the counter or on prescription?  Would Professor Finn go so far as to say that the evidence suggests that, while cannabis has some side effects, they are generally not as severe or dangerous?</p></speech>

That is the bud form, the oil form, etc.</p><p>As has been mentioned a number of times, the HPRA stipulated three conditions in its report.  As far as I know, the medications that have been stipulated for the two conditions in question are Sativex and Epidiolex.  That is like fast-tracking a pharmaceutical brand, and I have many problems with that.</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about replacing other harmful drugs.  It has been found in the US that, since medicinal cannabis has become a treatment, the use of opiates has decreased, as has the number of deaths.  Pharmaceutical companies have a major problem with that.  According to a report in <i>The</i><i>Guardian</i>last November, the makers of Vicodin and OxyContin were prominent financial supporters of anti-cannabis lobbies and projects because sales of drugs, which were harmful, had decreased dramatically due to being replaced by medicinal cannabis.  That can only be a good thing.  Some opiates are extremely addictive and can be harmful or lead to death.</p></speech>

I was surprised.  Given the meta-analysis and systematic reviews that have been published, including the Barnes report, which we have discussed, but also papers from Whiting <i>et al.</i>, Hill <i>et al</i>. and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, pain is the condition that has been most studied in terms of cannabinoids.  A substantial body of evidence suggests moderate efficacy or, depending on the study and the condition, better-than-moderate efficacy in some cases.  It is a pity that chronic pain was omitted.  The HPRA gave four reasons for doing that and the Irish Pain Society's statement examined and commented on them.  I will run through the commentary quickly.<br/><br/>The first reason was that the causes of chronic pain are diverse and that a suitable patient population or clinical indication for treatment with cannabis cannot be defined due to the complexity and variety of chronic pain syndromes.  We have learned quite a lot in the past 15 or 20 years about the mechanisms and causes of chronic pain.  Central sensitisation and peripheral sensitisation are well recognised as the neurobiological bases for chronic pain.  As has been shown in many studies, cannabinoids work to reduce these two mechanisms.  The clinical research to which I alluded have shown that cannabinoids have moderate-to-significant efficacy in terms of chronic pain, including neuropathic and cancer pain.  Sativex has been licensed in Canada for neuropathic pain in MS and for cancer pain, so there is a precedent for that type of drug, namely, a cannabinoid medicine that has passed the usual hurdles that a medicine must jump over in order to be authorised for chronic pain.  In other jurisdictions that have authorised medical cannabis, its primary use is for chronic pain.  In Colorado, 84% or 90% of patients reported their main reason for using medical cannabis as being chronic pain.<br/><br/>The second reason in the HPRA's report was &quot;physical, emotional, social, spiritual and other subjective factors inform the individual pain experience, making it difficult for a doctor to objectively assess the effectiveness of treatment&quot;.  The complexity of a disease is not a reason to avoid treatment.  A pain consultant would be able to assess the effectiveness of a treatment.  Otherwise, how could we justify prescribing any drug for chronic pain if doctors were not able to assess their efficacy?  The efficacy of cannabis and cannabinoids could be assessed.<br/><br/>The third reason was that there was &quot;a large number of authorised medicines that are of proven effectiveness, and other non-pharmacological treatments available to treat the many factors involved in chronic pain&quot;.  This is true.  There are many other analgesic drugs for and non-pharmacological approaches to the treatment of pain, but we cannot ignore the fact that one in five people in Europe suffer from chronic pain.  In Ireland, the figure is approximately the same.  Depending on the study, it is between 13% and 35% of patients.  This is the case despite the availability of other treatments.  The largest study ever carried out on this matter in Europe involved 46,000 patients.</p><p>The study, Survey of chronic pain in Europe: Prevalence, impact on daily life, and treatment, by H. Breivik <i>et al</i>, showed that 40% of chronic pain patients said that their pain was inadequately managed by current treatments.  This illustrates that there is a massive unmet clinical need here.  Existing drugs are working well for some patients but they are not working well for all.  That may be because of lack of efficacy or unacceptably high levels of side effects.<br/><br/>The fourth reason the HPRA gave was that chronic pain is common and the potential use of cannabis-based medicines by a large number of patients raises concerns about misuse and diversion into the wider community.  I understand those concerns but when we look at countries that have introduced medical cannabis, we can see that there is no significant evidence that this has led to diversion and misuse or to an increase in the overall recreational use of cannabis.  The other point is that those concerns about diversion and misuse are not unique to cannabis and cannabinoids.  They certainly apply to opoids and benzodiazepines.  Opoids involve a greater dependence liability and probably present a greater harm to the individual and society overall than cannabis and cannabinoids.  This addresses Deputy Boyd Barrett's question.  It is very difficult to objectively compare side effects of one class of drugs with those of another.  It is hard for me or anyone else to say whether one is worse than the other.  Certainly, the risk of overdose with opoids and benzodiazepines is significantly higher than for cannabis.  There are very few, if any, documented cases of fatality due to cannabis overdose.  The dependence liability relating to cannabis is generally thought to be less than that of opoids.  Depending on the study, the percentage of people who use opoids for chronic pain and who become dependent on them is around 3% but it could be as high as 10%.  The risk of overdose also exists.  Does that answer the questions?</p></speech>

I do not have any vested interest one way or another.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned pain, which is the crucial and most significant element in this debate.  Having had a condition that involved a lot of pain and having been referred to pain management in the past, I can speak with some experience.  One of the things I discovered was that management of the pain does not necessarily treat the cause of the pain.  My question follows from that.  To what extent did the witnesses's research go into the cause of the various forms of pain and the treatment of those conditions?</p> <p>  I am also talking about severe pain - the kind that involves contraction of the muscles, the clenching and breaking of teeth and a series of frightening degenerative effects.  People have different pain thresholds so when a person with a high pain threshold reaches to that stage, it is getting serious and they will do virtually anything to alleviate the pain, including beating their head off a wall.  I looked at all the options and discovered a person who told me that treating the condition that caused the pain was the most important thing and that individual was right.  That is only my personal experience.  I am fully aware that it does not apply to everybody.  I put that out there as a particular experience and would be very conscious of people with conditions that involve severe pain as a result of those conditions, be they children or adults.  It is an appalling situation to be in and something we need to spend far more time dealing with in order to get to grips with it.  I am not in any way dismissing the rest of the argument.  I emphasise that point and I want to know as much about the research into that area as possible.</p> <p>  The HPRA has advised against what is proposed, with the exception of a limited number of conditions.  The only exceptions are where the consultant and the GP are involved and approve, on prescription, with full authority.  The reason for that is simple.  If we do not do that, a serious problem exists and there is a liability.  Who accepts liability?  If one or other of those people is removed from the chain of command, and we say it is not going to work in every case, who will accept responsibility in the event of there being a serious liability and from where will the insurance to cover that liability come?  Will the liability be so serious as to deter the provision of insurance cover and could it proceed without cover?  I am talking about matters relating to the State as well.</p> <p>  The general idea would be to protect the patient as much as possible.  Is that accepted in so far as the witnesses are concerned?  Is it agreed that the patient's interests, not ancillary issues or advice, are the most important considerations?  Will the lifting of the ban, for want of a better description, protect the doctor or consultant?  Do the witnesses envisage changes that will protect the doctor, consultant or whichever person prescribes?</p> <p>  Could the patient have grounds to ignore the advice of the consultant?  That is a serious question.  Could evidence the witnesses might put forward be of such a nature that the patient or the patient's relatives feel it necessary, advisable or possible to ignore the advice of the conventional medical consultants and, as a result, bypass the GP and consultant and operate on the basis of a licence?  To what extent will that licence protect the patient, those prescribing or providing the drug or both, as well as the State, in the event of there being a claim?</p> <p>  In respect of insurance cover and in the event of a conflict, we have the HPRA on one hand and the removal of the ban on a particular product on the other.  Who protects the patient, society and the State in the event of a conflict?  The witnesses say that this is no worse than any other drug, that the procedure is no worse than any other and that it is hugely helpful in respect of particular conditions.  We know that and the HPRA has said it as well, but it has also specified instances where it should not be utilised under any circumstances.  It has also drawn attention to the limited access in other countries in Europe and the rest of the world.  I know the witnesses will tell me that this has been very effective in the US.  I am going through a hiatus in respect of the US.  I do not think it necessary to follow all the experience the US has had in recent times.</p><p> Am I correct in stating that cannabis-based products are already available and in use?  I think there are two.</p></speech>

It also indicated that the products were beneficial.  A patient who had used cannabis oil came into my clinic last week and she was not dramatically different from the way she was the week before.  It is claimed by the HPRA that the four cannabis-based products are as effective for certain conditions as what are in the Deputy's proposal.</p> <p>  I have already raised the issue of a licence versus prescription and would like to know which option we would be better relying on in the future.  I have also covered alternative drugs, which are available and can have a similar effect.  The side effects have been covered by various people and I accept that there are side effects with every drug.  The fear among some people is that, given the association of cannabis with illegal drug activity, we might be attempting to legalise it by the back door.  I know that is not the intention of Professor Finn or Deputy Kenny but it would not promote the product very well if other people saw it as a means of introducing a banned drug for general use.  We want to see a distinct barrier between that use and its use for medicinal purposes.  In the absence of meeting those criteria, the Bill needs to be looked at in considerably more detail and with much more research. </p></speech>

Does it mean a medicine in the conventional sense of the word?  Does he define cannabis as a medicine?  Cannabis is a whole-plant product and has up to 170 different components.  How can one define what cannabis means in that context?  Much of the Bill refers to herbal cannabis and to selling cannabis by the ounce.  I presume this refers to tobacco cannabis.</p></speech>

Can the Deputy comment on that?</p><p>If pure, synthetic components of the cannabis plant, CBD and THC, could be developed, would that satisfy the provision of medicinal cannabis as a product, as opposed to providing the plant extract in its own right?

As for whether both are mixed up at times, the answer is "Yes", and sometimes it is very difficult to differentiate in the debate.  I regard "medicinal" as meaning the extract from the full plant and that is how I define cannabis.  I regard it as the organic cannabis plant and its derivatives, of which there are over 700.  The two most known of these are CBD and THC and CBD oil is perfectly legal in this country, though if it has over 0.2% of THC it is deemed illegal.  People who want to use cannabis to treat their condition want an element of THC.  They do not, however, want to get stoned.</p></speech>

The specific sections the Chairman has mentioned state that if there is a research institute, that research institute would look into both the medicinal and recreational use and would look at research being done in both of those areas in other countries.  It is important to say that.  We could have a debate on Committee Stage as to whether the research institute should look into recreational use at all.  Certainly, there will be debate outside.  Professor Finn might have an opinion on that.</p></speech>

My reading of that was that the research institute would research the possibility of diversion or recreational use around the medical use of cannabis in Ireland.  It would look at whether diversion was happening.  I believe it should do that.  That is a really important question.  If we are to take steps to legalise medical cannabis, someone should look at whether recreational use is increasing or decreasing as a consequence.  I am not sure if that is what was intended.</p></speech>

There could be a guy there who does not have one who is using it for recreational purposes.  He is just having fun he is just getting a high for himself when the alleviation of pain is a serious issue for other people.  I do not agree with that at all.

It is highly illegal for anybody to have possession of methadone that is not prescribed and given out under controlled conditions by pharmacies.  Is it enforced well?  How is it enforced?  We know there is leakage with methadone that gets sold on in the black market and so on.  That could be just as easily applied.  It would probably be a more serious proposition to say we need better enforcement of that.  Nonetheless that happens now with methadone.  I believe we should not create a higher bar for medicinal cannabis, which can help sufferers, than we would provide for methadone, which is being done currently.  Why provide a higher bar?</p></speech>

For that reason a new product, which I have mentioned to the Chairman, is now available which will in fact correct that.  It breaks the habit-forming urge that is there.  I presume that will be examined by the HPRA in due course, if it has not been done already.  Its purpose is to limit this recreational use.</p></speech>

Of course, for many chronic pain patients, the root cause may be known.  It may be rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, an accident or post-operative pain.  Where possible, the best approach is to try to address the root cause, modify the underlying disease and have a disease-modifying approach to the treatment of the pain.  However, for a great many chronic pain patients the root cause is not known, particularly for neuropathic pain patients, for example, where there is no underlying disease, incident or accident to which that pain can be traced back.  That type of pain, particularly neuropathic pain, is really difficult to treat and it is refractory to many of our current medications.  There is some evidence that cannabinoids may be helpful to a subset of those patients.</p> <p>  Is it disease-modifying?  That is debatable.  We know that the root cause of that type of pain is peripheral and central sensitisation, the increase in synaptic plasticity in the pain pathway, the strengthening of synaptic connectivity in the spinal cord and the brain.  There is good evidence that cannabinoids can reduce those things - they can reduce peripheral and central sensitisation.  Are cannabinoids and cannabis a panacea, a cure-all for everything?  Absolutely not.  It will not be suitable for every patient or even every chronic pain patient.</p><p>It could be an option for those patients who are refractory to current treatments, who do not do well on current treatments or who are experiencing unacceptably high numbers of side effects, perhaps from current treatments.  I would not recommend that anyone ignore the advice of his or her consultant.  I attach great importance to and emphasise the consultant's expertise.  I certainly recommend that all patients heed the advice of their consultant in this or any other arena.</p><p> Reference was made to one patient who did not respond well.  That does not surprise me.  I do not know anything about the patient in question or the type of cannabinoid product that was taken.  Whether someone will respond or not depends on many factors.  It depends on the type of patient, his or her medical history, the exact type of pain and the length of time for which it has been experienced, whether there are other comorbidities, and the type and exact composition of the cannabinoid being taken.  One must determine whether it is THC, cannabidiol or other constituents.  These factors need to be taken into account and known.  Of course, as scientists we cannot come to any conclusion based on low-end numbers and individual patients.  We must examine objectively the evidence in larger patient groups and studies.</p><p> Whether THC and cannabidiol themselves are enough or medical cannabis and the plant extract are needed is a big question.  There is some belief that there is an entourage effect with the plant.  What I mean by that is that the cannabinoids and constituents in the complex plant material may combine in some way that we do not yet fully understand to have a greater therapeutic benefit in certain indications - greater than just THC or cannabidiol on its own.  That is a subject for research.  More research is needed on that, for sure.  There is some evidence, however, that in some cases there can be a greater therapeutic benefit by virtue of having the complexity of the plant and the entourage effect versus just one or two of the molecules on their own.  I refer to the possibility that the molecules can interact so cannabidiol, which does not induce euphoria or the same types of psychoactive effects that THC induces, can attenuate and dial down some of the psychoactivity of THC.  That ratio is really important.</p><p> Regulation is key.  This is not for me and my expertise is not in legalities or how the Houses or Government would go about regulation, but I do believe regulation is very important.  It is a question of the extent.  Does one opt for continual monitoring to be able to know with certainty what patients are taking what products and what doctors are prescribing so they may be regulated tightly?</p></speech>

It is timely that we are meeting today to discuss regulations, controls and ultimately protecting the consumer.  I am joined by Mr. Mel O'Reilly of MDY Construction, who chairs the CIF building regulations committee, and Mr. Brian McKeown of MKN Property Group, who is vice chairman of that committee.  Mr. Shane Dempsey has joined us in the Visitors Gallery.</p> <p>  Today, the building industry is steadily increasing the level of new buildings and housing supply to meet the demands of the population after nearly a decade of inactivity.  The committee and our industry have a key role in ensuring the building regulation, control and consumer protection regime deliver quality construction and sustainable growth across the industry.  CIF represents about 1,350 construction companies across the economy and at the outset, I reaffirm CIF's commitment to the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, and other regulations targeted at delivering quality construction.  CIF played a positive role in the formulation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 because our members and the wider industry will ultimately benefit when these regulations are applied to all those operating within the industry.</p> <p>  The CSO calculates that there are 46,000 construction-related companies and about 46,000 self-employed people operating in the sector.  Even though we represent only a fraction of these companies, it is in our interest to ensure that there is a robust building regulation and controls system in place to ensure that only reputable builders can operate in the industry.  By 2014, we had seen numerous high-profile cases arising from building control issues during an unprecedented period of building activity.</p><p>The CIF believed that these highlighted the real need for a more robust building control regime.  We engaged extensively with the Department and other stakeholders, including the RIAI, SCSI, Engineers Ireland and ACEI, when the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were being formulated.<br/><br/>BCAR has introduced greater transparency, traceability and accountability across all companies in the construction industry.  A key issue CIF identified was the ineffective system of certification that applied prior to the economic collapse.  These opinions were often based on inspections of buildings after construction and with caveats to the opinions expressed offering little to no consumer protection.  Thankfully, this system has now changed.  BCAR now requires that competent builders and professionals work together to an inspection plan, with certification of compliance on completion for all stages of the construction process.  This has introduced significant discipline into every stage of the process from detailed design to ordering of materials to inspections and certification of relevant works as they progress and come to completion.  In addition, commencement notices must now be accompanied by outline plans and documentation; a certificate of compliance design; a certificate of compliance - undertaken by an assigned certifier who must be a registered architect, a registered building surveyor, or a chartered engineer; and a certificate of compliance undertaken by the builder confirming his competence and the competence of his team.  The builder must also undertake to construct the works in accordance with the plans and specifications supplied; co-operate with the inspections carried out; and certify the works comply with the building regulations.  Before works or a building can be opened, occupied or used, a valid certificate of compliance on completion must be included on the statutory register maintained by the relevant building control authority.  The builder and the assigned certifier must sign this document and it must be accompanied by the inspection plan as implemented by the assigned certifier.  It is, therefore, safe to say there is a much more rigorous certification process at each stage of construction for new construction in the State.<br/><br/>To further embed these practices throughout the entire construction industry, the CIF, in conjunction with the Department, developed the register of builders Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI.  CIRI has a high threshold for quality that will essentially exclude inexperienced or <i>ad hoc</i>builders securing registration.  This will mean consumers can seek out builders on the register to carry out works.  CIRI reinforces the building regulations and drives standards by showing the consumer which builders are up to the required standards.  I ask the committee for its support for the introduction of CIRI on a statutory footing.  CIRI has an independent board including a chairman and ten members to assess the eligibility of applicants for registration.  The chairman of this board is appointed with the consent of the Minister for Housing Planning Community and Local Government.  Departments and agencies appoint five other board members - two are registered professionals while the remaining three are representatives of building contractors, house builders and specialist contractors.  CIRI registration will be contingent on compliance with building regulations, track record, financial standing, current level of expertise and competence on a category basis, etc.<br/><br/>To further ensure standards are adopted across all the industry, the Government should legislate in order that self-builders cannot opt out of BCAR requirements for one-off houses.  Considering that up to 50% of building activity since 2014 has been one-off, we cannot understand the decision to create an opt-out provision for BCAR at that time.  The opt-out provision means that these builders do not need to appoint designers, competent builders and assigned certifiers, nor is there any requirement for development of an inspection plan.  This is unacceptable.  I will not be popular for stating this, but all one-off builders should be subject to the standards set out in BCAR.  There must be a level playing field in respect of regulation if the consumer is to be truly protected.<br/><br/>The CIF fully supports the implementation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 as an effective tool to protect consumers and ensure compliance with the building regulations.  Further legislation is now required to put CIRI on a statutory basis.  This will provide the mechanism for assessment of builders&rsquo; competence and experience for registration, and also provide a means to penalise registered builders where breach of obligations under building control arises.  This can include removal from the register.  I reaffirm our commitment to standards in the industry and will work with the wider breadth of stakeholders to ensure our building regulations stimulate sustainable quality construction for the consumer.</p></speech>

The title of my thesis is "Consumer remedies for defective dwellings: devising a model for effective redress", for which I have been awarded a scholarship by the Irish Research Council, supported by the Housing Agency and Dublin City Council.  I was in practice as a solicitor for 14 years before starting a PhD at Reddy Charlton Solicitors here in Dublin and as in-house counsel at London Underground, in each case specialising in construction law.</p> <p>  I would like to provide a synopsis of my submission for the benefit of the members, following which I am happy to take questions.  Numerous housing defects have come to light in Ireland in recent years, which have highlighted the lack of effective, accessible legal remedies under domestic  law.  Speaking as someone who has examined the legal context for these housing failures in detail over the past four years, I have grave concerns that Ireland will embark upon a major programme of building homes without considering lessons learned, and without improving legal remedies for home owners.  My submission, and the preliminary recommendations emerging from my research are grouped under the themes of reform, remedies, and regulation and I will briefly address each.  I will use the term "home" to include both houses and apartments.</p> <p>  Irish law is stacked against home owners who discover defects.  We are all familiar with the stories of warranty policies that failed to provide the cover that home buyers expected, and with the problem of widespread insolvencies in the construction industry which left many home buyers who no-one to pursue for defects.</p> <p>  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which were mentioned in detail by Mr. Fitzpatrick, with their requirements for periodic inspections and certification by those involved in construction, have undoubtedly contributed to a cultural change in compliance with regulations, but they did not address the underlying problems of Irish law and practice that left people without legal remedies.  Irish law is unclear in a number of important respects with regard to remedies for building defects.  The relationship between sellers and buyers of new houses in Ireland is contained in two contracts: a contract for sale of the land or a lease in the case of an apartments, and a building agreement, usually in the form of the building agreement agreed between the Law Society and the CIF in 1987.</p> <p>  That agreement is entered into with the first purchaser of a home, who is the only person who may sue under that contract.  It is drafted on the basis that it will be signed under seal, for which the period for bringing proceedings is 12 years from the date of breach of contract.  The agreement contains a warranty in favour of the buyer but if the home is sold during that 12-year period, the agreement does not transfer with the house, and the benefit of the warranty is lost.</p> <p>  I mention in my submission the statutory duty in English law for builders to carry out their work in a workmanlike manner with proper materials in order that the house is fit to live in when completed; this duty is owed to the first and subsequent purchasers.  I also refer to the law of New South Wales, which implies warranties into contracts for building work, which also pass to subsequent purchasers.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act of 1980 implies a term that a provider of services, which would include a builder, will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence, using materials that are sound and reasonably fit for purpose.  This is an important protection, but the term also remains with the building agreement and, therefore, the first purchaser of a home if the home is sold during the 12-year period.</p> <p>  In Ireland, a second purchaser may be able to rely on a defects insurance policy, which should transfer with the property, but which will be subject to various exclusions and limitations.  Defects policies have an essential role to play, but will often provide substantially less protection than the first buyer would have had by law.</p> <p>  Another problem is that an action may also be statute-barred before an owner has had the opportunity to identify and investigate a defect in their home.  The Law Reform Commission recommended a change in law to deal with this in a 2011 report in order that time for bringing proceedings would start once the owner knew or ought to have known of the defect, but this has not been implemented.  Even where the standard building agreement is used, solicitors acting for builders may include unfair terms in the agreement.  In the past these terms have included limiting the buyer to one snag list, imposing short timescales for snagging, and allowing the builder to change materials, specifications and even dimensions of a site or building after the contract is signed.  The High Court banned the use of a number of sample terms in 2001, but this was still a problem as recently as 2016.</p><p>Legislation could be introduced to provide for minimum mandatory terms that would apply in all contracts for residential building work and that would pass automatically to subsequent purchasers.</p><p> These problems are not new.  The Law Reform Commission described them in 1977 and again in 1982 in a report that included the defective premises Bill.  The Bill includes a statutory duty on a person undertaking or executing work in favour of the person who commissioned the work and any person who acquires an interest in it &ndash; for instance, the second purchaser in my original example - to ensure the work was undertaken in a good and workmanlike manner with suitable and proper materials.  The Bill never passed into law.</p><p> The Law Society of Ireland building agreement also contains an arbitration clause.  Recent research suggests that many consumers have little understanding of the effect of an arbitration clause.  In parts of Australia, arbitration clauses may not be included in building agreements with consumers.  Arbitration can be a daunting, costly and time-consuming process for a home owner.  The same can be said of bringing proceedings through the courts.</p><p> Cost-effective and accessible remedies are an essential part of housing quality.  Even if compliance with building regulations has improved dramatically following the 2014 regulations, some percentage of new homes will have defects.  Remedies are essential when defects emerge.</p><p> A review should be carried out of the operation to date of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, as well as the resourcing and enforcement activities of building control authorities.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland provides a model for a transparent regulatory system.  Under that system, the authority publishes annual reports and significant amounts of information on enforcement activities.  This is not done by building control authorities in Ireland in general.  Little information is available in respect of their activities.</p><p> I suggest that an Irish building authority be established to administer building control on a nationwide basis.  A single national building inspectorate service was part of the programme for Government in 2011.  The infrastructure is in place with the building control management system, which is a national system for lodgement of certificates and other documents required under the building control regulations.  The authority could monitor local inspection and enforcement of building control, serve as a hub of knowledge gathered from throughout the country from building control activity and have a regulatory role in licensing those involved in construction.</p><p> I will conclude with a quotation from the Law Reform Commission report of 1982.  It was made in response to the suggestion made at the time that increased protection for consumers would increase the cost of houses.  The Commission stated, "Economies achieved at the expense of defective building work were not in the interests of purchasers or lessees of houses."  Now that we have evidence of tens of millions of euro being been spent by the State and home owners to deal with housing failures, I suggest that the cost of ensuring quality housing and effective, accessible remedies for defects must be seen as an essential part of the cost of building homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon O'Boyle" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to contribute in respect of its review of building regulations, building controls and consumer protection.  In particular I have been asked to address the issues around fire safety within buildings and how they are detected, problems with past buildings and the procedures currently in place.  I hope I can assist the committee in its important work.</p> <p>  I am a chartered engineer.  I specialise in fire safety engineering.  I am managing director of a consulting engineering practice, Eamon O'Boyle and Associates, established in 2002.  Prior to establishing Eamon O'Boyle and Associates, I was the assistant chief fire officer in Dublin Fire Brigade and had responsibility for the administration and implementation of regulatory fire safety throughout the greater Dublin area.  I propose to address the issues I have been asked to address as follows: to discuss issues around fire safety; to discuss how deficiencies have been detected; to outline problems with past buildings; and to outline procedures now in place.</p> <p>  I will address issues around fire safety first.  Buildings are designed with in-built fire safety measures based on robust construction and properly designed services, for example, electrical services.  The fire design for buildings, other than houses, is approved by a building control authority by way of a fire safety certificate.  The major issue that has arisen is the failure to implement aspects of the design.  In buildings where there are interdependencies, for example, apartments, hospitals or office buildings, a fire in one area can affect another area not directly involved in the fire.</p> <p>  I have provided the committee with some photographs and sketches.  I will refer to these now.  They illustrate the typical deficiencies observed.  A key feature in these sketches is poor fire stopping.  By fire stopping, I mean the methods used to seal around openings in fire walls for the passage of pipes, wires or ducts.  Fire stopping also refers to the closing off of cavities to prevent the spread or smoke from one part of a building to another.  Image 1 on the screen is a photograph of pipes that go through a wall.  The photograph shows how easy it would be for fire or smoke to go from one part of a building to another.  The second photograph shows how this can happen as well.  Work has not been completed properly in the building in that photograph.  The third sketch shows the mechanism by which smoke can move from one part of a building to another.  The image on display shows an apartment at a lower level where there is a fire and how the fire can spread to an independent apartment located overhead.  It illustrates how the ingress of smoke occurs if fire stopping is not executed properly between the floors and around windows.</p> <p>  It is evident from these images that fire stopping is critical to fire safety within a building.  Another aspect of fire safety that needs to be addressed relates to active fire safety systems.  These are features designed to operate in the event of a fire or power failure.  Examples include fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting and sprinklers.</p> <p>  Fire safety management is another factor.  This concerns: ongoing maintenance of active systems; good housekeeping, for example, the removal of combustibles; ensuring the availability of fire exits; and the development of procedures relating to actions to be taken in the event of fire.  Passive fire protection is another factor.  This is developed to slow the spread of fire through use of fire-resistant walls, floors, and doors, among other examples.  An integral part of a passive fire safety system is referred to as fire stopping, an element to which I have referred already.</p> <p>  Active systems and fire safety management systems require ongoing monitoring to ensure appropriate maintenance and to guarantee appropriate actions are taken in the event of a fire.  On the other hand, passive systems are provided at construction stage and must be installed correctly to ensure effectiveness.  Fire stopping is generally concealed behind plasterboard or in door frames.  It is hidden before the building is used and deficiencies only become apparent during a fire survey, generally referred to as a fire risk assessment.  The absence of passive fire systems can also become apparent when a fire occurs - the most serious situation.  This is the key focus of this presentation.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, these deficiencies are detected by two methods.  The first becomes apparent during the outbreak of fire when heat or smoke travels from one part of a building and emerges in another.  This is shown in the diagram to which I referred earlier.  The other becomes apparent during what we term a fire risk assessment, which is usually undertaken by a fire engineer as part of a survey of the building.</p> <p>  Problems with past buildings relate to buildings constructed prior to the introduction of the BCAR system referred to by previous speakers.  In order to address these, we need to describe the regulatory system that applied previously as well as the extent to which it still applies.  Under the Building Control Act 1990, building regulations in respect of fire safety were introduced in June 1992.  At the same time, building control regulations were introduced.  These made it mandatory to make an application for a fire safety certificate.  A fire safety certificate application is assessed by a building control authority and is either granted, granted with conditions or refused.  The certificate states that if a building is constructed in accordance with the application, it will comply with the building regulations.  The application contains details of how compliance with the fire safety requirements of the building regulations is to be achieved.</p> <p>  Many of the high-profile cases that have appeared in the media and that have been witnessed by my company have had fire safety certificates granted, but the design, as described in the application, has not been complied with.  This is particularly true in the case of passive fire safety systems.  In my experience, some applicants are satisfied to have a fire safety certificate but do not understand the importance of compliance.  In many cases, the fire safety certificate is viewed as an administrative requirement and not as an important design safety document.  While many high-profile apartment buildings have received media attention, it is worth noting that office blocks, hospitals and other buildings may have been constructed with similar defects during the busy building period.</p> <p>  I will outline the procedures now in place.  Since the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, it is mandatory to appoint professionals to undertake inspections and provide certification that building regulations have been complied with.</p><p>While the BCAR system is still in its infancy, I am of the view that it will provide a mechanism where at the very least buildings are inspected at all stages during construction.  I also believe that it will provide a level of consumer protection and that it must remain under continuous review.</p><p> It is worthwhile examining the system that operates in the United Kingdom where codes and technical guidance are similar to those which apply in Ireland.  During the design phase in the United Kingdom developers or builders have the option of going to a local authority to have their designs approved or to use independent inspectors.  This contrasts with the Irish system where only the Building Control Authority, BCA, can approve a design or fire officers of the BCA in the case of fire safety.  Staff shortages may prolong decision periods which leads to frustration within the construction programme.  The builder or developer generally provides 24 hours notice to enable the local authority to inspect at these key stages.  Once all inspections are complete, the BCA provides a completion certificate for the building prior to occupation.  In contrast, in Ireland, that job has been effectively outsourced to the private sector by way of the BCAR which is used by qualified professionals.  </p><p> In summary, there are significant fire safety legacy issues associated with some of the building stock nationally.  It is possible to address these issues in a proportionate way by undertaking a national programme of fire risk assessments.  Priority should be given to buildings in which people reside or sleep and other buildings should be assessed on a risk basis.  This approach will take time but it is necessary as there is strong evidence that there are deficiencies and it is essential they are identified and remedial action taken in a planned and methodical manner based on risk and within an agreed timeframe.</p></speech>

By way of background, the reason for this hearing and the hearing next week is that several of us in respect of our constituencies but also through discussions in the committee are concerned that we need to better understand the new regulations and the important issues raised by cases that have gained a high media profile.  The purpose of these hearings is for the committee to issue a report to examine these issues and, if required, we will make proposals to Government for changes to legislation.</p> <p>  Most of us have had some dealings with the issues raised today.  The witnesses are the experts, which is why we invited them here.  </p> <p>  Do the witnesses think there has been enough time since the regulations changed in 2014 to assess whether they are adequate to fix the problems that existed prior to that date?  I am particularly interested in the content of the regulations but also in compliance because while there is a move to more inspection, and this is not to question the professional integrity of any those carrying out inspections, it is my sense that when it is outsourced someone is brought in who is not independent because he or she is being paid for that inspection and certification.  Is that the best regime we could have?  </p> <p>  While we know of the high profile cases, many of us know of constituents who hear that the neighbours have accidentally come across firestopping that was not done.  One does not just see that, one has to be renovating one's house to discover it.  They wonder should they check this themselves and, if so, what they will find and what will be their liability for rectifying those problems.  How widespread is the non-compliance although there are fire safety or other certificates?   If there is to be a national fire risk assessment programme even just to consider buildings that might pose a high risk because of the time they were built, that could be a big programme.  How would that roll out? </p> <p>  The committee is having a separate discussion and the Government is undertaking two pieces of research to find ways to bring down the cost of producing private sector units, in respect of building, compliance, land, financing and tax related costs.  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn mentioned this.  Many of us are keen to find a way to reduce the overall cost of producing units without in any way compromising standards and compliance with standards.  We would be interested in witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on whether there is a way to bring down the cost while also increasing standards and compliance. </p> <p>  The area we are most concerned about is what happens the homeowner who discovers the defect.  In cases I have been directly involved with, the clear impression is that unless the inspectors were able to find some way of negotiating outside the formal mechanisms with a developer who is still trading with a local authority, which may have had some involvement in the development, the cost for the homeowner can be very substantial.  Even for relatively small levels of firestopping it can be thousands of euro.  Consumer protection is the one aspect that is failing absolutely.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views in as much detail as they can give on what needs to be put in place, such as changes to defects insurance or other mechanisms.  If I buy a CD today and it is broken I will bring it back to the record store tomorrow and get a replacement.  Most people think it is the same for most things they buy.  A house is the single biggest purchase most people make in their lives yet they find when major defects are discovered, unless they are willing to take a civil action against somebody to fight it in the courts, they could be left with the full liability and risk.  The committee will want to come forward with suggestions on that.  </p> <p>  The purpose of this report is to offer solutions, not to lay blame, criticism or to play politics.  It is to set out solutions in the context of the forthcoming building control Bill, the heads, or a draft of which, the Minister says we should have before the end of this session.  I am interested in hearing, in as much detail as the witnesses can give, what they think needs to change in the primary legislation or in regulations on standards, compliance, consumer protections and remedies, or in terms of implementation and policy areas that might not require legislation or a change of emphasis by State agencies. </p></speech>

I have met several of them before.  I think Mr. Fitzpatrick was once my local county manager or assistant county manager.  I welcome their comments, particularly what Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn.  If I buy a property that is built by a member of Mr. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s association I presume that what I am getting is as permitted.  Instead of outsourcing the responsibility to Tom, Dick or Harry, whoever that might be, whether the local authority or the fire expert, all the liability should rest on the association or the professional who signs it for the association.</p><p>Part of that is how the membership is policed.  Has the witness ever kicked any member or any builder out of the Construction Industry Federation?  People would go to a member of that association in the belief that they would meet certain standards.  How does the witness exclude members from his association?  Has that ever been done?</p><p> It has been suggested that part of the solution is that builders should provide a significant fund available to meet scenarios where people avoid their responsibility or go bankrupt.  A builder can be here one day and gone the next.  The Construction Industry Federation should have a significant part to play in assuring and funding the things that have to be done.  </p><p> To return to the role of local authorities, I may be misquoting the witness but he said at the beginning that there was a lack of supervision during the boom.  Is that a fair summary of what was said?  It was implied that there was a lack of supervision during the construction period and that local authorities were not doing their job.  If that is what the witness said I would agree with that.  They were not doing their job.  Huge fees were charged for planning permission and yet, in terms of numbers, there was a total lack of professional people within the local authority to do the work that needed to be done.  Much of the infrastructure that was built above and below the ground was very poor.  As Eamon O'Boyle said, much of it is unknown but it is out there.  We do not know where it is.  The witness was suggesting a series of audits based on the perceived high risk of fire hazards, for example, in certain types of construction.  I would like to think that whatever report this committee comes up with would put the onus back on the Construction Industry Federation, and particularly the builders.  Where does the Construction Industry Federation stand on those matters, what is it doing about it, and what has been done up to now to protect consumers?  Most people who buy a house are in hock for the rest of their lives.  They buy innocently and in good faith, buying houses from planning permission.  In many cases that is exactly what they get, but in many cases they do not.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#E00300"><p>I will start and my two colleagues can join in, because quite a range of issues have been raised.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked if we have enough time to assess whether these regulations are adequate.  Certainly the culture within the industry has changed significantly since the beginning of the regulations, from design of the buildings to inspection plans to appointment of competent persons.  I am aware that there is a huge amount of resources employed to ensure compliance with the building regulations under the new regime.  We welcome that and fully support it.  We must ensure that we have buildings that are built to the proper regulations and standards and that can be stood over.</p> <p>  On the issue of consumer protection and what needs to be in place, we recognised four to five years ago that there were shortcomings attached to the previous certification process that was in place.  By and large the only certification required was post-completion.  It was based on visual inspection, in many places, of domestic buildings, and opinions on compliance were expressed at that juncture.  That was not satisfactory.  We fully supported the introduction of the new building control amendment regulations.  There is one piece missing at the moment.  We recognised that we require a register of competent builders, and that only builders with competence should be allowed to build structures in particular categories for where they had relevant experience.  At the time we set about developing what was called the construction industry register Ireland in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and that was included as one of the Government actions to be put on a statutory footing during the current Government.  We would hope that that register would be put on a statutory footing, that it would be mandatory for all builders to be on that register and that it would be an offence for them to build anything for which they are not registered.  The advantage of a register of that nature is that builders would have to ensure that they undergo continuous professional development to ensure that they are kept up to date with the changing regulations and standards that are introduced by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We would like to see that approved.</p> <p>  In terms of consumer protection, it is fair to say that the insurance policies that are now in place differ greatly from the warranty schemes that would have applied in the past.  The insurance policies now available includes first-party insurance cover, so that in the event of the claim the policy holder does not have to go through the builder any more but can go straight to the insurance company to remedy any defect which might be identified.  The policy in these situations attaches to the house or unit, and that would subsequently transfer to subsequent purchasers of that unit, so that if someone buys a house or an apartment the policy will be in their name, and if they sell that unit two or three years down the road the policy will transfer to subsequent owners of that unit so that they will have the benefit of that policy for its term, which is generally ten years.  The policy today covers defective workmanship, design and materials.  The previous materials were purely structural policies.  The policies offer much greater protection than before.  They offer protection from fire safety, dealing appropriately with radon, mechanical equipment and drainage.  Some of those policies can be for up to &euro;200,000, plus &euro;50,000 in respect of various plant and equipment.  Any purchaser of a new residential unit will insist on having that insurance policy because they will not be able to secure funding from their bank or building society for a mortgage.  Any of our members that are building new units for sale on the open market will insist on having that insurance policy in place, because if they do not they will not sell it.  In effect it is mandatory in the market place because funders will not advance mortgages without that cover.  </p> <p>  With regards the issues that Deputy O'Dowd raised, the buildings must be constructed in accordance with the permission.  When one is selling a building on has to ensure that there are certificates of compliance with planning issued at that particular stage.  In addition, under the new building control amendment regulations, BCAR, requirements the builder must give a certificate of compliance on completion that the building meets the building regulations.  The assigned certifier must also certify that the building has been built in accordance with the building regulations.  The building control authority has the ultimate power to refuse to register that building on the register, and no sale of a unit can or will take place unless that unit has been registered with the building control authority.  The measures are much stronger than they have been heretofore because there was no statutory requirement for any of these certificates in the past.  The insurance policy that is currently available in respect of all residential units does provide an adequate fund to ensure that various defects can be remedied and that people can gain direct access to the insurance company, which is a major change from what happened before. </p> <p>  With regards the role of the local authorities, certainly we would love to see the building control authorities resourced more effectively so that they have the adequate resources to carry out more inspections.  The industry is not fearful of inspections.  It supports more inspections.  The more inspections, the better.  Certainly the culture within the industry is much changed in terms of ensuring that products purchased for use in the buildings comply with the construction projects regulations and that all elements of the workmanship comply with the building regulations, and that there is an appropriate chain of responsibility established within the overall building process.  We want the construction industry register Ireland, CIRI, in place on a mandatory basis.  The current regime provides that a registered member should be capable of being removed from the register if he has breached the requirements of the building regulations.  Those penalties would be determined by the independently appointed registration board, who have teeth and make decisions on an independent basis.</p><p>I have covered a range of issues and my colleagues Mr. O'Reilly or Mr. McKeon might like to elaborate on some of those key points. </p></speech>

It has changed things on the ground but if we are to find any way of assessing that objectively then some more time would be needed.  Very few buildings have been completed and occupied over that period to give any kind of representative sample.  From a working building contractor on the ground - we build under contract rather than for sale - we can see that the whole regime has changed enormously by what is done at the start with design drawings etc., by the inspections of the ancillary certifiers as well as the assigned certifiers and by what we ourselves do in relation to inspections and the compilation of construction records.  There is a cultural change afoot in the industry and it is gaining momentum as time goes by.  There are, however, two issues; some more time would need to go by before it is fully right through the industry and - not to beat the drum again - we need some sort of statutory basis for the CIRI.  Measures are required to ensure only those who are building properly are allowed to continue to build.  This is essential.</p></speech>

Reference was made earlier to the assigned certifiers we take on.  We pay them but they can only be members of three institutions, the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, the Institution of Engineers of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  The certifiers also fall under codes of practice and ethics.  They take their job very seriously and there is no bending of the rules.  I can state quite categorically that they take their role very seriously.  They must sign documents prior to starting and sign the end document, with me as the builder, to say that the property is built in accordance with the building regulations.  Their professional indemnity insurance is on the line and their job is on the line, as is mine.  When the Construction Industry Regulations Ireland, CIRI, becomes statutory then if a person does not comply with the rules and regulations he or she would be removed from the CIRI and that is their livelihood gone.  That is the reality.  From a consumer point of view the quicker that comes into being the better because this industry will be a better industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#F00400"><p>I will go back to the first point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin around whether or not we have had enough time, since 2014, to assess the performance of the building control regulations.  The building control regulations are part of the regulatory regime that operates for construction in Ireland.  There are different elements to this regime.  The planning process is another part of it.  It is part of a regulatory regime.  Any process like this needs to be assessed for its effectiveness and needs to be tested and monitored.  As Mr. O'Boyle has said, it needs to be kept under review.  I believe that three years is certainly enough time to be able to find out from the building control authorities their view on how the building control regulations are working in practice.  There are a number of procedures referred to in the code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings from September of last year. These involve the building control authorities interacting with the building control management system, which is the online system for submission of documentation around building control.  Procedures are referred to in the code of practice whereby building control authorities, for example, can use the system to assess whether or not the assigned certifier has resigned from their role on a project.  This might indicate if there are difficulties on a project and it might prompt an inspection.  Part of what we should be looking at in building control is whether or not the regulatory model is fit for purpose.  Consider the model for the regulation of food safety - which is one model I like to refer to - and which operates in a relatively similar way to building control.  There are inspections happening all over the State on a regular basis and these are fed into a regulatory system that involves an audit and review of how effective the system is.  If one looks at the annual reports of local authorities from 2015, most of which are available online, one will find virtually no reference whatsoever to enforcement activities by building control authorities.  Usually there is quite a lot of detail about other types of enforcement activities, for example in relation to planning.  There is, however, very little information on building control.</p> <p>  I will make this general point, which is also referred to in the report of the UK's all-party parliamentary group for new housing in England, published in July last year.  The report consisted, essentially, of a review similar to the one being carried out by this committee.  That group heard evidence that many consumers do not really understand the roles of their local authority or building control.  From my research and from people I have spoken to I believe there is a lack of understanding about the limit of what the building control authority is able to do and how frequently building control inspections are carried out.  If we look at the annual reports of the local authorities some building control authorities are inspecting 12% to 15% , which is the target set in the code of practice.  Some are inspecting 50% of new buildings.  That information needs to be captured, aggregated on a national level and analysed.  The BCAR was such a substantial change in practice that it should absolutely be possible to assess performance, even though it may well be there are not defects or claims yet coming out from the system it set up.</p> <p>  I also wish to address Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question about what happens to owners who find defects.  Again I refer back to one of the observations of the UK all-party parliamentary group report that builders need to put consumers first.  Their primary focus should be on the consumer.  The report found there is a huge gap between what people think they are getting and in what they actually receive in practice in respect of warranties and the finish of their homes.   Consumer education is very important.  The point around effective redress  is made several times in that UK report and is also referred to in my submission along with timely, effective and cost effective dispute resolution to avoid arbitration and litigation. </p> <p> My final point is on defects insurance, which has an essential role to play.  I believe that a warranty from a builder should transfer with a new housing unit.  There was a case before the High Court, decided in 2016, with respect to a seriously defective house in Donegal.  It was a one-off build and I use it as an example of precisely the problem identified by Mr. Fitzpatrick where one-off houses were exempted from the requirements of building control in 2015.  This was a decision I disagreed with at the time and I still disagree with it.  One-off houses are just as likely, and no less likely, to have defects.  Much of our litigation has been in regard to one-off houses.  The house in Donegal had defects and in order to fix it the estimate put on the claim by the plaintiff's surveyor was &euro;277,000.  Even with the policy that might be in place today for that unit and if &euro;200,000 is the limit of the policy, who would pay the &euro;77,000? There must be a remedy in contract, alongside the defects policy.</p></speech>

It is not yet known.  I am an assigned certifier on some projects, but it has been very few to date because the building process has not happened.  I reflect what the other speakers have said and it is my sense that there has been a huge change of culture in building contractors and professionals.</p><p>The degree of detail required is now quite extensive in terms of the inspection plans and all the material that goes with them.  I will keep housing on one side and multiple housing, that is, apartments on the other.  In the case of the latter, there are interdependencies and one apartment is dependent on the other.  There are requirements to construct common spaces and they have to operate the way they should.  If one piece is missing it has an impact on everybody.</p><p> The question of associated costs was raised.  The building control regulations added to the costs, with the need for a signed certifier, ancillary certifiers and other people for various responsibilities.  My preference would be to have very good people doing the work.  Consumer protection is achieved by good people doing their jobs properly.  The CIRI is the way to go and there needs to be ongoing training not just for contractors, but for people who can contribute to fire stopping.  Fire stopping is important because it is like the airbag in a car - one does not know if it works until one crashes.  If it is not in place, there is a huge impact.</p><p> We were asked for solutions.  The BCAR system is operating well but refinements could take place.  I was involved in a project in Germany some time ago where the developer had to pay for the appointment of an independent inspector who was employed by the local authority, creating an arms-length arrangement which seemed to work pretty well.  I disagree with Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn on the need for a nationwide building control authority because when building control authorities make assessments on plans, they do so on the basis of local knowledge, which contrasts with the Food Safety Authority.  For example, a building would have a water supply for fire fighting and the local fire chief would know about it.  I do not think this could be dealt with nationally in the same way.  Dealing with things locally would be preferable.</p><p> Deputy O'Dowd asked about inspections that were carried out by local authorities.  There was a lack of professional staff in local authorities to undertake inspections and there was no oversight but the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations plugged the gap in one fell swoop.  Professionals carry out the work now, even though they are not employed by the local authorities, and there are substantial penalties for professionals who do not do their work well.  They cannot even occupy the building if they are not on the register.  I will leave the matters of sinking funds and money to my legal colleague.</p></speech>

There are different stages in building control and the competency of both the design and the builders is important.  However, CIRI is not just to be a register of builders but also one of specialist subcontractors.  Mr. Eamon O'Boyle said fire stopping was essential but it is not covered by a trade - it is done by people who are semi-skilled.  The objective of CIRI is to ensure that people who carry out these essential works are trained in the exercise of those activities.  In the longer term, the builder will be competent but he will also only employ competent contractors who are on the register.</p></speech>

It is sad that, since 2015, so many buildings have been affected.  There have been good buildings but there were, especially in the boom, many buildings that were not regulated by the local authority or others.  It is a massive issue.  There is a recommendation for more homes and fewer complaints, based on a model from England.  There are ten recommendations, one of which is to set up a new ombudsman for building and sales.  I am a firm believer that if a person has a home it is their home for life, their castle.  We have to make sure that the rules and regulations are enforced and that people who have homes feel secure in them.  Over the years there have been issues with fire safety and wheelchair accessibility, among other things, and I have seen apartments built with no light.  There might be a tiny window and I cannot understand how this was allowed to happen.  It is a bit too late now but we are where we are.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to build thousands of houses between now and 2021 and it is crucial that these buildings are regulated and controlled.</p> <p>  The biggest issue over the years was accountability.</p><p>There needs to be accountability for this.  In the future, once that is in place, people will have lovely homes and will be very happy in them.  I know of many cases over the years which I felt should never have been approved.  I would be concerned about the once-off housing as well.  There are still many concerns that need to be addressed but in future, everybody should be working in the interests of the homeowner and the builder.  There are definitely many issues that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

I was at many meetings about pyrite, mica and so on.  The witnesses mentioned a number of things about local authorities and more resources, including fire officers and such.  There is no doubt that we have many more problems.  I know we have a massive complex in Finglas, on the Finglas Road, where there are fire issues, as the witnesses are probably aware.  Fire-stopping is an area that the witnesses mentioned and in which we need more expertise and to have people on-site and giving advice.  We have seen it happen there.  We have also seen the mica issue in Donegal.  It has not been properly addressed, even now, and it is a massive issue.  I know Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn mentioned that the law is stacked against homeowners who discover defects.  The witnesses said this and I believe that is true at present.  There are still many issues there.  One of the issues the witnesses mentioned was the transfer of policies.  It makes sense that there should be some way to transfer those policies over.  Just because someone else gets a place should not change what a person is entitled to in those areas.</p> <p>  I have a concern about what the witnesses said on self-builds.  They mentioned that people can opt out of the building control amendment regulations, BCAR.  I do not know whether that is down to cost or something else.  The witnesses might be able give an explanation on what they mean by people being able to opt out.  I believe we should have the construction industry register Ireland, CIRI.  Some builders behaved very poorly indeed and in some cases, I consider the behaviour to have been criminal.  We cannot afford to have such builders and those people who were on site and who took part in some of this coming back.  Some of the construction I saw was just appalling and I went to many estates and had a good look at them.  The certificate of compliance has to be properly enforced.  We have to make sure that we have better standards than what we had before.  What happened in the past is just not good enough.</p> <p>  Foremen on sites was a big thing in the past.  That seems to have gone downhill for some reason.  We do not seem to have that emphasis.  We had fewer problems when we had foremen on sites.  I do not know if that is Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick's experience, but it is my experience that shortcuts were taken during the so-called boom.  That disappeared.  I also worry that, over the years, there were practically no prosecutions or actions taken against many of these builders.  We have seen all these things that have happened, all the bad building and some matters bordering on criminal, and yet we have never seen any real action taken against these people.  I do not know if the witnesses have opinions on that.</p> <p>  The last thing I want to mention is about quarries and builders and the defective materials that came from quarries and builders' suppliers.  I did not really hear any mention of that issue.  What is the opinion of the witnesses on that?  Is there a need for more controls in this regard?  Some very good controls were in place in the quarries in the south of the country but in the north of the country, where most of the issues of mica and pyrite arose, the quarries were a big problem and do not seem to have had the controls and proper mechanisms in place.  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinion on that too.</p></speech>

I am interested in this whole area of building control regulation and I believe we should be taking it entirely back into local authorities and should have an independent review and inspection regime.  I would like a comprehensive inspection regime of all the different stages of construction.  I still have concerns that the current BCAR is not doing exactly what it should be doing.  While more large-scale developments probably have the resources and skills behind them for assigned certification and auxiliary assigned certification, I do not believe smaller-scale projects would be as strong on the professional side of the regulation.</p> <p>  I refer to the other major issue with building regulation.  While we often talk about new builds, much renovation work is going on, extensions are being built and different work is being carried out in commercial buildings where no regulation is being realistically applied.  I think fire certification and disability certification have to be applied for and I think it stops there.  As a country, we need to educate the people in the value of building control regulation.  If we can do nothing else but have people understand it is worth paying that little bit extra for entirely independent inspection, I would be fully in favour of that.</p> <p>  I have several examples, even in my own business, which is the hotel game.  I can go back to a very small fire that we had back in the early 1990s, where we zoned fire panels, so we knew it was in a zone but that was a big zone and we had to suss it out.  We had a very small fire two years ago but what we had was able to tell us exactly that it was in room 133.  Huge advances have been made in fire detection.  I have serious concerns about any renovation work that is done where gaps are left in fire safety provision.  There is no inspection.  From my understanding, there is no inspection with regard to fire safety.  One gets a certificate after providing a drawing.  It stops there.  No fire officer goes out to ensure the information strips are on the door, the doors are closing properly, the sewer pipe going through the wall has been filled in, or to check whatever else.  That is not happening.  While we are saying the assigned certifier is signing off on it, I still have concerns about it.  I am putting my cards on the table.</p> <p>  I had one other constituent who moved into his house 17 years ago but had to move out seven years ago because of an issue.  It took seven years to discover what the problem was, and then it took him seven years more to go through the court system.  When he eventually got to the court, he was told that he was statute-barred.  He wasted &euro;37,000 on legal fees in bringing that case.  That was a simple case of the damp-proof course being placed too low, which allowed water to come into the building.  I believe, and will be urging my own party, which I think is coming with me, that we need a top-down, local authority approach to building control.  We need entirely independent inspection at all the different stages of the building construction industry, and we need to get the people behind us and to educate them in how valuable building control is to them.  Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick said that he would welcome extra resources being provided to the local authorities to allow this happen.  I want to ask him whether he would agree that the best place for building control may be with the local authority with a move away from assigned certification and design teams.  There are also the smaller developments where the owner of the property has to sign off on a design team and assigned certifications and would have no knowledge of the building industry at all.</p> <p>  Drawings are going in through the BCAR system and I honestly believe that nobody is looking at them.  Very few people are looking at construction drawings.  I wonder how many developments are actually starting based on planning drawings as opposed to construction drawings.  I am concerned that construction drawings are never drawn up for one-off rural houses.  I have probably said enough at this stage.  I call Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick.</p></speech>

We need full accountability in this regard.  Deputy Casey asked how many developments start with planning drawings.  No development should do so.  Under the new building control system, one must submit construction drawings.  I share the Deputy's view that many one-off houses may be built on planning drawings which is totally unacceptable.  Detailed construction drawings need to be prepared in for all builds.</p> <p>  Should building control regulation rest with the local authority?  The current system provides for assigned certifiers to be appointed from within the registered architect, the registered building surveyor and the chartered engineer.  It has the potential to work very effectively.  The resources of the building control authority should be increased to ensure that they have greater monitoring and enforcement powers.  The system can work well.  </p> <p>  The problem that arose 17 years ago is an example of what was often the case when we did not have adequate supervision and inspection of buildings built.  I hope that that would not happen today.  An assigned certifier would ensure at the outset that the damp-proofing is put in at the right area.  That is a critical part of any inspection.  </p> <p>  We need to educate the public about the value of building control.  Many people building one-off houses in particular do not appreciate the value of the current Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and the necessity to have a professional come in and certify compliance with the building regulations.  It is for that reason that the opt-out option for people building one-off houses should be removed.  These builds should be brought back into full compliance with building control as it is for all other developments.</p> <p>  Any development or renovation works which require a fire certificate will require compliance with the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.  That should require the appointment of an assigned certifier and a competent builder to undertake those works.  If that is being policed effectively, any work, such as the fire certificate, should be fully in compliance with the building regulations.  That would address some of those issues.</p> <p>  Some self-builders are opting out because they are of the view that the cost of compliance with building control is a lot greater than it is.  It was said it could cost &euro;15,000 to comply with Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.  According to our information, the real cost of compliance with the regulations could be closer to &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 per assigned certifier.  Everybody should have an obligation to prepare detailed construction drawings for anything that they are building.</p> <p>  I will let my colleagues come in with regard to accountability, foremen on site and issues of that nature.</p></speech>

Over the past few years, there is more onus on employers to educate and to keep educating our foremen and engineers and so on.  There are more courses available.  Many younger foremen have been told in college to insist on receiving annual continuing professional development as part of their agreement.  There are more courses run by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and Engineers Ireland to which we send our people responsible for building and complying with regulations and drawings and specifications.  It is better now than it ever was before.</p> <p>  Builders phone quarries and builders providers in good faith and order material.  We order it according to the specification that is in our possession at the time and we get it delivered to site.  We get supporting documentation which says the material is capable of doing what it is meant to do.  We have previously been given that documentation by the quarries even though the material did not meet the specification.  There were not sufficient regulations.  Since then, there are new regulations, particularly in regard to stone, which is detailed in SR 21.  There is a regime for ordering stone.  When my foreman picks up the phone, he needs to know exactly what stone he is ordering and where it is going.  There is a regime where we have to monitor it and know where it is going.  There is an onus on us to get it independently tested.  Along with test certificates and more documentation than ever before to say that it is fit for purpose, many of my colleagues contact independent laboratories to get verification that the stone is suitable for purpose.  We need to do that more and more because we are relying on documentation and there is always plenty of documentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.602" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mel O'Reilly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#J00300"><p>As a builder, I yearn for the days when there were old-type general foremen who had come up through the trenches and knew almost everything that moved on a building site.  Over the years, there has been an emphasis on third level qualification for almost everything and probably an absence of the same attention to skills within the industry and allowing people to grow in the industry.  That needs to be tackled at a national level.  If one looks at most sites nowadays, the first thing that goes in is a plethora of cabins to store all the staff that we have on site.  As Mr. McKeon said, there is a far higher level of supervision now.</p> <p>  Mr. McKeon has mentioned the quarries.</p> <p>  I doubt the local authorities, without major investment, would be able to supply the skills necessary to fulfil what is required for all of the inspections.  Before we had the building regulation system, certain cities had by-laws.  An inspector used to come out.  From memory, there were about six or seven inspections at the time.  Buildings were very simple then.  Nowadays, buildings are very complex.  I do not think there are very many single designers who could design an ordinary domestic building fully and to the proper extent.  They would need input from mechanical or Part L contractors or whatever else.  It has become very complex.  The current legislation only deals with the role of the ancillary certifier, the builder and the owner but beneath that, as part of the process within the industry, all of these ancillary certifiers, the structural engineer, the mechanical consultant, the electrical consultant, the Part L compliance, fire safety and so on are all there doing their inspections as well.  There is a multi-disciplinary approach.  Very few buildings we start do not change during the process.  Schools might be on the cards for years.  If they are built, there will be changes made during the process.  Designers have to be on top of that.  They are more likely to see all of the issues that need to be done and put in place when that happens.  The present system should be given a chance for a number of years to see if it produces the goods.</p></speech>

To come back to my example of the Food Safety Authority, it works as a regulatory superstructure that monitors and supervises enforcement activities and inspections by lots of local inspectors.  It could work with our current system of building control.  That regulatory superstructure brings a consistency of inspection protocols and reporting of enforcement activity.  I went onto the Food Safety Authority website today and I found out the number of closure orders that were made for restaurants in February of this year and the total number of enforcement that were made last year.  I went onto the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, website and I found out about a non-compliance notice that was served on Three in the last few weeks.</p><p>It is impossible to find that information publicly with regard to building control enforcement.  This relates to the question about the public perception of building control.  I went to the launch of a county council annual report today, and the report did not contain the term "building control".  I was shocked by that.  People need to understand what building control means.  It needs to have that public profile because that is partly how we will educate people about the value of building control.</p><p> On a related point of local authority versus assigned certifier building control, we have set up this architecture now in the building control (amendment) regulations where we have a parallel private and public system but the public system is essential.  I become concerned when I hear statements being made to the effect that building regulations compliance is a matter for owners and their teams.  It is also a matter for monitoring and enforcement, and the State needs to be in this space.  The Deputy asked what people do when they find defects.  I spoke at a conference in London last year and I said that when someone in Ireland has a defect and they find out how bad their legal position is, they ring a disc jockey called Joe Duffy.  That is partly how we solve some of our governance problems in Ireland.  That is unacceptable.  People's lives have been destroyed, and we need to consider coming up with proper regulation.</p><p> The new homes ombudsman recommendation in the English parliamentary group is one that should be considered.  We need to have an accessible dispute resolution process.  Coming back to the Food Safety Authority, thousands of calls about food safety are made to its help line every year.  The Irish Government has not even set up a helpline for people with defects in their homes, not to mention a regulator.</p><p> On the point about building control, public and private building control have different objectives.  If I am an assigned certifier on a major project I have a very different set of objectives and duties from the local authority building inspector.  They work side by side, and I know from speaking to assigned certifiers that their roles can complement each other, but we have to recognise that the public role is still essential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon O'Boyle" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#K00200"><p>On the point raised by Deputy Ellis about foremen and clerks of works on building sites, the traditional form of general foreman had huge advantages.  I can relate an anecdote in regard to one inspection I was involved in recently where parts of a fire wall were not constructed correctly and when I asked the clerk of works, he said that that happened the week he was on holidays because the rest of the place had been done properly.  That level of on-site supervision was hugely important.</p> <p>  Mention was made by the other speakers and some Deputies of prosecutions.  As someone who was fairly close to the building control and regulatory systems, I know of very few prosecutions that have taken place here and some of those that have taken place were on the administrative provisions in terms of people having started work in advance of the granting of a fire safety certificate and so on.</p> <p>  Regarding the defectiveness of materials the Deputy raised, in my particular domain regarding fire safety and so on, all of the materials we get are manufactured materials so it would not necessarily arise.  On the issues the Acting Chairman raised as to whether the work should be undertaken by the local authority or within the private sector, I would not have a major opinion on that but it certainly needs to be done by somebody.  The general view among industry practitioners is that the current system is very stringent.  I believe it deserves a chance to work.  That is fine when there is a fire consultant, mechanical and electrical people, structural engineers, civil engineers and so on within the design team.  That can work perfectly well but it is an issue in the smaller scale projects.</p> <p>  Mention was made of buildings where changes are taking place and so on.  Mr. Fitzpatrick mentioned the requirement to obtain a fire safety certificate for changes of use.  However, there are three categories of buildings, namely, offices, retail and industrial buildings to which material alterations can be made without the need to make an application for a fire safety or a disability access certificate.  There is a requirement to comply with the building regulations and our experience is that people we would deal with, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where compliance is a huge issue, would require one to go through the same discipline, albeit not involving the local authority, in terms of doing it.</p> <p>  Value for money was mentioned earlier.  We cannot get away from the fact that building projects are big and cost a lot of money.  It is the type of industry where everybody is being squeezed constantly on margins but it is big expenditure and when so much money is being spent, it is important to do it correctly and to have all the professional advice one needs to do it well, and to make sure it is being done properly.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman mentioned a constituent who had a house in which the damp proof course was installed incorrectly.  While I do not want to reiterate the point, we have evidence from NAMA that it had to spend in excess of &euro;100 million to remedy buildings in which it was involved so we cannot be certain that we have a good national stock of buildings.  It is evident that there are legacy issues, and that is something we need to quantify to see what all of that means by way of detailed surveys being taken.  It can be done over a period of time, but it is something that needs to be done.</p></speech>

I have a number of specific questions.  To go back to the issue of the defects insurance about which Mr. Fitzpatrick and Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn spoke in the first round of answers, if I understand it correctly the liability for the cost of the repair still rests with the homeowner, albeit they have an insurance policy which will cover that.  There is a cost over the lifetime of holding the policy.  Is that the only model in place in terms of cases where defects are found and there is a financial cost to it or are there systems that work in other countries where, for example, if a builder or whoever is found to be responsible they share part or all of the financial liability as opposed to it just coming from the insurance?</p> <p>  Given the complexity of the buildings and the fact that there are so many moving parts in terms of architects, builders, sub-contractors, semi-skilled labour, apprentices and assigned certifiers, what happens if a dispute arises where someone says that they did their part of the properly but someone else did not do their part?  Does that disrupt the insurance coverage?  That is potentially a complex set of arguments and while these are pre-2014 buildings, issues have arisen which are trying to be resolved now and one of the comments I hear from homeowners is that they get completely locked in with regard to who is responsible for the defect that has been found and how they deal with that.</p> <p>  I wonder if losing one's livelihood is enough of a penalty given the scale of some of the bad buildings, so to speak.  I am talking about the pre-2014 ones we know of, but we have to assume that something like that could happen again.  Let us hope not but if I am responsible as a developer for 250 apartments that not only have no fire stopping or any fire safety requirements, is it enough for me to lose my right to practise in that profession?  Should there not be some greater level of penalty, whether it is financial liability, prosecution etc.?  Perhaps they exist and I do not know about them but I am interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p> <p>  In terms of there being no bending of the rules, I always work on the basis that I trust people but the harder we make it to bend the rules the less likely the rules will be bent.  Arguing for as tough a regime as possible is not in any way casting aspersions on the professional credibility of the individuals but I always get nervous when we are encouraged to take a certain level of issues on professional trust and the good name of the professional because it harps back somewhat to the old self-certification regimes we had previously, although, strictly speaking, I know that is not the case.</p> <p>  I also wonder to what extent any of this can be applied retrospectively, particularly in regard to Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI?  For example, if I am a contractor of one kind or another and CIRI has been put on a statutory footing and I apply to go on it, if I was involved in something prior to the statutory establishment of CIRI such as a Priory Hall type situation or something like that, could I be automatically excluded from membership?</p><p>Again, are there precedents from other jurisdictions for applying such retrospective rules?  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn spoke about effective redress.  Perhaps she would elaborate on what she means by that, both for the pre-2014 builds and the post-2014 builds.  As regards dispute resolution, how does that happen in other jurisdictions?</p><p> Mr. O'Boyle correctly highlighted the difference between the multiple-unit developments and the single or terraced houses.  If I buy a home in an apartment complex, for example, are the certificates and warranties I get with the purchase for everything across the boundary door of the balcony?  How does all of this conversation affect the communal areas, the communally insured areas, the roof spaces and so forth?</p><p> We are also not just discussing new builds.  The Government is about to launch a major refurbishment strategy and the committee is putting pressure on it to ensure that we get more than 6,600 of the currently vacant stock back into use over the next number of years.  How does all of this apply to what we are hoping will be not just a stock of new builds but also a significant increase in the number of vacant properties being brought back into use?</p><p> On the issue of costs, we have seen the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland study of the eight housing developments in Dublin.  If I recall correctly, the report referred to certification costs of &euro;5,000 to &euro;8,000.  However, other industry commentators who have detailed knowledge of this have put other figures into the public domain.  In some cases they go as high as &euro;35,000 in terms of overall compliance costs.  While some of this is straying into the other work the witness is doing, and I am not asking the witness to comment on that before it is finished, is there a sense from the industry that the level of compliance costs could reach &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 on units and is that a concern, or is the &euro;5,000 to &euro;8,000 range from the report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland closer to the ballpark?</p><p> I am midway between Mr. O'Boyle and Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn with respect to the responsibility for the inspections lying with the local authorities and fire officers.  They have the local knowledge and the Acting Chairman and I are strong defenders of increasing the capacity of local authorities to do that work.  However, I like what Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn said in terms of not taking that away from local authorities and fire inspectors but having some type of State-wide building authority that ensures consistency, collation of data and so forth.  If it is not about taking the responsibility away from local authorities or fire officers but working to increase, enhance and strengthen that and provide good data, is it something that could be helpful to local authorities in their work?</p><p> On the issue of effective redress, the big cases in the public domain are units that are all pre-BCAR.  We will be examining recommendations for future legislation and consumer protection.  Are any of the witnesses aware of other jurisdictions that have introduced stronger consumer protections and allowed them to be applied retrospectively for a limited period of time to buildings that were built prior to those regulations coming into effect?  Is that legally possible and has it been tried in other jurisdictions?  Is it something the committee should examine, so it is not just somebody who acquires a property built today who gets the better protections but also the people who are currently seeking assistance from the State to deal with the legacies of the time pre-2014?  Can we do something for them in this as well?</p></speech>

About a month ago I visited a local authority building site where houses have been completed in the past couple of years.  I visited a particular house the interior of which had been destroyed with condensation.  The tenant had gone through numerous fights with the council and there were more battles when I got involved.  We eventually discovered, as in the case 17 years ago, that a damp-proof course was not put into the house involved 17 months ago.  The house was built in the wrong location and potentially it could flood regularly.  I could not understand how the builder got away with that because it was disgraceful, shameful and unacceptable.  The mother, who has five or six children to look after, has been left in a disgraceful state by a local authority that passed a totally unacceptable house.  It has been left this way.  There have been dehumidifiers in the house for a couple of months.  They are on 24/7 in some of the bedrooms.  She has been told that if this does not work the solution is to knock her house down.  This is happening now.  I have no doubt that when I look up the CIRI or the construction register the builders concerned will be on it.  Will they be kicked out?  I cannot believe something like this is still happening.  That is the problem - the lack of credibility.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the major changes that have taken place.  That lady should not have had to ring me because the house should never have been built.  However, she should have been able to make a call to a one-stop shop independent authority to say, "There is something wrong with my house and I do not know what it is.  Will you sort it out for me?", rather than having a long battle with the council, getting me involved and having all sorts of people coming and going, day and night.  This is still the reality.  Eternal vigilance is the price of peace, so there must be continuous vigilance in respect of all of these matters.  I cannot understand a builder who would build a house, get a good price for it from the local authority but not put a damp-proof floor in it.  It does not make sense, but that is what they did.  It is callous and a disgrace.  That will happen again and again unless we maintain what will be, in a way, a bureaucracy.  It must be an independent one-stop shop to which a person can make a complaint and then it can come down like a ton of bricks on everybody concerned.  The professional bodies should be involved as well.  Johnny Murphy or whoever signed off on that house should get the bullet from his association.  He could not professionally sign off on that house and say it was built properly, because it was not.  That is the eternal problem we have.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn's comments and those from Mr. O'Boyle.  We must go further and look at best practice in other countries.  However, the penalties should apply to builders in real time.  They should be blacklisted.  If some guy does this, he should be gone for all time.  If he does that, he is not a fit person to build a house ever again.</p></speech>

We are all concerned because we are heading into another significant increase in property construction, but we are doing so with a lack of skills.  There is a significant skills shortage at present.  The practical operation of the BCAR system is that if I am the owner of the property that is being developed, I am paying the assigned certifier and the auxiliary certifier.  In theory, they are under my control.  If I am about to pour concrete and have five lorry loads of concrete waiting, but the assigned certifier suddenly realises there is something wrong with the steel, there is immediate pressure because of the presence of those five lorries.  That is the practical operation of it that concerns me.  That is the reason an independent control is required in respect of building control regulations into the future.  That is the right way to proceed.  Mr. Fitzpatrick said he would welcome further building control inspections, but there is no point in paying for it twice.  There is no point in the private sector paying for it and then in us having to pay the public sector to watch the private sector.  If the public sector could do it entirely, I would favour that system.  Equally, I am of the view that, in light of the framework agreements, we can get the expertise that is required to inspect buildings.</p> <p>  The local authorities are only inspecting 10% to 15% of buildings, if they are even doing that much.</p><p>They do not do so at all stages because buildings are picked at random.  We need to put in place a more comprehensive system, with independent control and inspection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.614" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017040500002#M00200"><p>In the event of a dispute over building controls, there is scope to refer an issue to the Building Control Authority for clarity.  With regard to penalties and people losing their livelihood, other penalties are incorporated in the Building Control Act, up to and including imprisonment, and these penalties must remain.</p> <p>  The certificates which apply are mandatory and there is no scope for changing any word in them.  The certificate is prescribed in statutory instruments.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether retrospective application is feasible.  The issue with regard to the BCAR is that people are appointed at particular times to do jobs during the process.  I do not know how any of this could be done retrospectively.</p> <p>  I do not agree the cost of compliance is &euro;35,000.  Perhaps people are incorporating all of the planning application fees, design fees and the preparation of all the drawings.  The cost of appointing a signed certifier is approximately &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 and perhaps less if it is of scale.  We do not feel the cost of complying with the BCAR is prohibitive in any way or adds significantly to the cost of building.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd spoke about being cynical because of past experience, and the case to which he referred should not happen and there is no condoning this type of behaviour.  This is the type of behaviour we want to root out of the overall system.  We do not want this type of person involved in building.  We want to ensure we have an effective statutory registration of builder scheme in place.  Individuals who have undertaken work of this nature have no place in the industry and they should be deprived of the right to build again.  We want a system with teeth, which will work for the betterment of the consumer and the industry.  We want a registration of builder scheme up and running with full power and independence to deal with these issues.  We want to ensure continued vigilance to ensure requirements are dealt with.</p> <p>  There is a skills shortage.  We have undertaken a major study on this in recent months, which has identified a significant skills shortage.  We need major recruitment of new apprentices and professionals in the industry because we will have an acute shortage of people for the construction industry in the coming years.</p></speech>

If the defects policy will not pay out and the contractor is no longer available as a mark, such as if the contractor is insolvent, the home owner is left, and many home owners have been left having to pay for the repairs to their houses and apartment blocks.  However, the only people entitled to be on site when a house is being built are the Building Control Authority inspectors or contractors.</p> <p>  If I commissioned the building of a commercial building I would have my own representative, who would be entitled to go on site, look at what is happening, point out where there are problems and tell the contractor to put it right.  A consumer cannot do any of this.  A consumer signs a contract and waits to be told it is time for snagging.  Most consumers would not want this right and would not want to have to go to the expense of appointing their own representatives on site, but it illustrates the problem that there is very little incentive in terms of the actual risk carried.</p> <p>  We have spoken about enforcement by building control authorities, and that it seems to be at very low levels.  People state they are not aware of any prosecutions.  I have not found any information on prosecutions.  When a major apartment defect came to light a few years ago, I was asked whether there should be personal liability.  I extracted the section of the Act and said there is personal liability, exactly as Mr. Fitzpatrick has said, with the potential for fines and imprisonment.  It is not just applicable to the company but also to directors and people involved in the management of the company.  It is available, but we do not seem to have activated it.  Perhaps it is a cultural thing.  The right against the builder should not disappear because of the fact there is defects insurance.  If somebody has signed a contract he or she should be able to rely on it.  If someone happens to sell a house a month after buying it, the building contract which contains warranties with the builder for a period of 12 years should go with the house.</p> <p>  A point was made on home owners getting locked into who is responsible for the defects.  This certainly is a feature of the small number of cases which have come before the courts.  I mentioned that the Law Society's building agreement has an arbitration clause.  There is very little case law from the Irish courts on the liability of builders under the contract because there is an arbitration agreement.  These cases never got to the courts, but when they did there was a long list of defendants.  The home owners had been involved in proceedings for years.  There was a case before the Court of Appeal last year where the opinion on compliance had been given in 2000 and the case was still ongoing.  This is impossible for everyone concerned, including the defendant engineer who was not in a position to defend the claim because the builder was in receivership.</p> <p>  We have spoken about whether losing one's livelihood is enough and about personal liability.  With regard to the construction industry register, when I speak to people who have defects in their homes they are surprised there is not already a regulation system for builders, and this is part of the point about consumer education.  Regulation for people who are responsible for the biggest investment we all make in our lives, and on whom we are totally dependent, is a given.  Of course there should be regulation, but there is regulation of many professions and activities in Irish society and there are still defects and negligence by people who must complete annual reports stating they have fulfilled their continuous professional development, they have not had any misconduct proceedings against them and they have not been adjudicated a bankrupt.  This will not remove the need for effective remedies.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what is meant by effective remedies and what dispute resolution looks like.  I mentioned there is not even a helpline in Ireland on what to do when people discover a defect in their houses.  I also mentioned New South Wales, where the office of fair trading has a dispute resolution and advocacy service, which can start quite informally and can involve various methods of dispute resolution including mediation.  How exactly it would be designed would have to be looked at, but the key is that it would be fast, cost-effective and people would know where to turn when it happened.</p> <p>  With regard to what to do about buildings with legacy defects, I am afraid that in other jurisdictions state intervention has been required.  In Ireland, unless someone comes within the pyrite resolution scheme, responsibility for legacy defects is left with the home owner.  We could go the way of Canada and New Zealand, where compensation funds and various measures have been introduced.  I do not know whether anything can be done.  Dealing with legacy defects is essential.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan has nothing in it about people who have legacy defects in their homes.  It is all about delivering new homes, but we have a huge problem, obviously, with the homes we have.</p></speech>

We know there are quite a few in existence with difficulties, and this can only really be determined by inspection, which is very laborious and will take time.  There is a time period required for it to be addressed.  It is a binary issue, either we have it or we do not, and this needs to be done.  The points made on the consequences of not doing it have been dealt with by other speakers.</p><p> It is worth noting that there is a facility under the Fire Services Act for fire authorities to serve orders on people to undertake fire safety risk assessments where there are suspicions.  Knowledge of where these buildings are, for example, apartments, is a factor.  The committee's focus has been on housing, but it is important to remember that people also stay in hotels, hospitals and other buildings.</p><p> Regarding what Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn and I stated, the building control management system, which is a computer portal for uploading documents relating to BCAR, is helpful.  It would be useful if we had national standards in that regard and possessed a databank of inspections, faults and solutions so as to provide us with a way of dealing with these matters nationally.  Mr. O'Reilly mentioned a difficulty with fire-stopping contractors, where the standards are set by industry groups rather than some other system.  It would be useful if national standards, competences and skills were set.  It is easy to install firestopping when there are standard sizes.  It becomes more difficult when there are non-standard sizes and awkward places to get to.</p><p> I cannot argue with the point on the independence or vigilance of the one-stop-shop.  Such an idea is a good one.</p><p> The Chairman made a point about a lack of skills.  In terms of engineering, one university runs a postgraduate programme on fire safety, one institute of technology runs a degree programme on fire engineering and a masters programme is available in the North.  A number of universities in the UK also provide that programme.  At technician level within the building industry, Mr. O'Reilly mentioned how firestopping would be viewed as semi-skilled work, albeit important within the overall envelope of the building.  There are skill shortages, so there must be training systems if people are to be able to execute firestopping properly.  It is the most critical item that is not installed properly.  A new fire detection alarm system can be installed retrospectively if it is not working.  One can have an addressable system as opposed to a zoned one, which is the older type.  If one does not have fire-stopping around windows and cavities, though, one will not realise that until it is too late.</p><p> Ireland has a legacy issue with fire safety and buildings.  Powers exist to deal with that and they should be executed.</p></speech>

People phone the insurance company.  They do not go near the warranty company or the builder.  The company then carries out inspections, so that is another independent body carrying out inspections.  No matter how many assigned certifiers one has, insurance companies insist on conducting their own inspections.</p></speech>

In setting out to discuss the Government amendments being proposed at today's meeting, members might like to have a sense of how and why those amendments have come about.</p> <p>  Section 2 of the Bill as initiated deals with the amendment of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act, 1986, which is the primary purpose of the Bill.</p> <p>  Section 1 of the Act of 1986 deals with the issuing of summonses in respect of offences as a matter of administrative procedure.  In 2004, the 1986 Act was recast, principally for the purpose of allowing for the issue of a summons to be effected by transmitting it by electronic means to the person who applied for it.  This allowed for the issuing of summonses electronically by the relevant court office in addition to the issuing of summonses manually.  The introduction of the third payment requires not only the issuing of summonses by electronic means but also the creation of the summons in an automatic manner.</p> <p>  The drafting approach to achieve this has undergone a revision by the Office of the Attorney General since the Bill was published.  The five Government amendments to section 2 of the Bill now being proposed are intended to give effect to this revised drafting approach.  The revised drafting approach is intended to ensure that the amendments to the 1986 Act to be made by the Bill are as legally robust, straightforward and challenge-proof as possible.  The original drafting approach in the Bill as initiated sought to integrate the new method of the creation of a summons in an automatic manner with existing provisions of the Act of 1986, particularly those relating to the notion of an original summons document and true copy summonses.  However, in the new automated system, there is no longer considered to be a need for a physical original in circumstances where both the original and the copy are created from the same source data and on foot of an automated process.  The revised drafting approach as set out under today's amendments seeks to follow through on this conclusion by not applying the original true copy separation in the case of the new automated process for the issuing of summonses.  The revised drafting approach therefore provides in a clearer, more distinct way for the new automated system as an additional but still legally robust method for the issue of a summons.  It is mainly technical stuff, as the Chairman will appreciate.</p></speech>

Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section 2A into the 1986 Act.</p><p> Amendment No. 1 proposes to replace the wording of the current section 2A with alternative wording.  This alternative wording arises from the further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and is aimed at expressing in a more straightforward manner the essential elements of the new system of the printing of summonses.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(a) essentially repeats the provision for the issue of a summons by electronic means to be deemed to have been effected by the transmission by the relevant court office of the information necessary to create the summons in an automatic manner.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(b) deals with the reality in the context of an automated system that the date of issue of a summons by the transmission of the electronic information may be earlier than the date of the creation of the summons.  In this context, the creation of the summons is the printing of the summons as a paper document.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(c) departs from the approach in the Bill as initiated in respect of the deeming of each summons to be a true copy of the summons.  The amendment now proposes that where more than one document is created in respect of the same alleged offence, each such document shall be the summons.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(d) essentially repeats, but in a more straightforward manner, the provision of the Bill to the effect that the creation in an automatic manner of a summons shall be taken to be the printing on paper of the summons.</p></speech>

Part of the problem is the question of whether the summons was received by the person at the other end.  What if a person claims they never got it?  There were anomalies.</p> <p>  The third payment option means that when the second notice arrives, a third payment option is available.  I understand up to 80% of the first notices are being paid.  An Post has a rigorous method of delivering post.  Whether people were simply ignoring these things or whether they arrived in the first place are the questions that arose.  The PULSE system has been changed such that these errors cannot recur.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan&rsquo;s point is interesting.  However, if a person says that he never got a summons, what happens then?  We must ensure that the PULSE system works and that is our purpose at the moment.  The third payment option should make the system far more robust.</p></speech>

The anomaly still exists.  I got a summons but I never got a fixed charge notice.  That was relatively recently &ndash; just before Christmas.  I get enough fixed charge notices, but I definitely did not get the notice in question.  I am well aware that was the case.  When we raised it with the Garda Commissioner last week, her answer basically implied that the problem was with An Post.</p> <p>  When the initial penalty points scandal arose, systems were put in place to correct the problem.  Then, a year later, another protected disclosure was made in either 2013 or 2014.  In that case, the claim was made that the system was still faulty despite all the checks that had been put in place.  The excuse given to get over the new restrictions in place with the penalty points was based around undeliverable An Post mail.  An independent investigation was set up by the Minister under the offices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Moneys were provided by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Three years on, that investigation has not taken off.  It is correct to raise concerns about the systems.  I reckon the systems are seriously flawed still.  It is probably something of a side issue to the legislation, which I believe to be a good measure.  However, it needs to be factored in.</p></speech>

The two agencies that manage the systems are the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present a fixed charge notice is issued by an outsourced print service provider on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Summonses are issued by the Courts Service following an application from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These two processes need to be linked to provide for the third payment option.</p> <p>  The technical solution between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na represents a departure from current arrangements made necessary to accommodate the simultaneous generation of a summons issued by the Courts Service and a fixed charge notice issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The agreed approach involves the electronic generation of summonses by means of an electronic file transfer from the Courts Service to an external print service provider contracted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Each summons will then be individually printed with an associated fixed charge notice and will represent the second such notice and the third opportunity to pay, for the purposes of service.</p> <p>  The systems have become more integrated and linked together now.  However, the Deputies are correct.  We have to be vigilant and monitor this.

Section 2(b) provides for the insertion of a new subsection 4A into section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to replace the wording of section 4A with alternative wording.  This alternative wording arises from the further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel aimed at expressing in a more precise manner the reality that a single transmission by electronic means can, in respect of more than one summons, or more than one application, be made for a summons.  This provision allows for the automated processing within an information technology environment of batches of summonses or applications of summonses.</p></speech>

The Bill, as initiated, proposed that this matter be dealt with by way of an amendment to the existing section 1(9) of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Amendment No. 4 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (9A) into section 1 of the Act of 1986 as an alternative to the originally proposed amendment to subsection (9).  This alternative approach arises from further work from the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel.  The new subsection (9A) provides for presumption that the summons created under the new subsection (2A) is created on the basis of the information transmitted by the relevant court office.  Also included in amendment No. 4, again on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, is an amended section 1(9) of the Act of 1986.  This amended subsection (9) is essentially a restatement of the existing subsection, with the substitution of a presuming clause for a deeming clause.  This reflects the preference on the part of Parliamentary Counsel for the drafting solution of a presuming clause rather than the deeming clause in the Act of 1986.  However, the legislative effect is intended to be essentially the same.</p></speech>

Subsection (10) of the 1986 Act provides that in the case of a summons that has been issued by electronic means, a true copy of the summons shall be evidence of the summons concerned.  In the Bill as initiated it had been proposed to also apply this provision to a summons created in an automatic manner under the new subsection (2A).  Amendment No. 5 proposes that subsection (10) will remain unaltered and that consequently it will continue to apply only to summonses issued by electronic means in accordance with section 1(2) of the 1986 Act.  This alternative approach arises from further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and flows from subsection (2A), whereby every printed document in respect of the same alleged offence is to be considered the summons.</p><p>Subsection (14) of the 1986 Act provides for definitions of various terms used in the Act.  In the Bill as initiated it had been proposed to add a definition of the term &quot;document&quot; and amend the definition of the term &quot;true copy&quot;.  The definition of the term &quot;document&quot; was proposed to clarify that a document includes electronic material or electronic information.  Within the Act of 1986, a summons is referred to as a document so the new definition was intended to have the effect of reflecting the issue of summonses as part of a batch of electronic data transmitted from the relevant court office to a print service provider acting on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is no longer proposed that this drafting approach shall be followed in the Bill.  This change arises from further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and arises from the new subsection (2A), whereby every printed document in respect of the same alleged offence is considered to be the summons.  The term &quot;true copy&quot; is currently defined in the 1986 Act with regard to a summons that has been issued electronically as a reproduction in writing of the summons certified by the prosecutor as being a true copy thereof.  In the Bill as initiated, it had been proposed to amend this definition.  However, as I previously explained, under the revised drafting approach, every printed document under the new automatic system is to be considered the summons.  Consequently, the matter of a true copy of the summons does not arise under the new and more straightforward approach.</p></speech>

Section 3 of the Bill provides for an exception to made from the general rule that a summons against a person who is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be signed by a judge.  This procedure cannot be accommodated in the proposed new streamlined arrangements for the creation of a summons in an automatic manner.  Section 3(1)(a) in the published Bill directly relates to the operation of the third payment option and is therefore an essential component of this Bill.  It is being replaced by the new and clearer language prepared in consultation with the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel with amendment No. 6.  Section 3(1)(b) is not directly linked with the third payment option and would not form part of that system when it goes live.  The case for its inclusion in this Bill now has receded following further consideration of the overall policy framework, including relevant road traffic legislation and following further consultation with Advisory Counsel, Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Accordingly, it is proposed that for present purposes, section 3(1)(b) will be deleted from the Bill and it will be revisited as part of a wider review of the summons process under which it is a more logical fit.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something we must look at and it must make it more difficult for a garda to summons another garda if, in order to do so, he or she is required to get the imprimatur and signature of a judge.  We can take it up on Report Stage but perhaps the committee or Minister should look at it to see if the process could be harmonised and the summons of a garda could be treated in the same way as a summons for anybody else.  We can note the legislation dealing with this dates to 1924.</p></speech>

We are inserting four new sections into the Bill, all of which are technical in nature.  The amendments concern the application of Section 5A - questioning of persons detained under section 4 not generally permitted pending access to legal advice - of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as inserted by Section 9(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 to the detention provisions of three Statutes, namely the Offences Against the State Act 1939, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Section 5A concerns the well-established right of a person in Garda custody to access legal advice and is aimed at clarifying the circumstances in which questioning may proceed, notwithstanding that a suspect has not yet had an opportunity to consult a solicitor.  It is an established policy principle that the relevant provisions of the 1984 Act relating to detentions made under Section 4 of that Act should also apply to detentions made under the aforementioned three criminal justice statutes.  Sections 9(b), 13 and 14 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 apply the new Section 5A of the 1984 Act to the statutes in question.  However, difficulties have arisen from the fact that both the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 amend the same provisions of the three statutes in question and while the amendments contained in the 2014 Act have already been commenced, those of the 2011 Act have not.  The fact that the provisions of the 2011 Act will be commenced after those of the 2014 Act has given rise to uncertainty as to what the final outcome of the amended detention provisions will be.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the most prudent way to clarify the matter is to draw up new provisions providing for the application of Section 5A to the detention provisions of the three statutes in question and to repeal the application of the provisions of the 2011 Act.  That is what these amendments effectively achieve.</p> <p>  We began with a bail Bill but because we are making changes to it which are outside of bail law, we had to pass a motion in the D&aacute;il last night to allow this to happen.  Normally, we would just introduce Government amendments on Committee Stage and present them here but we had to make these changes by way of a motion in the D&aacute;il, which is quite unusual.  It also means that we are widening the scope of the Bill and changing its Title.  That is why the motion, which was technical in nature, had to be dealt with last night.  Normally we would just bring the amendments to this committee and present them but we could not do so in this instance.  I thank the members for their indulgence in that regard.</p></speech>

In effect, we are being asked to put together a Criminal Justice Bill as opposed to a Bail (Amendment) Bill and we could have done with more time in respect of that.  We will deal with it today and we did not oppose the motion in the D&aacute;il last night, although we could have done.

The new provision concerns detention of intoxicated persons in Garda stations in circumstances where those persons, if released, would be a danger to themselves or others.  It allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain intoxicated persons who have been arrested for public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and who, but for this new provision, would be released.  Such persons can be detained for a period not exceeding six hours, where the member in charge of the Garda station in which the persons are in custody is of the opinion that they are intoxicated to such an extent as to be considered a danger to themselves or to other persons if released.  The provision also allows release prior to the expiration of the six hour detention period.  To date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has relied on a presumed common law duty of care to intoxicated persons to justify such detention.  However, this practice has no statutory basis and this amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act will provide for such a statutory basis.</p></speech>

Currently, there is a common law presumption of a duty of care.  If it is the opinion of the garda in charge of a station that individuals would be a danger to themselves or to other members of the public if released, they can be held.  Is there a time limit on that at present?  We are proposing to insert a time limit but does one exist at the moment?</p></speech>

It is their opinion.  We are talking about somebody who is dangerously intoxicated and who would be a danger to themselves or to others if they were released.  These are people who probably are not even aware where they are or what they are doing so for their own safety and for the safety of others, they can be looked after in the Garda station until, to put it bluntly, they sober up.  The six hours is the maximum period but they can be released earlier if necessary.</p></speech>

That makes it difficult.  I was arrested under suspicion of drink driving a number of years ago.  I was not and was well under the limit but when I was leaving the station the sergeant told me to come back when I was sober.  What is to say under other circumstances the sergeant could say, "You are a danger to yourself and others"?  It is probably an extreme example but it relates to the lack of confidence in the Garda in terms of this discretion.</p></speech>

The common law is a very vague animal and the public cannot really point to any section in an Act and state that is where the power comes from.  It is beneficial, therefore, to have it on a statutory basis to protect the garda&iacute; and the individuals concerned so that there is a legal basis upon which the garda&iacute; detain people.  From my assessment of it, to date it has been dealt with responsibly by the garda&iacute;.  Unfortunately, people get extremely drunk.  They can be a danger to themselves and to others.  It would be interesting if we did an assessment of the convictions before our courts to see the correlation between convictions and people who have a lot of drink taken.  It is extraordinarily high.  It is worthwhile putting this on a statutory basis.</p> <p>  In terms of the definition, I note that subsection (4) states: "In this section &lsquo;intoxication&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in section 4.&rdquo;.  I think that should be "intoxicated" as opposed to "intoxication".</p> <p>  On the reason for the six hours, that is based on an assessment as to how long it takes to sober up or for somebody to ensure they are no longer a danger to themselves but we cannot ignore the fact that there are circumstances where people are extremely drunk, they have not committed any criminal offence but there is a serious prospect that if they are allowed to continue as they are they will damage themselves or someone else.</p></speech>

Is there any legislative measure that requires the garda&iacute; to put them into a health care setting?  That would be a concern for me.  If we are putting a statutory timeline on a potential case of alcohol poisoning, that could have an adverse effect in the context of their future well-being.  If someone is in that mental state, they are potentially close to developing alcohol poisoning.  We need to be careful that we are not simply confining them to four walls but that a health care intervention takes place and that that could be incorporated within the law.</p></speech>

To respond to Deputy Chambers's question, the position is that there are custody regulations in place and they allow the member in charge to seek medical treatment, where necessary.  If the member in charge believes that somebody is at risk from the point of view of health or worse, they can and have to get medical attention.</p> <p>  On the six hours issue, we had to strike a balance between what is reasonable detention  and a person's freedom.  People should not be held but if somebody who is dangerously intoxicated was allowed to leave a Garda station and they got hurt, hurt somebody else or were killed, questions would be asked as to why they were released when they did not know what they were doing.  That is the purpose of this provision.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the common law is a very vague animal and we want to make it clear under statute, and it is a maximum amount of time.  I believe that if somebody was that dangerously intoxicated initially, the member in charge would seek medical advice.  There are custody regulations in place to govern this area and they have to be followed but seeking medical advice is part of that.</p></speech>

The amendment is changing the 1997 Act with the effect that when a judge is deciding to impose conditions on bail, those conditions have to be &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  The Act says &quot;appropriate&quot;.  That might seem like a small change.  The decision to grant or refuse bail is an incredibly serious one.  We have to be very careful in legislating in this area.  We have to take into account the costs of the decision.  There are substantial economic and social costs of using prison for remand as an alternative to bail.  When breaching one's conditions of bail is likely to result in a penal sentence, that has implications which need to be taken into account.  We must also bear in mind that the person has not been convicted.</p><p>Remand is disproportionately used against women.  The most up-to-date statistics were for 2013.  They showed that 13% of the male prison population were on remand compared with 20% of female prisoners.  The impact of women getting a custodial sentence, which we have explored over recent weeks in our consultation on penal policy, is that even a few weeks on remand could result in a woman losing her accommodation, custody of her children or whatever.  It is incredibly disruptive. We have to be careful about the conditions imposed by the court and that they are such that the person has a decent chance of complying with them.  Otherwise, they could end up in prison.</p><p>The problem with &quot;appropriate&quot; is that it can vary from court to court depending on the judge.  It  is quite vague.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, has said that where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty is satisfied.  Therefore, &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot; will be a greater guiding tool for the judiciary than &quot;appropriate&quot;.</p></speech>

She has put a lot of thought into it.  I appreciate the aim of the proposal but I am concerned it may have unintended consequences.  We may have to tease it out a bit more.</p><p>The amendment would replace the requirement in section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bail Act that bail conditions be considered &quot;appropriate&quot; with a requirement they be considered &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  There is already a well-established principle that any restriction of a person's constitutional rights must be proportionate to the objective and impair those rights as little as possible.  That is a constitutional provision.  On one reading, it may be argued that the amendment is unnecessary as the current provision already meets the objective.</p><p>The Deputy has proposed the amendment with a view to limiting the conditions which may be imposed.  It is possible that the inclusion of the word &quot;necessary&quot; would have this effect in some circumstances.  It is important to consider carefully the implications of this.  It may have the effect of preventing the imposition of the new condition in section 3 of the Bill restricting contact between the accused and the victim or his or her family.  Therefore, while I do not have a difficulty with the Deputy's objective in this amendment, the effect of the change in wording requires further consideration to determine its precise implications.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment at this time.</p><p>We will be prepared to look at it on Report Stage but it requires further consideration.  There may be unintended consequences which could cause more harm than good.</p></speech>

Section 6(1)(b) says: &quot;the recognisance may be subject to such conditions as the court considers appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case&quot;.  The proposal is that we would change the word &quot;appropriate&quot; and put in the words &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  I do not think there is a huge difference but I would be prepared to look at it.</p><p>My only concern is that I want the addition of subparagraphs (vi),<i></i>(vii) and<i></i>(viii), which are in the Bill before us, to section 6(1)(b) of the Bail Act.  I do not think this amendment would deal with those subparagraphs but I was slightly concerned that the amendment, in stating &ldquo;in subsection 1(b) by the substitution of &ldquo;considers necessary and proportionate&rdquo; for &ldquo;considers appropriate&rdquo;,&rdquo; is an amendment to the substance of the Act of 1997 as opposed to what is relevant here when one looks at section 3 of the Bill.  I am slightly confused by that and want to be certain what the consequences of that would be.</p></speech>

It is not only about limiting the conditions but also about making sure they are not unreasonable and that people will be able to comply with them.  It has to be seen in the context of later amendments which raise the issue of bail supports.  Bail supports have been demonstrated to have the greatest impact on whether people can comply and keeping people out of prison on remand.  If the Minister of State would clarify it for Report Stage I am happy to re-enter it at that stage if necessary.</p></speech>

The problem is that extending Garda powers to arrest without warrant in the absence of the provision for bail supports and services is what the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, calls a short-term and simplistic solution to what is a complex problem.</p><p>The particular concern I have about the new subsection (10) relates to a situation in which a garda might think that the person is about to breach his or her bail conditions.  The garda might anticipate that the person is going to do it, but the person will not actually have done anything.  It is a future crime for which we are allowing an arrest without warrant.  I know that it is qualified under the circumstances, but giving the power of arrest without warrant for something that has not happened is very dangerous.  This is something that has potential for a lot of abuse.  I would be concerned about it in that regard.<br/><br/>Garda&iacute; already have the power to arrest people without a warrant if they have committed crimes or if they are attempting to do so.  We have already covered circumstances such as if a person on bail physically assaults somebody, tries to physically somebody or roughs somebody up.  What the new subsection does is give garda&iacute; the power to arrest somebody without warrant.  For example, if a person went into a pub that he or she should not have been in and the person who was the alleged victim of the crime happens to be there as well, those circumstances could result in an arrest.  I am of the view that a breach of bail conditions should be dealt with in the usual way.  It is a little bit dangerous that we are giving garda&iacute; a sort of <i>carte blanche </i>to go around arresting people because they think something is about to happen.  That could be dangerous and it requires a few safeguards.  That is the thinking behind the amendment.</p></speech>

The Deputy is proposing the deletion of the new Garda power of arrest, that will be inserted by section 3 of the Bill into section 6 of the Bail Act 1997.  The provision would allow a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest, without warrant, a person who has been released on bail where the member reasonably suspects that the person has breached, is in the act of breaching or is about to breach a condition of his or her bail and the immediate arrest is necessary to prevent harm to or interference with the victim, another witness or another person that the court is specifically trying to protect.  We are talking about protecting victims here as well.  Let us not forget that.  The power of arrest provided in this provision has been very carefully considered and is very limited in nature.  There must be an imminent risk of harm or intimidation to the victim, witness or other identified person.  The provision is reasonable and is necessary to allow a member of the Garda to intervene in such circumstances.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment at this time.</p></speech>

A person accused of sexual assault or rape can apply for and be granted bail.  One of the conditions of bail set by a judge is that the person must stay away from the complainant in the sexual assault or rape case.  If the individual who is accused then turns up near the house of or in the vicinity of the area in which the complainant lives, that is a breach of the bail conditions.  From the point of view of the complainant, it is very unsatisfactory that she - most likely - must wait for the DPP to go back to court to apply for a change of bail conditions.  It is reasonable that garda&iacute; be given the power to arrest an individual who is in breach of a bail condition.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly said that it is about garda&iacute; having a power to prevent an offence or something that is about to happen.  However, it is not simply that.  If we look at the new subsection 10(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), it is clear that subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) go beyond that.  Deputy Clare Daly is right when she says that the subsection will give the power to garda&iacute; to arrest a person if they believe that he or she is about to contravene any of the conditions of the recognisance.  It then goes on to state that it also covers cases where the person is in the act of contravening any of the conditions or where the person has contravened any of the conditions.  This is an important protection which will ensure that bail conditions are taken seriously.  People obviously have an entitlement to bail.  However, there are various factors that are weighed up.  If conditions are set for a person in order to be granted bail, that individual must comply with those conditions.  If the conditions are breached to such an extent that the person is contravening them, garda&iacute; should be given the power of arrest in respect of that.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 relate to electronic monitoring.  The Bill amends section 6B such that the imposition of electronic monitoring can be at the behest of the prosecutor.  Under the Bill, electronic monitoring may be imposed on individuals charged with serious offences and those appealing sentences of imprisonment imposed by the District Court.  What these amendments seek to do is put in place a few rules, guidelines or safeguards - call them what you will - in respect of the use of electronic monitoring.  I accept that electronic monitoring can be a useful tool in the criminal justice system.  We know that in countries such Denmark, for example, 60% of all custodial sentences under six months are converted to electronic monitoring and intense supervision.  In Belgium, any prison sentence of less that three years is automatically commuted to electronic tagging.  This is a mechanism that is used.  However, we have to be careful when making electronic monitoring a condition of bail that the necessary safeguards are in place.  That is the aim behind these amendments.  They are trying to beef up the safeguards.</p><p>Electronic monitoring applies in two scenarios, namely, in respect of the commission of a serious offence or for people appealing prison sentences handed down by the District Court.  I think we have to tighten up matters in respect of the duration.  If we do not, delays in the system could mean people being tagged for a long time.  We have to take into account, as the amendment does, the person's age, disability and other relevant personal circumstances when electronic monitoring is being imposed.  We do not want somebody effectively imprisoned in their own home with impacts on mental health, etc., particularly if the person is vulnerable, has addiction problems or whatever.</p><p>One of the key issues highlighted in these amendments is data protection.  I am sure the Minister will say that the data is protected and that there is nothing to worry about.  However, I am of the view that we need explicit safeguards in this Bill involving the data that will be collected through monitoring.  We know that data is big business.  We have to make specific provision for that in the Bill.  This data is essentially being collected and monitored without somebody's willing consent.  It leaves the door open for that information, and the entire activity of monitoring, to be profited from.</p><p>The goal of the amendments is that any monitoring of tagging should be done by the State or by a not-for-profit company.  Monitoring should not be something from which people might profit from.  I am trying to leave no gaps in that.  In Germany, there is a state agency that monitors this area.  That agency includes social workers and support staff.  That is the direction in which it is going.  If we are moving towards a system whereby we are using electronic monitoring a lot more, then the protections to which I refer should be put in place.</p><p>If the alarm on the monitor were to go off, it is not the case that the Garda would be called immediately.  A support staff member, a social worker, could be called to assist the person.  If we were to have such a system, it is much more likely that the conditions would not be breached and it would help the person concerned to avoid a custodial sentence and address his or her offending in the community in which he or she lives.  We do not want to have a scenario like the one in parts of England in which police officers are on patrol accompanied by a G4S security van.  The purpose of the amendments is to eliminate that use.  They would provide safeguards in the use of electronic monitoring.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for proposing the amendments, both of which relate to the electronic monitoring provisions contained in the Bail Act 1997.  As the T&aacute;naiste outlined to the House on a number of occasions, electronic monitoring has its limitations, but as the Deputy pointed out, it has the potential to be effective when applied in certain circumstances.  That is the basis for the amendment to section 4 of the Bill which provides that electronic monitoring can only be imposed on the application of the prosecutor in order that it can be limited to those cases in which it is most likely to be effective.  The Deputy's amendments, if I understand them correctly, also seek to ensure the use of electronic monitoring would be restricted to the most suitable cases.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 6 would insert two new subsections into section 6B of the Bail Act 1997 which deals with the electronic monitoring of certain persons admitted to bail.  The new subsection (1A) would set out conditions to which the court would have to have regard in imposing a condition requiring electronic monitoring, including that the type and modalities of the tagging be proportionate to the age, disability and personal circumstances of the person concerned and that he or she not be confined solely to the place of residence.  The new subsection (1B) would require data to be collected in compliance with the Data Protection Acts and the data not to be used for any other purpose.  The amendments appear to be unnecessary, given the safeguards already provided in the existing provisions of the Bail Act which requires a person subject to electronic monitoring to consent to it and that the provisions do not apply to under-18s and only apply in the case of serious offences.  It is not possible to restrict the movements of a person on bail to such an extent that he or she must remain in any specific place or residence at all times and the provisions are already subject, as the Deputy pointed out, to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 would amend section 6D - arrangements for electronic monitoring - of the Bail Act 1997 to restrict the provision of electronic monitoring services to non-commercial or not-for-profit providers.  This would prevent current arrangements used for electronic monitoring by the Irish Prison Service and restrict the possible options for providing for electronic monitoring.  I do not share the Deputy's concerns that a commercial operator could not appropriately and effectively provide the electronic monitoring service.  Such a provider would be bound to operate the service in accordance with the statutory provisions and the contractual obligations imposed by the State.  Limiting the provision to non-commercial operators would restrict the available operators and possibly lead to circumstances in which electronic monitoring services could not be implemented in some locations, or not at all.  It would also be likely to increase costs.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#J00300"><p>The words "electronic monitoring" sound very negative, but we have to consider how such a provision is imposed.  People are arrested and charged with serious offences.  They then look to be released on bail.  The likelihood is that they will not be granted bail and that they will be remanded in custody until such time as their trial is held.  That is an option to be avoided, but they have to consent to use of the provision.  The advantage of electronic monitoring is that they will not be remanded in custody and will be released, but conditions will be imposed, one of which will be that they will be monitored in order that their movements will be taken into account.  It is important in the first instance that people will have to consent to this.</p> <p>  I note what Deputy Clare Daly is seeking to do in amendment No. 6, but I would have thought courts took all of those factors into account.  It is proposed that the type and modalities of tagging be proportionate to the offences alleged in terms of their duration and intrusiveness, but electronic monitoring will only be used in the case of serious offences.  I would have thought every court took into account the age of an individual.  The important point is that this provision will only apply and continue until the trial takes place.  We should get criminal trials up and running within one year, but if the option was to remand someone in custody or to use electronic monitoring, it would be a way of ensuring people were not incarcerated at a time when they had not yet been convicted.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 7, I recognise Deputy Clare Daly's concern.  In other countries, particularly in America, the incarceration process has become a business and it is creeping into Britain.  The last thing we want is to have an expert private company responsible for monitoring and extending its control into prisons.  Currently, monitoring is carried out by private enterprises.  If we were to let the State run the system, how effective would it be?  It requires a degree of technical sophistication,  I would be concerned, if amendment No. 7 was to be accepted, that it would have the effect of preventing the current system of monitoring from operating.</p></speech>

We should ensure there is no doubt that they will take them into consideration by placing the provision on a statutory footing.  I imagine most courts do take into account issues such as the mental health, disability and age of an alleged offender, but I do not see any reason we cannot ensure they must take them into account by enshrining it in legislation.</p> <p>  I have some concerns about amendment No. 7.  We should be moving towards a position where the service will be provided by not-for-profit businesses, but if the amendment were to be accepted, it would create problems for the holders of contracts already in place for the electronic tagging of individuals.  We are, however, supportive of amendment No. 6.</p></speech>

I have regard for the courts and their ability to make the necessary safeguards in place work.  The issue can be approached from an ideological basis of not wanting to believe the courts will enforce someone's necessary rights and entitlements.  As things stand, many people say there is a lack of rights for victims and those affected by serious crime.  The provision is sufficiently restrictive.  It deals with serious crimes only and where someone applies for bail.  I have no problem with a commercial company providing a service for the State in a good and cost-effective way.  It is up to the State to regulate to ensure it is delivered in compliance with the laws of the land, including on data protection and so on.  That can be accommodated.  It would be wrong to prohibit a commercial company from providing a service for the State in a regulated and proper way on a value for money basis.  I will be opposing that amendment also.</p></speech>

That will enable it to be managed and controlled.  I do not believe it will be widely used; rather, it will only be used in the case of serious crimes.  As Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said, it is an alternative to incarceration.  I have seen the system in operation in other jurisdictions and it does require a high level of sophistication to monitor and track individuals.  We have to be careful that what is in place will continue and that what we will put in place will actually work properly.  We also have to trust the courts which will make the decision on the conditions of bail.</p><p>If the prosecution applies for it, the courts will have to decide whether it is suitable or not in the circumstances.  The judges know a lot more than anyone else because they have access to all the information and that is the basis on which they make their decisions.  We had better trust the courts to do their job.  In addition, the Deputy should bear in mind that the measure is restricted.  It does not apply to everybody.  It will be a condition of bail and only on application of the prosecution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.761" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#K00200"><p>The objection to amendment No. 6 is that the situation is provided for, but if that is the case then I do not have any problem in seeing why it cannot be spelled out in legislation.  While one would assume the courts would take such considerations into account there is no guarantee and a legislative foundation for that would not be any harm.  Data protection is particularly important in this day and age and if provision is already made then why not seal the deal and leave no room for doubt by including it?  I take note of the views of members.  We can withdraw the amendment and consider tabling it again on Report Stage.</p> <p>  In terms of the private company, I question the privatisation of the criminal justice system.  I do not have a problem in principle with electronic monitoring.  The idea that it would be in operation as an alternative to a custodial sentence is economically efficient, it is efficient for society and it leaves the person in the community.  The issue is how we view that and what supports are available.  The German model is composed of civil servants, social workers and support staff and their response when the alarm goes off is to intervene with the person; it is not to haul them in or put a black mark against him or her.  The intention is to try to de-escalate the situation.  The various agencies decide whether to send out a social worker.  They operate on a 24-7 basis and each shift has a social worker to go out and intervene and it is up to them to decide when they intervene with a person whether the police should be contacted.  In fact, police contact only happens in approximately 5% of cases.  That has meant people have been less likely to breach their bail conditions and less likely to go on and receive a custodial sentence later because they are given an opportunity to address the issues.  The idea that one would have a company profiting from a vital public service is an ideological debate we could have in every arena but we will withdraw the amendment today and consider returning to it later.</p></speech>

In the context of reviewing bail the issue of bail supports is key.  All international studies vindicate that position.  If one supports people to comply with their conditions there are fewer breaches of conditions and it is better for everybody.  The amendment requires the Minister to review the bail supports within 12 months of the enactment of the Bill.  The amendment lists the types of bail support that could be provided.  The amendment also seeks that the Minister would make costed recommendations to Government regarding improvements in the provision of such supports in order to reduce both custodial remand orders and breaches of bail conditions.</p><p>The reason I included that is because it is as far as I can go as an Opposition Deputy in terms of making changes to bail supports that I believe are necessary.  I will not repeat them but studies from every jurisdiction indicate there is a huge cost saving if one puts the supports in place.  At the moment, the State is spending more than &euro;100,000 per day having people on remand in prisons.  The alternative is to have them out on bail and supported and it is far cheaper for society as a whole.  It allows the person to remain within the community, address his or her offending behaviour and enhances improvement.  If one supports somebody, the chances of him or her turning up in court are improved, which improves the efficiency of the courts.</p><p>The amendment provides for the Minister to carry out a review rather than leaving it to chance.  I could make many points about women offenders in particular and why we need the measures to be put in place.  I am not in government so I cannot secure the measures.  The best I can do is put a requirement in the legislation that the supports would be provided.  There have been incredible results from other jurisdictions.  Schemes in England and Wales found that where supports were provided, young people attended all court hearings in 94% of programmes and in Canada more than 81% of people who were on the programmes attended their court cases.  Bail breaches for women who got supports in Glasgow and other places were reduced.  We know that women in particular who end up in the criminal justice system are themselves generally the victims of crime such as sexual abuse and violence.  Getting the supports for those underlying issues is key in the women avoiding custodial sentences and being able to rebuild their lives and address their offending behaviour.  I believe such an approach is a winner in terms of cost.</p></speech>

The Deputy's amendment seeks to oblige the Minister for Justice and Equality to undertake a review of bail supports available and to make costed recommendations to Government with regard to improving the provision of such services.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that there are no specific bail support schemes for adults, such as those outlined in her amendment, currently operating in the State.  They do not exist.</p> <p>  Having listened to what Deputy Daly said, I believe she has made some interesting points.  Perhaps it is something the committee might consider reporting on at some stage.  That might be helpful.  I will consider bail supports with respect to restorative justice and penal reform but at the moment such measures do not exist for adults.</p> <p>  I am advised that there are arrangements in place to assist persons with particular needs who may come before the courts.  In that regard I am advised that psychiatric reports may be provided for the courts which can, in particular, aid the courts in diverting people with mental illness away from prison.  In certain cases, the court may adjourn to allow the person to access appropriate treatment and bail may be granted on that basis.</p> <p>  Bail support schemes are more commonly considered in relation to young offenders.  In that regard, I understand that a bail supervision scheme has been introduced and is being rolled out on a pilot basis in the Dublin area.  This initiative operates under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The intention is to roll it out nationally in time.</p> <p>  That said, there are no bail schemes for adults, such as those outlined, currently in place and the Government has no plans to introduce any new measures in this area but I am interested in what the Deputy said and it should be explored further.  In addition, it is not appropriate to provide in statute that the Minister should make any particular recommendations to Government.  For those reasons I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment but she has raised some interesting topics I feel we could explore further down the line.</p></speech>

The Act will be reviewed within 24 months and it would not be beyond the scope of the Minister to look at the provision of bail supports for adults as part of the review.  I know the supports do not currently exist but we will be looking at the Act as a whole, which concerns the provision of bail, and part of the review could include the possibility of the introduction of bail supports for adults.  The statutory review exists and must be carried out within two years.  Perhaps the Minister of State would confirm whether my understanding of the statutory review process is correct.  If it is, we could address the issue through that process.</p></speech>

That is there in any event.  In this instance, there are no bail supports available so we cannot report on something that does not exist.  Bearing in mind interesting points the Deputy raised, perhaps the committee might be interested in exploring the matter further and coming back to us with some proposals.  I will talk to the T&aacute;naiste about having a look at it as well but we cannot report on something that is not actually happening.  We cannot accept the amendments as they stand because there are no bail schemes for adults.</p></speech>

Obviously, one cannot review nothing.  That is a pretty serious indictment of our system.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that this is the key way to ensure that bail conditions are adhered to and it works particularly well with vulnerable groups.  We have the children and young people's part, which is key, but those with chaotic lifestyles or drug addictions find it difficult to comply with the conditions.  If they get the intervention early on, all of the evidence shows that court appearances and adherence skyrocket.  As a result, what is proposed is an attempt to build this in because the normal statutory review after 12 or 24 months would not provide for a review of bail supports or an examination of that area.  I will look at the next stage.  I note what has been said and I am glad that it is deemed worthy of further consideration but I would still like to see something in this.  We would not call it a review but it would be an examination of the types of supports or something like that.  Other than that, we are not looking comprehensively at bail.  I accept the point that "review" is the wrong word in the context of the lack of adult services and that we might look at rewording it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.777" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#L01100"><p>I move amendment No. 9:</p><blockquote>In page 7, line 4, after &quot;reasons&quot; to insert &quot;in writing&quot;.</blockquote> <p>These amendments provide that a judge must give his or her reasons in writing for decisions to grant or refuse bail.  The reason they should be in writing relates to transparency.  It promotes public confidence in the system.  In some instances, it would give victims a greater understanding of why a judge reached a decision and would help to promote consistency in decision-making.  If we want to develop our data and understand better the current use of bail, this would help research in that regard.  I do not think it is unreasonable.</p></speech>

As she outlined, the purpose of amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is to require that the reasons given by a court for granting or refusing bail and for imposing any bail conditions under section 6 be in writing.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s reasons for wanting to include such a requirement.  She has outlined them.  The purpose of section 6 is to improve the information provided by the courts in bail hearings.  However, the effect would be to require that a written decision be given in respect of all bail hearings.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, most bail hearings take place in the District Court.  Written decisions are not the norm in the District Court and the volume of work involved in implementing the Deputy's proposal could be considerable.  It would have cost implications and, more importantly, could entail delays in the processing of cases before the court.  It is also worth noting that all District Court proceedings are recorded on the digital audio recording system so in circumstances where clarification of the reasons given is required or is in dispute, the record of proceedings will be there.  At the very minimum, consultation with the Courts Service of Ireland and the Judiciary would be required to identify any issues and to assess the cost and other implications before such a proposal could be included in the Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendments at this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.780" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#L01400"><p>I would like to provide a practical assessment of it.  A bail list appears approximately twice a week in the High Court.  Yesterday, the bail list in Cloverhill contained 22 applications.  If we just limit it to the High Court, that is dealt with on Mondays.  They are dealt with promptly and fairly and the judges have an understanding of what the law is, as do the practitioners.  If there was a requirement for a written judgment in respect of all of them, it would slow the process down considerably.  To deliver 22 written judgements in respect of the applications yesterday would mean that those applications could not be concluded or ruled on until such time as the written decision was given.  I understand the purpose behind amendment No. 9.  I think there is a recognition among criminal law practitioners as to what is the law in respect of the area of bail and the grounds upon which it will be granted.  There have been decisions in the High Court in respect of that.  However, if it is to be the case that there must be a written decision relating to every application, it will slow the entire process down and will probably be contrary to the interests of individuals applying for bail because at the time they apply for bail, they are in custody and it will take longer for them to be granted bail.</p></speech>

While recognising what Deputy Clare Daly is attempting to achieve, I think the process would be unrealistic.  It would be so cumbersome in nature that, effectively, it would be a case of justice forgone for many people because of the time delay in trying to implement a system that would probably be unworkable.  I can see the thinking behind it.  I just do not think it is a practical solution.</p></speech>

It would appear that the aim of the amendment is to ensure that separate reasons would have to be given for each condition rather than giving reasons for the imposition of conditions generally.  However, in the context in which it is used here, I am of the opinion that the meaning is the same and that the word "any" also takes account of circumstances in which no conditions beyond those that are mandatory are imposed.  I do not consider that the amendment would have any material effect on the provision and the wording used is that considered most appropriate by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am, however, happy to have my officials consult the Parliamentary Counsel on the alternate wording if the Deputy wishes and if she wants to revisit the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I accept that.  Having accepted that, there are issues in respect of the rights of the person involved - or even the victim - and his or her ability to access the thinking of the judge in that scenario and in the context of openness regarding getting the reasons behind a judgement in writing.  There is also an issue in respect of the lack of availability of digital recordings and people's difficulty in accessing information from the courts in that regard.  Perhaps that is a slightly separate issue.  The other issue that feeds into it is the lack of data relating to this matter.  We do not really have any research into the thinking behind it.  I note the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan.  People in the profession either know or have a fair idea of what is involved but there is no data in respect of the breaching of conditions and how often this occurs or with regard to research, accountability and monitoring what is happening.</p><p>Is there a gap?  What is and is not working?  It is partly in that vein that we put forward for inclusion the words "in writing", but I accept all of the points made about the practicalities.</p></speech>

The Schedule to the Bail Act 1997 sets out the list of offences which, if punishable by terms of imprisonment of five years or more, are considered to be serious offences for the purposes of a bail application.  The two offences which will be added to the Schedule by the amendment were both inserted into section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 by section 17 of the Road Traffic Act 2014.  They are effectively hit and run offences.  They target individuals who seek to avoid sanction by leaving the scene of a road accident having killed or injured an individual.  A person guilty of such an offence is liable under the Road Traffic Act to a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to seven years in the case of injury and ten years in the case of the death of a person.  These are very serious offences and, as such, appropriate for inclusion in the Schedule to the Bail Act.</p></speech>

I thank all of them for giving of their time.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before we commence, I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 is to be amended such that all those detected drink driving above a certain limit will be subject to automatic disqualification from driving, while those detected driving with alcohol levels between 50 mg and 80 mg will be subject to disqualification from driving for three months instead of receiving three penalty points, which is the current position.</p><p>I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.824" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#D00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to engage in a pre-legislative discussion of the Road Traffic (Fixed Penalty &ndash; Drink Driving) Bill 2017.  It is a short but important Bill.  I appreciate the opportunity to explain what it is about and look forward to hearing the committee's views on it.  It is also appreciated that it has taken it today as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  The proposals I have included in the Bill have already generated a great deal of comment.  Most members will be aware that they are supported by the Road Safety Authority, road traffic victims groups, the AA and the Garda.  Every member will have received a letter from the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority in support of the measures included in the Bill.  Unfortunately, certain vested interest groups, particularly the Vintners Federation of Ireland, have lobbied - often in a cynical manner - against it.  I will refer briefly to some of the matters which been brought up in public debate about my proposals and, where appropriate, clear up some commonly held misunderstandings.</p> <p>  I am not proposing to lower the alcohol limits.  The Bill is about ensuring proper consequences when people drive while above the existing limits.  The current limits are not changing, about which there is a misconception.  I have heard it quoted by some Deputies and have certainly heard it quoted on radio by some authoritative commentators that we are bringing down the limit; we are not.</p> <p>  Many have questioned whether the proposal will have a significant impact on road safety.  I am not claiming that the Bill is the only answer to the problem of drink driving, but what it will do is strengthen the law and remove the dangerous impression that those who drive over the limit can be allowed to keep driving right away.  To give an idea of the problem, between 2012 and 2016, 3,003 fixed penalty notices were issued to drink drivers in the 51 mg to 80 mg alcohol concentration bracket, with numbers increasing significantly during 2016.  Before someone says, as I am sure someone will - some already have - that he or she has doubts about these figures because of the recent issues with figures deriving from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the figures I am quoting are based on specific notices issued to specific individuals detected and arrested for drink driving offences and follow a determination of the detected alcohol levels by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS.  They are, therefore, absolutely reliable.  I hope no Deputy will, whether deliberately or mistakenly, attempt to create confusion between badly needed legislation which could save lives on the roads and an issue which relates to how garda&iacute; have reported on the numbers of roadside preliminary breath tests conducted.  I want to be absolutely clear that the data and research supporting the Bill are in no way related to the current controversy in the Garda.  In addition, the RSA's independent research shows that the incidence of drink driving among younger drivers is increasing.  This is based on an RSA survey and depends on the numbers who admitted to drinking and driving.  It is fair to suppose the numbers drinking and driving are likely to be higher than the numbers admitting to it.  Similar results were found in a recent survey conducted by the AA.</p> <p>  The RSA has also found that drink is a factor in 38% of road deaths.  Just to be clear, this is a figure from the RSA which depends on coroners' reports on road deaths.</p><p>The RSA has also established that at least 35 people died in collisions in the period from 2008 to 2012 which involved drivers being found responsible owing to alcohol levels between 21 mg and 80 mg.  Of these, 16 were in the 50 mg to 80 mg range.  Members will be aware that the RSA has recently written to them to ensure they are familiar with these facts and aware of misleading information.  When people ask what good the Bill will do, that is their answer.  If we could prevent 35 deaths in the next five years, would it not be worth it?  If we could prevent people from getting the idea that driving over the limit was acceptable and prevent them from going on to drive at higher levels, would it not be worth it?  I believe it would and suspect the families whose loved ones have been killed or severely injured in preventable traffic collisions would also agree.  A culture change in the way we view drink driving is required.  Having a law on the Statute Book which allows drink drivers to get away with penalty points rather than a disqualification says drink driving is not really serious in some instances.  Is that a message we wish to send?</p><p> A number of commentators and some Deputies have expressed concern that the Bill will somehow damage life in rural Ireland.  I encourage them to stop and think about it.  By far the highest number of alcohol related road deaths, 81%, occur in rural Ireland.  No part of the country would benefit more from the number of lives saved.  I want to save lives in rural Ireland.  The results of a national survey of my proposals which the RSA conducted in January this year are overwhelmingly clear in terms of the public&rsquo;s view on this issue.  The survey found that 91% supported automatic disqualification for all drivers caught driving over the limit, as I am proposing.  Support for my proposal in rural areas, at 93%, was a little higher than in urban areas, 89%.  The notion that this is an urban-rural issue is simply wrong.  Some legislators and certain vested interest groups such as vintners appear to be very much out of step with public opinion where drink driving is concerned.  In fact, the full findings of the RSA's survey show a public with little or no tolerance for drink driving in any circumstance.  I urge all public representatives to read the findings of the survey on the RSA website.</p><p> We are all aware of the worrying increase in the number of road deaths last year.  After 2015 which, at 162 road deaths, saw the joint lowest number on record, the number jumped to 188 in 2016.  Over a wider number of years we can identify a distinct pattern.  Starting from 2005 when there were 396 deaths, there was a decrease in every successive year until 2012 when 162 people were killed.  The years since have seen worrying fluctuations, with 188 in 2013, 193 in 2014, 162 in 2015 and up again to 188 in 2016.  The figures this year are not good.  They have not improved and, sadly, are above the numbers for the equivalent period last year.  Clearly, a long downward trend has been reversed.  We must examine why this is the case and how to get matters back on track.</p><p> The starting point has to be the fact, as recognised by all those who deal with road safety issues nationally and internationally, that there is no single factor in road deaths and no single solution.  As the factors affecting road safety are many, we must apply a range of solutions.  The bigger and more obvious problems have been dealt with.  Investment in infrastructure, particularly during the Celtic tiger economy years, has improved the quality of roads.  The driver learning process has been enhanced through the introduction of graduated driver licensing measures.  The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints and the lowering of alcohol limits have contributed to the downward trend in the number of fatalities.  The creation of the national car test, NCT, has improved the quality of vehicles.  Measures in these areas, and others, were probably responsible for the long downward trend in the numbers of road deaths between 2005 and 2012.  Further measures will be needed to restore the downward trend.  The current road safety strategy which runs from 2013 to 2020 contains a wide range of such measures.  Work is well advanced on a mid-term review of the strategy.  It will enable us to identify the areas where we must push harder to resume the pressure to reduce the number of unnecessary deaths occurring on the roads.  Where does this Bill fit in?  As members know, it addresses the question of drink driving.  Nobody will disagree that driving under the influence of alcohol is a major risk factor on the roads.  For some years there was a belief we were witnessing a culture change and that it had become less socially acceptable to drink and drive.  If that was ever true, it is not true anymore.  Drinking and driving is a major problem again and we must address it.</p><p> To be clear, nobody is saying drink driving is the only problem in promoting road safety or that the Bill, alone, is the solution to it.  However, it is a very important step forward in the campaign against drink driving and deserves to be considered and supported as such.  To summarise, there are many factors in ensuring road safety and many aspects to drink driving.  The Bill is not a solution to all of them and not meant to be.  It is a measure we can and should introduce now to save lives, take dangerous drivers off the roads and send the message that drink driving is never acceptable.  It is a good Bill which will have a positive impact.  It deserves to be introduced and supported as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.826" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1424" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#E00300"><p>The Minister brought foward this Bill nearly a month ago and I was probably the first politician who said it could be seen as anti-rural.  I also said any measure that reduced the number of deaths on the roads was very welcome.  I pointed out that in the Minister's constituency of Dublin South one could hail a taxi, take a bus or walk to the pub.  In the town in which I live I cannot avail of public transport.  I highlighted the fact that the legislation could be seen as anti-rural.  Many people have a difficulty with it.</p> <p>  I was a member of the Vintners Federation of Ireland 20 years ago before I got involved in politics.  I did not agree with many of its policies, but the federation represents a lobby group and is a vested interest.  The Minister mentioned it twice.  Sometimes people attack bankers and vintners, but it is unfair that the federation has been attacked twice.  It is a lobby group and does its best to be proactive and measured in difficult circumstances.  It is fully aware that drink driving is most unwelcome.  The committee has had representatives of the RSA and many other groups and the Minister appear before it.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland has asked to appear before it and I believe its representatives should be invited to the meeting next week to give their side of the story.  Legislation is great, but legislation that is rushed or not seen to take account of all sides of an argument is bad.  The federation appears to think some of the figures being bandied about are wrong.  We should, therefore, give it the opportunity to correct the relevant figures.  I do not know what the figures are, but it has an issue with the ones released by the Department.</p> <p>  In referring to what good the Bill would do the Minister asked if it would be worth it if we could prevent 35 deaths in the next five years.  Yes, it absolutely would be worth it.  I remind members that we introduced an air ambulance service in Roscommon and Athlone three or four years ago and it has saved 500 lives.  However, it was not contentious.  Anything that can be done to reduce the number of deaths on the roads is very welcome.</p><p>A total of 81% of alcohol-related road deaths occur in rural Ireland.  Most people who drink and drive are driving in rural Ireland because they do not have public transport.  I am certainly not condoning it but the figures are balanced in such a way that it is urban against rural.  If I was coming from rural Ireland or was a politician from rural Ireland, I would ask myself what is going on.  We are getting into the wrong situation regarding the figures.  </p><p> I want to put on the record my belief that anything that can be done to reduce road deaths and deaths from drink-driving must be supported but we must ensure that all sides, regardless of whether we agree with them, are afforded the opportunity to put across their points of view.  If we do not agree with them and they do not stack up, that is fine.  I said it would be contentious.  I believe the Minister is acting in good faith to try to reduce road deaths but we need to look at all sides and ask all sides for their views.  The vintners are a vested interest group, as are the IFA, the IPU and many other groups, so we should not denigrate them and say "ah, well, why wouldn't they?".  The vintners have the same thoughts and views as most politicians and people in the Department.  They know that drink-driving is wrong and are doing as much as they can.  Perhaps they could have done more over the years but an awful lot has changed in the past ten years.  I will get no thanks for protecting the vintners but sometimes in politics, we need to look at both sides of the argument to ensure all sides are heard.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.829" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#F00300"><p>I thank Senator Feighan for what I believe is a very balanced approach to this Bill.  I can see the argument about it being anti-rural and the majority of the opposition to it seems to be coming from rural areas.  It is quite understandable.  We all know the reasons for that.  The pub is such an integral part of rural life and such a centre of the community, more so than in urban areas, and people feel that any anti-drink-driving legislation is an attack on that.  First of all, that is not the purpose of this Bill - quite the opposite.  Rural life and rural communities are priceless and we must do nothing that damages them.  I mean that quite genuinely.  I pointed out in my opening remarks, as did Senator Feighan, that this is not an urban-rural divide.  The Behaviour and Attitudes polls from which I quoted show that over 90% of people in rural areas are behind this type of measure.  In fact, the figure is slightly higher in rural areas.  I do not know why but my guess is that this is because more people in rural Ireland are touched by deaths caused by drink-driving than in urban Ireland.  I do not distinguish between any human life.  The loss of one is utterly appalling and tragic but the fact is that statistically speaking, if and when this Bill is passed, it will benefit rural Ireland more than urban Ireland because more people are dying in rural Ireland than in urban Ireland as a result of drink-driving.  That is the answer I have to give.  I know that a lot of the opposition to this Bill, the extent of which I do not know, comes from rural areas but it is misplaced.  According the scientific evidence we have, which is forensic surveys, people living in those areas are behind the legislation even if many of their representatives are not.</p> <p>  The vintners are a lobby group and I understand why they oppose it.  They serve alcohol and that is why they oppose it.  I would challenge them.  They have a vested interest and do not make any bones about it.  They are utterly wrong to oppose it.  I wish the vintners would play a constructive role in the reduction of road deaths - not by opposing this but by organising publicans to arrange transport home for people who come to pubs, as many publicans do, and help to preserve the rural community in that way in order that people do get to the pubs and have a drink but also to make sure they go home and do not drive.  I am not surprised by their intense lobbying but it is naked self-interest, which one can only expect from business groups.  Although it is not up to me but to the committee to decide, the Senator's suggestion that they should come in here is a very good one.  I think the vintners should be heard but they should not just be heard but challenged.  This is what would be useful if it does not delay this Bill because it is urgent.  More people are dying all the time and this Bill aims to prevent that.  I think inviting them in is a very good idea because if they are challenging some of the figures I have laid before the committee, it is good because we can stand over every single one of them.  They are not provided by any flawed sources.  They are provided by reputable bodies like the RSA, the World Health Organization and the AA.  If the vintners want to challenge them, they should be given that opportunity and I would welcome it.  The committee should invite them in but I ask members to challenge them because one of the great myths about this Bill is that we are changing the levels.  We are not changing them; the levels will remain the same.  We are simply changing penalty points for disqualification.  We are sending out a message is that if people drink and drive, they will be disqualified.  I would have thought that the vintners would agree with that, which is why I am puzzled that they do not seem to agree with the principal point in this Bill.  Was there anything else?</p></speech>

It was not frowned upon.  I used to always remark that people gave up drink-driving not because they could kill themselves or somebody else but because they would lose their licence or their insurance would go up.  We need legislation to address it.  The Minister said that drink-driving is a major problem again.  Based on what I am seeing on the ground in Roscommon, Leitrim and Galway, I do not think it is.  Perhaps the Minister has facts but it now is socially unacceptable for anybody to drink and drive.  Perhaps I am wrong but I do not think I have been in a situation in the past two or three years where I have seen anybody drinking and driving.  Most people up to the age of 35 or 40 and who do not drink-drive must be commended but it was a huge issue.  I am surprised to hear those figures because I would have thought drink-driving was decreasing over the years.</p></speech>

We have not included the figures for drugs, although there was a Bill introduced at the end of last year, as the Senator knows, which means that we will find another ingredient.  However, we have not got the figures for those and they are not included in this at all.  The only figures we have show a marked increase, particularly in 2016.  Between 2012 and 2016, 3,003 fixed penalty notices issued to drink drivers in the 51-80 mg per 100 ml alcohol concentration bracket, with numbers increasing significantly during 2016.  Those figures are tested by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, which is not any flawed body.  We have got an increase-----</p></speech>

I have seen two figures.  One was 758 and the other was 617.  The sum of 617 was quoted as being from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 758 was in the regulatory impact assessment.

I know about the severity of the issue at stake here.  I appreciate the figures the Minister has put before us today.  I can assure him that he is playing a game of David versus Goliath with his role as Minister and his access to the media.  Within a few days of the last committee meeting in February, he accused us of trying to turn the roads into the Wild West.  I have not changed my view.  I still have further questions for the Minister.</p> <p>  In light of the recent revelation with regard to figures being bandied about on statistics of breathalysers and crime figures, I feel that the Minister should hold back on this until all the issues around the statistics provided by the Garda are fully correlated and corrected.  I have one question for the Minister about the recent survey by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes he mentioned, which I think was conducted on behalf of the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The Minister gave the answers, but what were the questions?  The answers showed that people are against drink-driving, but what were the limits given?  What were the questions like and what limits were they using with regard to asking people their attitude towards drink-driving?  Was it just a broad question?  Everybody is against drink-driving.</p> <p>  I ask that the legislation not be amended.  I have been through this before.  First, there is the case of the person who has a good night the night before.  He goes home early, getting a taxi home.  He gets up the following morning and is heading to work of the assumption that he is in good order.  He hits a checkpoint and lo and behold he slightly tampers the breathalyser bottle.  He comes under the 51-80 mg measurement bracket.  The Minister stated in his previous letter to us in February that people are not recognising that penalty as being a stick to stop a person from doing the same thing again.  However, I cannot get any proper figures off the Minister or the Minister for Justice and Equality on this.</p> <p>  The Chairman has always said that different figures have been bandied around.  I asked other questions of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  She told me that the Garda was in a position to put those figures together.  Despite this, we have seen in the past two weeks that figures are wrong in other areas of road traffic.  There is inconsistency in the figures being bandied about.  I am of the belief, as the Garda Commissioner herself said last year to the Committee on Justice and Equality, that having a Garda presence is as much a deterrent as having garda&iacute; go out, harass people and catch them.  There is something to be learnt from that.  It is about enforcing the law by presence as opposed to catching people.  It is often seen as a deterrent.  I ask the Minister to enforce the existing legislation.  There was more legislation before the D&aacute;il before Christmas regarding drug-driving and other issues of people driving with no insurance and people who are off the road.  We need to enforce the existing legislation.  The Minister can then come back to us and tell us that the whole system is not working.</p> <p>  The issue of rural Ireland is very important here.  It is at a standstill again at the moment because of the bus strike.  There was a survey done in County Clare a number of years ago on people's interpretations of the drink-driving laws.  The Minister will have more people inside mental institutions if he enforces this law.  We are losing post offices and we are losing the small shops in the villages.  The pub is the final meeting place left in many villages.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal and act on the existing legislation.  I will not say any more because, no matter what I say, the Minister is going to drive on.  I feel I am in the position of David versus Goliath.  The Minister has pen to paper at his will every weekend.</p> <p>  I wish to make a comment.  When the Minister came before us in February, I had no lobby from the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  I responded that day from my own thoughts and thinking on the damage that the Minister will do to rural Ireland if he brings in this measure.</p></speech>

People may not feel they are impaired and may be in a somewhat different mental condition but they are still impaired.

The Deputy was talking about the Garda presence.  He is right about enforcement.  It is really important.  If the law is not enforced or seen to be enforced, people will take risks with drinking and driving.  That is part of the equation and must be addressed.  The Deputy is probably aware that after testing carried out by the Garda over the Christmas period showed the level of drink-driving was up 35% during that period, the Garda pledged that enforcement would go up, which it has.  The Garda has committed to increasing enforcement by at least 10% this year.  It is being addressed.  It is not my job to interfere with what the Garda does but we have a meeting with the Garda every couple of months and we ask questions on what is being done about enforcement.  The enforcement rates are increasing.  It is not part of this particular Bill but I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that it is part of the road safety puzzle.  I will reiterate what the Deputy says in that regard at every single meeting I attend with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and with an assistant commissioner of the Garda.  It is very important.  These things have to move in tandem.  We are only a small part of that jigsaw but we are an important one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.864" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#H00500"><p>Deputy Troy cannot be here today and sends his apologies.  Fianna F&aacute;il take road safety very seriously.  We have taken many steps through policy and legislation to try to address and change behaviour over the years.  That is evident from the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, the campaigns that were put in place in that regard and the halving of annual road deaths between 2005 and 2015.  In the past two or three years, there has been some regression in terms of the progress being made.  However, much of that comes down to the fact that it is important to take road safety seriously, to approach it on an evidential basis in terms of the rationale for measures and to ensure there is enforcement of the laws that are in place.  In 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward legislation to reduce the alcohol limit and put in place the current structure of a gradated penalty regime ranging from fixed penalty notices to various levels of disqualification depending on the testing being carried out and the results of that testing.</p> <p>  I seek further information on the basis for and approach to bringing this proposal.  The Minister indicated that 3,000 fixed penalty notices were issued between 2012 and 2016.  The Minister said there has been a change in attitudes in recent years and that people have become more flaith&uacute;&iacute;l in their approach to drink-driving.  If that is the case, it must be tackled.  Could the Minister give us the basis for saying that people are becoming more tolerant of drink-driving?  Could he give us details of the fixed penalty notices over the past four or five years which indicate that?  Can he comment on how he can make that assumption without comparing it with enforcement levels?  Has he looked at that?  I know there is the issue of reports but how can the Minister be clear in respect of that evidence given?  It is key that one looks at the enforcement level versus the convictions, as well as penalty point issuances.  Can the Minister deal with that and flesh it out?</p> <p>  That is the key point.  It is important to look at the evidence.  There is no doubt that enforcement is key in ensuring members of the public comply with the laws that are in place.  The Minister has indicated there were 3,000 fixed penalty notices.  As for testing positive for higher levels of alcohol, can he indicate how many people were in different categories in this regard and were prosecuted and brought to court?  The Minister indicated that because penalty points do not involve a mandatory disqualification, people are taking the risk of incurring them.  Can the Minister flesh out why that is the case?  Experience indicates that the public are very much aware of the dangers of drink-driving, that attitudes have been changing and regardless of whether it is a fixed penalty point or the potential of being put off the road, these are real deterrents in the eyes of the public.</p></speech>

I can give Deputy McConalogue some tables to support them.  The figure of 3,003 fixed penalty notices is based on drivers who have been tested by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, so that figure is incontestable.  In terms of drivers who have taken three penalty points plus the &euro;200 fine, the figures show there were 531, 563, 501 and 613 such drivers in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  There is a gradual trend toward that figure being far too high.  Non-specified drivers are a different category.  They are learner drivers and people who drive professionally.  In that category, the figures for such drivers were 356, 339, 315 and 350 in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  The total number of drivers arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving was 7,962, 7,697, 7,419 and 8,063 in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.</p><p>According to the other evidence, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stepped up enforcement during the Christmas period, I think the number of arrests for drink-driving increased by 35%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.867" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#J00200"><p>I ask the Minister to comment on the point I made.  He makes the case that the fact the punishment for drink-driving is three penalty points rather than disqualification for a period of at least three months is leading to more people falling into this category and, as I think he said in his opening remarks, abusing that provision.  Given the figures, how does he back up his case that this is a factor?  If one considers the number of fixed penalty notices issued, which is less than 10% of the total number of people arrested in those years, there seems to be a correlation regarding increases and decreases year by year in that more fixed penalty notices are issued in years in which more people are arrested.  Therefore, it seems to correspond to enforcement.  Will the Minister flesh out how he deduces that the fact the punishment is a fixed number of penalty points as opposed to a disqualification of at least three months is an issue and that the measure he proposes would address it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.868" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#J00300"><p>There is no doubt that the figures I have given the Deputy, certainly in 2016, have risen in every case.  The key figure is the number in this category who have died, which from memory is 35 over four years.  It averages about seven per annum in this category.  We believe closing this loophole will reduce the number of deaths.</p> <p>  I wish to make another key point.  The figures and the deaths are bad enough, but the message delivered, including through the 2010 Bill introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, which was a good Bill in many respects, was that some people do not get disqualified because offences in the 50-80 mg bracket are somehow lesser offences.  However, we know from these figures, including the figure of 35 deaths, that fatalities are occurring in this bracket.  Therefore, by making the penalty stricter, we have an extraordinarily good chance of saving lives, and that is the key figure and the key message.  One can adjust the statistics year by year but one must send out a message that drink-driving is not acceptable and that there is no middle way whereby it is okay to drive under the influence if one is in the 50-80 mg bracket and it is one's first offence.  It is not okay, and such people must be taken off the road.  Realistically, one is impaired at that level.  My instinct would be to bring the limit to zero.  I would prefer to do so.  One is impaired if one takes a very small amount of alcohol.  That is the reality.  To send out the message that offences in the 50-80 mg range are somehow lesser offences will encourage people to drink and drive and will not be a disincentive to them going on the road after drinking.</p></speech>

The Minister's key point is that the 50-80 mg range is being abused in some way.  There were 613 fixed penalty notices issued last year.  Meanwhile, more than 8,000 people were actually arrested for drink-driving.  This equates to 12 or 13 times more people who were way over the limit and who were in the fixed penalty points system.  I am just seeking to understand why the Minister believes the 50-80 mg range is being exploited, is not a deterrent and is not decreasing that number.  Regarding the figure of 35 road deaths under the 80 mg limit, is it correct that 16 had a blood-alcohol content of between 50 mg and 80 mg and 19 were beneath the bracket and outside of the current penalty regime altogether?</p></speech>

The message we are trying to send out is that everybody detected will be disqualified.  I am not making a distinction.  The whole point is to make no distinction.  There is a distinction in quality and degree, but I am trying to abolish the distinction to make it acceptable.  I am trying to tell people they should not do it and that if they do, they will be put off the road.  That is the whole point I am trying to make to the Deputy.  I am not saying there is a degree to this.  Those who drink and are over the limit while driving will be disqualified.  I do not want any other message to go out.  That is it - full stop.  I do not want to play around with figures in any way.  I do not want people to think they can drive after having a pint or two pints.  I do not want anyone to be able to say it will be fine, he or she will take three penalty points and &euro;200 and then be back on the road.  That is a totally unsuitable sentence for such behaviour when one's driving is impaired.  That is the point we are trying to make.  It is quite simple.  That distinction should be abolished.  I know the reasons it was introduced in 2010, I think they were wrong and I think there was political pressure.  We are seeking to remove this kind of leniency for people which exists for no good reason.</p></speech>

It relates to the lack of resources.  We were discussing the figures earlier.  Does the Minister believe that because of the lack of resources, the consequential implementation of any legislation suffers?  Does the Minister believe the figures could be higher were it not for the lack of resources?  I realise the Minister referred to a 10% increase in the Garda traffic corps this year.  However, that has not been delivered as of yet.  When will we get it up to the levels required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.906" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#K02300"><p>The lack of resources must be a factor.  The pledge relating to 10% was to do it by the end of the year.  The idea was to increase it by 10% by the end of this year.  It evident, I suspect, from the fact that when the Garda steps up the campaign, it gets more convictions and arrests.  The more resources that are applied, the more people are convicted.  The Garda needs more and we would get more convictions as a result of that.  It would consequently benefit the level of road deaths by taking people off the road.  There is a need for more patrols and checkpoints.  No one is contesting that point.</p></speech>

At the same time, he does not have the resources to implement it.  Is the Minister at loggerheads with the Minister for Justice and Equality on this matter?  I put this point to the Minister before.  He can bring in all the legislation in the world, but it does not matter unless the relevant bodies have the appropriate resources.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Minster for Justice and Equality has addressed the issue with the same concern and vigour as him?  The suggestion was made that the Garda traffic corps may have an extra 10% by the end of the year.  That is a big "may".  The chances are that the force will not get that.  Is the Minister for Justice and Equality taking it as seriously as the Minster for Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p></speech>

We aim to get higher than that as well, and I think we probably will.  It is not simply a matter of resources.  If we had more resources, for example, checkpoints on every road every night, it would help a great deal.  Is that not right?  If a driver thought that the moment he walked out of the pub a checkpoint would be in place, it would make a difference.  Obviously, we cannot do that.  There is a limit to the amount of resources available.  However, it is about creating the environment whereby people accept that there is a very good chance of being stopped and tested.  This is accompanied by the fact we are introducing legislation that will mean they are put off the road as well as other factors.  It is a question of the combination.  If Deputy Munster is asking me whether the commitment is in place and whether it is genuine and total, then the answer is "yes".  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda have given us that commitment.  I absolutely and totally accept that the 10% figure will be reached this year.</p></speech>

Does the Minister also accept that the perception exists among people that there is little or no chance of bumping into a Garda checkpoint?  We can see this in the way the figures have started to creep up again.  Many of these people take the risk of drink-driving.  They know there is little or no chance of checkpoints.  That is what I mean.</p> <p>  Bringing in legislation is one thing.  However, it is deemed ineffective or does not go anywhere near reaching its target if the Garda does not have the manpower on the ground.  That is common knowledge.  To refuse to admit as much is foolish.  It is common knowledge that people now know that there is little or no chance of bumping into a checkpoint on the road.</p></speech>

I realise the Minister's figures are not based on that, or so he says.  Given the serious anomalies in Garda breath-testing, we have to ask questions about the data.  We are bringing in legalisation when, clearly, as it stands, the data supplied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not reliable.  Indeed, they are clearly false in many instances.</p></speech>

They are impeccable, as far as we know.  There is no question mark over these sources and to question, say, the coroners' figures would probably be without any justification.</p></speech>

I want to address a number of issues.  A huge number of people want to be compliant but very often what they do not want is to be caught.  A question commonly raised is about people who are caught the morning after who believe they are compliant but who may be taking medication or even used mouthwash.  Zero may be the Minister's inclination but even mouthwash contains a degree of alcohol.  The way we calculate blood-alcohol levels is important and I believe a piece of work needs to be done in terms of other substances that would have an influence on that.</p> <p>  I was interested to read the statistics in the draft general scheme on driver fatalities between 2008 and 2012 which show that in terms of a blood-alcohol level of between 21 mg and 50 mg, 19 people were killed and six seriously injured.  That is 6.6%.  However, the figures for the higher blood-alcohol level of between 51 mg and 80 mg show that the numbers actually reduce.  I am not saying that the more drunk people get the more capable they are but that 21 mg to 50 mg figure is niggling me.</p></speech>

If we are looking at evidence, we should be sure about that evidence.  I know that when a fatality occurs, the Garda comes to the scene and a very detailed analysis is done.  Garda&iacute; will do co-ordinates to be sure of the exact location, whether it is daylight, if the road is wet, if a motorcyclist is involved and whether the person was wearing a helmet.  All of that information is recorded in a systematic way and inputted into the Road Safety Authority statistics.</p> <p>  Looking at alcohol levels on their own, I have a slight concern about that statistic.  If we looked at the statistic for a different number of years, it may show a different figure.  It is a small enough sample.  However, I would like an explanation on that and whether there is the potential for other statistics in that regard.  For example, in some categories, and they tend to be professional drivers, people with a blood-alcohol level of 20 mg are being put off the road.  The professional driver is far more likely to come up against road checks and be breathalysed because they travel on the road more often.  I am questioning that.</p> <p>  Obviously, there needs to be a targeted approach.  I was interested to see the statistics on page 30 of the Road Safety Authority's document on motorcyclists.  More motorcyclist collisions occurred between 5 p.m and 6 p.m. on a Sunday than at any other time of the day.  The targeted approach to apprehending people in terms of road checks must be stressed.  How evenly spread are the checkpoint locations over the weekend and during the week?  It is all very well having a law but if the law is not enforced or it is enforced in a haphazard way, it will not achieve the intention.  People are concerned about being caught going to work in the morning if they have had a drink the night before.  They may want to be compliant, and they hope and believe they are compliant, but they could be caught with very low levels of alcohol in their blood and be put off the road.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  There is a belief that those people were not the original intended target.  Are there other reasons for impairment, given the statistics?  That is the reason I ask that question.</p> <p>  I spoke to a number of garda&iacute; and former garda&iacute; over the past while about a range of issues, not necessarily about those before this committee.  Garda&iacute; in rural areas will tell one about the close relationship they have with the community and part of the reason there may be a flaw in the statistics in that they do not want to upset that relationship with the community.  When the work is done on the 1 million tests that did not happen, we will know whether there is a geographic pattern to that but there is no point in having the law if it is not enforced.  That will bring it into disrepute.</p> <p>  On another issue, there was a case reported in my local paper recently involving somebody who tested positive for a fairly high blood-alcohol level.  The case was thrown out of court because the machine in the Garda station was not calibrated within a defined period.  That type of thing drives people nuts because while there is acceptance, and the Minister referred to the level of acceptance regarding the survey that has been done, if a case is brought to court as a result of garda&iacute; doing their work in apprehending the person but the case is thrown out a result of inadequate training or calibration of a machine, that is a problem.  I would like the Minister to take a note of that because some sort of regime must be put in place to make sure that does not happen again.</p> <p>  The statistic I referred to is on page 29.  A total of 9% of collisions occurred between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., indicating the presence of alcohol the morning after socialising.  It may be the case that people take medications at a particular time of the day, and if alcohol is one of the ingredients in the medication, they should not be driving.  That may account for something other than the statistic given in this document.  That is why there should be some rigour with regard to the kind of circumstances, other than people out socialising, that are likely to account for some of that.</p><p>Are any other statistics collected from people when they are breathalysed regarding what medications they might be on?  It could be a factor.  The data we have to work with must be robust.  While I would not question the toxicology tests that the coroner carries out, there are other statistics that merit some consideration.</p><p> I know that the doubling of the numbers reported in terms of breathalysing is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are frequently told that crime rates are falling.  If the number of negative tests is inflated, the crime statistics will be skewed and may actually be wrong.  The crime statistics upon which we rely are then all open to question.  It is not just that a million tests are registered as having been carried out; the problem is that this skews the results as well.</p></speech>

Although a lot of them are really more appropriate for the Department of Justice and Equality, I will certainly take them on board.  We will consider them when we are drafting the legislation.  We are not using the statistics to which she is referring for this particular Bill, which is very short.  If the Deputy can point out any place where the matter could be relevant for this Bill I would be happy to consider it.  I think it is not.  While the points the Deputy is making are appropriate and right, I do not think they are relevant to this Bill.  We are not depending on those Garda statistics but on others from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, the Road Safety Authority, RSA and coroners' reports.  I do not think they are being challenged by anybody at all.</p> <p>  The issue of driving on the morning after was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I acknowledge it is a constant cause of difficulty and people feel it is an injustice but nonetheless, they are still impaired.  People who are arrested the morning after and found to be above the limit are committing an offence specifically because they are still impaired.  Just because they have had a short night's sleep does not mean they are not impaired.  I understand 14% of alcohol-related fatal crashes are reported between 6 a.m. and 12 noon.  There is plenty of evidence that those people should be picked up, even though they may feel they are in a different condition themselves.  The alcohol is still in their blood.</p> <p>  I do not know anything about mouthwashes.  I suspect it is not enough to get someone over any limit.</p></speech>

The Deputy cited figures based on a group of 35 people, of whom 19 were in the 21 to 50 mg bracket and 16 were in the 51 to 80 mg bracket.  I find that interesting.  I am not sure what to read into it.  If it tells me anything, it is that anyone over 21 mg is impaired.  A statement from the World Health Organization, WHO, which is another authority which I respect - it is not from the Garda - notes the risk of impairment starts at very low levels of alcohol consumption and rises exponentially with alcohol intake.  This is what is so worrying and makes me think the levels should be brought down.  We are not bringing them down in this Bill.  Drivers with a blood alcohol content, BAC of between 20 and 50 mg, which is where the 19 people come, have at least a three times greater risk of dying in a vehicle crash.  This risk increases to at least six times greater with a BAC between 50 and 80 mg and rises exponentially.</p></speech>

Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  I am asking what are the components of that particular table.  Is it only alcohol or were other things tested for?  According to those statistics, it seems that driving is more risky with lower BAC levels than it is with higher levels .  That is jumping out at me.  Are there other circumstances to consider?  If we are going to be evidence-based on this, can we at least have some understanding of why that is the case?</p></speech>

There should be zero tolerance of drinking and driving.  I cannot understand how anyone can support the idea that it is okay to drive while having drink, no matter how little drink was taken.  It is about time we realised that it is simply not acceptable to take control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  If we save even one life as a result of this legislation we will have done a good job.  To me it is black and white.  If, God forbid, a person is involved in a fatal car accident and that person has alcohol taken, he or she should accept the punishment.  I fully support the Minister.</p> <p>  Can the Minister give the committee a timeline for the introduction of this legislation?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017040500002#N01100"><p>The Minister wondered why the number of fatalities increased last year.  The massive increase in the volume of traffic on our roads has certainly contributed to that.  The longer distances people now have to drive to work also contributes to it.  Our roads are not adequate for the volume of traffic or the size of vehicle using them at present.  Bridges in many parts of the country were built over 200 years ago.  They are not fit for today's traffic and certainly contribute to accidents occurring.  There is also a problem with bends and junctions.  At one bend in Glenflesk, there have been five fatalities.  The camber of the road is wrong but nothing has been done about it even though many members of Kerry County Council highlighted the fact at meetings.  There are also the junctions around Killarney.  I am simply giving the Minister the examples I am aware of that have caused, and are still causing, accidents and fatalities.  Bends and junctions must be addressed.</p> <p>  If the Minister wishes to reduce the number of fatalities on the roads, he and his Department will be very busy because there is much work to be done.  If he has everything so right that he can say that a fellow who has had two or three glasses of beer or Guinness is the cause of all the fatalities and trouble on the roads, then I must tell him that there are many other things to be considered.  Indeed, somebody told me the other day, and it is a fact, that because of the height requirement for the car's headlamps when they are tested for the NCT many of us drive most of the time with dipped lights.  That means one can see no more than 30 m ahead because they are too low.  That is the result of us complying with the laws that apply for the NCT.</p> <p>  People are frustrated when trying to overtake.  One cannot overtake on a road, day or night, because of the amount of traffic both ahead and oncoming.  If one is in a large vehicle, there is nowhere on the side of the road to pull in and allow traffic pass.  It has been decided by the NRA in recent times that the roads can only be a certain width.  We are trying to widen them.  When a stretch of road was being redone recently, the NRA would not let us widen it any further.  As a result, there was no place for a slow moving vehicle to move in and allow the traffic to flow.  These matters must be considered.</p> <p>  I do not rely on the figures the Minister has given us today for a number of reasons.  I would like to see how they are compiled.  The Minister said that 35 people were killed between 2008 and 2012 because of individuals who were in the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket.  We need to know whether there was some poor unfortunate person who drank four or five pints and, when walking home, fell in front of a car for some reason or was lying on the road when the car came along.  Perhaps the driver of the car drank a pint or one and a half pints.  He would have been blamed for that fatality.  Many pedestrians have been killed over the years.  That is because our roads are not adequate for pedestrians in the first instance.  We are not allowed to cut the bushes so pedestrians are walking practically half way out on the road because the briars and bushes are sticking out.  Some other do-gooders will not let us cut the bushes other than during a couple of months of the year, and they are not even being cut then.  The Minister must consider that.</p> <p>  Then there is the case where a fellow is driving home on his own side of the road after drinking a pint or two or three glasses.  He is on his own side of the road when a lunatic driving at 100 mph on the other side of the road crashes into him, resulting in a fatality.  It is the fellow who drank the pint or the half pint who is blamed and it is deemed to be an alcohol-related accident.  There is also the case of the fellow who is travelling home after having one pint and he hits black ice.  When the story is told, again, it is and alcohol-related incident.  I want to know the make-up of the Minister's figures.  He should go back and check them.  I do not believe that it is a person who drinks one pint or a pint and a glass or three glasses.  In rural Ireland, that has been the only option for the past number of years.  The only outlet an old man, a single man or a single lady had in the country was to go to the pub and have the three glasses.  I assure the Minister that they drove home carefully and that they have not been the cause of the accidents he mentions.  I have a good grasp of what happens in my neck of the woods and I travel a fair amount of ground.  I know that nobody caused a fatality after drinking three glasses of Guinness.</p> <p>  If the Minister does this to the people in rural Ireland, he will isolate them further.  They are isolated enough already.  Many of them would not know that their neighbour down the road was dead were it not for the death notices on the Kerry radio station every morning at 8 a.m.  That is how isolated they are at present.  They have no other outlet.</p><p>It is a very serious matter for someone in rural Ireland to lose his or her licence.  Such people do not take their licence lightly and they have been obeying the law.  The people who take three glasses have not caused the 35 accidents as the Minister states and in the way it is presented to us.  I believe it has been happening in different ways.  We know what happened because we are on the ground.  It was the black ice and the fellow with the one pint, or it was where the pedestrian was maybe after having a few drinks or something else happened to him, he fell out on the road and he was before the driver who came along and who was driving after having a pint and a half pint.  The Minister should address those issues and check those figures because I firmly believe, and I am very serious about it, that the person with three glasses or a glass of wine has not been causing the fatalities.</p><p> If the Minister wants to do something about the fatalities, there is a lot of work to be done.  There is savage speeding on the roads and the roads are not adequate.  There are bends and cambers on roads and many other things to be addressed.  The Minister would be very busy but should start and do everything in the proper order.  If he does those things he will see he is reducing the number of accidents and fatalities because that has not been done.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the National Roads Authority, NRA, have not been listening to us.  If the Minister wants to do good work in his term as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, he should address these issues because the issue in front of us is totally unnecessary at this time.</p></speech>

Much of what Deputy Healy-Rae says is right of course.  I agree.  There is speeding on the roads; he is right.  There are holes and dangerous black spots; he is right but there is also alcohol on the roads.  Alcohol is dangerous.  It impairs.  That is not an opinion.  That is a scientifically proven fact.  I accept what he says about speed, about there being dangers on our roads, about mobile telephones and all those other things but there is alcohol too.  Deputy Healy-Rae's blind spot is he does not accept that alcohol of any sort impairs driving.  That is a fact.  Were he to recognise that, we would be a long way nearer a solution to the problem.  This is not an attack on rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The Deputy cannot contest scientific facts: 80% of the fatalities referred to occur in rural Ireland, including in his own county.  Let us recognise that alcohol is damaging and an impairment to driving.  That is the first step he must take to recognise this problem.  He must also recognise that a very small amount of alcohol is an impairment to driving.  It does have inconveniences.  It is an obstacle to other activities.  I accept that but it saves lives.  This measure will save lives in rural Ireland principally.  That should be recognised.  If there are any difficulties for the fabric of rural Ireland, which the Deputy represents so successfully here, let us look at measures to remedy them.  Let us look at measures which help people get to the pubs and home in different ways but not to drive there if they are going to drink excessively.  Nobody is disputing that a tiny amount of alcohol impairs driving.  I would like to see a compromise whereby the Deputy says he accepts that and measures will be taken by the community or others to see that people still get to their pubs, their communities and their social life and get home safely.  These things are not irreconcilable.</p> <p>  The idea that I could give them a blanket three points, which is the same as they would get for driving over a white line in the middle of the road, when their driving is impaired is totally unacceptable to me.  I do not wish to change rural life in Ireland in any way by doing this but I do want to see that the Deputy's constituents, as well as constituents from Donegal to Kerry to west Cork and elsewhere, are protected from people who are driving under the influence.  That is what I want to do.  I want to send a message to them, quite straight, that if they do this they will be disqualified for a minimum of three months.  That is all because that is what applies to everybody else and I do not think the Deputy is fighting against that.  </p> <p>  Let me deal with some of the other issues which arose.  Most of them were to do with the-----</p></speech>

How sure is the Minister that it was not the black ice that caught the fellow only after drinking one pint and caused him to hit a bridge or a wall?  How sure is the Minister that this is not one of the 35?  How sure is he that it was not the case that a fellow going home, driving on his own side of the road was not hit by some mad driver doing 100 mph or 120 mph who crossed the road to his side?  How sure is he that some of what I am talking about is not included in those figures?  Perhaps most of them are.</p> <p>  That is what I want to check because while every member of the committee and the Chairman are entitled to their own opinions, I am saying loud and clear, I will say it everywhere and I have said it before, two glasses or three glasses of Guinness will not cause anyone to have a fatality.  If we are going to go down that road, the next thing we will be saying is that the cough bottle or medicines for the flu will be the cause of the accidents as well.  The Minister needs to get real about it and check out those figures because I know that what I am talking about is the truth.  I would not make such a case about it except that I know that no accident or fatality was caused by someone having two or three glasses of beer or Guinness.  I ask the Minister to check those figures because I do not think he has done that.  If he had, we would not be here at all today. </p></speech>

They are based on absolutely impeccable organisations of that sort, which are producing these figures.  It is absolutely incontrovertible - I am repeating myself &ndash; that alcohol impairs people.  In the 38% figure which I have given - and the Deputy is quite right, some pedestrians are included - 9% are pedestrians and 29% are drivers.  The proof is there.  The question is whether people in that particular bracket or degree of impairment should or should not be disqualified.  That is all.</p></speech>

I will not go over a lot of questions that have probably been covered already.  I can see value in certain things that Deputy Healy-Rae is saying but if there is evidence - I know he was disputing the evidence and asking whether it was the ice as against the pint of Guinness - and if it is totally evidence-based, it is very difficult to argue that something should not be done.  If this is brought in, there should be some type of sunset clause or in other words that people could come back in two years and state whether there have been improvements in that area.  If not, we must do everything to avoid more rural isolation.  If, however, one extra life is saved I will hold my hands up and say I have to agree with it.  We do not need to do it just for the sake of it because as the Minister has said, there are many different dynamics in the road safety issue and the fatalities on the road.</p></speech>

I have given a large number of figures here.  We can consider reviewing its effect at some stage.  That is certainly an interesting idea.</p><p>One can never tell exactly what the impact of this measure would be because the issue is multifaceted.  Many people have said enforcement and other areas are equally important in reducing the number of road deaths.  A review of this could certainly be considered.  The evidence is compelling, namely, that alcohol of any sort, of any degree, or of any amount impairs driving and is damaging to the driver.  At its basic level, this measure will reduce an anomaly.  This is just recognising a fact in the 50 mg to 80 mg range area.  That is all it is doing.  It is not doing any more than that.</p></speech>

We have to identify the right problem to bring down the death rate on our roads.  The Minister is saying his proposal  is one of the issues that would bring it down.  Those of us who live in rural Ireland may dispute that, but only time will tell.</p></speech>

The committee has been working in recent months on formulating a raft of proposals that will help address road safety in the country.  It is encouraging to see a Minister being so proactive and enthusiastic about this measure.  The committee's job is to ensure that what we are doing as an Oireachtas is evidence based and will be effective.  That is the basis for my questions.  We have the 2008 to 2012 statistics, as compiled by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in reference to alcohol-related accidents, although they may not be the best ones to mention given that there was a change in the law in the final two years and ten months of that reference period from the end of October 2010 to the end of 2012.  With respect to the fatalities caused by 16 drivers who were found to have a blood alcohol reading in the 51 mg to 80 mg range, which averages three out of the 215 per annum over that five year period, how many of them were specified drivers in terms of the 20 mg maximum limit for the final two years and ten months of that reference period?  Does the Minister have that information?</p></speech>

It is important because we need to recognise that there was a change in the law just after the midpoint of that reference period.  Therefore, the new law may have applied to some of those 16 drivers who had a blood alcohol reading in the 51 mg to 80 mg range.  Therefore, the current proposed change would not have applied to them in that they would have been in a lower cohort.</p></speech>

Using the number of arrests and the number of fixed penalty notices decisions made by motorists is not the best basis for the argument.  The year 2015, like 2012, was equally the safest year on our roads since records began, accepting that every life lost is one too many.  A total of 501 fixed penalty notices were issued in 2015, which is quite a contrast to 2012, when we had the same fatality figures but a lower rate of arrests.  That illustrates the point I am making.  Basing the requirement for this change in legislation on an increase in the number of fixed penalty notices may not be sound given that we had far safer years on roads with much higher numbers of fixed penalty notices.</p> <p>  Moving on to my third question, of the fixed penalty notices issued to drivers found to be in the 50 mg to 80 mg range, how many of those were detected a second time after a three year period?</p></speech>

It would interesting to get those figures.  It would help inform the debate on this topic.  It would be helpful if we could get a breakdown of the subsequent readings.  Did they subsequently become specified drivers?  Were they found to be in the 20 mg to 50 mg, 50 mg to 80 mg, 80 mg to 100 mg or 100 mg plus ranges?

In other words, he was saying that people do not take any notice of the three penalty points, that they are not a deterrent.  The Chairman asked the Minister if there have been repeat offenders, and the Minister for Justice and Equality has said that she cannot answer that question.

The Minister made the point that the number of  young drivers being detected for drink driving is rising, but a higher proportion of young drivers are learner and novice drivers and many male drivers, for example, tradesman, would be professional drivers, who would fit into the 17 to 24, 25 to 34, and 35 to 44 age categories.  Those figures make up a disproportionately large number of the drink driving cases that are coming before the courts or being detected.  Does the Minister believe that the lower blood alcohol level requirement is having an impact and resulting in a different proportion in terms of the overall number of drink drivers, as it is a far lower limit?</p></speech>

This is what we are proposing to change now.  That is the only one where there is not an automatic disqualification.</p> <p>  The question I want to get to is this.  If we look, on the overleaf on Appendix 2, in terms of impacts, at the options, under item 3, there is no reference to impacts of an increase in court appearance, but looking at where one has automatic disqualification as distinct from the penalty points and fine issue, one has far lower payment rates.  Would one anticipate that there would be higher numbers of court cases as a result of the change in law?</p></speech>

There is the three-months automatic disqualification but in that same category, the minimum court punishment is six months.  I wonder will more drivers chance going to court because it is either three months off the road or six months off the road.  If one is off the road, one is off the road.  It is something that should be factored in as an impact and it is not in the regulatory impact analysis.  It should be in there.</p></speech>

It is something that needs to be factored in by both the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If one has 20% more court cases in the year, even based on the current figures, that is an extra 150 court cases.  That is extra Garda Traffic Corps time in the courts and longer periods for waiting for disqualification.  I am merely asking could one be into diminishing returns in certain areas here as a result of the change.</p></speech>

Has the Department, for example, considered an automatic disqualification if someone is driving 20 km/h or 30 km/h over the limit anywhere?  Would that not be more effective?  Considering the statistics - looking at the three fatalities per annum, while they are three too many - the Minister would save a lot more lives by incorporating something like that into the Bill as distinct from focusing on a narrow cohort of motorists.</p></speech>

I am merely saying that, looking at the analysis - I do not want in any way to sound crass or to deviate from the point that every life lost is one too many - I am not entirely convinced that the Minister's most effective measure is to target the 51 mg to 80 mg bracket with a change in the ramification.  In as short a piece of legislation, the Minister could have a far greater impact on driver behaviour and on the resultant figures.  I do not think that has being considered.

There has not been a reversal, it is a deviation.  As the Minister knows well, I showed how the figures for 2012 - when we had the safest year on the roads - were actually far higher in the number of fixed penalty notices served on those in the 51 to 80 years cohort than they were last year.  These things deviate.  The Minister sees them as a priority but looking at the facts overall there could be a far greater impact from looking at other areas than pursuing this.  It is something that has been overlooked.</p></speech>

There are so many factors involved in road deaths and many of them are being addressed.  Speed is one such factor.

What I am trying to get at here is that I do not believe that the thing which the Minister describes as an anomaly is an anomaly at all, and nor do most people.  Is there evidence within the Department, through correspondence from officials - prior to the Minister announcing this - which says that it has to be addressed as an anomaly.  I served as a Minister in this Department and I never heard of it.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his honesty.  It will save me from putting in a request for all correspondence regarding where it was stated that this is an anomaly.  It does not exist, obviously, and it is an anomaly because the Minister decided that he needed to deal with it.  That is his prerogative but it is an anomaly because he decided it to be so.  That clarifies matters.</p> <p>  The Minister is correct that there are lobby groups and vested interests.  When it comes to issues such as this, I listen to them but they do not formulate my decision for me.  There are two items of legislation before the Oireachtas which relate to the Vintners Federation, which is the biggest vested interest in this interest.  I support its opposition to one matter and vehemently disagree with its opposition to the other.  I have informed the federation directly as to how I feel about both.  I believe this is madness.  It is something that is without any justification.  I agree with the Chairman that it is not the number one priority.</p><p>If I were dealing with road safety issues, the number one priority would be getting into the detail and intricacy of some of the stupidity on the roads, including speeding and using mobile phones.  An issue that drives me mad is the use of hard shoulders, which actually causes a number of accidents and fatalities, particularly when not on motorways.</p><p> The Minister is obviously quite passionate about this Bill.  I attended a public meeting about it.  Deputy Jackie Cahill expressed the view that Fianna F&aacute;il would be opposing it.  I expressed the same view for Labour.  Virtually all the Independents there expressed the same view, and we have a number of them in Tipperary as the Minister knows.  Therefore the likelihood of this legislation ever seeing the light of day is probably very slim.  </p><p> I do not mind the fact that this is such a passionate issue for the Minister.  Fair play to him if that is what he believes, but can he see himself continuing in Government if this Bill is defeated?</p></speech>

How is the Minister's relationship with the Chair of the Road Safety Authority?  How often have they met?</p> <p>  The board of the Road Safety Authority is completely depleted.  I believe that the RSA board is not meeting its function as regards the expertise it requires to function.  I also believe that the RSA board believes that.  Given the Minister's views on boards - which I disagree with, but leaving that aside - does he not think that an exception should be made to his personal rules in one Department as regards ensuring that this board has adequate people on it with expertise on a range of issues, including engineering, road safety and how messaging is communicated?  Does the Minister not believe that the board needs to be ramped up to meet its actual requirements?</p></speech>

The authority has been very supportive of the Bill.  Members of the committee will have received a letter from them supporting this Bill and the measures therein.  It is evidence-based.  The chief executive of the Road Safety Authority supports this Bill and has written to the committee.  The chairman of the RSA, to whom the Deputy referred, is also totally supportive of this Bill.  We are working in exactly the same direction on the Bill, so there is no conflict there at all.</p> <p>  Although we have not had any real clash about it, I think we probably have a difference of opinion about how the board should be constituted.  </p></speech>

I think the chair has a different view, and that is a common view among a lot of semi-State bodies.  My view is that boards should probably be smaller than they are, including the Road Safety Authority.  I also think that boards should be selected in a very different way to how they have been in the past.  I am of the view that they should also include people who are users.  In this particular case I would very much like to see people on the board who have expertise in road safety because of what they have experienced themselves.  We will be looking for people like that.  That will be a novelty but I do not think it is necessarily an agenda which many State boards share.  However, I am determined that that should be done and that they will be selected in a way which reduces my own input to an absolute minimum.  I do not want to be accused or to in any way appoint people with whom I have common interests or who are friends or acquaintances.  I want them to be appointed on merit and that will apply to the Road Safety Authority as much as to any other State agency or State body.</p></speech>

We will also appoint people who have other expertise.  One of the problems, particularly in the area of road safety, is that they do not have enough people who have actually suffered.

I would like to appoint people who have experience and who have campaigned and crusaded for road safety.  If they have had a personal experience in that way, that makes them an even strong advocate for road safety, and a strong person on the board.</p></speech>

I have no issue with that.  I would actually agree with the Minister about putting some people like that on the board.  The fact is, however, that the Minister is in dereliction of his duty by not having appropriate people with expertise on the board of the RSA to implement this policy and other policies.  I am saying that directly to him as a serious concern.  I know it to be a serious concern of the board and the chairperson themselves.  I am asking the Minister, aside from politics, to please look at this differently.  He should get adequate engineering, safety and other experts onto this board, whoever they are - it is not an issue for me and nor is the process by which he does it.</p> <p>  I understand the Minister's thinking and I agree within him about people who have experienced trauma due to issues on our roads.  However, the board itself cannot give best policy and direction to this country given the way it is currently constituted.  That is an undeniable fact.</p> <p>  I have one brief question.  Obviously if this law were to come in, which it will not, it does give us a chance to be privy to this sort of thinking.  I would hope that the Minister will examine the issue of rural transport both within the capital and budgetary planning processes.  </p> <p>  I wish to mark two things on the Minister's radar.  One is to look at the process of funding rural transport across the country, given where Bus &Eacute;ireann is.  We do not know what will happen in the future and I will not even go down that road with the Minister, he will be glad to hear.      </p></speech>

The rural transport network has a huge future in delivering services in rural Ireland and needs to be expanded but it needs to be done in a way that is mapped out with all the services like Expressway and rail services so that there is interconnectivity.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  There is another thing the Minister should look at that may lead certain pressure groups to view him in a more favourable light.

A rural hackney scheme was in existence during that time.  This is basically a second type of licence in terms of ensuring there were rural hackneys in areas with no taxis.  We are talking about fairly remote areas.  Unfortunately, due to administrative issues, it never fully got off the ground.  I urge the Minister to look at how that could be enhanced.</p></speech>

There seemed to be a lot of red tape and stumbling blocks associated with it.  In the context of this Bill, the committee identified previously that there are very many places around the country that do not have somebody to drive people to or from places.  It is certainly worth consideration.</p> <p>  To conclude, I thank the Minister and his officials for their time here.  I appreciate that it was a very long meeting and their time is very much appreciated.  As the Minister is aware, a number of interest groups appeared before us prior to the heads of the Bill coming before us but the content of the Bill has been well flagged.  The committee decided to invite all those groups in for further observations based on what is now known.  In the interests of balance, the groups that have not been before us to date and that would have an interest in the Bill will come before us in the future as well.  At that point, we would hope to conclude the pre-legislative process.  </p></speech>
