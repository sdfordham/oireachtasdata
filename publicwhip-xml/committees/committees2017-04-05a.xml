On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and Ms Naomi Kennan, policy officer at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children; Mr. Terry Dignan, CEO and Ms Karla Charles, policy officer at Empowering People in Care, EPIC; and Ms Cliodhna O'Neill, director of policy and Ms Catherine Ghent, solicitor, from the ISPCC.  Ms Carol Anne Coolican and Mr. Keith Walsh from the family and child law committee of the Law Society of Ireland will be joining us.  I thank all the witnesses for attending today and extend a welcome to their colleagues in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask all members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting, as well as adversely affecting television and web streaming.  Any submissions or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I understand the witnesses will make a short presentation, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee on the heads of the Bill.</p><p>I invite Dr. Muldoon to make his opening statement.  We will then take opening statements from EPIC, the ISPCC and the Law Society of Ireland in that order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to present to the committee this morning.  Today we are discussing an extremely important piece of legislation that will have a major impact on the experiences of thousands of vulnerable children and young people in Ireland.  Before outlining the view of my office in respect of the general scheme, I would like to briefly outline the work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, OCO.<br/><br/>The OCO is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  We examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies.  We are independent and impartial, acting neither as an advocate for the child nor as an adversary of the public body; we respect and promote local complaints procedures, and we aim to achieve systemic change that addresses the root causes of complaints.  <br/><br/>In my work, I am statutorily obliged to consider the best interests of the child and to give due consideration to the wishes of the child, in accordance with age and understanding.  I also have a statutory remit to promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children.  This involves a number of actions, one of which is to advise on legislation, as I am doing today, and my advice is always informed by my obligation to promote children&rsquo;s rights.<br/><br/>Since our office was established, some of the most powerful and effective work we have done has been in hearing the voice of young people through consultations.  We carried out the &quot;Big Debate&quot; around the children&rsquo;s constitutional referendum, and we created <i>A Word from the Wise</i>, a collection of personal stories based on complaints we received and which we then presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Only last month, we published a report on scoliosis which included the powerful testimonies of three young people who had experienced significant delays before undergoing scoliosis surgeries.  What we have learned in our work is that young people have a lot to say, they can have great insight, and most important, their views about decisions that affect them almost always add to the success of the outcome.<br/><br/>I very much welcome the general scheme because the establishment of a nationally organised and managed guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL service at a statutory level is a crucial step towards ensuring that children and their rights are placed at the centre of judicial proceedings affecting them.However, in order to ensure that the national GAL service is child-centred, independent, accessible and transparent, I am recommending a number of amendments to the scheme as it stands.<br/><br/>Legislation that informs reform of the current system needs to be underpinned by recognition of guardians <i>ad litem</i>as being first and foremost a service for children to give effect to their constitutional and international rights.  It appears that the general scheme is based on an understanding of guardians <i>ad litem</i>as being primarily a service to the courts, with the function of providing support to the courts when they deem it necessary to inform their decision making.  This in no way reflects the reality that implementing the rights of children in judicial proceedings is not a choice for adults, but an important legal and constitutional obligation that must be fulfilled.  We must ensure that access to a GAL is first and foremost the right of a child affected by judicial proceedings, and then secondarily a service for the courts.  <br/><br/>It is our view that the optimal approach to putting in place a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is to establish and properly resource an independent statutory body.  Such a body would be given powers to establish a panel of guardians <i>ad litem</i>who can be appointed by a court in proceedings covered by the legislation.  A single, State-funded agency would ensure greater consistency across Ireland.  It would be independent and would provide a means to recruit, train and select GALs.</p><p>This system would allow for GALs to be employed on a salary and the legal costs of solicitors representing GALs to be better controlled.  It would also provide a means for quality control and oversight of the service.  This is in line with practices in England and Wales, where guardian <i>ad litem</i>services are managed by a non-departmental public body, which is accountable to the Secretary of State for Justice, known as the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, CAFCASS.<br/><br/>The establishment of an independent statutory body is important as the general scheme, as it currently stands, would allow for the procurement of a national service by a private body and would largely result in the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>for a long period of time, with all rather than the majority of GALs operating under the auspices of one external agency.  The establishment of an independent statutory body with the broad responsibility for providing children with access to independent representatives would also future proof the legislation, which is crucial.  It would ensure that it has the capacity to work towards fulfilling Ireland's international obligations to promote the rights of children involved in all judicial proceedings, not just in child care proceedings.  Although the process of setting up an independent statutory body will clearly involve challenges, these can be overcome by forward planning and engaging with all the necessary stakeholders.  We should also make use of the learning available from Northern Ireland, England and Wales regarding the establishment and operation of such a model.  We can even improve on that.<br/><br/>In commenting on the general scheme, it is also important that I add my objection to those already made regarding Tusla continuing to fund the GAL service.  It is essential that this service remains fully independent as GALs will be working closely with Tusla and we cannot allow a risk of blurred lines to exist.  In legislating for a statutory GAL service we must ensure that it is done correctly from the beginning.  The highest standards of governance should be targeted and achieved.<br/><br/>I have touched on the main recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, but we have also made a detailed submission to the committee.  Members will see that our contribution is driven by the need to remember, at all times, that the children who are availing of GAL services can be extremely vulnerable.  The proceedings themselves can be long and complex, and the decisions made have profound and lasting implications for the young people involved.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>can play an important role in arguing for the necessary supports and therapies for children.  However, there is currently no consistency in the appointment of GALs or in the extent to which courts hear the voice of the child in child care cases.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project found that of 1,194 District Court cases reviewed over the period from December 2012 to June 2015 on average a guardian <i>ad litem</i>was appointed in 53% of cases.  A GAL was appointed to children in 79% of cases in Louth, but only 13% of cases in Galway.  The lack of transparency and structure is an issue.  The role a GAL plays must be set out clearly.<br/><br/>This legislation is very welcome but it must provide a child centred and rights based service.  In drafting this long called for and extremely important legislation it is essential that we bear in mind Ireland's obligation in respect of children's rights and the progressive realisation of those rights.  It is particularly relevant this year, the 25th anniversary of Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and also in light of the children's referendum which recognises children's rights at constitutional level and clearly establishes the duty of the Government to protect and vindicate those rights through its laws.  Of particular relevance in this context are Articles 42A.4.1 and 42A.4.2, which provide that in the resolution of child care proceedings brought by the State and proceedings concerning adoption, guardianship, custody and access the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration and the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  In its concluding observations on Ireland's children's rights record in 2016 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, CRC, recommended that measures should be taken to ensure that the effective implementation of legislation recognises the right of the child to be heard in relevant legal proceedings.  This legislation is a vital opportunity to do that.  There are approximately 6,500 children in care at present.  We must strive to ensure that the views of all those young people are properly represented and that we push forward to consider the opinions of all young people involved in legal proceedings.<br/><br/>Finally, in drafting this legislation the rights of children with disabilities, children with mental health issues and the rights of children of all ages and of all abilities must be considered.  The CRC highlights that non-verbal forms of communication, including play, body language, facial expressions, drawing and painting, should be used so children can avail of the opportunity to demonstrate understanding, choices and preferences.  I thank the committee for inviting me to address it today.  I am hopeful that, following consultation with the relevant stakeholders and with a clear focus on the rights of the children involved, this can be a very progressive legislative measure to provide for some of Ireland's most vulnerable children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Dignan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to address it today.  EPIC, empowering people in care, is a national advocacy organisation that works with children and young people in care with care experience.  The work of the advocate is to support the child, to allow the child to understand issues affecting him or her, to access information and to access the entitlements they have.  All of our advocates are professionally qualified and experienced child care professionals.<br/><br/>We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical issue of guardians <i>ad litem</i>with the committee in the context of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017.  EPIC&rsquo;s position is that every child involved in legal proceedings requires a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is a crucial aspect of the system that the child&rsquo;s best interests are represented in any court proceeding that will have an impact on the child&rsquo;s life.  It is important to note that such proceedings can be very intimidating and confusing to a child.  This is especially true for children in care, for whom court proceedings can determine their separation from their parents, siblings, community and the extent of their contact and access to their birth family.  EPIC believes it is crucial that all children involved in legal proceedings have a right to have their voice heard and have their best interests represented.  We also recognise that guardians <i>ad litem </i>can be appointed for a limited period of time.  Children involved in care proceedings should have the support of both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and, where possible, an independent advocate with whom they have had time to develop a trusting relationship.  We are encouraged that the joint committee has dedicated time to examine the importance of the voice of the child and we are grateful for the opportunity to put forward the opinion that children with care experience or in care must have entitlement to both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and, where possible, an advocate. <br/><br/>Guardians <i>ad litem </i>and advocates provide different yet complementary support to children in care.  While guardians <i>ad litem </i>will outline the child's wishes and feelings and defend the child&rsquo;s best interest, the role of the advocate is solely to support the child in having his or her voice heard.  This is a particularly significant distinction given how disempowered children can feel in care proceedings where decisions are being made about their interests and future.  Due to the difference in their role, guardians <i>ad litem </i>in some cases may only have had the opportunity to meet the child on a limited basis and only when proceedings are in being.  Guardians <i>ad litem </i>might have a trusting relationship with the child in some instances, but not in all cases.  This is especially significant for children in care, which is why we are drawing the committee's attention to the importance of having an advocate who will have the opportunity to engage with the child before, during and after the court proceedings.<br/><br/>Children in care are a particularly vulnerable cohort.  They often struggle to build relationships and trust with adults.  Advocates will always have the opportunity to build a relationship with the child over an extended period of time and position themselves as a medium to long-term support on whom the child can count.  An advocate will encourage the child to speak where possible or will accurately represent their views in care proceedings.  The relationship between the child and the advocate is further strengthened by its voluntary nature.  The child chooses to work with the advocate, whereas in many cases the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is court appointed.  We have successfully supported children and young people with care experience in large part because of the time, effort and expertise that advocates devote to developing this trusting relationship.  In EPIC&rsquo;s opinion, guardians <i>ad litem </i>and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system would benefit significantly from working in collaboration with advocates, where possible, when representing a child in care proceedings.  Furthermore, it is the child at the centre of these proceedings who will ultimately benefit from a closer collaboration between an advocate and a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. <br/><br/>We welcome that the best interests of the child is highlighted as paramount in child care proceedings.  EPIC&rsquo;s opinion of the proposed legislation is twofold.  First, we welcome the regulation of the GAL service to ensure consistency in practice, adequate oversight and structured complaint procedures.  This is especially welcome given that there are currently significant geographical inconsistencies in a child&rsquo;s access to a court appointed guardians <i>ad litem</i>and such a lottery is unacceptable.  Further, it is our duty to promote the right of the child to have their voice heard in matters that affect them.The proposed regulation of the GAL in head 5, subhead (1), insists that &ldquo;while the Guardian <i>ad litem </i>will hear the child&rsquo;s views, and have regard to them, in formulating his-her report for the court, the GAL will advise the court ... on what is in the best interest of the child.  S/he is not constrained by the views of the child ...&quot;.  While we understand that this is consistent with the guardian <i>ad litem&rsquo;s </i>mandate, children, and especially children in care, would benefit in some cases from having access to both a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and an advocate in court proceedings.  Our opinion is that it would be beneficial to both the child and the court if a formal structure was put in place to enable better collaboration between the child and the court through having a relationship between the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and advocates, where possible.  This collaboration would be facilitated by the establishment of a single guardian <i>ad litem </i>service that would be open to the possibility of advocates being appointed alongside guardians <i>ad litem </i>for children in care.</p><p>To conclude, EPIC believes that the legislation is a positive development.  However, the current proposal is in danger of diluting the voice of the child by limiting the child to a witness status.  This does not, in our opinion, give appropriate or adequate weight to the voice of the child in respect to court proceedings in a manner that is consistent with Article 42A of the Constitution, which states, &ldquo;in all proceedings ... in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.&rdquo;  It is our contention that the key to ensuring the child&rsquo;s voice is heard is through structured collaboration between guardians <i>ad litem</i>and advocates.  The voice of the child must be central to that process and must inform court decisions during child care proceedings.  If the voice of the child is absent, the court will not be in a position to make a fully informed decision.  We feel this is critical to the vulnerable cohort of children in care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliodhna O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for having us back so soon.  We sent some follow-up information after our last appearance on cyber-safety which I hope members found useful.<br/><br/>We are delighted to be here to discuss this important and long-awaited legislation.<br/><br/>The ISPCC has been calling for reform of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service for a number of years.  We have many concerns, some of which are addressed in the heads of this Bill and some of which are not.  I want to briefly refer to these.  What the legislation should do is give effect to the constitutional amendment which recognised and affirmed the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and, in this case, particularly in a situation where they are vulnerable.  To some extent, it does this and to a large extent it does not.  Our primary concern in calling for reform over many years is that the current system is unregulated and while there are many examples of good practice among existing guardians <i>ad litem</i>, there are no recognised professional standards to which all guardians must adhere.  Further concerns have been that the current system lacks statutory guidance on function, eligibility criteria and payment structures, to the detriment of children.  The new Bill must address these deficits and, to some extent, it does so, and these are the positive aspects of the Bill.  However, some of the proposals still fall short of best practice standards and there are key improvements we feel are needed to ensure that children's voices are heard and their rights truly vindicated, which is the purpose of the legislation.<br/><br/>We make several recommendations.  We recommend that the reformed guardian <i>ad litem</i>system requires a shift in focus from that outlined in the new legislation, that is, from assisting the court in decision making to clearly meeting the State's obligation under Article 42 of the Constitution and Article 12 of the UNCRC to ensure children's rights are vindicated within the courts system, particularly in child care proceedings.  The State, through legislation, must ensure appropriate measures to allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to ensure full participation and realisation of a child's constitutional rights.  This is a concern we have in regard to the heads of Bill, as outlined.  We do not believe the right of the child to be provided with a guardian should be restricted, and I would echo the comments of my colleague from EPIC, who said all children should have access to a guardian.  We believe a comprehensive and independent service cannot be achieved if it is funded through Tusla and that an alternative mechanism should be followed.<br/><br/>We welcome the establishment of a single national service, the proposals on management and structure and the fact the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be defined in legislation.  We are less thrilled at how the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is defined in legislation, and my colleague Ms Catherine Ghent, a solicitor who has advised the ISPCC on this topic, will speak shortly on that.  To give a little more detail, while we believe the establishment of a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>system is to be welcomed, it must achieve what is outlined in Article 42A and the voice of the child must be heard.  In order for the voice of the child to be heard in our courts system, however, it must be effectively advocated for within the courts system.  This can only be achieved where the status of guardian <i>ad litem</i>in proceedings is equal to that of others who are appearing in court.<br/><br/>I was at the excellent Barnardos conference yesterday and it must be congratulated for holding such an excellent event.  It was remarkable how many people who work within the courts system, including judges, spoke of their concern in regard to this item within the legislation whereby the role of guardian has been restricted to that of a special type of expert witness who advises the court on a child's interests and views but who is not party to proceedings.  It was notable how many people talked about the removal of the ability to cross-examine, which is a diminution of service to children when compared to the existing system.  It is a crucial role for guardians and their legal representatives to be able to question what happens in court.  To remove that in this legislation would, we believe, be a retrograde step.  Ms Ghent will address this shortly.<br/><br/>As EPIC has said, every child should have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  With regard to the funding structure, for the purposes of independence we do not believe this national system should be funded through Tusla.  We believe there is a conflict in this regard and we believe it should be taken out and funded through a separate mechanism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Ghent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#D00300"><p>To pick up on that point, it is very important to ask what is the role of the guardian and what we do when we go into court.  I am a solicitor who represents guardians and I sometimes represent children.  A guardian is the representative of a child before the court.  It is not just someone who goes to the child and says, &quot;What do you think about this?&quot;  That is a role which would not be appropriate.  Children need advocates before the court and we all know the effect when they do not have one.  They need regulated professionals who have expertise and who will say: &quot;I am determining what is in your best interests.  I am going to promote and listen to what you say.  I am going to put that before the court and I am not going to put it in a passive way.  I am going to advocate for you.&quot;<br/><br/>The constitutional amendment recognised children as rights holders on their own behalf and it did not diminish or specify any limits on the children's rights.  In fact, for the first time, it gave constitutional backing and a constitutional impetus for children's rights to be the paramount consideration.  That has been recognised in the key judgment given by Mrs. Justice Baker last year in regard to what this actually means, where she said that even within the existing statutory framework, the guardian is the representative of the child.<br/><br/>In that judgment she also said the child is entitled to the full panoply of rights in terms of fair procedures.  What does &quot;fair procedures&quot; mean?  This was established in the <i>re</i>Haughey case, where someone went before a tribunal and what was at stake was their reputation and reputational damage.  Within that context, which we also see in the Charleton inquiry, people are entitled to cross-examine and to put their client's case before the decision making body.  What I am really worried about is that in diluting and diminishing, and in the extraordinary step of removing the right to cross-examine, we take away from children the rights which have been constitutionally identified as pertaining to people, not just in court proceedings, but before tribunals where reputational damage is involved.<br/><br/>Mr. Justice McMenamin has acknowledged the fundamental impact of a care order on a child.  That is what we are talking about.  He said that in cases where the decision and the consequences are so profound for the child, we need to protect their constitutional rights.  I am an advocate for the child before the court and, therefore, I need to cross-examine on their behalf and I need to be able to bring appeals on their behalf.  Mrs. Justice Baker said those rights as previously identified in terms of fair procedures are actually enhanced.  I question how the removal of the right to cross-examine, which is a fundamental right which applies to other citizens, is compatible with the key decision as to what representation for children looks like, even within the limited statutory provision as it stands.  In fact, I think they are not compatible.<br/><br/>I was involved in a case a number of years ago where a father was subsequently convicted of rape of his child.  When we went into the court in the care proceedings, he looked for access.  The judge told us that he had a right of access to his child and, despite the fact his very young child was saying &ldquo;I am terrified of him, I do not want access&rdquo;, the judge granted it.  The HSE at the time did not appeal that.  We appealed it on behalf of the child.  The Circuit Court judge expressed her serious concern and stopped what could have been a really abusive process for the child.  Recently, there has been a case where the parents fled from another European jurisdiction.</p><p>There are legal remedies in a European context under regulations.  The Child and Family Agency, CFA, did not spot that this was a case where the child should have been returned to the jurisdiction which had most information in regard to the child.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>was appointed.  The guardian <i>ad litem </i>instructed me and I immediately highlighted that this was not the right jurisdiction to deal with this.  That became very clear.  The case has become very sad and difficult and the level of tension is very concerning.  The child now has a sibling born in a different jurisdiction in respect of whom there are proceedings in being.  The sibling could be adopted in that jurisdiction and the child in our jurisdiction may not have any contact with them.  We are seeking to stop siblings being split up.  In circumstances where the CFA did not do that, the ISPCC is that child's only voice.  <br/><br/>We have cases before the courts at the moment.  There has been a certain limited backlash to the referendum.  Certain judges have taken the view that they are at the vanguard of parents' rights and they have to protect parents' rights.  At times, it is quite difficult to get the voice of the child heard before the court.  For example, in cases where a child has been beaten to the extent that injuries are apparent, where they have scars or have been scalded, certain judges determine that this is severe physical chastisement and that the child has not been assaulted.  If those cases were before the criminal courts judges would have to find that assault was committed.  Where would those children go if they did not have the ISPCC to tell the judge that that is unacceptable and that the judge has a responsibility to vindicate and promote children's welfare?  <br/><br/>That is the seriousness of what we are dealing with and that is why I am asking the members of the committee to question if the provisions of this Bill are constitutionally compatible.  How do they give effect to specific identification of the constitutional rights, which we all said was appropriate and necessary?  In terms of looking at the constitutional rights and giving effect to Article 42A, it is not passive.  It should not be allowed to sit there.  There is an obligation to promote.  How can that be promoted if the child is given a lesser status in proceedings than parents or the Child and Family Agency?  We have serious concerns in that regard which I would like to be addressed.</p></speech>

The Law Society's function is to assist, advise and use its experts and expertise to get the best legislation and to provide the best outcomes for children.  Its members appear on every side of the argument in the District, Circuit and High Court in regard to child care matters.  A considerable amount of expertise and time has gone into this submission.<br/><br/>My name is Keith Walsh.  I am chair of the society&rsquo;s family and child law committee and a family law practitioner based in Crumlin.  I am joined by my committee colleague, Ms Carol Anne Coolican, who is managing solicitor of the Legal Aid Board in the law centre in Tralee and has extensive experience in the subject under discussion this morning.  <br/><br/>The Law Society family and child law committee is composed of experts in the family law area who are dedicated to improving the practice of family law for the public and those involved in the family law system.  I would like to recognise the dedication of a number of our committee members who have contributed to today's paper and and who are here today:  Sin&eacute;ad Kearney from Byrne Wallace Solicitors, Denise Kirwan from Comyn Kelleher Tobin in Cork, Geraldine Keehan from Augustus Cullen Law in Wicklow and Dublin and Cormac &Oacute; Cul&aacute;in from the Law Society.<br/><br/>Our submission, as drafted by our committee, has been furnished in advance to committee members and provides further details and recommendations in respect of some of the heads proposed in the Bill.  The society is available and interested to engage with the committee and Department officials in improving the Bill.<br/><br/>At the foremost and core of consideration of the general scheme is the amendment to the Constitution in respect of the voice of the child in legal proceedings.  All considerations must flow from this simple tenet.  Rather than provide a section by section commentary on the scheme, we wish to highlight three issues that impact on the intention of the scheme.  <br/><br/>The first point is that there is a constitutional right for the child's voice to be heard.  That means the current scheme will need to be amended so that there is an obligation on the courts to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The scheme, as drafted, gives a discretion but not an obligation to the Circuit and District Courts on such appointment.<br/><br/>The second point is that it is imperative that an independent agency manage the guardian<i>ad litem</i>service.  This should be an independent non-departmental body which is also independent of the parties, including Tusla.  This is the approach adopted in our neighbouring jurisdiction. <br/><br/>The third point is that the scheme as drafted would be greatly enhanced by the specific inclusion of the criteria to be assessed in determining the best interest of children.  This is set out in section 31 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in regard to cases involving children in private law matters.<br/><br/>The society has made 12 recommendations in regard to the general scheme, relating to some of the following points: the necessity for a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service; the necessity for greater clarity of roles in respect of service providers; a recommendation for comprehensive criteria for establishing the best interests of the child, head 5; and a strengthening in regard to the qualification of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, head 7.  The society recommends the introduction of a fee structure for both guardians <i>ad litem</i>and their legal representatives; regular audits of files and accounts and clarity on the discretion of the courts, head 8; and finally, the society is advocating for careful consideration in relation to the provision of information to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and reports prepared by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>for the courts, heads 10 and 12.<br/><br/>The society and practitioners working at the coal face of child and family law welcome the Bill.  However, the test of the commitment will be the degree to which resources and professionalism are brought to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>infrastructure and that the policy objectives are appropriate from the outset.<br/><br/>Ms Coolican and I are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I fully endorse that this should not be attached to Tusla.  That would be a very dangerous step.  I made it quite clear when Barnardos attended this committee that we would be making a very serious mistake by having this service attached to and monitored and funded by Tusla.  We would be creating more problems than we would be eliminating.</p><p>I agree that to remove the ability for someone to cross-examine would be another very serious issue for our children.</p><p>What is meant by the qualifications of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  Are they legal qualifications or other qualifications?  How would the process of creating that monitoring board who will take on the guardians be undertaken?  Who will form the initial body that is going to monitor, examine and oversee these guardians?</p></speech>

That is being echoed by all parties.</p><p>What are the qualifications of guardians <i>ad litem </i>that are currently working in the service?  I ask that so that we have an understanding of where we are coming from and what we are trying to achieve.  I would like to hear what the Ombudsman for Children thinks about the role of the advocate in their collaboration with guardians <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>At the moment it is a geographic dolly mixture, if one is fortunate enough to get a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is not a statutory obligation and it depends on where one is located.  I am concerned about the role of advocacy.  One only gets to meet one's guardian <i>ad litem</i>prior to a court proceeding.  Would it not be important for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to have built up a relationship with the child in advance so that there is trust?  I would like to hear the views of others in that regard.<br/><br/>In terms of the role of Article 42A and expanding the voice of the child, in what respect is that not addressed in the Bill?  Where should it be addressed?  I am looking for recommendations in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#F00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is an interesting area of law.  I wish to clarify a few issues.  In some cases the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is the only voice for the child and it is most important that the child's voice is heard on all occasions.  The criteria for the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>are outlined.  They include education, experience and professional qualifications.  Transparency in terms of the appointments is important.  In 2016 we spent &euro;16 million, which is a significant amount, and we need value for money given the view of the public about gravy trains and the cynicism people rightly have in some respects.  The current <i>ad hoc</i>arrangement must be put on a statutory basis.</p><p>The witnesses might not have the answers to the questions I wish to pose in two areas.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act has been enacted and further elements of it remain to be introduced by the Minister.  It provides a statutory framework.  As I understand it, the legislation concerns adults.  Is there any possibility of expanding the legislation to include children or are we double-jobbing?  If it is not broken, why fix it?  Could we not add to that legislation rather than starting over again?</p><p>It is extremely important that we have the capacity to care for all children, especially given the cases of Grace and Mary and what has emerged in that regard recently.  We believe those children do not have the capacity to express their views but I suspect they would if we gave them an opportunity.  That ties in with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act as well.  We talk about giving children a voice and a child who is capable of forming his or her own views.  What does that mean?  Is it a criterion of intellectual ability and does it include verbal and non-verbal communication?  Some children who did not have a voice have been let down horrifically by society but we probably need to delve deeper, give them a voice and listen to them a bit more.</p><p>I am involved in a case currently concerning six children, of whom we know, with mental health issues, who were sent abroad in recent years.  They were seriously disturbed young children.  Is it intended that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would be assigned to them to represent them in mental health tribunals?  I am not sure whether that would be the case as such tribunals are very rare for children but to represent their views in general.  What has happened has been horrific.  The children have not been kept safe.  They have not received treatment but have been incarcerated.  That is something I am investigating further.  There does not seem to be any oversight from the Mental Health Commission or any statutory body in this country when we export children because we do not yet have the facilities here.  Would guardians <i>ad litem</i>be appointed in such circumstances?  If children go outside the State what would the remit be of the guardians <i>ad litem</i>?  What would their responsibility be in such situations or are they allowed to take responsibility for children in this country who have been sent abroad for treatment of significant, difficult and challenging mental health issues?  I thank the witnesses for their contribution on this interesting area concerning children.</p></speech>

They were the current qualifications of GALs, the role of the advocate - the Ombudsman for Children should reply to that - and the gaps in Article 42A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#F00400"><p>From our point of view, we are not necessarily prescribing the qualifications but we do think it is too limited to limit it to social work and psychology.  Our whole idea is that every child should have a GAL available to him or her.  Therefore, one is looking at someone who needs to have expertise in infant observation, mental health issues and a range of issues.  Keeping the qualifications open is important.  That is something that needs to be discussed in terms of how one would allow that but, for example, there are fantastic barristers who were formerly teachers and a range of youth workers could also be involved.  We must look at the issue on a wider scale.</p> <p>  The way we see it in terms of linking it with advocacy is that a GAL is somebody who will hear and listen to the voice of the child, respect that voice and present it as the advocate for the child.  The GAL is crucial.  If there is an independent advocate such as EPIC, Empowering People in Care, that adds to the situation enormously but the idea is that one would have somebody who would automatically ask the child where they are coming from and what they want and then allow that to be represented in the court system so that there is an absolute certainty that the child has their voice heard.</p> <p>  Ms Ghent touched on the issue in the sense that there is no way you or I would not be allowed into a court to give our point of view.  We would have representation, including a barrister and all sorts of support yet the child who is at the centre of all those issues has been kept silent for so long.  There is always the possibility that a child will come back at a later stage and say they were not represented, that their voice was not heard and those responsible are culpable because the child was sent to a secure care facility or was not sent to a foster home.  We are really letting down children enormously in this situation.  The idea is that the GAL is that voice, but it is the voice of the child through the GAL in the courts system and they have to be able to be represented at the court table exactly as every other party in that system is.  At the moment the system is set up for adults not for the child, and the child is passive.  The idea is that children should not be passive.  We need to give children a voice and hear it.  That is the way I see it at this moment in time.  I will ask my colleague to respond about the question on Article 42A.</p></speech>

In some cases it says the court shall ascertain the views of the child and give the child who is capable of forming views a voice.  We could all agree that very young children, including infants and children with disabilities, are capable of forming views.  It is not about whether they are capable of expressing views.  We need to support them to find their voice through both verbal and non-verbal methods.  It is not a discretionary constitutional obligation, it is a constitutional imperative to listen to all children in court proceedings that affect them.  It is not resource dependent; it is a right that children have at a constitutional level to which we must give effect.</p></speech>

There is a constitutional imperative that the voice of the child must be heard and, according to our submission, head 8 must be amended so that there is not a discretion but a mandatory obligation for the appointment of a GAL.</p></speech>

On the qualifications piece, we did not speak to that specifically but in relation to the wider scale we are open to that in terms of it being broadened but the key thing for us is that there will be professional standards and there will be membership of a professional body.  What is listed in the heads at the moment is CORU, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which is appropriate.  Continuous professional development, CPD, standards do not exist at the moment.  If somebody is employed within Barnardos, for example, it has standards in place for the service but none of that is on a statutory footing, which is the key issue.</p> <p>  In response to the question on the role of advocacy, especially in terms of what is in and what is not in, I will refer to Ms Ghent, but our primary concern relates to head 5.</p></speech>

One cannot and would not have that limitation in respect of any other party.  I did not say that if a child was a party in his or her own right, there would be no question but that those rights applied and the limitation of the role in head 5 and the issues in head 6 would not arise.  That is important if a comparison is being made.</p></speech>

They should be broadened to include a wide range of potential qualifications.<br/><br/>On the role of the advocate, we are simply saying that in these proceedings we have one opportunity to hear the true voice of the child.  We have referred to the fact that this is a very alien and intimidating environment for children where their voice may not come through the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is our duty to the child to make sure we hear absolutely what his or her view and opinion is.  In those cases where it may be difficult to do this, the advocate can play a supporting role in ensuring the child's views and feelings are heard and made known.  <br/><br/>It might be interesting to introduce the voice of the child to the proceedings of the committee.  I would like my colleague, Ms Charles, to give the views of one child who was sent out of the State through court proceedings.  The child did very well, but these were their views on being involved in the case.</p></speech>

When we asked what happened to the usual rights they would have if detained under mental health legislation here, namely, access to a tribunal and having the decisions reconsidered, we were informed that the institution abroad could dispense with them.  We raised serious concerns about this, which resulted in our advocating on the child's behalf for a reference to be sent to the European Court of Justice.  That had not been done and both the Attorney General and the Child and Family Agency opposed it.  Through that reference, the European Court of Justice set down certain conditions which had to be fulfilled.  The system is not perfect.  The issues that have emerged in the case of St. Andrew's have caused huge concern, but we would have even less regulation if we had not insisted on reference to the European Court of Justice which indicated that the concerns we had raised were also concerns for it.</p></speech>

The discussion is very interesting and I concur with everything that is being said by my colleagues.  <br/><br/>The Barnardos conference yesterday on guardians <i>ad litem</i>is to be commended.  The Minister has said she is taking a child-centred approach to these reforms.  We have a couple of quotes from young people involved in court proceedings where guardians <i>ad litem</i>have been appointed, particularly from a child who was sent overseas.<br/><br/>One of the key points is that we want children to be part of the decision-making process, not passive recipients.  Where possible, we want to hear directly from the child.  Where it is not possible for a child to speak directly, or through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, other means should be used such as play, as the office of the Ombudsman for Children stipulated.  <br/><br/>One child said when they were told they were going to court: &quot;I thought we were in big trouble.&quot;  That is a key indictment of the scary situation and intimidating process a young child faces on hearing the word &quot;court&quot;.  Any previous experience he or she has had has probably been very negative.  It is an intimidating process for an adult, let alone a child.  Another child said she had been told she was going to court but &quot;it was never me, it was always them.&quot;  The child was not part of it.  The adults were speaking around her, at her and to her.  The person who was sent abroad was a very talkative, chatty individual but said very little because she was unprepared.  </p><blockquote>I kept my mouth shut.  That was not like me.  I did not say a word.  I felt completely silenced.  I should have been able to say what I needed to say but I couldn't.  Take the time because that could make the difference between feeling silenced or having my voice heard.  </blockquote> <p>These quotes give the committee a flavour of what young people are going through.  We would be very happy to follow up on it.  We could even arrange for some young people who have experienced guardians <i>ad litem</i>to meet directly with committee members.  We would have no problem doing so.  We would like to keep this conversation open.</p></speech>

Tusla cannot do it as that would be a complete conflict of interest.  It needs to uphold standards.  Solicitors are accountable to the Law Society of Ireland.  Everyone is accountable to his or her professional body, which is absolutely appropriate and has to be done.  Standards have to be set.  We would really welcome it because I have experienced different standards.<br/><br/>What Ms Charles says about the voice is the guardian <i>ad litem's</i>job, to explain to the child and reassure him or her.  I had a conversation with a guardian <i>ad litem</i>on that issue, saying a child thought courts had judges who dealt with baddies and jail sentences.  She had to say to the child in question that it was about hearing the child, that the child should not feel under pressure and that if the child did not feel they could go, they could write a letter or tell the guardian <i>ad litem</i>who would do it.  That reflects the need for standards, preparation and accountability in order that if a child has a bad experience, the question of why it happened will be raised and examined by a regulatory authority.  There is a complaints mechanism, oversight and regulations, which is very important.</p></speech>

There has been some discussion regarding the need to provide a consistent service and the fact that certain standards and practices should apply.  I would be interested in hearing the views of Ms Ghent and the witnesses from the Law Society of Ireland on how this might work.</p> <p>  In terms of the regulatory authority, how would a complaints mechanism work?  To whom would people complain?  Who would adjudicate on complaints made against a GAL and the independent service to which reference has been made?</p> <p>  Ms Charles spoke about the experiences of children in court.  Does she have any thoughts on how we might make the experience of being in court less scary for children?  A courtroom is a daunting place for any individual let alone a child.  Should there be special types of court settings?  I know that I have gone a bit off topic by raising this issue.</p></speech>

I tried to write down her comments and listen at the same time.  Can she provide a quick synopsis in respect of the matter?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Lisa Chambers that a court is an intimidating place for a child in terms of the air of ceremony that obtains and so on.  Sick children are afraid of hospitals and people use play therapy to help them view their time in hospital in a more positive light.  Have play therapy or other methods been explored to enable children have a more positive experience in court?  Therapy could be provided over three to five weeks, particularly as cases can take some time to reach the courts.  I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

The Minister will be coming before us after this session and we will put some of the points raised to her.  We have reached the stage of discussing the heads of the Bill.  We hope that the points that have been made will influence the direction of the legislation.  That is the point of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon suggested that amendments might be tabled.  Do the witnesses wish to suggest specific amendments?  Ms Ghent recommended inserting in head 5 a measure that would allow someone to advocate on a child's behalf, for example.  Any recommendations would prove useful to us as they would allow the legislation to be strengthened on later Stages.</p> <p>  From what the witnesses said, I understand that there are constitutional issues with the heads, as drafted.  I mean that they do not fulfil the rights of a child under Article 42A in that the word "shall" rather than "may" is used in respect of hearing the voice of the child..  I shall pursue the issue of ensuring that all children have access as opposed to leaving the matter to the discretion of the courts.  I would like to hear how we can strengthen the position in that regard.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon made a point about non-verbal children and those with disabilities, as did Senator Devine, and Deputy Neville spoke about using play therapy, etc., to alleviate the stress associated with going to court.  Will Dr. Muldoon elaborate on how the court might hear the voices of children who are not in position to express their views verbally.  Obviously, communication would take place via the GAL who, I presume, would have some way of communicating with the child.  Do we need to include anything in the legislation in this regard?</p> <p>  I want to discuss with the witnesses, mainly with those from EPIC, the benefits of having an advocate as opposed to a GAL.  At a previous meeting, we heard from Barnardo's about a child and it seemed that the GAL did an awful lot more than sit in court.  He or she explained things to the child and there was an element of the GAL advocating on the child's behalf.  Can a GAL fulfil the role of an advocate?  Is there a need to have an advocate?  Perhaps the other witnesses can answer my questions.</p> <p>  In terms of heads 3, 5, 6 and 8, there are specific things that we, as a committee, should recommend in order to ensure that the legislation is as strong as possible.  We would welcome the help of the witnesses in terms of these matters.</p></speech>

We have had a very good discussion.  I shall make three observations on specific heads and then I shall make some general observations.</p><p>In terms of head 6(6), we have had a lot of discussion on the cross-examination of parties.  There is a clause to the effect that the GAL may not request specific professional assessments for the purposes of preparing a report.  This seems to place a restriction on GALs, which should not exist.  It may well be the case that a GAL could believe that a professional assessment is required but it would not be in the best interests of the child.  I ask the witnesses to address the matter.</p><p>I shall not go into great detail on head 7 because it has already been discussed.  This proposed provision needs to be improved.  Perhaps the list of professions could be broadened.  We should also tighten up of the manner in which the persons involved in the carrying out of GAL obligations and work are regulated, monitored and trained.</p><p>I am curious as to why head 8 is weak and thin when it comes to children who are subject to voluntary care orders.  Perhaps this is an oversight or a weakness in the legislation.  Such people are also in need of representation by guardians <i>ad litem.</i></p><p>On a more general note, both today and perhaps a month ago, during pre-legislative scrutiny, the strongest message to come back relates to the need for an independent statutory body that would not fall under the remit of Tusla.  As much as an actual conflict of interest, the perception of a conflict of interest is important.  We must ensure that children and their advocates had confidence in the system that they encounter.  I understand that Tusla is not particularly enthusiastic about the idea of monitoring or managing this service.  I understand that Tusla recommended in its submission that the service could be located in the Department of Justice and Equality.  My instinct is that it would be better to locate the unit in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am interested in hearing the comments from the witnesses on the matter.</p><p>I support some of the observations made, particularly those from the Law Society of Ireland.  All of the contributions shared the theme of calling for a stronger obligation to provide a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to represent a child.  The Law Society of Ireland made the very strong point in paragraph 2.2 of its submission that family should include people who act <i>in loco parentis. </i>The committee should consider that issue.</p><p>In terms of EPIC and advocacy, should the role of advocate have a legal basis?  Is the role an operational matter relating to how the GAL service should be structured?  Should the committee insert a definition?</p><p>My final points are on cross-examination.  How can we resolve matters in this regard?  Should we remove the proposed section?  Should we remove the prohibition on cross-examination?  Can the matter be resolved through the use of the tandem model that exists in the UK?</p><p>Is there any possibility that if we remove the section there will be a conflict between legal representatives and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  Could they be at cross-purposes?  I am keen to get a sense of it.  If the provision is faulty or may create difficulties, how do we resolve it?</p></speech>

I wish to make some comments before the deputations come in again.  When answering the questions, please keep specifically to this legislation as opposed to straying into other legislation, something we could tend to do.</p><p>I wish to make three brief points.  As I said the last day, I have a major issue with the costs.  The costs are astronomical.  Can anyone before the committee set out the number of children who have availed of guardian <i>ad litem</i>services in the courts last year?  Is it possible to get a figure?  A total of 6,500 children are in State care but the vast majority have not have availed of the service.  I am unsure of the answer.  Can the deputations direct me?  How can I find out how many children have received the service?</p><p>The cost is &euro;15 million per annum.  By comparison, the cost of running the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is in the region of &euro;2 million and it gives a voice to hundreds of thousands of children, potentially.  The other service gives a voice in the courts but it is extraordinarily expensive.  That is a major issue.  It goes back to the issue of qualifications that has been addressed by many members.</p><p>The representatives from EPIC suggested we should have both.  Perhaps we can turn that on its head.  A good advocate would give the child adequate voice.  Does a child need to have a barrister-at-law representing him in the courts?  I am not so sure.  I am not convinced of that.  As I said the last day, we are giving a voice to children in court when we cannot get speech and language therapy for these same children who are in the care of the State.  Trying to get speech and language therapy is an uphill battle, although that gives them a voice in everyday living.  I appreciate the importance of giving them a voice in court, but we have to keep it in perspective in respect of the cost.</p><p>Another issue relates to the numbers.  Someone referred to the children in voluntary care.  Many children are in voluntary care.  If a mother puts her child in the care of the State, there is no court case or at least it is not contested.  That is one situation.  In other situations where children are given to care until they are 18 years of age, that does not arise.  I am curious about the real numbers as opposed to the broad numbers being put about.</p><p>Mental capacity has been addressed by several people.  I have some first-hand knowledge of this.  Some children in the care of the State can be up to seven or eight years of age and may have no ability to speak for themselves or explain what would be in their best interests.  That issue has to be addressed and recognised in this legislation.  We need to consider the age factor in respect of when a child can make an input into what is best for him or her.  Would an advocate work in that case?  How important is it to have legal representation?  Will the deputations explain why barristers are involved in so many of these cases?  That is what is driving the costs up to what I consider to be extortionate rates.  The total cost is &euro;15 million, an extraordinary figure by any standard.  I look forward to the responses.  Does Dr. Muldoon want to start?  We will continue along that way.  Please be conscious that these will probably be your closing comments.</p></speech>

Our view fits into the adaption of the broader system in the sense that all professionals working with children should be specialised and trained in children's rights.  In particular, this means a knowledge of children's rights and the legal context within which they are working.  It also means knowledge of areas such as child development, skills-based training in communicating with children of different ages and maturity as well as listening to children.<br/><br/>Reference was made to in-depth legal training.  We need to maintain the focus on the fact that guardians <i>ad litem</i>are not acting as lawyers when they are in the court.  They are not acting as social workers either.  We are keen for this to be recognised as an individual specialised profession and for those involved to receive training to be guardians <i>at litem</i>.  Part of this involves understanding the legal context within which they are working.<br/><br/>We need to see a broader adaption of the judicial system.  The need for this is recognised internationally and within Ireland.  Yesterday, Freda McKittrick from Barnardos called on all stakeholders to establish an expert group to look at how all judicial proceedings in which children are involved could be made more child-centred, in particular to ensure the views of children are heard.  That is something we really need to look at.  We need specialised courtrooms and professionals as well as a general adaption of procedures and practices and a recognition that this is necessary to ensure they are not intimidating or excluding children, whether in practice or reality.</p></speech>

I think we can go a long way to make it easier for children.  That is a key point.  Yesterday, Fred McBride of Tusla said he would engage with the inter-agency working group.  The judges are happy to do that as well.  We can find many ways to do it.  Examples in medicine show how we have come a long way in allowing children to find comfort in difficult situations.  We can make our court systems and environment better.  We can ensure the professionals who work there are better equipped to work with children.<br/><br/>Reference was made to non-verbal expression.  That is part of the reason we are keen for a wider expanse of professionals.  We can hear the voice of a child, no matter what the age or disability and no matter what issues are going on, once the right person is working with him or her.  It may take a little longer and it may take some time, but I believe it is worth it.  Often, we have seen cases where it can take six or 12 months of being in and out of court.  During that time we can really get a chance to work with and learn about a child and bring forward the voice in a proper way.<br/><br/>A question was asked about numbers.  I believe there is a shortage of data in that respect.  The transcript from two weeks ago suggests 1,600 guardians <i>ad litem</i>were available to the children not in voluntary care.  That leaves approximately 6,300 in care.  Approximately 50% of them have access to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The figure that seems to be abroad is 1,600.  Again, that is a guess.  This is one of the benefits that will come from the new independent agency.  We will be able to know who got the service, why and when.<br/><br/>Our vision is that this agency will be built up.  If we set ourselves a target of putting forward the best possible agency, we can make it available for all the children with issues across court services.  Non-voluntary care would be available to them.  It would help children who have mental health issues and children with disabilities.  It would operate across the range.  We have a range of opportunities now.  Other Bills have mentioned special reporters or experts.  This service could provide all of these in one setting.  There is a great opportunity to be a world leader in this field.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to specific amendments.  They are in our submission.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in respect of the comment on a conflict of interest.  The perception is crucial.  It is the most obvious thing.  Let us suppose we came back in ten years to look at a case and a child made the case that he was not looked after properly.  The first question is who the paymaster was and whether there could have been a conflict of interest.  It would be difficult to prove that there was not if the two representatives in court are paid by the same paymaster, though Tusla.  That would make it difficult to have a perception of fairness.  It is not impossible, but it would make it extremely difficult.  If we can fix it now, it makes more sense to go in a different direction.<br/><br/>Reference was made to high costs by comparison with speech and language services.  Undoubtedly, we need to work on both areas.  We need to ensure resources are available for all the children who need speech and language support as well as any advocacy within their world.  Children in foster care have extraordinary advocates working for them, whether parents or foster parents.  They fight hard for the rights of the children.  They need to be assisted through economic social and cultural rights becoming part of our constitutional rights.  We need to know that children in foster care have an advocate, voice, parent, foster parent or social worker who can help them.  The children in the Courts Service need guardians <i>ad litem</i>now.  It should not be a case of either-or.  We need to find a way to make it work better.  This new system should allow the money that is being spent to prevent further cases.  It should allow children to have a better voice and provide better solutions for them.<br/><br/>This is the whole idea.  We bring them into the system ant they give us their sense of it.  In that way we will improve the outcome for them.  That is the essence of this.  That, in turn, should reduce the long-term harm done to children by listening to adults talk about what the child needs.</p></speech>

I want to make our position clear.  We believe that the experience and qualifications of the advocate can be an additional resource for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, especially when it is time specific.  Guardians <i>ad litem</i>are appointed at the beginning of care proceedings.  The advocate may have a long relationship with the child and family and may be able to give insight into the background of the child or issues relating to or affecting the child.  This can allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to move out of the blocks more quickly in terms of representing the child as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<br/><br/>The Chairman raised a point about the legal representative.  There are cases - it is always case specific - where the advocate may be more than adequate.</p><p>There have been situations where a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is representing in one case and an advocate in another so there is the potential to do that.  Ms Charles will speak to the fact that as it stands, all children are required to be made aware of EPIC as an advocacy service for them.  We welcome that and want it to continue.<br/><br/>In respect of training, we agree with the Ombudsman for Children and the other speakers here that it should be broadened to look at a range of opportunities to bring people in from education, social care and so forth.  We feel that once those people come into the service there should be training that is specific to the requirements of that particular role.  We would recommend that an advocacy module be part of that, which would overcome that.<br/><br/>In respect of the perception of conflict of interest, we feel the voice of the child and what is in the best interests of the child are often not the same thing.  Where the best interests of the child lie in taking the child out of the home, the child may want to be with his or her parents for whatever reason.  That needs to be addressed to see how that could work.  Again, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>advocate could work on that, as can the legal profession in terms of determining the outcomes of that.</p></speech>

I will deal with the structures at which the Courts Service of Ireland is looking.  The service took submissions last year or possibly the previous year regarding structures and ways of making a court setting more child-friendly.  That is in motion and we are involved in that process separately.  This is something we can discuss at another stage.  It is an intimidating process that can be much improved.<br/><br/>I will not repeat what Mr. Dignan said about the advocate versus the guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I would add that it is the current right of every child in care to be made aware of our service but it is a voluntary involvement on the part of child and involves requesting an advocate.  An advocate would never be appointed where a child did not want one.  In respect of the ability of an advocate versus a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, sometimes there may be a need for both while at other times there may only be a need for an advocate.  It is very much case dependent.  It should be part of the remit of the independent body to look from a cost perspective and in conjunction with the child at the best way to represent that child in court proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliodhna O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#K00300"><p>We will try to get through as much as possible.  To be honest, I have lost track of who has asked what so I will just go for it.  In respect of the independent body, the key point is that form should follow function.  We need to look at what this independent body needs to do and then determine the best mechanism to achieve that.  What everyone believes this body needs to do has been pretty clearly described here today in terms of professional standards, regulation and keeping the independence, so it should be looked at in that context.<br/><br/>In respect of the Chairman's point about costs, I should have mentioned at the outset that the ISPCC does not provide any services related to this and our interest in it purely relates to the policy in law and strategic matters.  I concur with the Chairman about costs and concerns about costs.  It is great that this committee and other committees keep an eye on that in respect of value for money for the taxpayer.  It is important to remember that value for money is not just about money.  It is also about value and what value is got for children in respect of particular services.  I have no doubt that costs could be contained better in a new system.  However, it is not so much about questioning the role of the lawyers but ensuring there is equality of status for children in court proceedings so the children have the right to be represented and that right exists.  That would be one of our concerns regarding the independence of the function.  It is very important it never comes down to cost.  It does not come down to cost for adults so why should it be the case with children?  That is an important point to make.<br/><br/>In respect of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, I am not the world's leading expert on the topic but my understanding is that this legislation is about determining decision-making on the basis of the functional approach.  It is quite a specific approach and that is supported by the National Advocacy Service.  It is quite a different mechanism and I am not sure how useful it is in this context.  There are some parallels but this service must be a specialist service, particularly for children, for the reasons my colleagues have outlined.  Ms Ghent has some points she wishes to raise.<br/><br/>A number of people raised a point about cross-examination.  It might be worth mentioning that under head 6, which states that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>may not cross-examine parties or witnesses, it is our understanding that this means the guardian <i>ad litem</i>or his or her legal representative, so there would not be a conflict between the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and the legal representative.  Where required by a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, a legal representative is instructed by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>on behalf of the child so there would not be a conflict there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Ghent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#K00400"><p>I would love the committee to sort out legal costs because the fact that a few have driven up costs extensively impacts on the perception of the kind of work I do and the kind of guardians I represent who are not getting paid that kind of money.  If I wanted to do that, I would go off and do commercial law, so I would really like that to be sorted out.</p> <p>  In respect of qualifications, I am not qualified to attend a child in care review, look at documents and say what I think is best for a child.  I am not qualified to go to a child who has been abused and approach them in a way that would not trigger trauma for them.  My function as a lawyer is to take instructions and advocate before the court, but I really feel that I need someone who is properly qualified.  In respect of very young children who cannot verbalise or children with disabilities who cannot verbalise, I would like someone who is qualified to interpret that.  Clearly, that qualification exists.  In respect of the point about getting reports, sometimes we have sought reports to see how we can best elicit the views of that child.  It is very important that this function continues.</p> <p>  I accept the point about trying to get resources.  It should not be a conflict because what is at stake in child protection is the fact that children could be sent home.  They could be left in a situation where they continue to be abused or neglected.  We know that ongoing abuse and neglect has consequences.  It generates mental health problems and involvement with the criminal justice system, and that generates costs for us all.  It needs to be run in parallel.  We have gone into court saying that the child I represent needs this service and I make no apology for this.  The issue relating to voluntary care is that there are no court proceedings in respect of it.  We have seen the devastating consequences for people who are in care and are left for years with nobody looking at their case and nobody advocating for them.  I take the point about resources, but we as a society need to say that we are going to provide resources, that where the risk is that a child could go home to suffer abuse we will make sure this child has the best possible chance, or where there is a proposal to take the child away from their parents when they should be at home, that they need somebody to advocate for that.</p> <p>  In respect of cross-examination, as I said at the outset, I represent the child through the guardian.  If that was brought into the legislation in terms of the child being a party through the guardian, we would not have that discrepancy in terms of the child and parties having those full constitutional rights.  They could not be denied if that was the case.  In any event, the judgement of Ms Justice Baker, which said very clearly that they are entitled to those fair procedure rights, must be taken into account.  We definitely welcome the greater certainty and would certainly be willing to work with any members afterwards to try to address this problem.</p> <p>  In respect of severe chastisement, clearly, the Oireachtas did significant and very valuable work in removing the defence of reasonable chastisement.  This was in the context of an assault on a child.  You could deal with a judge who does not have that experience or who has never had it happen to them and he or she cannot go there.  Sometimes it is really easy to feel sorry for a parent because his or her circumstances may have led him or her to become a parent who cannot engage with his or her children in an appropriate way.  This is why it is very important that we are able to come in on behalf of the child and say that.</p></speech>

We are very happy to engage and make further submissions if required.  We would have a concern that, as drafted, the Bill is open to constitutional challenge or even referral by the President.  I refer in particular to head 8, which I spoke about previously, that deals with the discretionary and mandatory remit of the courts in the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<br/><br/>In terms of head 3, we have some reservations that, as drafted, there are proposals in the short term to appoint a certain agency and other options may never fully be explored.  We have a concern about that particular head, as articulated in our submission.<br/><br/>In terms of the qualifications, we have specifically mentioned that we believe the guardian should have seven years' postgraduate experience, five of which would be in child protection, and preferably with management experience.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is a dual one, first, to establish the views of the child and, second, to indicate clearly to the court what is in his or her best interests.  The best interest principle is enshrined in private law proceedings for cases of custody, access, guardianship and adoption, and the children in those very vulnerable situations should also have those rights.  It should not be a case of making flesh of one and fowl of another.  The best interest principle set out in the private law legislation should also be set out in the public law legislation.  We will make further submissions to the committee.</p></speech>

The clerk has advised me that a report was made to the Committee of Public Accounts on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a lot of work on the breakdown of the costs.  The report is available for information purposes.  In summary, a total of 1,600 children availed of the service last year at a cost of &euro;16 million which works out at &euro;10,000 per child to give them a voice in court.  Many of the children only had one court case.  I do not say children should not have a voice in court but the costs are not proportionate.  That is the final word of the Chair.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance today and their participation at the meeting.  I also thank members for their co-operation.

The general scheme of the Bill provides for the extensive reform of existing <i>ad hoc</i>guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements in child care proceedings.  Before going into the detail of the general scheme, I want to highlight a number of the key positive aspects and features of the reform proposals.</p><p>First and foremost, there will be a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in all child care proceedings.  Where the court decides not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it will be required to give the reasoning behind its decision.</p><p>A nationally organised, managed and delivered guardian <i>ad litem</i>service will be established.  The service will be responsible for providing guardians <i>ad litem</i>for the courts and will support the professional practice and development of guardians <i>ad litem</i>and monitor their performance.  It will also be responsible for making legal advice available to guardians <i>ad litem</i>through an in-house legal facility and arranging legal representation for a guardian <i>ad litem</i>where it is deemed by a service provider to be required.  The role and functions of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and the qualifications and experience required to act as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be clearly defined.  These are major changes in parts of the reform process.</p><p>In conjunction with reform in this area, my Department is progressing a review of the 1991 Child Care Act in its entirety.  The detailed review includes identifying areas which need to be revised or updated to reflect current practices and respond to current needs.  It also includes the examination of a number of potential new areas for development, for example, the inclusion of principles underpinning the revised Act, including explicit reference to the principle that all those involved in child care proceedings should promote and uphold the rights of the child.  My Department has been engaging with Tusla and intends to commence a comprehensive public dialogue very shortly to inform this important review.  It will be working with the Children's Rights Alliance in that regard.</p><p>With regard to the importance of guardians <i>ad litem</i>to the court and children, it is important to acknowledge that they perform a very important function in child care proceedings.  They are an invaluable source of advice for the courts and also a great support for the children and young people involved in these proceedings.</p><p>I am taking a child-centred and a child rights based approach to the reform of current guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements.  My focus is on ensuring all children in child care proceedings will have the opportunity to have their voice heard through having access to an independent guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The emphasis in these cases is on what is in the child's best interests.  The first area of focus is on hearing the views of the child.  One of the key objectives of the national strategy for children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making published by my Department is that young people will have a voice in the courts and the legal system.  One such mechanism for hearing the views of the child in public law cases is the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Under current arrangements, the appointment is made where the court considers this to be necessary in the interests of the child and justice.  This is entirely at the discretion of the individual judge.  As this approach has resulted in the uneven appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i>across geographical areas, I want to ensure an end to inconsistency.  The approach I am taking is that there will be a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for all children in child care proceedings.  Where the court decides not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, it must openly state its reasons for not appointing one, which might include choosing to hear the voice of the child through a direct meeting between the child and the judge in chambers.  This presumption in favour is not intended to be a criticism of the judges <i>per se</i>but to enable consistency for children throughout the country.  This approach will help to ensure more children across the country will have the services of a guardian <i>ad litem.</i></p><p>As members are aware, the second key reform is the establishment of a nationally organised, managed and delivered guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, separate from Tusla.  The purpose of the service will be to enhance the decision-making capacity of the courts by operating a well managed, high quality and cost-effective service in the best interests of children and young people.  The new service will be established initially by means of public procurement to facilitate speedy reform.  I will be the contract holder for the service and my Department will closely monitor its effectiveness and efficiency so as to inform its further development and final positioning in a new or existing reformed public body.  Although I will be the contract holder for the new national service provider, Tusla will make periodic block payments to it for guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs in accordance with the terms of the contract.  Care has been taken in the general scheme to ensure the independence of the service and its guardians <i>ad litem</i>from Tusla by stating explicitly that the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is independent in the exercise of his or her functions and that Tusla will not exercise any governance or oversight of the service provider or the performance of individual guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  This will limit any perception of a conflict of interest or lack of independence on the part of guardians <i>ad litem</i>or the national service.</p><p>The role and functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be clearly set out.  They will have two functions, first, to inform the court of the child&rsquo;s views and, second, to advise the court of what, in the professional opinion of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, is in the best interests of the child.</p><p>The current absence of formal qualification requirements and experience standards for those who wish to act as guardians <i>ad litem</i>is being addressed.  Those who wish to work as guardians <i>ad litem</i>in the future will have to have qualifications in social work or psychology and at least five years' experience in the area of child welfare and child protection.  They must also supply a vetting disclosure document as provided for under the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012.</p><p>Under the proposals, access to legal representation will be more transparent and formalised.  The national service provider will be required to provide in-house legal advice for guardians <i>ad litem</i>and will organise legal representation with expertise in care proceedings for guardians <i>ad litem</i>where the service is satisfied that the circumstances of the case warrant it.  This approach will not remove the ability to engage legal representation which will be paid for by the State but which will regulate it in a way that is more cost effective, while still providing for the child&rsquo;s rights to be vindicated.  While this proposal will enhance governance, it is not a cost-saving exercise.  It is about providing the best service for the courts and children to ensure the child&rsquo;s best interests will be served and that children&rsquo;s views will be taken into account in child care proceedings.  We hope the intended approach will result in an increase in the number of appointments of guardians <i>ad litem</i>, with an attendant increase in expenditure on guardian <i>ad litem</i>fees and expenses and a reduction in spending on external legal advice.  My aim is to refocus current expenditure in order that resources will be available to meet the increased guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs by reducing the current spend on legal costs.  I anticipate that the reforms will lead to substantially reduced legal costs.  This will come about through the provision of in-house legal advice by the national service provider and the introduction of standardised legal fees for a national panel of legal representatives for those cases in which legal representation for guardians <i>ad litem</i>is required.</p><p>While every effort will be made to introduce these reforms within existing resources, I acknowledge that some expenditure could be required.  Should this happen, any additional funding required will be quantified and sought by me in the context of the Estimates process.<br/><br/>My Department is carrying out a number of steps in parallel with the work on this Bill, including the preparation of requests for tender documentation for the procurement of a national service provider.  It is intended that the new service will be evaluated over time.  Other options can then be examined, as appropriate, including, for example, establishing the service within the proposed family court system or as a separate public body or placing it within existing statutory structures.<br/><br/>The proposed legislation has been designed to address the deficiencies in the current guardian <i>ad litem</i>service that have been acknowledged by all interests.  It is vital that we put in place a well organised quality-assured cost-effective national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service as soon as possible and I am committed to achieving this.  My Department and I will work intensively to implement it as soon as the Bill is finalised and enacted.<br/><br/>I look forward to our engagement which my officials will support.  I know that the committee has listened carefully to other representatives and taken their views into account in its analysis.  I assure it that it is my absolute intention in the light of our ongoing discussions to have the best Bill and service possible in the most efficient and speediest manner.</p></speech>

There are a great many positive things in this legislation.  In many ways, it will leave the area far better regulated and monitored.  However, our responsibility in this committee is to try to work with the Minister to improve it.  The concerns we have heard today and last month from several organisations are in two or three primary areas.  The first concern relates to where the service will be located and how it will be managed and funded.  I recognise the point made by the Minister to the effect that it will be separate from Tusla.  However, it will still be funded from it.  The Ombudsman for Children was before the committee earlier and made the point clearly that it was not only about a conflict of interest but a perceived conflict of interest.  The specific difficulty relates to a party being unhappy with a set of proceedings and knowing that there is the same paymaster for legal representation on both sides.  It is a question not only of Caesar's wife being beyond reproach but also being seen to be beyond reproach.  That is an important point.</p><p>I am also somewhat concerned about the process of tendering for a national service provider as opposed to a permanent statutory or public body.  Corresponding examples include the civil legal aid provided by the Legal Aid Board and so on.  I am concerned that if we were to operate on the basis of tendering, over the course of a decade or beyond we could potentially have a second competition involving a tender followed by a different service provider.  We could see a loss of institutional memory and all that goes with it.  My instinct is that we should have a permanent body funded directly through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I see no reason we should not have such a body.  If Tusla can fund such a body, why can the Department not do so?  It should be permanent.</p><p>A second major issue arises.  Catherine Ghent from the ISPCC was before the committee earlier.  She expressed reservations about the constitutionality of the legislation, specifically the fact that there was no automatic right to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to represent the voice of the child.  While I recognise that there may be circumstances in which a judge might decide that it is not necessary, the decision should be one for the child and whether he or she wishes to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Allowing for discretion in the hands of the judge rather than the child may not be in line with the spirit, whatever about the letter, of Article 42.</p><p>Another major issue relates to head 6, to which there are several aspects, the first of which is the ability to cross-examine.  All speakers expressed strong views on this point and suggested the proposal presented a difficulty that needed to be addressed.  I also believe the fact that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>cannot request a professional assessment is an issue.  It may well be in the best interests of the child.</p><p>My final point relates to a point well argued by EPIC on the potential enhancement of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service under this legislation.  The role of advocates as chosen by children through EPIC and other organisations needs to be safeguarded.  It is not the same as that of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>; it is different in that there is a closer relationship with the child.  It is the view of EPIC &ndash; one I support &ndash; that we need to be certain that the new dispensation ensures both advocates and guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be in a position to work hand in hand in court proceedings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#N00600"><p>I thank the Minister.  It is useful that she has come after we have heard the various voices.  Some of her officials were in the Visitors Gallery and would have been able to take notes.</p><p>Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has covered several of the issues involved.  I will return to the question of separation from Tusla.  The various groups which appeared before the committee advocated strongly on that point.  I will try to summarise what they sought.  They called for the Department to be the funder rather than Tusla.  They believe this is necessary and Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined the reasons well.  Since we are only at the stage where we are considering the heads, we are calling on the Minister to consider that suggestion.</p><p>The issue of the constitutional position was raised in the context of there being a presumption a guardian <i>ad litem</i>was needed.  The court will have to explain why it would prefer not to appoint one.  We need to come at it from a constitutional perspective.  Representatives of the Law Society of Ireland quoted Article 42A and made reference to how the views of the child &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;may&quot; be ascertained.  This was inserted into the Constitution following the recent referendum.  It should not necessarily be at the discretion of the court.  If a child believe he or she needs a guardian <i>ad litem</i>or a voice or needs to have his or her voice expressed through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, that should be the priority rather than the views of the court on the matter.  In other words, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be there for the child rather than the court.  It is a fundamental shift in the emphasis on how decisions are made with regard to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p><p>I wish to follow up on another point made by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It relates to the ability to cross-examine.  Ms Ghent said this was taking away a right.  Perhaps it might not apply in all circumstances, but if there is such a right, perhaps the Minister might reflect on whether it is being taken away.  I do not know.  I am referring to the right to cross-examine.  Obviously, Ms Ghent has considerable experience of such cases.</p><p>There was a suggestion that under head 5 one of the functions of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be to advocate on behalf of a child and that an extra function should be included in head 5.</p><p>There was a considerable discussion about non-verbal children and children who found it difficult to express themselves.  The point made was that a wider range of professionals should be referenced in the head dealing with professionals.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister should consider the inclusion of a wider range of professionals on the list of approved guardians <i>ad litem</i>to ensure, for example, that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>would be able to communicate with a child who had a difficulty communicating.</p></speech>

I am also delighted to hear she will have a child-centred approach to every aspect related to the child, which is terrific.  I am equally delighted to learn that she will be contract holder for this service and will have control over what will happen in this area.</p> <p>  I reiterate that my one concern relates to any involvement of Tusla in this service, and I have said that publicly on a few occasions.  Although the Minister has said that it will have no involvement in the overseeing or management of the service, the fact that it will provide funding is like it having a power trip.  I would like to know what Tusla's criteria will be to make payments.  In the context of this power control aspect that it and the HSE have, and from having been involved for many years, it nearly comes down to the personality, not to what the child or what the service needs.  That is my serious concern about any involvement of Tulsa in this service.  Who will oversee the creation of this national service?  The Minister said that she will be the contract holder.  Will she have a sub-committee that will oversee this, or how will it work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00300"><p>I apologise for being late.  During the past two days we heard presentations from various groups who have an involvement with and a good understanding of our most vulnerable in society.  I would like to pick up on two points.  A representative of Empowering People in Care, EPIC - I cannot remember the gentleman's name -spoke about the role of the advocate.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children endorsed and echoed what he said, namely, that a relationship is sometimes built up between the children and the advocate.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is to inform the court while the role of the advocate is to be the voice of the child.  While there are two voices in term of those roles, they possibly have two different levels of engagement, with one being at the level of the Courts Service when a child is in a court environment.  I do not know if the role of the advocate is set out in the Bill.  What does the Minister envisage to be the role of the advocate, if, for example, a court decides there is no need for a guardian <i>ad litem </i>to be appointed?  It is at that point that the role of the advocate would be involved?</p><p>I wish to ask an awkward question.  All the groups who came before us expressed the wish that the service would not be part of Tusla and they made strong representations in that respect.  They also expressed the wish that Tusla would not be funding mechanism for the service or have overarching responsibility for it.  Tusla is tasked with recruiting our social care workers.  Its was formed to deal with child protection issues.  Why have all the representatives who appeared before the committee in recent weeks said that they do not want Tusla involved in this service?  I did not see its involvement in this service prior to today, but today it is clear it will be involved.  Why has there been that shift?  Why do we not have a belief that Tusla should be given that role?  I know it is a difficult question but it is one that needs to be asked.  It is tasked with role of protecting all children in our society.  That is its role and it is the umbrella organisation in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00400"><p>The answer to the Deputy's question is that we believe Tusla cannot be trusted.  That is the short, unscientific answer.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the committee again today.  I raised earlier the matter of ensuring this service will provide for the needs of children with disabilities, be they intellectual or physical.  The children who may be represented in court may not have the verbal skills of their counterparts who run around the playground with them every day and they may also be more disadvantaged.  The service will need to be able to interpret children's wishes, desires and their story of what is going on in their family or the care institutions.  Does the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service require a subsection, as it were, to provide for the interpretation of a child with disabilities who has poor or no verbal skills?  We referenced previously the horrendous cases of Grace and Mary who did not have a voice.</p><p>I gather that the Minister will quickly set up the procurement process and tender for a service provider to deliver the service.  Those interested, which I imagine will be child agencies such as Barnardos, will respond and submit their costs.  Is there a time limit for that process?  In the interests of the children and the smooth running of the service, it would appropriate that the service would come back under a statutory body and it would preferable if it were set up in that way initially.  Is there a time limit for the procurement process in terms of tendering, the receipt of applications, the selection process and there being a review or an assessment of the service within, say, five years?  Will that process work?  Will we be able to bring the service back under a statutory body within the remit of Government and good governance in terms of it being a public service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.95" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#O00500"><p>All those are excellent questions.  Many of the members have focused on similar issues and I might deal with the issues as distinct from responding to individual members' questions unless a member asked a unique question.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire commented that ideally it would be better ultimately if this service provision was located within an independent body as distinct from there being a tendering process for a national service provider in light of all the arguments he made for that.  Deputy Devine also referred to this issue.  While ultimately that may be the case, and I accept the point in terms of institutional memory and all that would need to be assembled to perform these functions and this service for the children, largely the decision to move in the direction that we are going is to ensure we enable as speedy a reform as possible.  Effectively, it is a pragmatic decision.  There is also the opportunity built into this approach of reviewing the process after a number of years.  The officials might identify that period but I will deal with the members' questions first.  When this service is in operation, there can be a close review and monitoring of it to determine if this is the best way to deliver the service.  We are in a position where extensive reform is required and it is happening on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  We all know what the issues are. We are trying to put in place the provision of a top-class set of services for our children and young people but we may not be able to get to that point as our starting point.  I still believe that this is the best way to proceed in terms of the establishment of a national service provider through a tendering process as distinct from the establishment of a separate body immediately.  Members will be aware that current Government policy is that we must be careful about establishing any further public bodies, but that is the not be the best reason for not doing it because Government policy can always change.</p><p>On the question of Tusla's role in this regard in terms of the operation of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>national service, I appreciate the members' concerns and questions and also those of the advocates in terms of Tusla.</p><p>Let me say a couple of things in that regard and then we can have a further exchange on it.  I emphasised in my opening remarks that I as the Minister am the contractor.  As I understand it, all of the responsibilities and so on that come with that role, including the funding, fall on the Department.  The Department ultimately provides the funding but Tusla administers it.  That is the way I would describe it.  Perhaps officials can help to finesse the detail of that.  Tusla is not funding the service.  The Department for Children and Youth Affairs is funding the service.  Tusla does not have any role, for example, in reviewing invoices in terms of the work or the fees for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, or the establishment of fees for the legal representatives.  The service provider does that.  The decision is that in the interests of efficiency and to fund the service effectively, the Department provides Tusla with the moneys to administer the services but it does not in any way make decisions on the oversight or dealing with individual invoices and so forth.  A member said the Department needs to be clear and to spell out exactly what Tusla is doing and not doing in this regard.  The perception probably needs to be sorted, and what that means is there is no role for Tusla except to administer the funding which the Government provides.<br/><br/>I will ask Ms Fisher to explain it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#P00200"><p>Many members have raised questions on this issue.  I think some of the issues have been raised because the general scheme does not cover some of these issues.  Some of the issues raised were in regard to the detail of the service level agreement and the contract that will be conducted between the Minister and the national service provider.  Obviously we can revert to the committee in assisting it in understanding that.  By its nature it cannot be in the general scheme because that would be very prescriptive and we want to be flexible.<br/><br/>On the question of the payments mechanism, a payments mechanism process of the sort that would be required for something at this level does not exist in the Department.  There is a payments mechanism process in Tusla.  It is akin to a banking system that is not responsible for the actual daily invoices and looking at the quality of the work that is being carried out by the different guardians <i>ad litem</i>or the amount of time they were in court or the actual substance of the invoice. The substance of the invoice and the financial management of that would be a matter for the service provider, which would be monitored by the Department, and that would be very closely monitored under the service level agreement.  We are in consultation at present with the Office for Government Procurement in regard to how best to set it up, and it is advising us very closely on that.  What we have tried to do, as the Minister has been pointing out, is to distance Tusla from the process of being in contact with individual guardians <i>ad litem </i>themselves from the point of view of maintaining the independence of the individual guardians <i>ad litem</i>, while at the same time, given the necessity to speed up and improve the current system as urgently as possible, which we all recognise has deficiencies, to have that payment mechanism, that banking system in Tusla so that it can process the payments.  The service level agreement with the service provider will provide more detail on that and we can come back to the committee as necessary.</p></speech>

I will deal with the issue of whether the child has an automatic right to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, and that being raised in the context of the constitutionality of it.  As I understand it, and I can ask officials to support me, the major shift in the Bill is that there is a presumption that the child ought to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<i></i>Describing it in that way as distinct from another is because it could be the case, given the child's ability in terms of his or her age to make a decision, that the child may not be able to express a preference whether he or she wants a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That is a concern, because in light of the child's age, the child may not be able to make that decision.  To put it in the context of the presumption, if the judge makes a decision not to use the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and instead wishes to have a direct exchange with the child on the child's view as distinct from an exchange with the guardian<i>ad litem</i>, that is also taken into consideration.  I think, and I will ask the officials to elaborate, that the shift is largely that the presumption is effectively the most pragmatic way to ensure the child has that right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017040500002#P00400"><p>I would like to draw the committee's attention to head 15 because that might reassure members.  While the general scheme provides for a presumption in relation to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the general scheme itself provides in subhead 1 that in any proceedings before the court under this Act in respect of the protection of a child, the court shall in so far as is practicable give due consideration, having regard to his age and maturity to the views of the child.  That is very strong.  While there is a presumption in relation to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, and that is one thing, in terms of actually hearing the voice of the child, this amendment of section 24 of the Act says the court shall in so far as is practicable give due consideration to the views of the child.  One way of giving consideration to the views of the child is through a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and there is a presumption of appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>. The court has to consider the most appropriate means for hearing the child's views.  If in the view of the court the child is of such age, maturity and level of articulateness that it does not believe that a guardian <i>ad litem </i>should be appointed, then the court will have to give reasons that cannot be done.  There is the prescription in respect of hearing the views and then there is the question of how they should be heard.  If there is a presumption of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>being appointed and the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is not appointed, the court has to give the reasons.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

Allowing the guardian <i>ad litem </i>to cross-examine was seen by one eminent judge to give the guardian <i>ad litem </i>a status akin to a party in the proceedings.  That was changing the role of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>significantly from being a person appointed to express the views of the child, pass on his or her feelings, wishes and views and give assistance to the court in its professional assessment to having a separate role as a party to the proceedings.  It was seen, if I am correct in this, and we considered in depth something that was said by the President of the District Court that this was akin to giving the guardian <i>ad litem </i>party status.  In such circumstances, giving such status was moving too far away from the express purpose of the Bill of giving effect to the voice of the child.<br/><br/>There always has been since the 1991 legislation a provision to provide for the child to be made a party to proceedings.  As Carol Coulter said in her Child Care Law Reporting Project, this provision is rarely used.  That provision will continue through this Bill as well and the child can be made a party to the proceedings.  Where this happens and legal representation is appointed, the cross-examination will take place.  Given the concerns have been raised and having listened to the various interventions this morning, that is perhaps too nuanced and we may need to clarify that more.  We can talk to the Parliamentary Counsel on that.  We were concerned that the purpose of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>might be diluted, which I totally understand.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made a point about professional reports.  The matter may need to be considered.  The professional reports in the particular head he mentioned relate to the production of the GAL's report to the court.  Where those reports on the child had previously been acquired by Tusla, for example, it was felt that it would be unfair to have the child be the subject of further reports.  There is a head that allows for any issue to be brought to the attention of the court and for the court to request any report that it deems necessary.  Perhaps the provision may be too nuanced.  We need to consider the provision again but we will take on board the views expressed by members.</p></speech>

We have heard what members have said about the matter.</p> <p>  Under the proposed new system, the child can be a party and can have legal representation, which is a route to advocacy.  The whole point with regard to the proposed new system is for it to be different from the current system and to provide clarity in respect of the role of the GAL.  First, it will outline what is the role of the GAL and, second, it will indicate where advocacy begins and ends in the context of the GAL.  We must decide whether it would be better if the GAL was not expressly given the power of advocacy and whether it would be better for that power to be bestowed on a legal representative who would be trained to act as a professional advocate in court.  A firm line on this has not been established.  We must discuss where advocacy starts and ends with the Parliamentary Counsel.  We must have clarity because there is inconsistency when it comes to the function and roles of GALs.  We want to pin all of that down and there may be a way to do so.</p></speech>

It is considered more appropriate to have an independent person to speak as the voice of the child in such proceedings.  It would not be appropriate for Tusla to play the role because it will have instigated proceedings.  The whole point of having a guardian <i>ad litem</i>separate from Tusla is to provide an independent voice to challenge, reason in respect of and analyse the decision.  Were the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be part of Tusla, then the provision would dilute and almost submerge independence.  The whole point of a GAL is to be separate, challenging and independent.  Have I answered the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Let us say someone took a case on the basis that a judge exercised his or her discretion not to appoint a guardian ad litem.  Five or six years later, because he or she was not offered the services of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the person might return to court and claim that his or her rights under Article 42A were not vindicated.  What defence could be offered in such a case?  I accept the point with regard to head 15.  The provision could have existed before the referendum.  I refer to the words, &quot;in so far as practicable, give due consideration, having regard to ... age and maturity, to the views of the child.&quot;  The level of due consideration fundamentally changed after the constitutional referendum.  I am of the view, therefore, that a question still arises in this regard.</p><p>On Tusla, the Minister stated that there is an awful long distance to travel.  If we to undertake a fundamental reshaping the entire area, then I do not see a reason not to include the establishment of a body.  This is the appropriate occasion on which to do so.  I still have reservations about using a tender process because I do not believe that this can provide for the permanency and consistency required.</p></speech>

I have quarterly meetings with Tusla and at times in between.  There are huge challenges in terms of the work of the organisation.  Lots of things have come out, and more things will come out, in terms of past practices, etc.  Tusla has embarked on a major programme of reform.  The Department and I will oversee and monitor this.  I appreciate that the public has major concerns in light of different things that have happened.  A lot of these relate to legacy issues, as well as to systemic issues in the past couple of years.  A reform programme has been put in place.  I have also launched a special HIQA investigation.  There is ongoing HIQA monitoring and reports are being compiled throughout the country in terms of where Tusla operates.  We receive these reports and respond to them.  I appreciate that the more general concern has an impact on what we have discussed here.</p><p>In addition to being very clear about what Tusla is doing in this regard, there might also be an important communications piece on behalf of the Department as we move to this new way of provision.  I accept Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's view that perhaps the tendering process might not be the ideal way to go.  However, from a pragmatic perspective, it is the speediest way.  We require reform and we are building a way of monitoring and evaluating that will bring us to where we wish to go.</p></speech>

The GAL could ask the judge to make the child a party.  Deputy &Oacute; Loaghaire referred to due consideration.  That is to provide some latitude.  It is written in that way for the purpose of saying that, with regard to certain circumstances, it might be quite clear to the court that it is difficult for the child to provide his or her views.  Due consideration is something that would have to be weighed by any appeal court or any other mechanism.  Due consideration is almost intangible; it is almost subjective.  I accept that there might be difficulties in that regard but, at the same time, the purpose of this is to provide a situation where the court shall take account of the views of the child and to provide for that with as much prescription as possible, bearing in mind that there will be difficulties for the child to give those views in particular cases.</p></speech>

We have had discussions with the various legal advisers along the way and we will continue to have them.  Before a Bill is tabled, it is checked for constitutionality but, of course, those questions can arise again.  We will have particular regard for that, especially in light of the questions raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It would be appointing a GAL for every child for the sake of appointing one, because there are numerous cases where it is not necessary to have a GAL.  There has to be a level in that regard.  This is all about giving effect to the voice of the child.  There is one issue that often confuses me.  In court cases involving a child in care, the person who knows the child best, arguably, is the care giver, who is the foster carer.  Let us say that it is four years later and the court case comes up again to review the child's care order and whether it continues.  There is no means for the care giver to contribute.  Given that this legislation is about giving effect to the voice of the child, have you given any consideration to allowing that for a care giver?  I have not come across where it occurs.</p></speech>

As I understand it, they are not consulted in any way in the vast majority of cases.

It is my experience that there is a clear and deliberate intention to exclude foster carers from the deliberations regarding care orders.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#A00500"><p>I have a brief opening statement, if the Chairman will allow it.  In setting out to discuss the Government amendments being proposed at today's meeting, members might like to have a sense of how and why those amendments have come about.</p> <p>  Section 2 of the Bill as initiated deals with the amendment of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act, 1986, which is the primary purpose of the Bill.</p> <p>  Section 1 of the Act of 1986 deals with the issuing of summonses in respect of offences as a matter of administrative procedure.  In 2004, the 1986 Act was recast, principally for the purpose of allowing for the issue of a summons to be effected by transmitting it by electronic means to the person who applied for it.  This allowed for the issuing of summonses electronically by the relevant court office in addition to the issuing of summonses manually.  The introduction of the third payment requires not only the issuing of summonses by electronic means but also the creation of the summons in an automatic manner.</p> <p>  The drafting approach to achieve this has undergone a revision by the Office of the Attorney General since the Bill was published.  The five Government amendments to section 2 of the Bill now being proposed are intended to give effect to this revised drafting approach.  The revised drafting approach is intended to ensure that the amendments to the 1986 Act to be made by the Bill are as legally robust, straightforward and challenge-proof as possible.  The original drafting approach in the Bill as initiated sought to integrate the new method of the creation of a summons in an automatic manner with existing provisions of the Act of 1986, particularly those relating to the notion of an original summons document and true copy summonses.  However, in the new automated system, there is no longer considered to be a need for a physical original in circumstances where both the original and the copy are created from the same source data and on foot of an automated process.  The revised drafting approach as set out under today's amendments seeks to follow through on this conclusion by not applying the original true copy separation in the case of the new automated process for the issuing of summonses.  The revised drafting approach therefore provides in a clearer, more distinct way for the new automated system as an additional but still legally robust method for the issue of a summons.  It is mainly technical stuff, as the Chairman will appreciate.</p></speech>

Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section 2A into the 1986 Act.</p><p> Amendment No. 1 proposes to replace the wording of the current section 2A with alternative wording.  This alternative wording arises from the further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and is aimed at expressing in a more straightforward manner the essential elements of the new system of the printing of summonses.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(a) essentially repeats the provision for the issue of a summons by electronic means to be deemed to have been effected by the transmission by the relevant court office of the information necessary to create the summons in an automatic manner.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(b) deals with the reality in the context of an automated system that the date of issue of a summons by the transmission of the electronic information may be earlier than the date of the creation of the summons.  In this context, the creation of the summons is the printing of the summons as a paper document.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(c) departs from the approach in the Bill as initiated in respect of the deeming of each summons to be a true copy of the summons.  The amendment now proposes that where more than one document is created in respect of the same alleged offence, each such document shall be the summons.</p><p> The proposed section 2A(d) essentially repeats, but in a more straightforward manner, the provision of the Bill to the effect that the creation in an automatic manner of a summons shall be taken to be the printing on paper of the summons.</p></speech>

Effectively, we are legislating for an automated system around summonses.

If we are doing something by electronic or automated means, in a human context what is within the legislation to prevent something adverse occurring to the person who is going to receive the summons, given that it is an automated system?</p></speech>

Part of the problem is the question of whether the summons was received by the person at the other end.  What if a person claims they never got it?  There were anomalies.</p> <p>  The third payment option means that when the second notice arrives, a third payment option is available.  I understand up to 80% of the first notices are being paid.  An Post has a rigorous method of delivering post.  Whether people were simply ignoring these things or whether they arrived in the first place are the questions that arose.  The PULSE system has been changed such that these errors cannot recur.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan&rsquo;s point is interesting.  However, if a person says that he never got a summons, what happens then?  We must ensure that the PULSE system works and that is our purpose at the moment.  The third payment option should make the system far more robust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#B01200"><p>Maybe it is a discussion for another day.  The anomaly still exists.  I got a summons but I never got a fixed charge notice.  That was relatively recently &ndash; just before Christmas.  I get enough fixed charge notices, but I definitely did not get the notice in question.  I am well aware that was the case.  When we raised it with the Garda Commissioner last week, her answer basically implied that the problem was with An Post.</p> <p>  When the initial penalty points scandal arose, systems were put in place to correct the problem.  Then, a year later, another protected disclosure was made in either 2013 or 2014.  In that case, the claim was made that the system was still faulty despite all the checks that had been put in place.  The excuse given to get over the new restrictions in place with the penalty points was based around undeliverable An Post mail.  An independent investigation was set up by the Minister under the offices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Moneys were provided by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Three years on, that investigation has not taken off.  It is correct to raise concerns about the systems.  I reckon the systems are seriously flawed still.  It is probably something of a side issue to the legislation, which I believe to be a good measure.  However, it needs to be factored in.</p></speech>

The two agencies that manage the systems are the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present a fixed charge notice is issued by an outsourced print service provider on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Summonses are issued by the Courts Service following an application from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These two processes need to be linked to provide for the third payment option.</p> <p>  The technical solution between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na represents a departure from current arrangements made necessary to accommodate the simultaneous generation of a summons issued by the Courts Service and a fixed charge notice issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The agreed approach involves the electronic generation of summonses by means of an electronic file transfer from the Courts Service to an external print service provider contracted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Each summons will then be individually printed with an associated fixed charge notice and will represent the second such notice and the third opportunity to pay, for the purposes of service.</p> <p>  The systems have become more integrated and linked together now.  However, the Deputies are correct.  We have to be vigilant and monitor this.  It will be monitored carefully from now on to ensure the problems Deputy O'Callaghan and Deputy Chambers brought up cannot and will not happen again.</p></speech>

Section 2(b) provides for the insertion of a new subsection 4A into section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to replace the wording of section 4A with alternative wording.  This alternative wording arises from the further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel aimed at expressing in a more precise manner the reality that a single transmission by electronic means can, in respect of more than one summons, or more than one application, be made for a summons.  This provision allows for the automated processing within an information technology environment of batches of summonses or applications of summonses.</p></speech>

The Bill, as initiated, proposed that this matter be dealt with by way of an amendment to the existing section 1(9) of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  Amendment No. 4 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (9A) into section 1 of the Act of 1986 as an alternative to the originally proposed amendment to subsection (9).  This alternative approach arises from further work from the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel.  The new subsection (9A) provides for presumption that the summons created under the new subsection (2A) is created on the basis of the information transmitted by the relevant court office.  Also included in amendment No. 4, again on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, is an amended section 1(9) of the Act of 1986.  This amended subsection (9) is essentially a restatement of the existing subsection, with the substitution of a presuming clause for a deeming clause.  This reflects the preference on the part of Parliamentary Counsel for the drafting solution of a presuming clause rather than the deeming clause in the Act of 1986.  However, the legislative effect is intended to be essentially the same.</p></speech>

Subsection (10) of the 1986 Act provides that in the case of a summons that has been issued by electronic means, a true copy of the summons shall be evidence of the summons concerned.  In the Bill as initiated it had been proposed to also apply this provision to a summons created in an automatic manner under the new subsection (2A).  Amendment No. 5 proposes that subsection (10) will remain unaltered and that consequently it will continue to apply only to summonses issued by electronic means in accordance with section 1(2) of the 1986 Act.  This alternative approach arises from further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and flows from subsection (2A), whereby every printed document in respect of the same alleged offence is to be considered the summons.</p><p>Subsection (14) of the 1986 Act provides for definitions of various terms used in the Act.  In the Bill as initiated it had been proposed to add a definition of the term &quot;document&quot; and amend the definition of the term &quot;true copy&quot;.  The definition of the term &quot;document&quot; was proposed to clarify that a document includes electronic material or electronic information.  Within the Act of 1986, a summons is referred to as a document so the new definition was intended to have the effect of reflecting the issue of summonses as part of a batch of electronic data transmitted from the relevant court office to a print service provider acting on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is no longer proposed that this drafting approach shall be followed in the Bill.  This change arises from further work of the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel and arises from the new subsection (2A), whereby every printed document in respect of the same alleged offence is considered to be the summons.  The term &quot;true copy&quot; is currently defined in the 1986 Act with regard to a summons that has been issued electronically as a reproduction in writing of the summons certified by the prosecutor as being a true copy thereof.  In the Bill as initiated, it had been proposed to amend this definition.  However, as I previously explained, under the revised drafting approach, every printed document under the new automatic system is to be considered the summons.  Consequently, the matter of a true copy of the summons does not arise under the new and more straightforward approach.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#C00700"><p>I move amendment No. 6:</p><blockquote>In page 5, lines 6 to 12, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; in line 6 down to and including line 12 and substitute the following:&quot;Notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law, a summons may be issued under and in accordance with the Act of 1986 in respect of a fixed charge offence within the meaning of Part 3 (amended by Part 5 of the  Road Traffic Act 2016) of the Act of 2010 in the circumstances provided for by the Act of 2010 where the fixed charge offence is alleged to have been committed by a person who is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>This provides for the amendment of section 3 of the Bill by the insertion of enhanced alternative language.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for an exception to made from the general rule that a summons against a person who is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be signed by a judge.  This procedure cannot be accommodated in the proposed new streamlined arrangements for the creation of a summons in an automatic manner.  Section 3(1)(a) in the published Bill directly relates to the operation of the third payment option and is therefore an essential component of this Bill.  It is being replaced by the new and clearer language prepared in consultation with the Advisory Counsel and Parliamentary Counsel with amendment No. 6.  Section 3(1)(b) is not directly linked with the third payment option and would not form part of that system when it goes live.  The case for its inclusion in this Bill now has receded following further consideration of the overall policy framework, including relevant road traffic legislation and following further consultation with Advisory Counsel, Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Accordingly, it is proposed that for present purposes, section 3(1)(b) will be deleted from the Bill and it will be revisited as part of a wider review of the summons process under which it is a more logical fit.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something we must look at and it must make it more difficult for a garda to summons another garda if, in order to do so, he or she is required to get the imprimatur and signature of a judge.  We can take it up on Report Stage but perhaps the committee or Minister should look at it to see if the process could be harmonised and the summons of a garda could be treated in the same way as a summons for anybody else.  We can note the legislation dealing with this dates to 1924.</p></speech>

We are inserting four new sections into the Bill, all of which are technical in nature.  The amendments concern the application of Section 5A - questioning of persons detained under section 4 not generally permitted pending access to legal advice - of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as inserted by Section 9(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 to the detention provisions of three Statutes, namely the Offences Against the State Act 1939, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Section 5A concerns the well-established right of a person in Garda custody to access legal advice and is aimed at clarifying the circumstances in which questioning may proceed, notwithstanding that a suspect has not yet had an opportunity to consult a solicitor.  It is an established policy principle that the relevant provisions of the 1984 Act relating to detentions made under Section 4 of that Act should also apply to detentions made under the aforementioned three criminal justice statutes.  Sections 9(b), 13 and 14 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 apply the new Section 5A of the 1984 Act to the statutes in question.  However, difficulties have arisen from the fact that both the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 amend the same provisions of the three statutes in question and while the amendments contained in the 2014 Act have already been commenced, those of the 2011 Act have not.  The fact that the provisions of the 2011 Act will be commenced after those of the 2014 Act has given rise to uncertainty as to what the final outcome of the amended detention provisions will be.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the most prudent way to clarify the matter is to draw up new provisions providing for the application of Section 5A to the detention provisions of the three statutes in question and to repeal the application of the provisions of the 2011 Act.  That is what these amendments effectively achieve.</p> <p>  We began with a bail Bill but because we are making changes to it which are outside of bail law, we had to pass a motion in the D&aacute;il last night to allow this to happen.  Normally, we would just introduce Government amendments on Committee Stage and present them here but we had to make these changes by way of a motion in the D&aacute;il, which is quite unusual.  It also means that we are widening the scope of the Bill and changing its Title.  That is why the motion, which was technical in nature, had to be dealt with last night.  Normally we would just bring the amendments to this committee and present them but we could not do so in this instance.  I thank the members for their indulgence in that regard.</p></speech>

In effect, we are being asked to put together a Criminal Justice Bill as opposed to a Bail (Amendment) Bill and we could have done with more time in respect of that.  We will deal with it today and we did not oppose the motion in the D&aacute;il last night, although we could have done.  That said, there are significant changes being proposed here and we could do with more time.  We will proceed with the legislation in any event but I just wanted to record my slight dissatisfaction with the situation.</p></speech>

The new provision concerns detention of intoxicated persons in Garda stations in circumstances where those persons, if released, would be a danger to themselves or others.  It allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detain intoxicated persons who have been arrested for public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and who, but for this new provision, would be released.  Such persons can be detained for a period not exceeding six hours, where the member in charge of the Garda station in which the persons are in custody is of the opinion that they are intoxicated to such an extent as to be considered a danger to themselves or to other persons if released.  The provision also allows release prior to the expiration of the six hour detention period.  To date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has relied on a presumed common law duty of care to intoxicated persons to justify such detention.  However, this practice has no statutory basis and this amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act will provide for such a statutory basis.</p></speech>

Currently, there is a common law presumption of a duty of care.  If it is the opinion of the garda in charge of a station that individuals would be a danger to themselves or to other members of the public if released, they can be held.  Is there a time limit on that at present?  We are proposing to insert a time limit but does one exist at the moment?</p></speech>

That makes it difficult.  I was arrested under suspicion of drink driving a number of years ago.  I was not and was well under the limit but when I was leaving the station the sergeant told me to come back when I was sober.  What is to say under other circumstances the sergeant could say, "You are a danger to yourself and others"?  It is probably an extreme example but it relates to the lack of confidence in the Garda in terms of this discretion.</p></speech>

The common law is a very vague animal and the public cannot really point to any section in an Act and state that is where the power comes from.  It is beneficial, therefore, to have it on a statutory basis to protect the garda&iacute; and the individuals concerned so that there is a legal basis upon which the garda&iacute; detain people.  From my assessment of it, to date it has been dealt with responsibly by the garda&iacute;.  Unfortunately, people get extremely drunk.  They can be a danger to themselves and to others.  It would be interesting if we did an assessment of the convictions before our courts to see the correlation between convictions and people who have a lot of drink taken.  It is extraordinarily high.  It is worthwhile putting this on a statutory basis.</p> <p>  In terms of the definition, I note that subsection (4) states: "In this section &lsquo;intoxication&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in section 4.&rdquo;.  I think that should be "intoxicated" as opposed to "intoxication".</p> <p>  On the reason for the six hours, that is based on an assessment as to how long it takes to sober up or for somebody to ensure they are no longer a danger to themselves but we cannot ignore the fact that there are circumstances where people are extremely drunk, they have not committed any criminal offence but there is a serious prospect that if they are allowed to continue as they are they will damage themselves or someone else.</p></speech>

Is there any legislative measure that requires the garda&iacute; to put them into a health care setting?  That would be a concern for me.  If we are putting a statutory timeline on a potential case of alcohol poisoning, that could have an adverse effect in the context of their future well-being.  If someone is in that mental state, they are potentially close to developing alcohol poisoning.  We need to be careful that we are not simply confining them to four walls but that a health care intervention takes place and that that could be incorporated within the law.</p></speech>

To respond to Deputy Chambers's question, the position is that there are custody regulations in place and they allow the member in charge to seek medical treatment, where necessary.  If the member in charge believes that somebody is at risk from the point of view of health or worse, they can and have to get medical attention.</p> <p>  On the six hours issue, we had to strike a balance between what is reasonable detention  and a person's freedom.  People should not be held but if somebody who is dangerously intoxicated was allowed to leave a Garda station and they got hurt, hurt somebody else or were killed, questions would be asked as to why they were released when they did not know what they were doing.  That is the purpose of this provision.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the common law is a very vague animal and we want to make it clear under statute, and it is a maximum amount of time.  I believe that if somebody was that dangerously intoxicated initially, the member in charge would seek medical advice.  There are custody regulations in place to govern this area and they have to be followed but seeking medical advice is part of that.</p></speech>

The amendment is changing the 1997 Act with the effect that when a judge is deciding to impose conditions on bail, those conditions have to be &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  The Act says &quot;appropriate&quot;.  That might seem like a small change.  The decision to grant or refuse bail is an incredibly serious one.  We have to be very careful in legislating in this area.  We have to take into account the costs of the decision.  There are substantial economic and social costs of using prison for remand as an alternative to bail.  When breaching one's conditions of bail is likely to result in a penal sentence, that has implications which need to be taken into account.  We must also bear in mind that the person has not been convicted.</p><p>Remand is disproportionately used against women.  The most up-to-date statistics were for 2013.  They showed that 13% of the male prison population were on remand compared with 20% of female prisoners.  The impact of women getting a custodial sentence, which we have explored over recent weeks in our consultation on penal policy, is that even a few weeks on remand could result in a woman losing her accommodation, custody of her children or whatever.  It is incredibly disruptive. We have to be careful about the conditions imposed by the court and that they are such that the person has a decent chance of complying with them.  Otherwise, they could end up in prison.</p><p>The problem with &quot;appropriate&quot; is that it can vary from court to court depending on the judge.  It  is quite vague.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, has said that where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty is satisfied.  Therefore, &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot; will be a greater guiding tool for the judiciary than &quot;appropriate&quot;.</p></speech>

She has put a lot of thought into it.  I appreciate the aim of the proposal but I am concerned it may have unintended consequences.  We may have to tease it out a bit more.</p><p>The amendment would replace the requirement in section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bail Act that bail conditions be considered &quot;appropriate&quot; with a requirement they be considered &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  There is already a well-established principle that any restriction of a person's constitutional rights must be proportionate to the objective and impair those rights as little as possible.  That is a constitutional provision.  On one reading, it may be argued that the amendment is unnecessary as the current provision already meets the objective.</p><p>The Deputy has proposed the amendment with a view to limiting the conditions which may be imposed.  It is possible that the inclusion of the word &quot;necessary&quot; would have this effect in some circumstances.  It is important to consider carefully the implications of this.  It may have the effect of preventing the imposition of the new condition in section 3 of the Bill restricting contact between the accused and the victim or his or her family.  Therefore, while I do not have a difficulty with the Deputy's objective in this amendment, the effect of the change in wording requires further consideration to determine its precise implications.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment at this time.</p><p>We will be prepared to look at it on Report Stage but it requires further consideration.  There may be unintended consequences which could cause more harm than good.</p></speech>

Section 6(1)(b) says: &quot;the recognisance may be subject to such conditions as the court considers appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case&quot;.  The proposal is that we would change the word &quot;appropriate&quot; and put in the words &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot;.  I do not think there is a huge difference but I would be prepared to look at it.</p><p>My only concern is that I want the addition of subparagraphs (vi),<i></i>(vii) and<i></i>(viii), which are in the Bill before us, to section 6(1)(b) of the Bail Act.  I do not think this amendment would deal with those subparagraphs but I was slightly concerned that the amendment, in stating &ldquo;in subsection 1(b) by the substitution of &ldquo;considers necessary and proportionate&rdquo; for &ldquo;considers appropriate&rdquo;,&rdquo; is an amendment to the substance of the Act of 1997 as opposed to what is relevant here when one looks at section 3 of the Bill.  I am slightly confused by that and want to be certain what the consequences of that would be.</p></speech>

It is not only about limiting the conditions but also about making sure they are not unreasonable and that people will be able to comply with them.  It has to be seen in the context of later amendments which raise the issue of bail supports.  Bail supports have been demonstrated to have the greatest impact on whether people can comply and keeping people out of prison on remand.  If the Minister of State would clarify it for Report Stage I am happy to re-enter it at that stage if necessary.</p></speech>

The problem is that extending Garda powers to arrest without warrant in the absence of the provision for bail supports and services is what the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, calls a short-term and simplistic solution to what is a complex problem.</p><p>The particular concern I have about the new subsection (10) relates to a situation in which a garda might think that the person is about to breach his or her bail conditions.  The garda might anticipate that the person is going to do it, but the person will not actually have done anything.  It is a future crime for which we are allowing an arrest without warrant.  I know that it is qualified under the circumstances, but giving the power of arrest without warrant for something that has not happened is very dangerous.  This is something that has potential for a lot of abuse.  I would be concerned about it in that regard.<br/><br/>Garda&iacute; already have the power to arrest people without a warrant if they have committed crimes or if they are attempting to do so.  We have already covered circumstances such as if a person on bail physically assaults somebody, tries to physically somebody or roughs somebody up.  What the new subsection does is give garda&iacute; the power to arrest somebody without warrant.  For example, if a person went into a pub that he or she should not have been in and the person who was the alleged victim of the crime happens to be there as well, those circumstances could result in an arrest.  I am of the view that a breach of bail conditions should be dealt with in the usual way.  It is a little bit dangerous that we are giving garda&iacute; a sort of <i>carte blanche </i>to go around arresting people because they think something is about to happen.  That could be dangerous and it requires a few safeguards.  That is the thinking behind the amendment.</p></speech>

The Deputy is proposing the deletion of the new Garda power of arrest, that will be inserted by section 3 of the Bill into section 6 of the Bail Act 1997.  The provision would allow a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest, without warrant, a person who has been released on bail where the member reasonably suspects that the person has breached, is in the act of breaching or is about to breach a condition of his or her bail and the immediate arrest is necessary to prevent harm to or interference with the victim, another witness or another person that the court is specifically trying to protect.  We are talking about protecting victims here as well.  Let us not forget that.  The power of arrest provided in this provision has been very carefully considered and is very limited in nature.  There must be an imminent risk of harm or intimidation to the victim, witness or other identified person.  The provision is reasonable and is necessary to allow a member of the Garda to intervene in such circumstances.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment at this time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#H00300"><p>I also will not be supporting the amendment for the following reasons.  A person accused of sexual assault or rape can apply for and be granted bail.  One of the conditions of bail set by a judge is that the person must stay away from the complainant in the sexual assault or rape case.  If the individual who is accused then turns up near the house of or in the vicinity of the area in which the complainant lives, that is a breach of the bail conditions.  From the point of view of the complainant, it is very unsatisfactory that she - most likely - must wait for the DPP to go back to court to apply for a change of bail conditions.  It is reasonable that garda&iacute; be given the power to arrest an individual who is in breach of a bail condition.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly said that it is about garda&iacute; having a power to prevent an offence or something that is about to happen.  However, it is not simply that.  If we look at the new subsection 10(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), it is clear that subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) go beyond that.  Deputy Clare Daly is right when she says that the subsection will give the power to garda&iacute; to arrest a person if they believe that he or she is about to contravene any of the conditions of the recognisance.  It then goes on to state that it also covers cases where the person is in the act of contravening any of the conditions or where the person has contravened any of the conditions.  This is an important protection which will ensure that bail conditions are taken seriously.  People obviously have an entitlement to bail.  However, there are various factors that are weighed up.  If conditions are set for a person in order to be granted bail, that individual must comply with those conditions.  If the conditions are breached to such an extent that the person is contravening them, garda&iacute; should be given the power of arrest in respect of that.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 relate to electronic monitoring.  The Bill amends section 6B such that the imposition of electronic monitoring can be at the behest of the prosecutor.  Under the Bill, electronic monitoring may be imposed on individuals charged with serious offences and those appealing sentences of imprisonment imposed by the District Court.  What these amendments seek to do is put in place a few rules, guidelines or safeguards - call them what you will - in respect of the use of electronic monitoring.  I accept that electronic monitoring can be a useful tool in the criminal justice system.  We know that in countries such Denmark, for example, 60% of all custodial sentences under six months are converted to electronic monitoring and intense supervision.  In Belgium, any prison sentence of less that three years is automatically commuted to electronic tagging.  This is a mechanism that is used.  However, we have to be careful when making electronic monitoring a condition of bail that the necessary safeguards are in place.  That is the aim behind these amendments.  They are trying to beef up the safeguards.</p><p>Electronic monitoring applies in two scenarios, namely, in respect of the commission of a serious offence or for people appealing prison sentences handed down by the District Court.  I think we have to tighten up matters in respect of the duration.  If we do not, delays in the system could mean people being tagged for a long time.  We have to take into account, as the amendment does, the person's age, disability and other relevant personal circumstances when electronic monitoring is being imposed.  We do not want somebody effectively imprisoned in their own home with impacts on mental health, etc., particularly if the person is vulnerable, has addiction problems or whatever.</p><p>One of the key issues highlighted in these amendments is data protection.  I am sure the Minister will say that the data is protected and that there is nothing to worry about.  However, I am of the view that we need explicit safeguards in this Bill involving the data that will be collected through monitoring.  We know that data is big business.  We have to make specific provision for that in the Bill.  This data is essentially being collected and monitored without somebody's willing consent.  It leaves the door open for that information, and the entire activity of monitoring, to be profited from.</p><p>The goal of the amendments is that any monitoring of tagging should be done by the State or by a not-for-profit company.  Monitoring should not be something from which people might profit from.  I am trying to leave no gaps in that.  In Germany, there is a state agency that monitors this area.  That agency includes social workers and support staff.  That is the direction in which it is going.  If we are moving towards a system whereby we are using electronic monitoring a lot more, then the protections to which I refer should be put in place.</p><p>If the alarm on the monitor were to go off, it is not the case that the Garda would be called immediately.  A support staff member, a social worker, could be called to assist the person.  If we were to have such a system, it is much more likely that the conditions would not be breached and it would help the person concerned to avoid a custodial sentence and address his or her offending in the community in which he or she lives.  We do not want to have a scenario like the one in parts of England in which police officers are on patrol accompanied by a G4S security van.  The purpose of the amendments is to eliminate that use.  They would provide safeguards in the use of electronic monitoring.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for proposing the amendments, both of which relate to the electronic monitoring provisions contained in the Bail Act 1997.  As the T&aacute;naiste outlined to the House on a number of occasions, electronic monitoring has its limitations, but as the Deputy pointed out, it has the potential to be effective when applied in certain circumstances.  That is the basis for the amendment to section 4 of the Bill which provides that electronic monitoring can only be imposed on the application of the prosecutor in order that it can be limited to those cases in which it is most likely to be effective.  The Deputy's amendments, if I understand them correctly, also seek to ensure the use of electronic monitoring would be restricted to the most suitable cases.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 6 would insert two new subsections into section 6B of the Bail Act 1997 which deals with the electronic monitoring of certain persons admitted to bail.  The new subsection (1A) would set out conditions to which the court would have to have regard in imposing a condition requiring electronic monitoring, including that the type and modalities of the tagging be proportionate to the age, disability and personal circumstances of the person concerned and that he or she not be confined solely to the place of residence.  The new subsection (1B) would require data to be collected in compliance with the Data Protection Acts and the data not to be used for any other purpose.  The amendments appear to be unnecessary, given the safeguards already provided in the existing provisions of the Bail Act which requires a person subject to electronic monitoring to consent to it and that the provisions do not apply to under-18s and only apply in the case of serious offences.  It is not possible to restrict the movements of a person on bail to such an extent that he or she must remain in any specific place or residence at all times and the provisions are already subject, as the Deputy pointed out, to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 would amend section 6D - arrangements for electronic monitoring - of the Bail Act 1997 to restrict the provision of electronic monitoring services to non-commercial or not-for-profit providers.  This would prevent current arrangements used for electronic monitoring by the Irish Prison Service and restrict the possible options for providing for electronic monitoring.  I do not share the Deputy's concerns that a commercial operator could not appropriately and effectively provide the electronic monitoring service.  Such a provider would be bound to operate the service in accordance with the statutory provisions and the contractual obligations imposed by the State.  Limiting the provision to non-commercial operators would restrict the available operators and possibly lead to circumstances in which electronic monitoring services could not be implemented in some locations, or not at all.  It would also be likely to increase costs.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#J00300"><p>The words "electronic monitoring" sound very negative, but we have to consider how such a provision is imposed.  People are arrested and charged with serious offences.  They then look to be released on bail.  The likelihood is that they will not be granted bail and that they will be remanded in custody until such time as their trial is held.  That is an option to be avoided, but they have to consent to use of the provision.  The advantage of electronic monitoring is that they will not be remanded in custody and will be released, but conditions will be imposed, one of which will be that they will be monitored in order that their movements will be taken into account.  It is important in the first instance that people will have to consent to this.</p> <p>  I note what Deputy Clare Daly is seeking to do in amendment No. 6, but I would have thought courts took all of those factors into account.  It is proposed that the type and modalities of tagging be proportionate to the offences alleged in terms of their duration and intrusiveness, but electronic monitoring will only be used in the case of serious offences.  I would have thought every court took into account the age of an individual.  The important point is that this provision will only apply and continue until the trial takes place.  We should get criminal trials up and running within one year, but if the option was to remand someone in custody or to use electronic monitoring, it would be a way of ensuring people were not incarcerated at a time when they had not yet been convicted.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 7, I recognise Deputy Clare Daly's concern.  In other countries, particularly in America, the incarceration process has become a business and it is creeping into Britain.  The last thing we want is to have an expert private company responsible for monitoring and extending its control into prisons.  Currently, monitoring is carried out by private enterprises.  If we were to let the State run the system, how effective would it be?  It requires a degree of technical sophistication,  I would be concerned, if amendment No. 7 was to be accepted, that it would have the effect of preventing the current system of monitoring from operating.</p></speech>

We should ensure there is no doubt that they will take them into consideration by placing the provision on a statutory footing.  I imagine most courts do take into account issues such as the mental health, disability and age of an alleged offender, but I do not see any reason we cannot ensure they must take them into account by enshrining it in legislation.</p> <p>  I have some concerns about amendment No. 7.  We should be moving towards a position where the service will be provided by not-for-profit businesses, but if the amendment were to be accepted, it would create problems for the holders of contracts already in place for the electronic tagging of individuals.

I have regard for the courts and their ability to make the necessary safeguards in place work.  The issue can be approached from an ideological basis of not wanting to believe the courts will enforce someone's necessary rights and entitlements.  As things stand, many people say there is a lack of rights for victims and those affected by serious crime.  The provision is sufficiently restrictive.  It deals with serious crimes only and where someone applies for bail.  I have no problem with a commercial company providing a service for the State in a good and cost-effective way.  It is up to the State to regulate to ensure it is delivered in compliance with the laws of the land, including on data protection and so on.  That can be accommodated.  It would be wrong to prohibit a commercial company from providing a service for the State in a regulated and proper way on a value for money basis.  I will be opposing that amendment also.</p></speech>

That will enable it to be managed and controlled.  I do not believe it will be widely used; rather, it will only be used in the case of serious crimes.  As Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said, it is an alternative to incarceration.  I have seen the system in operation in other jurisdictions and it does require a high level of sophistication to monitor and track individuals.  We have to be careful that what is in place will continue and that what we will put in place will actually work properly.  We also have to trust the courts which will make the decision on the conditions of bail.</p><p>If the prosecution applies for it, the courts will have to decide whether it is suitable or not in the circumstances.  The judges know a lot more than anyone else because they have access to all the information and that is the basis on which they make their decisions.  We had better trust the courts to do their job.  In addition, the Deputy should bear in mind that the measure is restricted.  It does not apply to everybody.  It will be a condition of bail and only on application of the prosecution.</p></speech>

While one would assume the courts would take such considerations into account there is no guarantee and a legislative foundation for that would not be any harm.  Data protection is particularly important in this day and age and if provision is already made then why not seal the deal and leave no room for doubt by including it?  I take note of the views of members.  We can withdraw the amendment and consider tabling it again on Report Stage.</p> <p>  In terms of the private company, I question the privatisation of the criminal justice system.  I do not have a problem in principle with electronic monitoring.  The idea that it would be in operation as an alternative to a custodial sentence is economically efficient, it is efficient for society and it leaves the person in the community.  The issue is how we view that and what supports are available.  The German model is composed of civil servants, social workers and support staff and their response when the alarm goes off is to intervene with the person; it is not to haul them in or put a black mark against him or her.  The intention is to try to de-escalate the situation.  The various agencies decide whether to send out a social worker.  They operate on a 24-7 basis and each shift has a social worker to go out and intervene and it is up to them to decide when they intervene with a person whether the police should be contacted.  In fact, police contact only happens in approximately 5% of cases.  That has meant people have been less likely to breach their bail conditions and less likely to go on and receive a custodial sentence later because they are given an opportunity to address the issues.  The idea that one would have a company profiting from a vital public service is an ideological debate we could have in every arena but we will withdraw the amendment today and consider returning to it later.</p></speech>

In the context of reviewing bail the issue of bail supports is key.  All international studies vindicate that position.  If one supports people to comply with their conditions there are fewer breaches of conditions and it is better for everybody.  The amendment requires the Minister to review the bail supports within 12 months of the enactment of the Bill.  The amendment lists the types of bail support that could be provided.  The amendment also seeks that the Minister would make costed recommendations to Government regarding improvements in the provision of such supports in order to reduce both custodial remand orders and breaches of bail conditions.</p><p>The reason I included that is because it is as far as I can go as an Opposition Deputy in terms of making changes to bail supports that I believe are necessary.  I will not repeat them but studies from every jurisdiction indicate there is a huge cost saving if one puts the supports in place.  At the moment, the State is spending more than &euro;100,000 per day having people on remand in prisons.  The alternative is to have them out on bail and supported and it is far cheaper for society as a whole.  It allows the person to remain within the community, address his or her offending behaviour and enhances improvement.  If one supports somebody, the chances of him or her turning up in court are improved, which improves the efficiency of the courts.</p><p>The amendment provides for the Minister to carry out a review rather than leaving it to chance.  I could make many points about women offenders in particular and why we need the measures to be put in place.  I am not in government so I cannot secure the measures.  The best I can do is put a requirement in the legislation that the supports would be provided.  There have been incredible results from other jurisdictions.  Schemes in England and Wales found that where supports were provided, young people attended all court hearings in 94% of programmes and in Canada more than 81% of people who were on the programmes attended their court cases.  Bail breaches for women who got supports in Glasgow and other places were reduced.  We know that women in particular who end up in the criminal justice system are themselves generally the victims of crime such as sexual abuse and violence.  Getting the supports for those underlying issues is key in the women avoiding custodial sentences and being able to rebuild their lives and address their offending behaviour.  I believe such an approach is a winner in terms of cost.</p></speech>

The Deputy's amendment seeks to oblige the Minister for Justice and Equality to undertake a review of bail supports available and to make costed recommendations to Government with regard to improving the provision of such services.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that there are no specific bail support schemes for adults, such as those outlined in her amendment, currently operating in the State.  They do not exist.</p> <p>  Having listened to what Deputy Daly said, I believe she has made some interesting points.  Perhaps it is something the committee might consider reporting on at some stage.  That might be helpful.  I will consider bail supports with respect to restorative justice and penal reform but at the moment such measures do not exist for adults.</p> <p>  I am advised that there are arrangements in place to assist persons with particular needs who may come before the courts.  In that regard I am advised that psychiatric reports may be provided for the courts which can, in particular, aid the courts in diverting people with mental illness away from prison.  In certain cases, the court may adjourn to allow the person to access appropriate treatment and bail may be granted on that basis.</p> <p>  Bail support schemes are more commonly considered in relation to young offenders.  In that regard, I understand that a bail supervision scheme has been introduced and is being rolled out on a pilot basis in the Dublin area.  This initiative operates under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The intention is to roll it out nationally in time.</p> <p>  That said, there are no bail schemes for adults, such as those outlined, currently in place and the Government has no plans to introduce any new measures in this area but I am interested in what the Deputy said and it should be explored further.  In addition, it is not appropriate to provide in statute that the Minister should make any particular recommendations to Government.  For those reasons I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment but she has raised some interesting topics I feel we could explore further down the line.</p></speech>

The Act will be reviewed within 24 months and it would not be beyond the scope of the Minister to look at the provision of bail supports for adults as part of the review.  I know the supports do not currently exist but we will be looking at the Act as a whole, which concerns the provision of bail, and part of the review could include the possibility of the introduction of bail supports for adults.  The statutory review exists and must be carried out within two years.  Perhaps the Minister of State would confirm whether my understanding of the statutory review process is correct.  If it is, we could address the issue through that process.</p></speech>

That is there in any event.  In this instance, there are no bail supports available so we cannot report on something that does not exist.  Bearing in mind interesting points the Deputy raised, perhaps the committee might be interested in exploring the matter further and coming back to us with some proposals.  I will talk to the T&aacute;naiste about having a look at it as well but we cannot report on something that is not actually happening.  We cannot accept the amendments as they stand because there are no bail schemes for adults.</p></speech>

Obviously, one cannot review nothing.  That is a pretty serious indictment of our system.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that this is the key way to ensure that bail conditions are adhered to and it works particularly well with vulnerable groups.  We have the children and young people's part, which is key, but those with chaotic lifestyles or drug addictions find it difficult to comply with the conditions.  If they get the intervention early on, all of the evidence shows that court appearances and adherence skyrocket.  As a result, what is proposed is an attempt to build this in because the normal statutory review after 12 or 24 months would not provide for a review of bail supports or an examination of that area.  I will look at the next stage.  I note what has been said and I am glad that it is deemed worthy of further consideration but I would still like to see something in this.  We would not call it a review but it would be an examination of the types of supports or something like that.  Other than that, we are not looking comprehensively at bail.  I accept the point that "review" is the wrong word in the context of the lack of adult services and that we might look at rewording it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The reason they should be in writing relates to transparency.  It promotes public confidence in the system.  In some instances, it would give victims a greater understanding of why a judge reached a decision and would help to promote consistency in decision-making.  If we want to develop our data and understand better the current use of bail, this would help research in that regard.  I do not think it is unreasonable.</p></speech>

As she outlined, the purpose of amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is to require that the reasons given by a court for granting or refusing bail and for imposing any bail conditions under section 6 be in writing.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s reasons for wanting to include such a requirement.  She has outlined them.  The purpose of section 6 is to improve the information provided by the courts in bail hearings.  However, the effect would be to require that a written decision be given in respect of all bail hearings.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, most bail hearings take place in the District Court.  Written decisions are not the norm in the District Court and the volume of work involved in implementing the Deputy's proposal could be considerable.  It would have cost implications and, more importantly, could entail delays in the processing of cases before the court.  It is also worth noting that all District Court proceedings are recorded on the digital audio recording system so in circumstances where clarification of the reasons given is required or is in dispute, the record of proceedings will be there.  At the very minimum, consultation with the Courts Service of Ireland and the Judiciary would be required to identify any issues and to assess the cost and other implications before such a proposal could be included in the Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendments at this time.</p></speech>

A bail list appears approximately twice a week in the High Court.  Yesterday, the bail list in Cloverhill contained 22 applications.  If we just limit it to the High Court, that is dealt with on Mondays.  They are dealt with promptly and fairly and the judges have an understanding of what the law is, as do the practitioners.  If there was a requirement for a written judgment in respect of all of them, it would slow the process down considerably.  To deliver 22 written judgements in respect of the applications yesterday would mean that those applications could not be concluded or ruled on until such time as the written decision was given.  I understand the purpose behind amendment No. 9.  I think there is a recognition among criminal law practitioners as to what is the law in respect of the area of bail and the grounds upon which it will be granted.  There have been decisions in the High Court in respect of that.  However, if it is to be the case that there must be a written decision relating to every application, it will slow the entire process down and will probably be contrary to the interests of individuals applying for bail because at the time they apply for bail, they are in custody and it will take longer for them to be granted bail.</p></speech>

While recognising what Deputy Clare Daly is attempting to achieve, I think the process would be unrealistic.  It would be so cumbersome in nature that, effectively, it would be a case of justice forgone for many people because of the time delay in trying to implement a system that would probably be unworkable.  I can see the thinking behind it.  I just do not think it is a practical solution.</p></speech>

It would appear that the aim of the amendment is to ensure that separate reasons would have to be given for each condition rather than giving reasons for the imposition of conditions generally.  However, in the context in which it is used here, I am of the opinion that the meaning is the same and that the word "any" also takes account of circumstances in which no conditions beyond those that are mandatory are imposed.  I do not consider that the amendment would have any material effect on the provision and the wording used is that considered most appropriate by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am, however, happy to have my officials consult the Parliamentary Counsel on the alternate wording if the Deputy wishes and if she wants to revisit the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-05a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017040500002#L02400"><p>The arguments put forward by the Minister of State and the other Deputies are pretty compelling in terms of the practicalities in an overall sense and how this, as put forward, would be unworkable.  I accept that.  Having accepted that, there are issues in respect of the rights of the person involved - or even the victim - and his or her ability to access the thinking of the judge in that scenario and in the context of openness regarding getting the reasons behind a judgement in writing.  There is also an issue in respect of the lack of availability of digital recordings and people's difficulty in accessing information from the courts in that regard.  Perhaps that is a slightly separate issue.  The other issue that feeds into it is the lack of data relating to this matter.  We do not really have any research into the thinking behind it.  I note the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan.  People in the profession either know or have a fair idea of what is involved but there is no data in respect of the breaching of conditions and how often this occurs or with regard to research, accountability and monitoring what is happening.</p><p>Is there a gap?  What is and is not working?  It is partly in that vein that we put forward for inclusion the words "in writing", but I accept all of the points made about the practicalities.</p></speech>

The Schedule to the Bail Act 1997 sets out the list of offences which, if punishable by terms of imprisonment of five years or more, are considered to be serious offences for the purposes of a bail application.  The two offences which will be added to the Schedule by the amendment were both inserted into section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 by section 17 of the Road Traffic Act 2014.  They are effectively hit and run offences.  They target individuals who seek to avoid sanction by leaving the scene of a road accident having killed or injured an individual.  A person guilty of such an offence is liable under the Road Traffic Act to a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to seven years in the case of injury and ten years in the case of the death of a person.  These are very serious offences and, as such, appropriate for inclusion in the Schedule to the Bail Act.</p></speech>

This change is necessary as a consequence of including the new sections in the Bill to provide for the detention of intoxicated persons in Garda stations and technical amendments concerning the application of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 to other Acts.  The new sections will broaden the scope of the Bill beyond bail and, as such, it is no longer appropriate for it to be referred to as the Bail (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 16 amends the Long Title for the same reasons.
