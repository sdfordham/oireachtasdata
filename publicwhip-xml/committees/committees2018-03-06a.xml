    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Crowe" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am happy to be able to help it with the deliberations on this important subject, to answer any questions as well as I can and to follow up as necessary with any information that the committee might need subsequently.  I submitted three documents in advance to the committee, including the most recent state of the environment report of the EPA, the EPA's submission on Food Wise 2015, and a very recent report called the State of Knowledge on Climate Change Impacts for Ireland.  We might come back to them during the discussion.  I want to touch on a few key points from the submission.  The first is the overall policy direction.  I drew attention in the submission to two policies in particular, the longer term national policy objective for 2050 of an approach to carbon neutrality and the more immediate Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Looking at the two together, the overall policy direction is clear, that farming, land management and food production must happen in harmony with the environment.  The second point I wanted to make is that because of climate change, things have to change in agriculture, land management and food production, but these changes have to involve and have to work for farmers and rural communities, because they will have to implement these changes in the long run.  The third point I wanted to make relates to carbon neutrality, which is a key part of the policy plank for climate change up to 2050.  Currently, in Ireland, land is a net source of carbon dioxide.  Land can either be a sink or a source of carbon dioxide.  Forest land, for example, is a major sink.  It absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and traps it.</p><p>That is something we will have to reverse over time.  Our land should be a net sink, not a net source.  Again, it is something to which we may return.</p><p> The fourth point is that, from now on, when we do anything in this area with regard to agriculture we should try to get multiple benefits for whatever actions are taken.  It has to be good for the farmer, it must work for the bottom line and it must work for water quality, climate, nature and air.  Many actions can be undertaken at farm level that can satisfy those different benefits.</p><p> Fifth, there are many very positive things happening and I have listed them in my submission.  I draw the committee's attention to one in particular, which is the most recent one I could find and was in the national development plan that was published a couple of weeks ago.  It is town-scale pilots of food and agricultural waste to gas in agricultural catchments for local gas networks supply and biogas production, and the piloting of climate smart countryside projects to establish the feasibility of the home and farm becoming net exporters of electricity.  They are two potentially significant activities that could have a very positive impact for farmers, rural communities, towns and people living in single houses around the country.  There are up to 500,000 such houses in Ireland.</p><p> The sixth point relates to adaptation.  Mitigation means trying to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions into the atmosphere, but adaptation is equally important in Ireland.  We learned the lesson again last weekend with the snow and we had Storm Ophelia just before Christmas.  These events tell us that Ireland has many vulnerabilities to extreme weather events, and the climate change scientists, both international and national, tell us that we are likely to have more extreme weather events in the future.  The issue is getting ready and being prepared to deal with the consequences of climate change.</p><p> Finally, I reiterate the point about involving, engaging and collaborating with farmers and rural communities.  I cannot overemphasise the importance of this.  It is about seeking the common ground on the things we can all agree are good for the environment, the economy and for society.  There is plenty that can be done in this country which will work for the economy, society and environment, particularly in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Our coalition of overseas aid, environmental, youth and faith groups has been working together since 2007 for Ireland to do its fair share to tackle the causes and consequences of climate change.  The changing climate poses a threat to everybody in Ireland, to all parts of the country and society and to all sectors of the economy.  Agriculture is not exempt from these climate risks and threats.  In fact, agriculture is particularly dependent on a stable climate.  In recent years we have seen this in the damage done by flooding and the fodder crisis and, in recent days, by the damage done by the combination of Storm Emma and the "beast from the east".  All these extreme weather events are made more likely by global warming.  Our greenhouse gas emissions are loading the dice against ourselves and our future.</p> <p>  Just as it is not exempt from climate risks, the agricultural sector is not exempt from climate responsibility.  Both the EPA and the Climate Change Advisory Council have used the word "transformation" to describe the scale of the change we need in our society and economy to do our share to prevent runaway climate change.  Nobody is asking the agriculture sector to do more than its fair share, just its fair share.  In fact, the national policy position on climate action, adopted by the Government in 2014 and underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, accords special and differential treatment to the agriculture sector.  In line with EU policy and climate laws in other countries such as the UK and Finland, the national position stipulates an 80% reduction in emissions from electricity generation, buildings and transport, but only carbon neutrality in agriculture and land use.  That is, by 2050 our agriculture emissions must be offset each year by our enhanced sinks, grasslands, peat lands and tree cover.  That still requires a 2% reduction.  If we are to match the two it means coming from approximately 19 million tonnes of emissions now to approximately 9 million.  That will require a 2% reduction in agriculture emissions every year, at least, from now to 2050.  That compares with a 5% reduction across the rest of the economy, so there is a significant advantage for agriculture.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, neither the rhetoric nor the action of Ministers or industry stakeholders is in line with the national policy position.  In fact, agriculture emissions over the last couple of years have been rising by 2% per year rather than falling by 2%.  The Government notes that the national policy position states that Ireland will take an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  The Climate Change Advisory Council has asked the Government to clarify that because it is not clear what exactly is meant.  There are a couple of things we can say right now.  We either start taking measures to reduce the emissions now, or we do not and agriculture over-shoots.  We cannot define our way out of this challenge, and our approach to carbon neutrality cannot be not to do it.  If we fail to reduce agricultural emissions we must reduce emissions from other sectors by more than the 80% target we have already set.  There is no escaping the imperative to take action commensurate with the threat of climate change.</p> <p>  The other variable here is the capacity for sustainable food production.  This is something Stop Climate Chaos Coalition member organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and Christian Aid have considerable experience of, given that they work across the world with people struggling to achieve sustainable food production.  My colleague, Noreen Gumbo from Tr&oacute;caire, will address this is her statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noreen Gumbo" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#D00400"><p>I am the director of humanitarian programmes in Tr&oacute;caire.  I have worked in humanitarian and development aid for more than 25 years.  I have two messages today. The first is simple.  Climate change is already a crisis in most of the vulnerable countries in which we work.  It is impacting significantly on hunger and nutrition.  Without tackling the underlying causes of climate change hunger will increase in the coming decades.  Reducing global emissions, protecting people&rsquo;s livelihoods and investing in resilience are essential to protect food security in the context of this changing climate.</p> <p>  In Ireland we are increasingly aware of the impact of extreme weather.  Imagine if, instead of a forecast of a week of snow, we were facing an entire season of drought, following on from a previous season of drought.  This is what east Africa is currently undergoing.  Drought is an insidious crisis.  By the time a drought hits the headlines families have been doing everything they can for months, such as selling livestock or tools, which is their equivalent of bank savings, taking children out of school and migrating temporarily, thus splitting up families.  As the gap between droughts in east Africa decreases, families are unable to recover before the next one hits.  In countries Tr&oacute;caire worked in during the period 2015 to 2016, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan and Malawi, we have seen drought, food shortage and flash floods.  In Sierra Leone, Myanmar, Pakistan, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua we have seen heavy flooding and landslides.  Tr&oacute;caire and other agencies are providing humanitarian aid when needed, but it is not enough.  We are helping communities to adapt their agricultural practices, strengthen natural resource management and diversify their incomes to increase resilience, but without tackling the root causes of this people will run out of options.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second message, which is that hunger is caused by poverty, not by inadequate food supply.  The poverty is in the form of lack of access to economic resources to buy food or lack of resources such as land, water and tools to grow it.  The world currently produces enough food to feed the global population, yet the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that approximately 795 million people of the 7.3 billion in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2014 to 2016.  Almost all the hungry people lived in developing countries.  We find that the hunger affects children under five years old and the elderly most quickly and dramatically.  Eradicating hunger in areas of the developing world that experience it, and that are already experiencing increasing food insecurity as a result of climate change, requires a series of responses at various levels.  Key among these is the requirement to increase the resilience of food production to the impacts of climate change in these regions, to increase local incomes and access to food and to ensure people's livelihoods.</p><p>With this understanding, if we are concerned about food security in the context of a changing climate, we must be concerned, first and foremost, with ensuring all countries, including Ireland, will fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement to hold the rise in average temperature to well below 2&deg; Celsius - 1.5&deg; Celsius should be our aim - and the countries and communities experiencing increasing food insecurity as a result of climate impacts will be supported to adapt.  In his visit to Ireland in 2015 the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon said, "Ireland has been a champion of efforts to counter hunger, but today one cannot be a leader on hunger without also being a leader on climate change."</p></speech>

Irish agricultural emissions are rising by nearly 3% a year.  Dairy cow numbers are increasing by 6%.  The increase in emissions in 2016 was 2.7%.  Not only does this have a climate impact, it also has the effect of warming oceans, causing ocean acidification which affects marine life.  The United Nations environmental programme is telling us that the world needs to move to a more plant based diet.  It stated, "A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products".  At the same time, Ireland is embarking on a beef and dairy industry expansion which contradicts the national policy position on climate change.  It has been misleadingly justified on the basis that capacity for sustainable food production should be the approach rather than a business as usual model for expansion.  </p> <p>  A number of very problematic arguments are being used to justify the expansion of the beef and dairy industry.  The first is that Ireland is contributing to global food production in terms of beef and dairy exports.  What this is mainly doing is exporting a western beef and dairy diet which is not meeting the needs of the world's poorest and most hungry.  It is a middle class diet export.  There is an argument that if Ireland was not increasing production, somebody else would.  This highlights the reality of the need for global action.  There is an argument that Ireland produces beef and dairy more efficiently.  Efficiency measures that have been gained are marginal and being undermined by increased production.  A 2017 EU report stated Irish agriculture was the least climate efficient in Europe in terms of output.  There is also the argument that Ireland is accommodating a global market demand, but this demand has been created deliberately by trade deals and promotions.  The promotion of infant formula is controversial and problematic and icontrary to the World Health Organization's advice on promoting breast-feeding.  </p> <p>  Arguments have been made that Irish emissions can somehow be offset against grassland management, forestry and bio-energy, but the technical reports available show that the capacity is very limited.  There are arguments that what Ireland is doing in grassland management and beef and dairy agriculture is best suited to the Irish climate, but there is inadequate research on the alternatives.  It should be a general principle that we reach a genuinely sustainable food production matrix to enhance food security and biodiversity, reduce climate impact and support the promotion of a more plant-based diet.  There is a major opportunity to do this in the current CAP reform negotiations.  In Ireland, this should mean that we move towards the production of nutritionally diverse plant-based food crops that are climate resilient, compatible with soil conditions in the environment and sustain employment and rural communities.</p></speech>

We hope to offer some solutions to the crisis agriculture is facing in dealing with its contribution to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.  We do this, in particular, with a focus on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post-2020.  </p> <p>  The future CAP programming period is being examined, with a view to reforming the policy to address pressures and issues surrounding agriculture, food and rural areas in Europe.  With the European Commission presenting its vision for a future CAP in its communication in November, the next step is for the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers to present its joint statement.  Part of this process has seen the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine launch a consultation exercise to develop an Irish position on the future of the CAP.  We welcome this with open arms.  We are absolutely delighted that the Minister is taking this approach because we need to come up with a model for Ireland that will make us the star in Europe in agriculture and in the case of the CAP.</p> <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy has played a major role in the development of a socially, environmentally and climate-destructive model of farming across the European Union.  The reform of the CAP in 2013 was meant to ensure measures to secure the sustainable management of natural resources would receive public money, with funds being ring-fenced for climate protection measureas.  Unfortunately, attempts at real reform were thwarted by vested interests in lobbying member state governments and MEPs for a business as usual approach, leading to the intensification of European agriculture through CAP supports.  It is to be hoped such a short-sighted approach will not be the conclusion of the current reform process.  It is clear that a failure to address important and urgent issues in the European Union covered by bhe CAP may cause long-term and irreparable damage to the agrifood sector and rural areas in Europe as a whole.  In its November communication the European Commission indicated that it was prioritising environmentally sustainable activities and basing rewards on them, which we welcome strongly.  We will be keen to work with agricultural interests to ensure climate measures are adequately financed, in other words, we are totally behind public money being used for public good.  Another innovative element of the Commission's communication was a focus on results-based actions.  We strongly support an approach that is focused on delivering results rather than the more abstract indicators used to monitor or evaluate implementation of the CAP.  </p> <p>  A third emphasis by the Commission suggests giving increased powers to individual member states when deciding on how to spend CAP funds.  There is concern in some member states that this may create a race to the bottom in terms of ambitions for the policy.  An ambitious CAP programme in Ireland that seeks evidence-based measures to deliver results represents a timely opportunity for Ireland to realign its food production system.  Furthermore, with a likely reduced CAP budget for the next programming period, a member state that can demonstrate that the content of its CAP programme is ambitious, that seeks to build on a strong foundation of evidence, best practice and inclusive stakeholder engagement and that has social and environmental sustainability as core objectives is likely to be seen favourably during budgetary negotiations.  CAP payments need to be targeted at recipients who are directly implementing actions to address EU priorities as defined by the objectives of the CAP.  It is likely that this will require a substantial shift from the current distribution of payments under the CAP and recommended that this shift occur in a defined and transparent way during the course of the next programming period to maintain stability within the sector and allow existing CAP beneficiaries to realign their activities with the market or the mechanisms a new CAP would support.  Part of this will involve simplification of the payments' process.  Rather than farmers having to go through a multitude of contracts and agreements - we all know what they are - they should have a single contract encompassing both pillar 1 and pillar 2 to deliver on varying obligations under the CAP.  Such an approach would see not only improved simplification for participating farmers as they would only need to go through one set of paperwork, it would also improve the integration of actions and undertakings between each of the elements operated as separate schemes.  Such a co-ordinated approach could better address environmental requirements such as linking pillar 1 greening with agri-environment or non-productive investments.  It would also link production activities supported by the basic payment scheme with non-productive activities, appropriate greening or agri-environment measures or similar.  </p> <p>  In summary, in order to build a forward-looking agriculture sector that will make a significant contribution to the European Union&rsquo;s climate mitigation efforts, it is essential to have a solid knowledge base, knowledge-sharing and an inclusive dialogue between all stakeholders, farmers, NGOs, scientists, decision-makers, etc.  This should include a national and EU evidence-based set of data for the farming sector&rsquo;s potential to achieve climate mitigation, including its socioeconomic impacts.  It should also include a policy analysis assessing the extent to which this potential is being achieved and the role farming policy such as a reformed CAP plays and should play in it in the future.</p></speech>

Dr. Connolly is much more expert in fisheries matters, on which I am sure there will be questions.  I will summarise briefly our statement and submission.  </p> <p>  The committee will not be surprised that as the representative of a marine agency, I will be speaking more from the perspective of the part of Ireland - 90% - that is under water.</p><p>Oceans make up 70% of the planet's surface.  It should be no surprise that Ireland's weather and climate experience is dominated by the Atlantic Ocean.  Our written submission sought to highlight the very significant socioeconomic impacts associated with climate change from a maritime perspective, not only with fisheries and aquaculture but also with land-based industry and agriculture.  There are trends we can see very clearly.  The waters around Ireland are continuing to warm.  We are seeing increased winter precipitation, decreased summer precipitation, more storm surge events, increased sea level rise and extreme wave heights.  One only has to think about Storm Ophelia in the south east of Ireland where a record wave height of over 17 m was recorded.  It was so strong that it took the measuring device away with it.  Acidification is a considerable worry.  The oceans absorb 25% of all man-made carbon.  They absorb 90% of the heat produced.  </p><p> There are trends in fisheries.  Cod and haddock stocks are declining.  We also see increasing stocks of hake and monkfish, which are even more valuable.  Aquaculture faces the risks of acidification and what it can do to oyster and mussel productivity.  We are also seeing new and increasing occurrences of harmful algal blooms, which can have disruptive impacts on market access, production and increased food safety risks.  The severity of storm surges is not limited to the coast.  It can have impacts on drinking water and essential national infrastructure in cities.  </p><p> While the threats are numerous, there are several opportunities.  We have the potential to harvest sustainably and grow new species that are better suited to these changing ocean conditions.  Undoubtedly, more effort in the scale of ocean research and sustained monitoring will be required in order to equip Ireland with suitable advice to manage and mitigate risks associated with climate change.  When we look at Ireland's integrated marine plan, a very ambitious target for 2020 was set to double the socioeconomic value to &euro;6.4 billion from a base of &euro;3.2 billion in 2012.  By 2016, Ireland was achieving a &euro;5.7 billion economic return from the maritime sector.  There is a lot for Ireland to get right in the future.  To do that right and to manage the interaction with climate change and the ocean will require an enhanced, integrated national effort.  Robust advice and enhanced projections are essential to deal with the changing oceans and climate.  Ireland has a very substantial solid performance base and infrastructure to build on.  We have world-class facilities in oceanographic, environmental and fishery science research, world-class research vessels and ocean observation systems, a data buoy network and a tide gauge network right around the country that is a very solid base for expansion of the scientific endeavour.  The endeavour will be taken on in collaboration with many State actors, Departments and agencies.  </p><p> Climate change and oceans are inextricably linked.  A healthy ocean has an existential impact on life on earth; it is our planetary life support system.  The oceans are the heartbeat of the planet.  Half the oxygen one breathes comes from microscopic plants in the ocean and 97% of the planet's water is in the ocean; it is the planetary reservoir.  One can understand why the major focus of the Marine Institute's next national research plan and our next strategy will put a very serious emphasis on the role of climate and oceans and the interplay between both.  We will be very happy to take questions from the committee.   </p></speech>

We are acutely aware there is a two-way relationship between agriculture and climate change.  The nature of our climate impacts upon our ability to produce goods.  As the climate changes and variations arise in it, the agriculture sector will have to adapt.  When I first started out in 1974 there were almost 300,000 farmers across Ireland.  There was low-intensity and low-productivity farming and they were mostly family farms.  That is the model that many people now advocate as a sustainable model but it would not survive.  How do the witnesses see us achieving the targets set out in the various agriculture reports such as Food Harvest 2020?  How do they fit in?  Do the witnesses see us trying to achieve those targets to maintain the maximum number of farm families in rural Ireland?  This is about rural Ireland.  It is very important.  Many people come in and make presentations and forget they are dealing with real people who are trying to eke out a living on the ground.  People in rural Ireland are deeply concerned about climate change.  It has been evident in the past week.  We still have to try to live there.  Very often, the agricultural community wants to ensure it maintains its production levels but wants to do so in a climatically sustainable way.  It has made significant changes.</p> <p>  There will be a consultation on CAP.  Do the witnesses have any idea how CAP should be distributed?  Are they suggesting we move away from a basic payments system to an alternative system that rewards people in a more proportionate way for reducing climate change impacts?  Climate conditions in Ireland are generally favourable to grass growth.  Many of our products are based on grass, which is the comparative advantage we have.  Our beef and dairy sectors are highly focused on it.  Is it not very difficult to tell Irish farmers that they should drop the only place where they have a comparative advantage in terms of production capacity and ability?  Notwithstanding what the witnesses said, the products from nine out of ten animals we produce are exported.  We are self-sufficient.  We have to sell nine out of every ten animals.  That is important.  </p> <p>  There have been fairly intense contributions made by the witnesses and they were well summarised.  They said another country will not fill that gap but of course one will.  We are talking about the world population increasing by about 1 billion over ten or 15 years, and eventually being 10 billion.  Where will the food come from to feed those people?  Has anybody given any thought to that in the context of this issue?  I am all in favour of many of those things.  I have been very supportive of various things such as heat production, oilseed rape and bioethanol production and all of those things that would be very useful as cash crops down on the farm.  I was very supportive of them.  When the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine tried to introduce them, they fell flat on their face.  They went south.  Not alone did they go south but many of the farmers almost went south with them as well.  We are trying to replace fossil fuels.  I note Deputy Eamon Ryan is present.  He has been very consistent in advocating the displacement of fossil fuels.  He has been a strong advocate of rotation crops.  Could any of those methods, including anaerobic digestion and various things, significantly contribute to climate change success down on the farm?</p><p>I hope such methods are affordable but some are significantly expensive.  I recall that farmers were encouraged to grow miscanthus in the midlands but it was a disaster and it took years to extricate farmers from the resultant difficulties.  I applaud the submissions that have been circulated.  I hope my Marine Institute colleagues will forgive me for not being an expert on the fishing industry.  The cattle, sheep and dairying sectors are more important in the midlands and the witnesses present have made presentations on those sectors.  Outside the farming sector, people believe that farmers are doing their best to offset emissions.</p><p> I am surprised none of the witnesses have commented on the following point.  Like my parliamentary colleagues here, I have firmly called on Coillte to produce more afforestation.  Coillte is no longer a major player as the vast bulk of afforestation is carried out by about 18,000 farmers.  The carbon sink has been mentioned and the actions taken by farmers have made a huge contribution.  The work done by farmers has not been factored into the equation.</p><p> In terms of carbon emissions, the original target was 39% but now Ireland must reduce its carbon emissions by 30% by 2030, a fact referred to by Mr. Coghlan.  I acknowledge Mr. Coghlan had a view on that but can the witnesses identify specific actions that could be taken at a broad agricultural level, ether at the basic producer level or the processing level, that will help us to achieve the 30% target by 2030?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I apologise for missing the first presentation by the EPA but I managed to watch the other presentations on screen.</p> <p>  Climate change is a recurrent issue for this committee.  A number of us travelled to Brussels before Christmas.  The clear message that we got from MEPs, Commissioner Hogan and everywhere we went was that the new CAP scheme would place greater environmental requirements on farmers in terms of water quality, biodiversity and climate change.  Any responsible person would have to say that to grow an industry, with all that we now know and the witnesses are keenly aware of the fallout, things must be done in a sustainable fashion.  One will go nowhere if one does not do so and one is just pillaging the earth. </p> <p>  We must to our best to rescue the situation and put ourselves on the right trajectory.  While we obviously must take account of scientific findings and take on board what we are told, in many ways, we must fine-tune how we bring people along.  Everybody has a part to play but I refer to what happens sometimes when climate change is being discussed.  Everybody seems to get excited about the Paris climate accord and agreement but when it comes to individual choices people cannot see that they can make a difference.  Sometimes, where they can make a difference, they choose not to do so.  The Government must create policies that will encourage people to change their lifestyles.  In terms of energy usage, all of our business and lifestyles have emanated from the fact that we discovered oil.  Many technologies have stemmed from that discovery and it could be argued that if we had diversified at an earlier stage we would be in a different position and would have avoided a number of wars as well.  </p> <p>  One attitude that sometimes comes across, and I mean no disrespect, is that one is urged to stop doing this and that and it seems like we must pull back.  The reality for us, as politicians who deal with people, is that people expect certain lifestyles now in the agriculture sector or in terms of the type of car one has or how power is used in the home.  Anything where we tell people to stop and switch off is often viewed as a backward step.  Of course the message has been conveyed that people can save money by conserving energy but I am impressed more by new solutions.  A very simple solution has been the advent of light emitting diodes, LEDs, and lighting and electricity has become a lot more efficient, cheaper etc.  Solutions that prove meaningful to people must involve all of the technology.  It not good enough just to tell people that Armageddon is coming because people just throw up their hands and decide to carry on as normal and, unfortunately, that is the message that people are given.  </p> <p>  Energy is a major part of agriculture too.  I hail from a part of the country that has a lot of natural renewable energy resources such as wind and wave energy.  The wind energy sector on land has been developed more.  I have often thought that when we were developing projects, there were no experts around to identify where projections should be developed.  Instead, politicians attended public meetings where we encountered people who objected to such development.  It is all very well to say, at a high level, that we should achieve this.  I have heard calls to crush the farming way of life but that is unrealistic.  Instead, people switch off and do not participate in an innovative fashion.  Some people have even called for farmers not to keep livestock any more.  Such people are negative towards the many positive things that farmers do or are involved in and have been contradicted in terms of the dairy sector.  Ireland has the most carbon efficient dairy production sector in Europe and Ireland is fifth in beef production.  Every aspect of farmers' lives are affected by climate change.  Environmental requirements must be satisfied before farmers can draw down payments and farmers are heavily penalised if they do not comply with the rules stipulated by Europe.  All of that must be acknowledged in terms of farming.</p> <p>  I note that Deputy Penrose has left the meeting.  Mr. Lumley mentioned fodder shortages.  Ireland, as a country, has natural advantages when rearing bovine animals.  Therefore, is it realistic to expect Irish farmers to grow more plant-based food crops?  My understanding is it is easier to grow protein crops in the tropics, for example, than here.  I imagine that attempts to grow some of those crops here would not be successful.  Is that not a reality, from the climate point of view, in respect of how we live and in terms of what our diets require?</p> <p>  As for how targets will be achieved, an awful lot of targets have been discussed at a higher level.  The Irish Government is regularly bashed for not meeting its targets.  I believe this country should be sustainable in its approach to all things and it is a good economic move as well.  Recently there have been media announcements about hybrid vehicles and manufacturing in China and India.  Ireland has to meet many targets such as Food Wise 2025.  The food sector is a major employer in rural Ireland and is a considerable part of the Irish economy.  How do the witnesses reconcile that fact with having a transition blueprint and who pays for all of this while bearing in mind the current realities we are facing?  </p> <p>  My next question is on the local authorities.</p><p>It seems that we need to bring things down to a more local level.  Do the witnesses envisage more of a role for local authorities in that regard?  I appreciate that they have environmental sections and work with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and so on but can they have more of a role in trying to achieve some of our targets, whether through education or otherwise?  What might that involve or is it feasible?</p><p> As regards the marine, Dr. Heffernan referred to the &euro;6.4 billion growth target in terms of Ireland's ocean economy.  Mr. Lumley discussed the expansion of the beef and dairy industry and set out that our targets in that regard are not sustainable.  As regards targets in terms of the marine, does Dr. Heffernan think that harnessing our ocean wealth is being future-proofed in terms of climate change?  If so, how is that progressing?  Could some of what is being implemented or encouraged by the Marine Institute be brought to bear on agriculture?  What advice would Dr. Heffernan offer on the dilemma with which we are faced in that regard?</p></speech>

The fact that this is the third or fourth of these meetings demonstrates that the committee very much understands that climate change and how we deal with it must be a key part of agriculture in the future.  The farming community is very much at one on that objective.</p> <p>  Dr. Crowe spoke first and one of his opening comments was that there must be change but that such change must also work for farmers.  We must proceed according to that ethos and principle.  We must also recognise that there is a tremendous tradition of agriculture and agricultural produce in this country.  In terms of traceability and standards, we have an exceptional agricultural product and that is why we are so successful in terms of exports, production and reputation.  That will increasingly have to be put alongside sustainability and will increasingly be demanded by the markets to the same extent that our environment requires us to produce in a carbon-friendly manner.</p> <p>  I would be interested in the perspective of witnesses in respect of Food Wise 2025, which sets very ambitious but achievable targets in regard to agricultural production, and whether they believe we should continue to achieve those objectives or push to do so.  Although we are becoming more efficient, the expansion of production contributes to our overall footprint.  I think we should follow the targets set out in Food Wise 2025 but I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' perspectives in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of climate, this country is very suited to food production, in particular grass-based food production, which puts us in a situation whereby we have a very good story to tell.  The evidence indicates that we can also produce at a competitive advantage from a sustainability point of view compared to other countries in the global market.</p> <p>  Some other European Union countries face challenges similar to those pertaining in Ireland.  They do not have as high a percentage of their overall emissions based in agriculture as does Ireland but they are trying to address climate change.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on how other EU countries are tackling this issue and whether there are any lessons for us in that regard.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly held a module on this issue, although it did not give it a massive amount of time.  One of its recommendations was for the imposition of a carbon tax.  I do not believe that is the way to go but I would be interested in the views of the witnesses in that regard.</p> <p>  As regards the marine, Dr. Heffernan indicated our cod and haddock stocks are reducing.  According to the research, how much of that is attributable to climate change as opposed to fishing levels?  In view of the fact that under the Common Fisheries Policy catches by fleets from EU countries are being managed and stocks seem to be responding to that, how much of an impact on stocks does Dr. Heffernan believe the temperature increase is having?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#H00300"><p>A startling set of statistics that was presented to the committee and which is available in the public domain in recent times tells its own story.  According to the statistics, 42% of farms in the west of Ireland have closed in the past 20 years, the vast majority of which were small family farms.  At European Union level, the European Court of Auditors found that 1,000 farms are lost every day across the EU.  I had to recheck that to ensure it was correct.  The European Court of Auditors also found that one third of farmers under the age of 44 have left farming in the past ten years in Ireland.  That goes against all the stated policies of bringing younger people into farming and making it more productive.  Under EU and Government policy over many years, we have moved to a more intensive and market-led form of farming that has driven huge numbers of small farming families off the land.  It is estimated that 75% of many farmers' incomes comes from direct single farm payments at European level.  Those single farm payments heavily favour large operators in the manner of their distribution.  The policy framework at European and Government level has served to push us towards the intensification of farming and has driven smaller farmers off the land.  We must have honesty on these issues.  I would like to hear the views of all the witnesses on how that relates to the topic under discussion today.</p> <p>  A valid point made by one of the farming organisations is that the European Commission is currently negotiating the Mercosur trade agreement yet other branches of the European Commission are rightly pointing to the high contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gasses in Ireland.  Agriculture contributes more than 30% of the total, which undoubtedly is very serious.  On the one hand we are being told we must address that and will be fined if we do not and on the other, the Mercosur agreement is being negotiated, which will bring in huge amounts of beef and other products that do not have anywhere near the same environmental standards as such products from Ireland from countries that are destroying their forestry and rainforest left, right and centre.  That dichotomy must be addressed and I would like to hear the witnesses' views in that regard.  These are loaded questions and the witnesses can probably sense my views on the matters but I would like to hear their views.</p> <p>  Another point made by farming organisations that appeared before the committee is that Ireland has had an historically low level of industry and the contribution of agriculture to the overall level of greenhouse gasses here is, therefore, higher than one would find in other European Union countries.  That is a fair point.  They also argue that greenhouse gas emissions should be measured not alone where food is produced but also where it is consumed.  If there is market-led demand for high-quality grass-fed Irish beef, responsibility for the greenhouse gas emissions accruing from the production of the beef should be shared by the consumers and producers.  That is a reasonable point and I ask the witnesses for their views in that regard.</p> <p>  I seek the views of the witnesses on the forthcoming Common Agricultural Policy framework.  Some have already addressed that issue.</p><p>What are the witnesses' views on the current payment levels?  There is an argument payments should be capped at &euro;60,000 to ensure they are spread more evenly and we can reverse the statistic of 42% of family farms being lost in the west and so on.  With the current European Union framework, do witnesses see contradictions in terms of the messaging of the trade negotiations versus greenhouse gas demands?  How can we collectively address those issues at Irish and European level?</p></speech>

Does that include any of the processors such as the creameries or meat producers?  Are they categorised as agricultural or industrial?</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency referred to Origin Green, Bord Bia's sustainability programme.  I see it more as a marketing tool.  How effective is it as a monitor of the sustainability of production, particularly in the case of food manufacturers?  It involves on-farm sustainability audits for the farmers who have to deal with controls.  For food businesses, however, it is a plan.  What is the difference? Is there any enforcement in this project?</p> <p>  Everybody said our model of farming is wrong and is not sustainable.  I did not hear of any alternatives, however.  Will the witnesses give more specific details about alternative agricultural production?  What does one do to keep people living in rural areas if we move from this unsustainable form of production?</p> <p>  What is the Marine Institute&rsquo;s view on the sustainability of land use as that does have a direct impact on marine use?  I do not believe the marine sector is contributing to climate change but it is reacting to it because of what has happened on the land.  What changes will be introduced?  What new fish will fisherman have to go after because of climate change?</p></speech>

For example, say grain farmers here moved over to afforestation, became carbon sinks rather than carbon sources and we balanced the books to become carbon neutral.  Last week with the snow, our fondness of bread was a national joke.  We also have thriving brewing and distilling industries.  We will need grain to sustain those industries.  What if the grain comes from Russia by rail, road and boat?  Could that carbon footprint be greater than the sequestration from new forestry?  If each country balances its books, then the world problem is solved.  If we stop producing beef, however, the English must source theirs from South America.  If one considers the size of the carbon footprint of beef from South America, would it not be better to leave us to produce it as efficiently as we possibly can?</p> <p>  There is a big movement to change and, apparently, veganism will solve the whole problem.  However, take the difference between having a steak dinner and an avocado salad.  The avocado probably has a far greater carbon footprint than the steak.  This is not just an Irish problem.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; proposals in this regard?</p></speech>

My views are well known on this.  While I agree the climate changes, I do not concur with many people's views as to how it changes.  Back over the ages and through the centuries, there has been climate change when we did not have as many cows, highly intensive farming or mechanical engines or vehicles.  The climate always changes.  I am reliably told that, if this country were to become completely emission-free, the difference it would make in the worldwide context is only 0.13%.  The rest of the world would make up 99.87%.  Our farmers and our business people are targeted in an unfair fashion in the overall context of some people's views on climate change and global warming.</p> <p>  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Land Commission threatened farmers that if they did not till one acre of their farm, they would lose it and it would be divided among their neighbours.  That happened and people had to go to England to survive.  One farm beside me was taken off the owners in such circumstances.  Then along came the Agricultural Training Council, ACOT.  Farmers were the best custodians of the land and knew how to manage their land.  Every farmer knew the grass yield of his farm.  One farm might be known as the grass of seven cows while another farm might have the grass of 16 cows.  ACOT advised farmers to intensify.  Instead of where they might have one cow to three acres, ACOT turned it around the other way to have two or three cows to one acre.</p><p>That is what farmers did.  They were given grants to do that and to improve marginal land.  As well as getting the grants, farmers had to spend a lot of their own money and work very hard to try to bring the land around.  That was as a result of the advice the received from officials of the Department - fellows with collars and ties.  The farmers and the business community are paying for the likes of us inside here.  Farmers, the self-employed and private companies are paying for public services and for the public administration of the country.</p><p> Farmers went along with that.  Then, lo and behold, in the mid-1980s, fellows with good land were told they had to set so much of it aside and there was a satellite or a camera up in the sky looking down on them if they did not do that.  This is the way farmers have been advised and, we will say, controlled because they are told to do these things.  This country is already paying &euro;480 million in carbon tax.  Where is the carbon tax going?  I believe it is going into social services because I do not see it doing anything to help the model that the climate change body or the global warming crowd are talking about.</p><p> In the Project Ireland 2040: National Development Plan document, it is stated that &euro;22 billion is going to be directed towards dealing with climate change.  Where is that money going to come from?  Only from the poor fellow out in the morning milking his cows or the other fellow on the road with a lorry trying to transport food products or whatever.  They are going to pay.  We are already paying &euro;500 million a year.  They are going to double that to &euro;1 billion a year for the next 22 years.  That is where they are getting the &euro;22 billion.  I am very sure of it.</p><p> The people working will have to pay for that because there are no Mother Teresas.  Mother Teresa died and there are no leprechauns.  The money will have to be extracted out of the working people, the farmers and the business people.  It is there the money is going to come from and nowhere else.  We cannot get money to put a few extra beds in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee.  There is going to be no massive injection of money.  I cannot see it.  We have no gold.  We have no mines.  I cannot see it coming from anywhere else so it is going to come out of the pockets of the poor working people.  I think all this is fine if we could afford it.  However we cannot afford this.  It is a game.  Look back to 2007.  Everyone was told they had to buy diesel cars.  Now we are being told-----</p></speech>

Are they going to be broken further?  Farmers are in a bad enough position as matters stand with Brexit looming.  We do not know if it will be a hard border , a soft border or what kind of border, but one thing is sure, it will not be as good as they had it.  There is a decline in farming.  It has been mentioned by others.  There will be a greater decline.  The farming community made up the backbone of the country and kept it going back over the ages and the centuries.  When they give up, the country will give up.  That is my belief.</p> <p>  We are talking about ways to help.  Planting of forestry is restricted if it is to be covered by grants.  There has to be 80% green ground and 20% other rough ground.  Down our way, it is always the other way; we have only 10% or 20% of green ground and the rest of it is rough ground.  All of that type of ground has been used since 1950 to grow the grandest of trees.  My father started work in forestry in 1950 and there have been two crops out of it since.  It was pure rough ground way up the mountain.  All that has stopped since either 2011 or 2012.  That would one way of utilising the land because it is hardly fit for anything else.</p> <p>  The other thing I am very hurt about is the notion in the Project Ireland 2040 document that we will not be able to burn any turf or peat after 2030.   That is unfair to people cutting a bit of turf for their own fires.  We have notions from some Deputies that it would be better to leave the turf in the bog.  I can tell them that there would be a lot of people in Gneeveguilla, Kilcummin, Scartaglen, Killorglin, Kilgarvan and all the way to Cahersiveen that would be fairly cold inside in their houses if they could not cut a bit of turf.  This is what is going on.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  The Chair is part of the Government.  He is doing his very best but I can tell him and his party that if this is rammed down the rural people's throats on top of everything else they are taking, he will get an answer again some day.</p></speech>

That is what we are liable for.  They are choked and using face masks in Japan as they go about their work.  They cannot breath there.  We have the cleanest air.  Go to Valentia Island, to the top of Mangerton Mountain or to anywhere else in between.  We have the cleanest air.  What are we at?  What are we trying to do to the people?  They do not understand.  It does not make sense.  Our emissions are 0.13%.  Let the rest of them tune up first or make an attempt to do so.  However, they are making no attempt.  We have Trump in America and someone else in China and Japan.  We are told that we have to have certain types of diesel engines.  We were told that in 2007.  Where are all the grand diesel engines we had at that time?  They are in Third World countries, they are in Africa and they are in India.  They are working fine and still going.  The new engines here only last two or three years.  It is not working out.  If a modern engine in a lorry breaks down, any operator knows it cannot be reconstructed.  It has to be thrown away and a new one bought.  That is the story now where once it was possible to remodel and do a job on the other engines.  That cannot be done now.</p> <p>  It is all costing money.  Everyone is operating on a margin.  It is so tight now for a fellow to keep going.  We are going to make it harder.  That is what Project Ireland 2040 is trying to do, and we are hurting so many people along the way.  People are told about electric cars.  There is nowhere to plug them in to charge their engines.  People will also have to be told that there can be no pools of water on the road if they are driving electric cars.  If they are obliged to drive through the pools of water I have been trying to go through over the last fortnight, they will soon find out how far their electric cars will keep going.  They will not keep going like the diesel or the petrol vehicles.  One splash of water and they are finished.  They will be walking then.  I think many people want people in rural Ireland to do now.  I refer to finishing up walking or cycling at the very best.  That is what they are trying to do to us.  Instead of trying to go forward-----</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  I read most of the submissions earlier.  I have a couple of brief points because I know most of the questions have already been asked.</p><p>One thing that strikes me is that farming in Ireland has become more intensive.  The intensification of farming has brought us down a particular route and has certainly made food cheaper for the consumer.  However, a lot of that farming is based on inputs, many of which are imported from various parts of the world.  That is linked to some of the other issues we have.  We have often had people from the tillage sector before the committee telling us how they are struggling to survive and how tillage in Ireland has practically been wiped out.  They cannot compete with the cheap products that are coming in from abroad.  That is having a very negative effect on our greenhouse gas emissions, yet tillage is a very good carbon sink.</p><p> As I was leaving, Dr. Matthew Crowe was talking about forestry.  I live in Leitrim and forestry is a big issue there.  We have huge tracts of almost 100% Sitka spruce forest, which grow and then are cut down completely to grow again and be cut down completely again.  There is an issue around all of that.  We need to find a better model of afforestation, which creates continuous cover so there is continuous segregation of carbon.  It is very much a profit-driven enterprise rather than being something that is there for the farmer to try and make some money from.  There is a big resistance to it in the farming community for many sensible reasons.</p><p> I am sure slurry and slurry storage have come up.  Our answers to the problems we had in the past around the Water Framework Directive focused mainly on sewage and what was happening with our towns' sewage systems, one-off housing and all of that.  We avoided the issue of agricultural slurry by giving farmers very good grants to store the slurry.  Slurry can only be stored for so long, however, and then it has to go out on the land.  The climate has changed and part of what we have been dealing with in the past years are increasingly wet summers running into the harvest.  It ends up that the land is often saturated and cannot take the slurry.  Something we do not have in Ireland that is used in many countries is biodigestion.  What can we do in that regard and how is it moving forward?</p><p> On renewable energy, should we be looking at supporting farmers to erect solar panels and other systems in order to negate the carbon that is being produced by farming?  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left but he mentioned a couple of things of which we also need to be cognisant.  Big multinational and global corporations produce the vast majority of the problems we have, yet the emphasis is put on the little guy when it comes to solving them.  That needs to be borne in mind.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae also said that everything is going towards modernisation, which increasingly means becoming a throw-away society.  He had a point there, out of all that he said.  We need to look at that.  We know it in our own households.  If I buy a washing machine and it breaks down after five years, the guy who comes to look at it will say, "Ah, we cannot fix them anymore.  You will have to throw it out and buy a new one."  That is part of the logic that has come in.</p><p> I thank the witnesses and apologise that I was not here earlier.</p></speech>

Senator Mulherin asked about targets for the integrated marine plan for Ireland and the relative future-proofing of those.  Deputy Pringle asked about the balance of the ocean.  The ocean is the sink for 25% of the carbon produced on the planet.  The balance is very much absorption, with the oceans negating for the land and people on land.  In general, the two things that are crucial to the state of the ocean with regard to climate are the gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, and the sinking of carbon and delivery of oxygen for us all.</p> <p>  All water on the planet returns to the ocean.  That is the reservoir.  There is a Chinese proverb that says all water is on a journey back to the sea.  Water quality in all its facets is very important to the health of the ocean system and all of its ecosystem.  I refer to the enhanced focus on the Water Framework Directive and its marine counterpart, the marine strategy framework directive.  They touch on every aspect of dealing with water, all emissions, all water arriving into the ocean and the quality of water waste treatment.  They are very important factors for the ocean in receiving the water back and society needs to bear them in mind.</p> <p>  On the question about moving forward in the achievement of the &euro;6.4 billion target, while it is tangential to the committee's focus on agriculture and the marine, one of Ireland's greatest assets that is very much part of our future is the fact that we have the largest combined renewable energy asset given to any nation on this planet, between the combination of offshore wind, tidal and wave.  I have often heard it described as Ireland's oil for a future world.  It is not only carbon neutral but it would have enormous potential for substitution of what are primarily carbon sources of energy in the modern economy.  Wind is the closest to market.  Tidal is next, and the next in sequence is wave.  Ireland has an integrated investment portfolio of infrastructure between the Science Foundation Ireland centre of excellence in University College Cork with world-class wave tanks, the one-quarter scale wave energy test site in Galway Bay that has a scientific observation cable, and then plans for a full-scale device centre off Belmullet.  That is one of the greatest economic opportunities for Ireland in the short, medium and long term.  It would have a very significant contribution to energy balances.</p> <p>  There were questions about the relationship of the ocean to a number of sectors.  The ocean is central to a fast-growing area of Irish tourism and activity-based leisure.  This is working off the brand of the Wild Atlantic Way, literally from the south to the north of the country.  The ability to provide more detailed information on ocean conditions on app-based deliveries offers potential to increase tourism revenue.  Activity-based tourism is a very low-carbon footprint type of tourism.</p> <p>  Another very valuable asset is wild salmon from an angling perspective.  A facility in Newport, County Mayo is one of the global indicators sites for how well salmon are doing and what populations are returning.  It is a species at its southern limit in natural distribution so it is really important that the data in respect of a long-term trend of over 50 years are available to help mitigate and plan for the future.  </p> <p>  Another emerging area of the ocean economy is the use of marine based molecules and materials from the deep ocean for functional foods and for providing significant added value to food production.  They are also used in pharma and medtech, and in emerging and new sensor technologies to develop nature-inspired design materials that go on sensors.  While it is the smallest element of the overall mix of the ocean economy, it is the fastest growing component, with new and emerging sectors measured from 2010 onwards.  That augurs well for the future and will help, to a large extent, in carbon-proofing the growth areas.</p> <p>  In marine fisheries, the scale of effort is going in the direction of increasing efficiency, while the quantum of natural resources that is going to be available will not see an expansion or an explosion in the activity of fishing.  The whole effort is towards extracting greater value and ensuring sustainability.  My colleague, Dr. Connolly can talk about emerging opportunities.</p><p>Finally, while I would not be competent to talk on the more detailed aspects of land use and agri-practices, there are others present who would be.</p><p> I can give two examples of how understanding the ocean can benefit us in dealing with the challenge of climate change, as well as other challenges.  As the Atlantic Ocean dominates our weather experience and our climate, the earlier we get a depth of understanding of what that is delivering to us, the greater the benefit for Ireland.  I am talking in the medium term of being able to predict conditions in the next season and the years such as the general growth conditions that are likely coupled with the weather forecasting.  As we go into a period of more and more precision in agriculture and aquaculture and satellite-linked practices, it is not unreasonable to think that we will be able to forecast and predict that for a season ahead.  Certainly that would give us an enormous ability to plan, mitigate and reduce.</p><p> In addition, recent research points to the potential - I stress that it is the potential - of significant methane reduction by the integration of marine plant materials, seaweeds into the diet of cattle and other bovines.  That is a potential and other experts who will appear before the committee may be able to address it in detail.</p><p> Chairman, I have dealt with the questions from Deputy Pringle and Senator Mulherin and my colleague Dr. Connolly will answer the fisheries questions. </p></speech>

The first question is about changing fish stocks and the opportunities for the industry.  The science view is that species such as cod, haddock, plaice, pollock and saithe will start moving north as the water warms up.  We have no doubt that in the next ten to 20 years, there will be increases in sea temperature that will cause these stocks to move north to get to the colder waters.  What will take their place?  We will have species that are more southerly distributed, such as boarfish, hake, monkfish and brill, that will move north and take their place.  There is also another opportunity here in that the market value of the new species that will move into the waters, such as hake and monkfish, are much more valuable than species such as haddock and cod.  There may be an opportunity there, but the extent of the movement north, when it will take place and its variations around Ireland and Europe are extremely uncertain but we definitely think that there will be a displacement of the stocks that the Irish fishing industry will be targeting in ten to 15 years.</p> <p>  Mackerel stocks are really important to Ireland Inc. and we are already seeing a shift in the distribution of where they spawn.  The west coast is a really important spawning ground for species such as mackerel, horse mackerel and blue whiting.  Every year off Scotland and Ireland, more than 7 million tonnes of these fish spawn there.  With the shift in temperature, we are beginning to see slow movement north of these spawning areas and that will affect the fishing industry and the time of the year that boats can go out to exploit the mackerel and get it at the times that it is of the highest economic value.  There is major uncertainty around that but we know that there will be significant changes coming.   </p> <p>  My last point reflects on a comment by Senator Mulherin on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I will draw on my experience in the Common Fisheries Policy reforms in 2013.  The Senator made the point that it is really important to bring people with one.  It is really important to bring the farming industry with one in terms of change, just like we brought the fishing industry with us in times of fundamental change around the way the science is done around the stocks and the concept of maximum sustainable yield.  We showed the industry that they would have to take short-term pain but the long-term benefits would far outweigh it.  We are beginning to see five years later that there are much improved stocks around the Irish coast.  We still have work to do, but we brought the industry with us by explaining the concepts and I think it will be really important to do the same in respect of the CAP reform.  </p></speech>

I referred to the fact that we contend there is no basis for this argument.  What is clear, and I think there was common ground in terms of the impact of climate change arising from agriculture in Ireland and in the countries in which we work is that we cannot get away from the fact that emissions are impacting on the recurrence of drought in places such as eastern Africa and the Sahel.  The issue is not around supply but around access.  We know that Ireland's exports are going to the more affluent societies and are not filling that hunger gap.  The role we need to play is supporting, with the same empathy that we have for Irish farmers, smallholder farmers in east Africa and the Sahel to ensure they have a viable livelihood in the places that are being impacted most at this time.  This can be done through research, technology or some of the roads we have travelled.  I think support for those smallholder farmers is the way to go, rather than arguing that we can increase Irish agriculture with a view to filling that gap.</p></speech>

I was asked whether the level of emissions from processors and creameries fall within the agricultural or the industrial sectors.  As far as I understand and others may correct me on this, they are not classified as agricultural emission, as agricultural emissions are the land-based emissions only.  The other ones would be in the industrial sector or potentially in the power generation sector in the EPA inventories.  They are separate from what we talk about when we talk about agricultural emission, which are the methane and other gases related to agricultural production itself.<br/><br/>On Ireland's overall place and level of responsibility in the global emissions setting, Ireland is not being asked to do more than its fair share; every country has to do its proportionate share in reducing emissions over time.  Europe has been relatively understanding, in the context of the European allocation of emissions, that Ireland was a developing country 20 years ago when this started and Ireland was asked to do less than other countries.  We are not being asked to do more than anybody else.  When I started my present job with Friends of the Earth a little more than ten years ago, I came from the overseas aid sector and at the time we were very proud of the fact that per person, we were the sixth most generous country in the world in terms of overseas aid.  We had a very good track record on aid but I discovered then that we were the sixth most polluting country among the rich countries in terms of climate pollution.  When I looked at that, it was a clear contradiction in how we interact with and show solidarity with poor communities in the global south.  Since then the recession has reduced both our emissions <i>per capita </i>and our aid <i>per capita</i>but we are still the eighth most polluting country in the rich world per person.  This includes our agricultural emissions, as well as everything else.  It is worth saying that agricultural emissions are about the same as they were in 1990 but transport emissions have more than doubled in that time.  This is not about one sector.  All sectors will have to pull their weight.  We are now 12th per person in terms of overseas aid.  Our pollution has remained relatively high per person and it behoves us to reduce that over time between now and 2050 to do our fair share.<br/><br/>On the issue of food, and Ms Gumbo has covered most of it, but a member raised a question on the intensification of production and imports as well.</p><p>Ireland imports more calories than it exports.  For all the talk and reality of our food production, by the nature of our consumption patterns and our production patterns, Ireland is importing calories for 1.4 million people more than we export.  Ireland is not a net contributor to global calories, never mind global food security, just by the reality of the current global food production system.</p><p> Questions were asked about Ireland's grass-based agriculture, the place of beef and dairy, whether we are just saying "Stop" and if there are other ways of looking at the issue of climate regimes that apply.  Friends of the Earth for the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition are definitely not saying that beef and dairy production should stop now or overnight, or even in the immediate or foreseeable future.  We are saying that to begin with we cannot bet the future of rural communities in Ireland on ever increasing beef and dairy production, given the carbon constraints that we all face around the world, the climate challenge and the fact that it is probably not practical for everyone in the world to have the dietary patterns we now have if we are to stay within the global carbon budget over the coming years.</p><p> Deputy McConalogue and Senator Mulherin spoke about the grass-based system inside the European Union being to Ireland's natural advantage and how could we possibly not use it.  Senator Mac Lochlainn asked about consumption versus production and which is the best for responsibility.  We have an EU trading system, for example, for electricity emissions, cement and so on.  For the current round of EU negotiations, if we had come up with and proposed - it was on table - a European emissions trading system for agriculture within an overall limit of agricultural emissions, and if Ireland competed for ours to be the most efficient and to get the biggest share of that market, that would have been fine because it would not be creating new loopholes.  It would have created a level playing field inside a limited budget.  This is how Ireland treats things at a national level - we treat agriculture separately - but at EU level, Ireland has said to put them all together.  Ireland basically ended up looking for loopholes for the agriculture sector to try to define our way out of the challenge.  This is not practical.</p><p> On a global level and the issue of consumption versus production, it would be fairer if Ireland was accountable at international level for its emissions for things Ireland consumes rather than for things Ireland produces.  In that case, all those beef and dairy exports would be the responsibility of India, China or the United States of America and not our responsibility.  Ultimately, however, Ireland would be responsible for the emissions in the production of all the cars, washing machines and televisions we import from China and Japan.  It is interesting that a good few years ago the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, funded research that showed on a production basis if all countries produced like Ireland, three planets would be needed to absorb the pollution.  The pollution calculation for consumption ends up much the same.  Ireland's consumption is about the same as three planets' worth of pollution, so neither is sustainable.  It would, however, change the relative responsibilities within Ireland and this would have been worth looking at.  That horse has bolted because that is a decision at UN international level.  Farming representatives may have said that at this committee, and we have backed them in saying it, but it is not what Ireland tried to do in the UN negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement.  Ireland looked for exemptions for agricultural production rather than a new way of dealing with those emissions.</p><p> The carbon tax issue was raised a couple of times.  I believe that carbon tax has a role to play but it is not a silver bullet.  People respond more to smaller-scale incentives, be it the plastic bag tax, a congestion charge, a grant for a solar panel or a price for electricity from a solar panel.  "Tangible" is the wrong word - it is more easy to get one's head around these incentives than the abstraction of a carbon tax.  I believe a carbon tax has a role to play in the rest of the economy and in the agriculture sector because it changes the incentive structures for us.  It makes polluting activities more expensive and it makes retrofitting a house, or moving in to forestry or other less polluting activities more environmentally attractive.  On its own, however, a carbon tax will not do the trick.</p><p> Reference was made to whose pockets the carbon tax is coming from and into whose pockets it is going.  It is often forgotten that when the tax was introduced in the budget in December 2010, VAT was reduced in the same budget.  For a while those measures cancelled each other out.  Essentially, one indirect and technically and socially regressive tax was reduced in the form of VAT and another tax was increased.  At the time, not much was made of the fact that they were revenue neutral.  The other way of doing it is to have it going in to the general Exchequer, or use it to pay Ireland's fines for overshooting our emissions, which is not ideal.  Another idea on the table on this budget is that the carbon tax goes up significantly and the Citizens' Assembly said two things of interest in this regard.  They said that they would be willing to pay higher carbon taxes themselves for more polluting activities, and they said that agriculture should not be exempt and should face similar pricing incentives.  Raising the carbon tax is very much on the agenda for the coming budget, with a potential decrease in income tax at the same time to offset labour costs versus pollution costs, or it could be given back in a payment to people.  people could pay carbon tax and then get it back in a tax dividend system.  This is a social transfer to marginalised communities because those people who have a lower income spend less, so they would gain money from a carbon tax.  Those persons who drive bigger cars and have a more expensive lifestyle would pay more in to the system.  We could have a socially progressive tax if it was given back in a dividend to citizens.</p><p> Turning to the issue of opportunities in rural Ireland and especially energy opportunities, Mr. Joseph Curtain of the Institute of International and European Affairs is the lead author of a climate-smart agriculture report in which he brought together many stakeholders.  In his address to the Citizens' Assembly, Mr. Curtain said: "Ambitious climate action can happen in such a way that benefits rural communities and in a manner that drives regionally dispersed economic development."  Much of this is because of the opportunities around renewable energy, through both developer-led projects and community-led projects.  I agree with Senator Mulherin that developer-led projects were not necessarily always done that well.  Ireland did not have a system in place to guarantee a share of ownership, and not just a community benefit in the form of payment to the local sports club.  The new government scheme provides for community shared ownership of developer-led projects, but it specifically provides for 20% of new renewable energy to be community-led projects where they have majority ownership.  We are, however, disappointed that there was no provision for a price or payment for really small-scale micro level solar generators, particularly on the rooftops of farms, businesses and houses in the State and in rural Ireland.  Our organisation and the Irish Farmers' Association are at one on this issue and we have both pushed for a scheme that would allow people to be paid for the electricity that they feed in to the grid.  There is talk of a pilot scheme around grants, but grants are inefficient: they can be captured by the contractors who install the solar panels.  It would be better to have a price support that would allow rural communities and others to benefit.  I would like to see every school, in the State install solar panels on their roofs and be paid for electricity they generate.</p><p> There are real opportunities for rural Ireland in this regard and I hope this will be the focus when considering where Ireland goes now: how do we diversify agricultural income and other income streams to have vibrant and diverse economy in rural and urban Ireland, which is what we all want.  I hope we can work together on that.  I must bring my son to GAA training now so I must leave.</p></speech>

If we are to have effective climate action at global level, it will have to be integrated with targets that meet the Paris Agreement, and trade agreements must reflect that.  This was a major issue at the Bonn climate summit last November.  In his speech President Macron raised a very important signal that if there was a conflict between meeting global climate targets and countries that were able, through trade agreements, to export products that undermined the climate targets then there would have to be a reconciliation of that conflict with carbon taxation or some other mechanism or agreement.  We have to start thinking of accounting for pricing and disincentivising higher carbon impact actions, in energy as much as in food, and incentivising decarbonisation.</p><p>This opportunity can now be realised at European level through the negotiations taking place on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  European agricultural policy resulted in the removal of milk quotas under the previous CAP round.  This has caused problems with respect to climate action and emissions.  In Ireland and across Europe, major issues include continuing biodiversity loss and water quality.  The Netherlands is facing major legal pressures on nitrates and water quality, potentially resulting in significant destocking, some of which has already occurred.  The negotiations on CAP present an opportunity to make climate action a centrepiece of future European agricultural policy and subsidy support, with a switch to supporting more plant-based and locally-based food, enhancing biodiversity and water quality, controlling nitrates and addressing problems with ammonia emissions. </p><p> In Ireland, substantial resources have been devoted to researching and promoting grassland agriculture to the exclusion of other sectors.  A redirection of targeted, area-based pilot schemes is required towards better quality tillage, plant-based food and potential energy crops.  There are lessons to be learned from what happened when miscanthus was incentivised without a proper support system for the crop being put in place.  My colleague, Mr. Ewing, will discuss the potential for high-value nature farming which could result in a significant rebooting of the CAP figures to favour those parts of the country that have lower support for farm incomes. </p><p> We must also take a realistic approach to the concept of offsetting, which has limited potential for forestry and bioenergy.  We must ensure that support mechanisms in forestry and bioenergy are compatible with the concerns of local communities.  The concerns raised by Deputy Martin Kenny regarding County Leitrim, for example, are widely recognised as a consequence of the current system of subsidies. </p><p> Major issues arise with regard to Origin Green, a branding and labelling system that could cause serious reputational damage to Ireland when reconciled with the reality of our rising climate emissions and the difficulties we will experience meeting nitrates and water quality targets as a result of increasing stocking levels.  The problem applies not only to the bovine sector, but also in horticulture, including the extraction of peat for horticultural use.</p><p> On marine issues, there is serious unpredictability in respect of the impact of warming oceans and ocean acidification on the marine ocean feeding chain.  We should not take comfort from projections showing that warming oceans will result in species migrating from our waters to the north as waters warm and species from further south migrating in our direction.  Species change and migration may not be reconciled with the maintenance of marine feeding systems.</p><p> There are also serious worries that new forms of exploitation of the marine ecosystem for marine protein could further cut into and endanger the stability of the marine ecosystem.  These include the pursuit of deeper fish such as boarfish and blue whiting, as has been proposed in Deputy Pringle's constituency.  Marine life, including marine organisms and marine fish species, sequester carbon.  We need to be careful, therefore, about the ecological and carbon balance within the marine ecosystem if we are to maintain its stability. </p><p> The potential for offseting methane in bovine agriculture through the use of marine protein is still very much at the research stage.  If this idea were to proceed further, the environmental impact of the scale of potential extraction of marine protein that might arise would need to be quantified as the issue has not yet been addressed.  There is also serious ecological conflict and capacity issues with Irish aquaculture in our coastal waters, including with regard to the sustainability of finfish farming given the ecological footprint of the marine feeding of farmed fish relative to output. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Ewing" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#O00200"><p>Many questions were raised and I tried to track most of them.  I will try to answer those that have not been addressed.  I live in a farming community in north County Roscommon and I come from a family that has been farming for many generations.  Most of the people who live around me have at least two jobs, with some having three or four jobs.  The reason is that their farms are not economic in the system that has been imposed on them.  They were encouraged to get into debt in the past to intensify beef production, stock cattle and so on.  The types of things they are encouraged to do in terms of slatted sheds and slurry spread and so forth did not fit then, do not fit now and will not fit in future because of the intensification of rain incidence in the west and so on.</p> <p>  What do we do about this?  Farms west of the Shannon are generally extensive.  In terms of farming land, these farms cover approximately half the country, yet farmers in the region receive the least income from the CAP.  These farmers should be encouraged to protect our nature value land in terms of biodiversity, climate and protecting soils.  We have declining soil quality and quantities in this country and these factors, which are not being tracked, will impact greatly on us in the future.  We need to encourage these people to be the carers for the land and this involves financial encouragement.</p> <p>  As many speakers noted, there is a movement away from the land.  Senator Mac Lochlainn provided some startling statistics on the movement of young and older people away from the land and farm abandonment.  These are serious problems which will worsen if we do not do something about them and look after those who are looking after the land. </p> <p>  Where do we go with this?  We need to examine the Common Agricultural Policy as this is one mechanism where we can find the finances to support people who are looking after farms and preserving biodiversity.  Why are average farm incomes in Ireland &euro;15,000 when they are &euro;30,000 in Germany?  Why are farmers east of the Shannon receiving much larger incomes from farming per acre than farmers west of the Shannon?  The reason is the focus in Ireland on intensive farming.  In Germany, the focus is on factory farming.  Those are the background scenarios, if one likes. </p> <p>  We need the polluter to pay for the pollution he or she creates.  The polluter pays principle is enshrined in European law in any case.  It means people must pay for pollution they create on their farms or through the use of cars and so on.  This needs to be borne in mind when we visualise the issue.</p> <p>  Change is always difficult.  Coming from a farming background, I know people are traditional and stuck in their ways.  However, the tried and trusted mechanisms they have used throughout their lives will not work in future for a variety of reasons, including climate change. </p> <p>  I ask the Chairman to excuse me for a rambling a little.  I am trying to find the right responses to the questions asked.</p><p> In terms of protein production, it is inaccurate to state protein cannot be produced in this country by any means other than ruminants of one sort or another.  It is perfectly possible to grow field beans and other forms of beans, which are high protein sources, in this country and to do it quite productively.  There are other ways of going about it, and these are plant proteins.  I know we do not do it in this country, but in intensive agriculture it takes 20 pounds of vegetable protein to produce one pound of beef.  Does this make any sense in terms of a starving planet?  It does not.  I want to make sure I have covered everything that has been asked.</p></speech>

Food Wise 2025 is a pathway to serious problems for the future.  I do not think it is possible.  We can achieve it, but it will cost us big time both financially and environmentally.  It will have a cost for the water quality in Ireland and for biodiversity.  We have had a decline in farmland birds of between 70% and 90% over the past 30 years.  This is enormous.  There are reasons for this, and many of them relate to the way in which we farm now compared to how we farmed before.  People spoke about the size of farms and stated that people were living hand to mouth to a degree in farming, and I totally accept this, but we should allow for the fact that an aspect of farming is about our culture, our rural environment and our rural communities.  I live in a small rural community, and these issues are very important to individual people and communities.  We need to recognise this and provide for these people to continue to be on their farms and to live in vibrant communities.  Leitrim is probably the extreme case.  Pension funds are coming in and buying up land to grow forestry and basically closing down farms and communities.  This is not a good thing for the future.</p> <p>  I do not know whether committee members can see the little badge I am wearing.  It represents the sustainable development goals, of which there are 17.  We should be thinking in holistic terms with regard to agriculture.  It is not isolated.  It is part of a bigger picture of our society.  We should be thinking in these terms and in terms of the 17 goals and how we can achieve them all together as one thing.  Dr. Crowe spoke about at the very beginning about the conversations we need to have.  These are realistic conversations between farmers who are part of our community and environmentalists who are part of our community.  It is about every aspect of our community speaking together about bringing all of these goals into the one picture and not people just picking off little bits and stating they want to make money as farmers.  Farmers deserve to make money.  They are custodians of 75% to 80% of our land surface and they should be supported in what they do, but they should also realise that what they do is important to everybody else also.  This is not just with regard to food production but protection of our natural wealth.</p> <p>  I will come back very briefly, if I may, to an aspect of the marine sector, which is shell fisheries.  This is very unregulated in this country and the way in which licensing and shell fisheries are conducted is a very serious issue for us.  They will impact on climate change in due course, perhaps not at the moment but they will in terms of a number of factors.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny spoke about the issue of consumption and production, and I totally agree with every word he said in terms of the throwaway society we have created.  This is a major part of the problem in terms of climate change.  We produce far more than we actually need and we produce it in a way that will not last.  All of these aspects of our economic system contribute to the issues we now face in terms of climate change.  I could go on and on about this but I think the Deputy understands and his point was well made.</p></speech>

Deputy Mulherin asked about the role of local authorities in dealing with climate change.  They have a major role to play.  New regional climate offices are being established in Dublin, Mayo, Cork and Kildare.  This was announced before Christmas, in tandem with the publication of the national adaptation framework.  Not surprisingly, these climate offices will probably focus more on adaptation than mitigation.  The local authorities know a lot about adaptation, flood management and dealing with the risks that climate change is bringing upon us.  They will have a very big role, and I imagine that as the climate dialogue evolves local government will get more and more involved.  It is interesting to see the word "climate" beginning to appear more in the administrative language of local government, even in terms of some of the directors of service now having climate as part of their brief.  This would not have been the case ten years ago.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked two specific questions, one on the accounting.  As was advised earlier, the agricultural figures are mainly for methane and nitrous oxide, which are from the animals and the fertiliser.  The processing plants are accounted for elsewhere in the statistics.  A broader climate point on this is that bar the agriculture bit that deals with methane and nitrous oxide everything else is carbon dioxide.  This is the driving force in terms of climate change from all of the other sectors, whereas with agriculture it is different as it is predominantly methane from the animals and nitrous oxide mostly from fertiliser use.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about Origin Green.  I take a slightly different perspective on it than has been said.  There is no doubt it is a marketing tool.  Many companies and farmers are involved in it and it includes farm sustainability audits and sustainability plans for food businesses.  Anything like this is a good thing because it helps to drive behaviour change, particularly with small companies involved in the food sector.  I live in Wexford, and I can see it with some of the local butchers who are branding themselves as being green.  They are doing things and they want to make a difference.  They are not just doing it for marketing purposes.  Little things like this can really help in terms of encouraging businesses to think a little differently about their behaviour and move it along in the right direction.</p> <p>  Many members asked about the global issue.  On page 11 of the submission there is some text on the international context.  It includes a reference to the two special reports the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, decided it would have done after the big meeting in Paris.  One of these is on climate change and land.  The point is that it is a global issue.  It does not just affect Ireland.  The IPCC acknowledged at that time that more research and work had to be done to look at the whole question of global food production from a climate perspective.  This work is happening at present, and the report will be completed in late 2019.  This will be a very important report in terms of informing what happens next in how the world deals with the food issue.  No doubt it will have some ramifications for Ireland also.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about Food Wise 2025 and learnings from other countries.  Again, I take a slightly different perspective on Food Wise.  The Deputy specifically asked whether it should continue and I would say that the answer is that it should, but there are serious environmental constraints in relation to it.  Food Wise acknowledges the fact that food production and expansion in Ireland cannot happen at the expense of the environment.</p><p>What is important now is how it happens and how the environmental issues are factored in.  Food Wise 2025 is about much more than the beef and dairy industry.  It covers areas as diverse as brewing and aquaculture.  Pretty much all of the food-producing businesses in the country are in some way connected to Food Wise 2025 but the bit that gets the most attention is the part concerning animal numbers.  When Food Harvest 2020 was developed, and subsequently in designing Food Wise 2025, a big part of the plan was that with the end of quotas, dairy would start to expand.  At time it was expected that the overall number of animals would not go up.  It was anticipated that if the number of dairy cattle went up, the number of beef cattle would go down.  However, that is not what has happened.  The number of beef cattle is holding up.  That is where the environmental constraints issue will become more important.</p><p> It does not just concern climate change.  It also concerns water in the case of the nitrates directive and the national emissions ceiling directive, which includes a ceiling on the amount of ammonia that the country can produce.  Pretty much all of that is produced by agriculture.  It is a complicated picture, but overall, as a food producing nation, it is far better for us to have a plan like Food Wise 2025, which acknowledges the environmental constraints, than to go without one.  This plan can involve the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and other authorities watching it, reporting on it, assessing, monitoring and carrying out research.</p><p> There is a huge amount we can learn from other countries.  In particular, I will mention the initiatives I referred to at the very start, which were included in the national development plan.  The first of these is the town-scale pilot projects converting food and agricultural waste in agricultural catchments to biogas to supply local networks.  I refer here to anaerobic digestion.  Other countries have managed to do much more with anaerobic digestion than Ireland.  Wexford, to refer to my home county, is now being networked for gas.  A question linked to the future-proofing of a town like Wexford is where gas is going to come from in 40 years.  It is in an agricultural catchment and there is plenty of agricultural and food waste produced there.  That could be used to produce gas of a suitable quality to supply the town network.  The farmers would then get a much more stable fertiliser product at the end of the day.  It is good to see that thinking of this kind is in the national development plan. </p><p> The second initiative which was mentioned was the idea that houses and farms could be their own power plants through the use of renewable technologies like solar power and heat pumps.  The technology is getting to the point where it is possible for houses and farms to produce enough electricity for themselves and to sell some excess electricity into the grid.  That will require a lot of change.  The grid will probably need to change for that to happen.  However, piloting climate-smart countryside projects is in the national development plan.  This type of thing has happened in other countries.  Ireland can learn from what has happened elsewhere to speed up the implementation of these projects. </p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the regional issue.  There are some interesting maps of the country on pages 12 and 13 of the EPA submission.  They show that certain environmental issues, particularly water and nature, vary from one part of the country to another.  The maps on page 12 deal with water quality.  One can see that most of the water quality problems are in the east of the country, that is, the north east, the east and the south east.  There are more people living in those areas and more intensive agriculture.  The second map shows the most pristine waters remaining in Ireland.  Most of them are in the west, where there are fewer people and less intensive agriculture.</p><p> On page 13 there is a map of what is called high nature value farming.  That map shows the parts of the country that are more suitable for high nature value farming.  Again, they are mainly in the west, north west and south west of the country.  When it comes to reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and designing the next version of it, the EPA would like to see more ways of incentivising the best type of farming for a given location.  Again, this must be done in a manner which works for farmers.  If it does not work for the farmer, it will not work.  There are some really good examples of such projects.  The Burren Life Programme is a high nature value farming project that works really well for the farmers in the Burren, in a way that was not happening 15 or 20 years ago.</p><p>  Deputy Kenny had some questions on the forestry issue.  If Ireland is to move towards carbon neutrality, which is the stated aim of Ireland's policy position for climate change for 2050, we have to figure out ways in which more trees can be grown in the country.  I think the target in the national forestry strategy is to reach 18% of land cover.  That figure is about 11% at the moment.  This raises the question of who plants the trees.  The planting is mostly done by farmers.  If there are barriers which prevent that from happening, they need to discussed in collaboration with the people who are actually doing the work.  Ways to remove these barriers must be figured out.  I imagine that will be part of the discussion as the CAP starts to evolve. </p><p> Slurry storage was also mentioned.  A potential solution to help with that is anaerobic digestion.  This is the same thing I spoke about earlier when I raised the possibility of projects at scale for gas production.  Such projects will not totally solve the problem, but would be an alternative to simply storing slurry on farms. </p></speech>

Clearly local government has a very important role in adaptation.  It is also important in mitigation.  It comes back to the question of how we get people talk and engage together.  As members are aware, for the last three years we have had a new model of local engagement with communities called the poly-participation networks.  They now beginning to develop a vision for the well-being of their communities for this and future generations.  We are running a series of pilots to enable communities to work together to come up with these visions for well-being.  Thankfully, these pilots are funded by the EPA.  This covers all aspects of their lives, including food production, health, education, etc.  Everything about their community is involved.  It is a visioning exercise, designed to develop ideas and policy at a local level for action.  There is potential for these questions to be examined at very local level.</p></speech>

They will have received our submission.  </p> <p>  Dairy Industry Ireland represents the primary and secondary dairy manufacturers, including the specialised nutrition sector.  I am director and with me is our head of regulatory affairs, Dr. Miriam Ryan.  Our current CEO is Mr. Jim Woulfe of Dairygold.  We have four team members to represent the entire industrial dairy manufacturing base in Ireland.</p> <p>  The dairy processing industry is a key component of the economy on the island, providing much needed employment spread across rural areas into every parish.  The industry processes across 30 sites over 7.5 billion litres of milk which is supplied by 18,000 family farms, many of which are the owners of primary businesses.  The industry has an all-island presence.  Since the abolition of quotas, we have been driving to be a global leader in the development of a high value, environmentally sustainable dairy industry based on an extensive grass based dairy system.  Dairy companies have invested hundreds of millions of euro in recent years to prepare for this opportunity which resulted in us achieving almost &euro;5 billion worth of exports of dairy products, ingredients and nutritionals in 2017.  These exports have found their way to over 155 markets worldwide, with international markets beyond the European Union becoming increasingly important.  In 2018 these international markets are projected to take over 50% of Irish dairy exports for the first time.  Ireland remains in a strong position, with the primary dairies continuing to be 100% Irish owned entities, while the quality of our produce is reflected in the fact that three of the world's major specialised nutrition companies have chosen to base key secondary processing sites in Ireland.</p> <p>  Having gone through that introduction, I will move quickly to discuss what we have come to deal with in terms of an action based approach to sustainability and climate change.  To put the seriousness of climate change for the industry into context, I note that the environment and sustainability are the first and second agenda items when our CEOs meet as a board.  To put it in further context, Brexit is the third item.  Dairy Industry Ireland has long been working with Bord Bia at processor level to drive the completion of the sustainable dairy quality assurance scheme, SDAS.  Its members have supported this process wholeheartedly and funded the audit process on behalf of their farmer members.  This has been very arduous but worthwhile and as of now the finish line is in sight for phase 1, with nearly all 18,00 dairy farmers included.  The industry recognises that resting on its laurels is not enough, as Mr. Matt Crowe of the EPA has pointed out, and that more must be done to support the SDAS in driving best practice at dairy farm level.  In that vein, the dairy industry established Dairy Sustainability Ireland in 2016 to provide industry leadership on the issue of sustainable dairy practices that would help the climate change agenda in a positive manner.</p> <p>  Dairy Sustainability Ireland is a proactive, industry-led, whole-of-sector and whole-of-government partnership which is working to develop and implement new approaches to dairy farm sustainability at both economic and environmental levels.  A Dairy Sustainability Ireland board has been established containing all 14 members of Ireland's dairy processing industry, including the specialised nutrition companies.  They were joined by all of the main dairy associated farm organisations, including the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme.  I acknowledge that the ICSA is not represented here but we focused on the dairy sector.  These groups were then augmented by the key agencies of the State, including the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on foot of its responsibility for water services, the Environmental Protection Agency, Bord Bia, Teagasc, the representatives of which will make their own presentation, and the local authorities.  The board meets quarterly, with the most recent meeting having taken place in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 1 February.  The next meeting will take place in the Customs House on 2 May.  Specific task forces are constantly meeting to develop and implement the strategy agreed to by the board at company and farm level.  There is an organogram in the material circulated to the committee for the information of members.</p> <p>  What we seek to engender from the Government through the industry down to farms is a rationale for positive climate change measures.  It is clear that the discourse on climate change and sustainability has caused a disconnect between stakeholders, as we have seen today in some of the exchanges.  Negative messaging and forced environmental and climate change actions have increasingly been seen pejoratively by the majority of farmers and some key companies.  As such, the project set about providing real solutions to show that positive environmental outcomes for all, growth in farmer incomes and overall company sustainability were not mutually exclusive of each other and could work with each other to create win-wins.  At the start of 2017 the board set out a plan of action.   The chart included in the document shows the three goals we identified.  We said we had to start from the start on climate change.  As such, water quality and soil issues were identified as the first key goals before moving on to anything else.  I am delighted to see representatives of Teagasc here.  Teagasc is a key partner in the target to drive nutrient management and a soil fertility improvement plan which builds very much on the science developed by Professor Frank O'Mara and his colleagues over many years.  We are also promoting best practice in farmyard waste management, in particular water.  The initiative is being implemented, first, through the six biggest Dairy Industry Ireland companies and 30 pilot scheme farms.  Members should have received in their packs a copy of the handbook which has been circulated to each company and farm.  The handbooks have been localised for individual companies.  The idea is that they will go to all 18,000 farmers over the course of 2018.</p> <p>  Dairy Sustainability Ireland had a public launch at the end of 2016.  We did detailed technical work, with other stakeholders, to build trust and consult on the science, etc.  That occurred over a year-long period and the initiative was then publicly launched in October 2017 by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and our chairman, Mr. Jim Woulfe.  The key issue was the possible loss of our nitrates derogation at the end of last year, as the Chairman of the committee is well aware.  The project evolved very quickly.  With Ireland needing to react to challenges under the water directives and the possible loss of the nitrates derogation, it was decided at the end of 2017 that the components of Dairy Sustainability Ireland would fully support the Government's establishment of the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, in tandem with the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Our chairman, Mr. Jim Woulfe, launched the initiative with the relevant Ministers, Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Michael Creed, in Government Buildings in December 2017.</p></speech>

All key stakeholders involved in the dairy sustainability initiative are fully committed to this initiative.</p> <p>  In terms of what has been committed to, all of the processing dairy companies at all levels will fully support this new sustainability drive to achieve improved on-farm sustainability outcomes.  This work will be supported up the supply chain by the specialised nutrition Dairy Industry Ireland members.  Dairy Industry Ireland members will provide and fund ten full-time sustainability advisors to work within a shared partnership strategy and governance within the new agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP.  These sustainability advisers will work cohesively and in an integrated way with the Teagasc teams and staff, and all will be trained with the Teagasc team to the same standard.  The sustainability advisers will, in turn, support an internal change programme within the companies as part of this new programme.  All dairy industry personnel in direct contact with farmers will be trained in this new approach and there will be work within the partnership to develop a new communications strategy to support on-farm sustainability and climate change best practice.  In addition, the co-operatives' communication channels with their suppliers and supplier network structures will be utilised to drive this new strategy.</p> <p>  What we are aiming for in terms of early outcomes is that current company farm pilots for nutrient management programme best practice will be expanded from the current pilot phase of six co-operatives across the 11 processing co-operatives during 2018, so there will be immediate progress.  Two new pilots will be established with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency to understand and devise best practice in critical source areas to break nutrient pathways.  That refers to the point made by Dr. Matthew Crowe of the EPA on areas where water is declining very rapidly.  The processing companies will actively promote the implementation of the new nitrates action programme across those companies and involving all dairy farmers.  The co-operatives will seek that all dairy farmers implement best practice in nutrient management practice by 2021 and they will support the development of new approaches and best practice regarding the broader sustainability and climate change agenda.</p> <p>  We see that this is only phase 1.  We have heard the issues raised by the earlier contributors in terms of renewable energy but if we do not get water and soil right, we cannot go on to look at the bigger picture of climate change mitigation, be it through solar panels or otherwise.  I thank committee members for their time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gillian Westbrook" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#T00400"><p>On behalf of the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, I thank the Chairman and committee members for asking us to speak here today.  Sustainably feeding the growing world population while reducing our impact on climate change are two of the major challenges facing society today.  While there is a growing understanding of the complexity of the links between these challenges and of the global degradation of the environment, the contribution of food and farming to climate change mitigation is too often looked at from the single perspective of greenhouse gas emissions per hectare or per kilogram of product.  This narrow view fails to take into account the vast array of ways that farming itself makes a contribution to climate change.</p> <p>  Farming is linked to, but considered separately from, food.  Industrial food production has farming as a base activity but "food" includes a range of usually upstream impacts in terms of processing, packaging and transportation.  For an encompassing sustainability assessment of food production systems, it is crucial to complement efficiency measures with more systemic aspects, that is, sufficiency measures, as well as the role certain resources play in a food systems context, that is, consistency of resource use.  Moreover, for effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture production, fluxes occurring outside the agricultural sector need to be taken into account, such as the emissions linked to the production of mineral fertiliser.  For livestock production, emissions from land use and land use change linked to concentrate feed, or conversion of forest to pasture or arable crop production, should all be taken into account in life cycle analyses.</p> <p>  Climate change itself is too narrow a factor to consider in isolation.  Environmental pollution often feeds back into and exacerbates climatic change and remains a key problem to be tackled at all levels.  Working in sustainable way is at the core of organic farming, hence minimising pollution is where organic farming practices score very highly.  The impact of agricultural practices, food waste and sustainable diets must all be evaluated if we are to understand how food and farming can positively contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, while simultaneously providing food security.  All farming and food production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and, as such, it is vital that we look honestly at the impacts, and that includes indirect emissions which are not accounted for or attributed to agriculture.</p> <p>  We say this not because we wish to see agriculture held responsible but to truly tackle this massive problem.  There is little point having Irish farmers dramatically change their approach only to result in insignificant or possibly no impact on a global problem.  Indirect emissions from feed production in third countries, mineral fertiliser production and transport must all be part of the overall discussion if we are to get a better picture of the impact of agriculture and the whole food system.  Therefore, activities that are required to keep the current agricultural system running should be taken into account.  Taken together, one third to half of global greenhouse gas emissions could be linked to food production, processing, transport, distribution and consumption.</p> <p>  Nitrogen is a key nutrient required for fertile soils, yet its use and manufacture are linked to high levels of emissions all along its life cycle.  Nitrous oxide emissions account for 32% of greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland.  Emissions generated from the production of mineral nitrogen fertilisers alone, and banned in organic systems, amount to about 1.75% of total EU emissions.  Reducing nitrogen fertiliser applications, therefore, is a very effective way of achieving emission reduction.</p> <p>  Methane and nitrous oxide emissions caused by manure management play a significant part.  Manure composting is often used in organic systems.  This technique alone can reduce nitrous oxide by 50% and methane by 70%.  Therefore, much more consideration needs to be given to this technique.</p> <p>  Carbon sequestration offers tangible short-term assistance for mitigation of climate change.  However, it is reversible and not permanent, and, as such, cannot be considered to be a real mitigation tool.  It will, however, allow for offsetting of emissions and award some more time to implement long-lasting and permanent solutions.</p> <p>  There are many benefits from organic systems and these are outlined in more detail in our submission.  These will and do contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and make this specific farming method more resilient to changing weather conditions.  To name but a few such benefits, there is higher biodiversity, conservation of soils, reduced eutrophication and water pollution, a ban on mineral fertilisers and composting.  Diversified systems are, by definition, geared towards producing diverse outputs, while delivering a range of environmental and social benefits on the farm.  This is what organic farming provides.  Organic farming has a part to play in climate change mitigation and, as with all sectors, there is room to improve.  Organic agriculture empowers farmers by helping them design agronomic systems that are more resilient towards the impacts of climate change and pollution, by enabling them to reduce dependence on external inputs and by promoting the development, rather than the degradation, of the natural resources on which we all depend for food production.</p> <p>  Climate change action comes in many forms and critical to sustainable food production is the need to reduce waste.  In tandem with education of the consumer regarding the impact their food choices have on the environment, climate change needs to be a top-down strategic policy approach meeting the major issues head on.</p></speech>

I will go through my opening statement as quickly as I can.</p> <p>  Food Wise 2025 makes a compelling case for further growth in the agrifood sector but cautions that this growth must take place in a manner that is sustainable in both an economic and environmental sense.  It should be noted that climate influences production in agriculture and that the greenhouse gas emissions by agriculture are a contributor to climate change.  Climate change will impact on agriculture over the medium term but ongoing intervention to address the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is required, not least to ensure that agriculture is not unduly constrained by national level greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the period 2021 to 2030.</p><p>Solutions are required that will limit the greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions from agriculture but at the same time, allow it to grow where feasible by remaining competitive at an EU and global level.  We must realise that these are not mutually exclusive and that we can continue to have growth in our food production and tackle emissions from the sector.  Given that Ireland has a low level of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, that is, a low carbon footprint, there is a need to ensure that climate policy is cognisant of the potential for carbon leakage, which occurs when agricultural products are produced in other countries with high emissions per unit product.  Senator Paul Daly mentioned that scenario in the first session of this meeting.  </p><p> The relatively unique position of Ireland as a major exporter of meat and dairy products - we export about 90% of our butter, beef and dairy products - means that national-level initiatives to curb consumption of meat and dairy products can have little impact on the emissions of our agrifood sector.  Therefore, national-level solutions are more likely to come from interventions on the production side, particularly inside the farm gate.  Recognising this, over the past 15 years Teagasc has made a substantial commitment in terms of staff and other resources to tackling the issue of GHG emissions at farm level.  This commitment encompasses both research on technologies and farm practices to address emissions and knowledge transfer to ensure the effective adoption of these technologies at farm level.  All the evidence to date suggests that reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions will be challenging.  No single large-scale silver bullet type intervention exists.  Therefore, the mitigation of GHG emissions from agriculture will require a wide suite of interventions that can cumulatively deliver a significant level of emissions reduction.</p><p> A complication in achieving a reduction in the total GHG emissions generated by agriculture in Ireland is the fact that the total level of agricultural activity is increasing, particularly in the context of the expansion taking place in the dairy sector and the related increase in the cattle population.  This means that interventions that reduce emissions per kilogram of milk or per kilogram of beef may be offset to some degree by additional emissions generated due to the overall increase in the amount of product that is produced.</p><p> Teagasc has previously identified measures to reduce GHG emissions and has made estimates of the associated cost of each measure and the total amount of greenhouse gas mitigation the measures would deliver.  This is called a marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.</p><p>We published our first MACC a number of years ago.  In light of developments in research, agriculture and policy, there is a periodic need to revise the marginal abatement cost curve to reassess the suite of mitigation options available, including mitigation options not previously considered.  We will shortly publish our latest marginal abatement cost curve, which will detail 25 interventions that address agricultural emissions mitigation, land use sequestration and the displacement of fossil fuels emissions via bioenergy production.  These are the kind of things discussed by members in the earlier session. </p><p> Sustainable consumption is increasingly embedded in the minds of consumers of Irish agrifood products both here and abroad.  Origin Green has been discussed.  Teagasc will continue to work with the agrifood sector to ensure that it remains at the forefront of progress to address the emissions generated in agrifood production, a key objective in sustainable production.  In particular, Teagasc continues to highlight to stakeholders that adherence to more sustainable food production practices can be profit-enhancing for the sector, as well as beneficial to the environment.  That is a key point.  We must find solutions that work for emissions reduction but do not damage the profitability of the sector, which is low in many commodities.  </p><p> Recent changes to policy at an EU level now potentially make sequestration by forestry part of the solution to address the emissions generated within agriculture.  Heretofore, the sequestration by trees planted by farmers could not be used to offset the emissions generated on the farm.  This is no longer the case so the potential now exists to sequester significant amounts of carbon if the rate of afforestation is increased nationally and sustained at a higher level over the next couple of decades.  There is, however, considerable opposition to additional forestry in rural communities in some parts of Ireland.  These concerns need to be understood and effective communication will be required to illustrate the economic and environmental benefits which increased afforestation would have.  There are a number of options for biomaterial and fossil fuels substitution that would offset emissions outside of the farm sector and further incentivisation is required to develop these markets.  However, unlike forestry where the benefit of sequestration is included in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector, it is not clear whether farmers would be credited at a national level for the positive contribution these actions in terms of biomaterials or fossil fuel substitution would make to addressing Ireland's GHG emissions.</p><p> Teagasc is also committed to research associated with climate adaptation, that is, changes in agriculture that might be required to cope with the adverse consequences of a changing climate.  However, at this time, there are uncertainties with respect to the local level impacts of climate change on agriculture in Ireland, which complicate the provision of accurate advice to farmers in this regard.  In particular, it would be unwise to provide advice with respect to climate adaptation which might subsequently require revision as our knowledge of the impact of climate change becomes clearer.  Teagasc has highlighted measures that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of which also save farmers money, and there is a need for greater emphasis on the connection between environmental sustainability and profitability at the farm level.  There is an urgent need for farmers to continue reducing absolute emissions through the uptake of these measures and through enhancing carbon sequestration through forestry.  Knowledge transfer is key to rolling out these mitigation measures, as are national policies to incentivise farmers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Kent" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#U00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and other members of this committee for the opportunity to contribute to their deliberations on climate change.  The ICSA believes that we have to stop the negative narrative around agriculture and climate change.  Instead of being accused of being part of the problem, the ICSA believes that agriculture can be part of the solution.  First, let us look at why the negativity around agricultural emissions is misplaced.  As a general proposition, we argue that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions is fundamentally linked to excessive consumption of fossil fuel energy linked to economic development.  The Irish emissions profile is skewed towards agriculture not because we are excessively bad in terms of farming systems but because we did not partake in the industrial revolution.  In addition, only measuring emissions tends to paint livestock farming in a bad light while ignoring the carbon sequestration in growing grass and maintaining hedgerows and trees on typical Irish farming systems.  We hear far less about the reality that this is fundamentally a problem of energy consumption based on fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The 2017 Carbon Majors report indicates that 71% of global industrial emissions since 1988 can be linked to just 100 producers, almost all of which are companies in the fossil fuel sectors.  Moreover, the real culprits can be seen in the fact that Chinese coal production has tripled since the turn of the millennium and Russian coal production has expanded by 70% since the late 1990s.  Meanwhile, it is notable that at the COP23 summit in Bonn in November, which was attended by the ICSA, the host country Germany refused to sign up to a declaration of countries pledging to phase out coal.  </p> <p>  This is not to deny that there are emissions from agriculture.  At a global level, the figure for agriculture and land use emissions is 24% of total greenhouse gas emissions.  However, this figure ignores the fact that this is balanced to a considerable degree by land use and agricultural activities acting as a carbon sink, whereas other sectors provide no benefits in terms of sequestration.  In any event, people must eat; this is non-negotiable.  However, this raises an interesting question.  Why are emissions from fossil fuels attributed to the countries where they are consumed whereas food production emissions are attributed to the countries where the food is grown?  The ICSA believes that the question of who is held responsible for emissions needs to be revisited.  Specifically, Ireland should not shoulder all of the responsibility for food produced which is actually destined for consumption in other countries both within and outside the EU.  Demand for food is a given and is unavoidably linked to global population growth.  Presumably, the point of saving the planet does not stand above the need to feed the population of the planet in a hierarchy of imperatives for current or future generations.  While the question of which markets we supply is constrained by economics, the impact of emissions from food production knows no geographical boundaries.  Hence it is utterly futile to displace food production in Ireland to other parts of the globe in order to satisfy EU or COP21 targets.  The reality is that those who consume our food create the demand and thereby are essentially responsible for the emissions.</p><p>There is flexibility to reduce food demand by reducing food waste, which can be as high as 33%, but this is more under the control of retailers and consumers than primary producers.  We are not saying that we cannot use technological advances to reduce emissions or increase sequestration.  Interestingly, there is a research project in Denmark in which the addition of a feed supplement, Mootral, can lead to a 58% reduction in methane emissions from livestock.</p><p> We must remember that we are already starting from a good position as Irish livestock products such as meat and dairy are among the most efficient in terms of carbon footprint per kilogram of product.  There is no logic to reducing Irish meat exports to satisfy European demand for protein and then making up the gap with imports from South America or other countries where the environmental damage is much higher.  Schemes under the rural development programme can make a difference but we have to refocus them so that they deliver real income to farmers who go the extra mile to deliver climate change improvement rather than just cover costs or use farmers to circulate money to others.  With regard to forestry targets, it is important to understand that the compulsion to re-plant trees on land at clearfell is creating a barrier to some farmers taking the multi-generational decision to get into forestry.  However, I now want to say a bit on how agriculture can make a positive contribution to the climate change challenge in the energy sectors.</p><p> ICSA believes there is significant potential to integrate agricultural systems of production with decarbonising electricity production.  There is evidence that some European farms, which have a higher cost than Irish farms in production for dairying, for example, are nonetheless more profitable because of the integration of farming with anaerobic digestion systems, solar energy or community-based wind farm projects.  However, what is missing is a secure investment environment due to uncertainty around Government policy and market stability.  ICSA believes we need a stable and viable Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff, REFIT, regime and a commitment to seriously reconsider the detached attitude displayed to date on anaerobic digestion.  We should favour solar panels on the roofs of sheds also.</p><p> European agriculture has immense potential to provide very substantial gains in the emissions profile of transport energy.  For example, European crop-based ethanol is heading towards almost 70% less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels on a whole life-cycle basis.  Given that transport energy is well behind electricity and heating and cooling in terms of meeting the EU 27% renewable energy target for 2030, it is incredible to think that the EU clean energy package includes a proposal for a revised renewable energy directive that will undermine the limited progress made to date on transport energy.  Ireland should actively oppose the EU proposals to reduce the first generation biofuel mandate from 7% to 3.8% under the revised renewable energy directive.  This is now at the trilogue stage in Brussels.</p><p> Key crop based biofuels grown by EU farmers represent a win-win for farmers, for declining rural communities and for climate change objectives.  In addition, they reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Ireland should increase biofuel blending rates in conventional combustion engines.  In the short term this is likely to be far more effective than trying to buck the market in terms of getting people to buy electric vehicles that they do not want and cannot afford, and having regard to the fact that heavy transport and long distance travel will not use electric vehicles in the short to medium term anyway.</p><p> To conclude, I emphasise that the need for food security globally dictates that we should continue to advocate for efficient Irish livestock systems supplying meat, dairy and cereals to affluent consumers in Europe.  I notice that some people believe we may be able to grow beans west of the Shannon.  At a garden level we may be able to do so but from an agricultural perspective, it is not possible to grow beans more than one year in five in the very best land in the south or south east of the country.  Harvesting can be a problem in some years.  We are producing premium quality beef and there is no better food than can be eaten than beef cooked in butter from the west of Ireland.  It sure beats beans any day and we do not need to use any tomato ketchup.  It is hypocritical in the extreme to talk about cutbacks in livestock in Ireland or taxes on livestock farming while at the same time Europe proposes to import more meat from the likes of South America and Canada under trade deals.</p></speech>

I thank all the contributors for coming today, providing the background documentation forwarded to the committee and the succinct presentations.  I will start with a question about the sustainable dairy initiative and the potential that might exist for it to reduce emissions.  How will the curve go in the next period with regard to the expansion of the dairy industry and the impact it is likely to have on carbon emissions, taking into account what it is hoped to achieve with the sustainable dairy initiative and other measures?  The organic sector has a part to play in terms of climate change and increasing the percentage of land under organic farming, as we have discussed at the committee before.  What are the key support measures required in this respect?</p> <p>  The thread that came from Teagasc, which I agree with, is that we should push on in trying to achieve the Food Wise 2025 targets, taking into account our obligations and trying to be sustainable.  How does Teagasc see the curve going from its current assessment with respect to the carbon footprint of Irish agriculture?  I look forward to its updated report on marginal abatement.  How much does Teagasc believe we can achieve in reductions over the coming period?  I thank the ICSA for its contribution.  It made points about trade deals with Mercosur and I concur with those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#V00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the contributions.  I have some questions following on from the discussion we had with people in before the current delegations.  What percentage of animal feed and protein used as feed in Ireland is imported?  I am wondering about the potential.  I am conscious of much of this talk of Origin Green, and is it really Origin Green if we are bringing protein from the far side of the Atlantic to feed the cattle?  It does not fit properly but it is something we should look at.</p> <p>  The next issue might be related.  My understanding is that in Ireland we do not produce many of our own vegetables and many vegetables in our shops are imported to this country.  What percentage of our vegetable market is imported and what potential is there for change?  If we are talking about the miles that food must travel to get to a person, as well as the miles that inputs must travel, this is relevant.</p> <p>  The dairy issue is interesting and I have been looking at it for a while.  We were told that as the dairy herd expanded, it would not have any real impact as it was expected that others would go down.  I have a theory that the big plan was that the dairy herd might expand by 30% over a period and we could, with sex selection, produce replacement dairy animals and a beef calf from the bull calf, and that would almost replace the need for a suckler sector.  Is there any truth in that?  Many of the suckler farmers around the country are looking for supports.  Is there another programme in place that is not being mentioned?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Mara mentioned research into trying to mitigate the emissions from our bovines.</p><p>Mr. Kent mentioned a project in Denmark which is looking at various feed changes which, I assume, is about the science of the digestive system of the animal.  What is being done in that regard?  Is there science which could help to change that and to move that along?</p><p> I have what I suppose is a broader question.  Food Wise 2025 is about increasing production, mainly in the dairy and beef sectors because those are our two big sectors.  If our production is to increase, those are the sectors that will really increase.  With the advent of Brexit which will have an impact because we export so much of both our dairy and beef product to Britain and the potential of Food Wise 2025 on which one can say we should plough ahead anyway, are we placing ourselves in a position where we could be back here in three years time sitting around this table talking about the crisis in our dairy and beef sectors because there are not markets for all this production that we ploughed ahead with because we decided that it was the right thing to do regardless of the consequences?  I wonder have we thought this through.  We all hope for the best from the Brexit negotiations but the reality is the Brexit negotiations are going in a direction which will be detrimental to the Irish food sector.  At some stage, we must sit up and take cognisance of that and wonder where it will go.</p><p> In regard to the organic sector, Deputy McConalogue is correct.  We have on many occasions talked about what can be done and what scheme can be put in place to get more producers into organics.  I wonder how much has gone into both the domestic and export markets for organics.  There are many niche products.  Can we make mainstream some of those sectors so that they can become a possibility for other producers, particularly, I suppose, on the marginal land where one would not conduct intensive farming, as a future for them to sustain the family farm in those areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#W00200"><p>I have a couple of questions overall.  Between the dairy sector and the ICSA, as this goes for both groups, given what we heard earlier that even if everything is done right there will still be excess emissions from the existing farming using traditional methods, what are we to do?  Should we say that we will have higher emissions and we will sustain that, and put our hands up and say we will take it on the chin and go with it?</p> <p>  In the dairy sector, the matter is at the very early stages.  As to whether anything will happen or whether they can achieve that, I wonder is it just trying to be seen to be doing something rather than doing and achieving something.</p> <p>  The organic farmers state there is little point having Irish farmers dramatically change their approach only to result in insignificant, or possibly no, impact on a global problem.  I suppose that implies we are insignificant and it does not really matter what we do, and we should do nothing.  I wonder about that.</p> <p>  Teagasc referred to forestry's negative impact.  The changes that have taken place at an EU level might make forestry more acceptable for individual farmers but there definitely is a problem, in Leitrim and other places, where it is companies that are involved in forestry.  I wonder if the witnesses would comment on the possibility of forestry off-set in the context of climate change overall.</p></speech>

The Chairman can tell me if I repeat anything.</p> <p>  A question I was thinking of before I left for the Seanad was to ask the four groups their views on organic farming, as one of the least greenhouse gas emitting sectors, being a solution to this problem.  What bonuses could the dairy sector see it giving to dairy farming?  Likewise, with a view to the production that we need to keep up from the point of view of profitability, what is Teagasc's outlook on organics?  In a situation like this, we all have to take into consideration state aid.  The organic sector traditionally probably needs more support.  Going forward, what are the opinions of the other groups on organics as a stepping stone in the right direction with regards to climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#W00400"><p>I am glad to get the opportunity to say a few words here to support agriculture in general because, as we all know too well, if agriculture is in decline the country is in decline.  It is important to remember, when we are talking about climate change and getting rid of diesel cars and diesel vehicles, that we create &euro;5 billion worth of exports from agriculture.  We need to respect that and ensure that we at least retain that amount because farmers are put to the pin of their collars.  Farmers have to fight everything, including the weather.  It is grand to say now that dairy farmers are prospering but it is only a year and a half since they were in trouble.  In 2016, they were not getting for a gallon of milk what it cost them to produce it.</p> <p>  As Mr. Kent stated here, it is important to remember that food comes from the land.  It is equally important that it comes from our land.  We have a wonderful climate and for the best part, wonderful land to produce cattle, milk and food generally.  We are worried, as many farmers are, that we will lose some of our market with Britain leaving the Common Market.  Will it be the case that the beef, milk or whatever foods we were supplying to Britain will come from other countries and where will we be?  Will it be grand that our production will be reduced then and we will be in trouble?</p> <p>  In the overall context, as I stated here earlier this evening, these are important discussions.  That is why I returned here.  I watched the proceedings in my office - I was trying to do other things as well as listening to the witnesses.  They all, Mr. Mulvihill, Ms Westbrook, Professor O'Mara and Mr. Kent, made valuable points.  I did not hear others and if anyone else spoke, I apologise in that regard.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that in the overall context if we in this country were clear of all emissions we would only reduce the emissions of the world by 0.13%.  Therefore, 99.8% of emissions are coming from the rest of the world.  Agriculture is such a big part of our country.  It always has been and, hopefully, it always will be.  We must do our best to protect that part of our economy.</p> <p>  People are worried out there.  They hear that they have to get rid of diesel cars.  It is only a few years since they were told buying diesel cars was the thing to do.  That was in 2007.  I refer to heavy machinery.  I hear commentators saying that carbon tax will have to be increased on diesel and the price of diesel will have to increase but that is what lorries, tractors and agricultural vehicles run on.</p><p>Are we going to penalise these people and drive them underground?  They are in a bad enough situation as it is and they are worried about Brexit, with Theresa May talking out of the two sides of her mouth, one day saying there will be a soft Border and another that there will be a hard Border.  When the UK voted to leave the European Union I suggested in the D&aacute;il that they reconsider and hold another referendum.  That would lead to the only result that would help Irish farmers and our small industries, which have already been affected by the decline in the value of sterling.</p><p> It is important to remember that our food comes from the land.  Many people in the city might think milk is made down the street and comes out of a bottle, without a cow having to be milked, and they could be the very people who say farmers hurt the environment.  They drink milk, eat meat and put butter on their bread but then they say we need to do more about climate change.  There was climate change before there was a combustion engine or were as many cows as we now have.  In the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach said that the snow of the past few days was the worst event in 70 years but I disagree with him as we have had several such events, such as in 1982 which lasted for three weeks and when, in parts of my county, people did not come out of their houses.  My father remembered 1947 and I will tell a story about it.</p></speech>

Farmers will have to meet these targets by 2030 and we will not be able to cut turf or burn peat.  Are the witnesses worried about that?  If we have to comply with the Paris Agreement, come hell or high water, will it hurt Irish farmers?  I did not vote to accept the Paris Agreement because farmers will pay.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have said there will be &euro;22 billion to deal with climate change but we are already paying &euro;0.5 billion and another &euro;0.5 billion will come out of farmers' pockets.  I am worried about signing up to these agreements because a lot of things can happen, such as Brexit or the weather, and farmers on the west coast are out of fodder at the moment.  Are we going to insist that our farmers go into the red, or out of existence, to comply with these agreements?  A lot of farmers are worried because many things can go wrong in farming and create double or triple the trouble.  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to sucklers and spoke about getting beef calves from dairy cows.  The suckler trade is bad enough without suggesting that.  I know farmers in the west who cannot milk cows as their hilly ground is not amenable to it, though they provide good sucklers.  We must try to protect the suckler farmer as well as the dairy farmer.</p></speech>

I attended a trial farm in my part of the country, and I am sure Dr. O.Mara knows where I am talking about.  Teagasc has done a considerable amount of work, in conjunction with others, to develop a suckler-type calf from a dairy cow.  Can the witnesses give us more information about that?  There is a lot of discussion about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, at the moment.  Does Teagasc have any views about which measures could be introduced in a new CAP to address climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Kent" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#X00500"><p>There have been a lot of different contributions by various people, all coming at the issues from different angles, and Deputy Healy-Rae has raised some very valid points.  A lot of us will be gone by 2040 but I wish to nail the assertion coming out of the United States that there will be 9 billion people in the world by 2050.  Committee members will have to get busy to feed them because we will not be around to do it.  There is massive development potential in southern Africa and the main aim of the assertion, which originated in the US and has been repeated by some people in this country, is to get GM produce into the African continent.  It is a fallacy.  If there is political stability, populations do not increase but remain stable and in Europe they drop at such times, apart from the effect of immigration.  In Germany and Italy, populations are falling so it makes no sense to get farmers to produce more and get deeper into debt on a treadmill which they cannot get off, just so that large corporations can profit.  Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger, the EU Commissioner for budget and EU resources, stated that the CAP budget would be cut by between 5% and 10%.  We cannot invest more if our budget is going to be cut just because the UK is pulling out.  We produce food for the UK and it is a very valuable market.</p> <p>  Some 60% of Europeans do not want to eat GMO produce.  We are doing some experiments on GMO products in this country and that is compromising the saleability of our food, despite carbon credits, Origin Green and other fancy things.  Dr. Crowe said earlier that there had to be behavioural change and Ms Gillian Westbrook will talk about going back to basics in regard to agriculture.  Some fancy research is being done on multispecies pasture but that is what farmers have been using for generations as 90% of what we have in Ireland is multispecies pasture.  Monoculture farming has only come in recently, to ramp farmers up into being busy fools, and this has to be stopped.  Grass-fed beef is a premium product and if one goes into pizza restaurants in Italy one will only get horse or pork.  We have a premium-quality product that we are just dumping in the UK market and we are not even marketing it correctly.  The EPA wants us to have 80% trees and to wipe out farmers but Teagasc will try to back the agricultural sector to some extent.  There are GM experiments being undertaken in Carlow, despite the fact that not one farm in Ireland can grow GM products and nobody has any interest in doing so.</p> <p>  We have to get real and to get income back into rural Ireland.  Sequestering carbon comes from proper agriculture, as does rotation of pasture, but there will be no farmers who can do if they do not get a proper income.</p><p>We need to address all of these issues.   </p><p> On consumers' health, earlier someone mentioned that more calories were being imported into Ireland than being exported.  That is because we are exporting protein.  People are eating too much starch and sugar, which is why there is an epidemic of obesity and diabetes and all related conditions.  People see the price of protein and end up eating too many carbohydrates.  If they were eating protein and fats, they would eat much fewer calories because they would be satisfied.  People become obese because they crave nutrition.  They eat cardboard-type products such as maize, with the kernel removed, such as cornflakes, which one can eat all day and night but still be hungry two hours later.  That is how people get fat.  We have to address that issue.</p><p> I totally support the production of organic products and so on, but it is not for everybody.  They are slightly more expensive to produce because they involves reducing production levels, but as an organisation, we have members who produce organic meat.  It is not for everybody, but it is great for the consumers who can afford it.  If anyone attended a G8 or G20 summit or a Bilderberg conference meeting, I guarantee that the menus would not include a non-GM or non-organic product.  All of the top-level people in Europe or elsewhere in the world will not consume food that is non-GM, but they want others to do so.  We want to stop that.  If Teagasc wants to conduct research, let it do it in another country, but it should get it out of Carlow and declare the country a GM-free zone with immediate effect.</p></speech>

Dr. Donnellan will return to Deputy Charlie McConalogue's question on where we see the curve going on Ireland's future emissions and carbon footprint.  </p> <p>  As Deputy Martin Kenny asked very specific questions, my answers may not be exact.  He asked how much of our feed was imported.  In the dairy sector concentrated feeds make up approximately 20% of the diet and about half of the concentrates are imported.  Therefore, about 10% of the diet of a dairy cow is made up of imported feed.  It would be less than that if we looked at it on a fresh weight basis, just counting kilos of grass and silage, but the 10% figure is on a dry matter basis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#Y00400"><p>Yes.  The 10% is mainly the protein part of the diet such as distillers' grains, soya bean meal and rape seed meal to increase protein.  We produce some of the starchy feed here such as barley and the by-products.  We can grow beans; there is no problem with doing that, but I do not think we have the ability to grow enough beans to meet our protein requirements.  It is a crop that must be subsidised to make it profitable.  Most of the feed we import goes into the pig and poultry sector, where soya bean is the protein of choice.</p> <p>  I do not know the figures for vegetables.  My sense is that we grow most of the staple vegetables we need such as potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage and so on.  Potatoes are nearly all grown locally.  Looking at some of the other vegetables, I do not want to use the word "exotic", but it is the only one that comes to mind.  Many are imported, with all of the problems the member raised about import miles.  Unfortunately, I do not have exact figures beyond that hunch.    </p> <p>  On dairy industry expansion, there was a question about whether there was a master plan or programme to increase the size of the dairy herd to increase and reduce the size of the the beef herd.  I would not call it a master plan, but there was an expectation that some of the increase in dairy cow numbers would come from farmers getting out of beef production and getting into dairy production.  That has happened to an extent, but the beef cow numbers have remained fairly stable.  They have reduced somewhat, perhaps by 8% or 10% in the past five to ten years, but it is not a big reduction, whereas the dairy herd has grown by more.  I would not say it was a master plan, but people did think there would be more of a decline in the size of the beef cow herd.  Obviously, dairy cows produce calves and most of the male calves end up in the beef industry.  We did not anticipate any decline in beef output because we expected dairy calves to contribute to beef output.  Almost 60% of the steers killed in the country last year were of dairy cow origin.  Dr. Donnellan may return to this issue in his remarks about the future footprint.</p> <p>  On science that might help, we are looking at solutions that would help to reduce emissions.  They have a significant part to play.  Recently, we undertook research into fertiliser types that showed that in using stabilised urea instead of calcium ammonia nitrate that farmers might typically use we could reduce the emissions of nitrous oxide without any affect on grass production.  It is the case that there is a lot of research ongoing into feed additives.  Teagasc is not involved in it, but we are well linked into the international research in the area.  There is evidence that there are feed additives which will significantly reduce methane emissions.  There is more work to be done in establishing how long-term the reduction is and whether the cow will eventually return to her normal emissions.  There are issues surrounding the safety testing of these additives before they are used on a widespread basis.  There is also the cost.  These additives are not cheap.  There are possible technological solutions, some of which have been developed, while others are being worked on and they all play a part in how we think the sector can contribute to the reduction of emissions.  </p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about forestry and its acceptability.  There is no doubt that the afforestation targets included the national afforestation plan are a central plank for the country, especially the land use sector in contributing to emission reductions.  We are not reaching these targets but undershooting them.  It is an issue if we do not achieve the level of carbon sequestration we hope to achieve as it makes the challenge of reducing emissions even bigger.  There is an issue surrounding the acceptability of forestry as we have seen in recent months, particularly in County Leitrim, where people are very concerned about large-scale planting.  The forestry sector will have to take people's concerns on board.  Ultimately, individuals make a decision to plant their land, whether they do so themselves or bring in a forestry company, and it has to be done in a way that is acceptable to the communities around them.  It is important that forestry be distributed throughout the country and that it is not all localised in particular areas.  That is important from the perspective of public acceptability.  </p> <p>  There is also a question about the types of forests which we plant.  We are undershooting our targets for broad-leaf planting and need to address that issue.  The issue of clear-felling was raised in the earlier session.  We need to move more towards continuous cropping and a felling-type system rather than have blanket clear-felling.  Much needs to be done on how we communicate the benefits of forestry and help to allay people's concerns in particular locations.  The country has a low percentage of its land planted.  It is now 11% and when I was in school which was not today or yesterday, it was 4%.  Therefore, we have almost tripled the amount of forestry compared to what we it was 40 years ago.  The national target is to increase the level to around 18%, which would still be low by European standards but it represents a lot of land that has to be used for forestry.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked for our view on organics and the role of the organic sector as a solution.  We are very supportive of the organic sector.  We have dedicated specialists who help farmers involved in organic production systems and no doubt organic farming has a role to play.  There is a certain demand for organic produce.  The role of agriculture is to meet differing demands for food.  Some people want meat and plant-based food, while others want organics.  Agriculture has to supply all of these needs.  There is a role for organics which has increased as a proportion of our land use in recent years, which is welcome.</p><p>If the whole country went organic, I do not think it would be any good for the organic sector because it is a relatively niche market.  If the market is flooded, nobody makes anything out of it, so that is not a solution in itself to the climate issue.  It should also be borne in mind that the output per hectare on an organic system is lower, and we must be mindful of food security as well as climate change.  We need to continue to produce food, as does the rest of the world, in increasing amounts.  Organic has its role but will not solve the climate issue of itself.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae about the importance of agriculture in rural Ireland.  It is really what makes the fabric of rural Ireland.  It is the biggest contributor to economic activity in rural Ireland.  The Deputy asked how worried are we about the 2030 targets.  There is no doubt but that it is a big challenge for the sector to reduce its emissions significantly.  There is no target as yet for any sector.  For agriculture there has not been a specific target to meet.  For agriculture to make a significant contribution to reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions is a big challenge, but there are ways and means of doing it.  There are the things we talked about such as fertiliser and improving efficiencies that can make a contribution.  Forestry can make a significant contribution, as can biofuels and biomass offsetting.  However, these measures will not happen by themselves; they will require a continuous effort in research, knowledge transfer and policy to support their adoption.</p><p> The last question I will address was asked by the Chairman and concerned a suckler-type calf from a dairy cow.  We are in collaboration with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, in this regard.  Rather than a dairy farmer just picking any Angus or Hereford bull to bull the cows after he or she has finished bulling with a Holstein bull, we recommend he or she pick one that is better for beef than the average.  The research has shown that there is a big difference between, say, the worst Angus and the best Angus that one could pick from a beef perspective.  Therefore, we are working with the ICBF to develop an index that would show dairy farmers that if they will be selling Angus or Hereford calves, they might as well sell good ones.  This would allow them to select the best Angus or Hereford bulls from a beef perspective because they are making up a bigger proportion of our beef industry.  As I said, about 60% of our national kill is now from the dairy sector.  It will be a very important development that we try to maximise the value of the beef calf coming out of the dairy herd.</p><p> There are a number of matters left for Mr. Donnellan to address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Donnellan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018030600002#Z00200"><p>I will mop up a few of the issues my colleague, Dr. O'Mara, has not touched upon.</p> <p>  The first question, I think from Deputy McConalogue, was essentially about where we are going regarding agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.  We are working to produce new sets of projections for the Environmental Protection Agency.  What I can say at this point is that, certainly in the short term, we expect agricultural emissions to continue to increase.  The question is whether over the longer term we will see a stabilisation and a reduction.  This is before we take into account anything regarding Brexit or the mitigation measures that exist, so we are talking about what we call our base case view of what will happen to emissions.  Certainly in the short term those emissions will increase, and this is largely, or exclusively, due to the fact that the dairy sector is expanding and there are more dairy cows in the system.  Most of the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland can be attributed to the bovine sector because its emissions are the largest component of the overall emissions.  Over the longer term whether emissions will stabilise in that base case or maybe even reduce a little depends on how the suckler herd, the other part of the bovine herd, evolves and whether it stays the size it is at present or moves into decline into the future.  This question depends on various things, including the level of support that sector will get.</p> <p>  Our new MAC curve which will issue shortly suggests that there are measures which could reduce emissions by up to 6 million tonnes.  This is against the level of current emissions from the agriculture sector, which is approximately 20 million tonnes.  We need to bear in mind that this may increase in the future.  We are looking at a situation in which there is potential to reduce the overall emissions generated by agriculture and land use in the future but we would caution that there is a lot of work to be done to ensure farmers take up, for example, the 25 measures we talked about in this MAC curve that we will issue shortly.</p> <p>  One of the questions Deputy Kenny asked concerned Brexit and if we will be back here in a few years in a crisis situation if Brexit turns out quite badly from the agriculture sector's perspective.  Limiting our discussion, given that we are talking about climate change, to the dairy and beef sectors, I think the beef sector at an industry level and a farm level has much more to be concerned about regarding Brexit than dairy.  This is not to say dairy does not have concerns about Brexit, but the concerns are much steeper in the case of the beef sector.  Looking at the two sectors as they are at present, particularly at the farm level, the economics of the beef sector is much inferior to that of the dairy sector.  Profitability in dairy is very high; profitability in the beef sector, when one takes away the support payments it receives at the farm level, is pretty much zero.  This situation will worsen under Brexit.  A particular concern for the beef sector is that it has very high levels of dependance on exports to the UK, and what is not exported to the UK is generally exported to continental Europe.  We have very little in the way of beef exports outside the European Union, and the European Union market is pretty stagnant in terms of beef demand.  The demand is not very strong.  If one contrasts this with the position of dairy, there is still some growth in dairy demand in Europe - small, admittedly, but it is still there - but more particularly at the international level, outside of Europe, there is strong demand growth for dairy products.  This contrasts quite significantly with the position of the beef sector.  What I am saying in short is that there are export opportunities for dairy both in continental Europe and globally that do not exist in the case of beef, so there is a difference there.  I would also caution that in the dairy sector some dairy processors are more exposed to the effects of Brexit than are others, particularly dairy processors that have a significant production of cheddar cheese going into the UK market.  Some processors do not produce cheese at all, so the level of exposure to Brexit from the dairy industry perspective differs across processors.  The impact on both sectors, I think, would be negative but I think the dairy sector has a greater potential to power through the difficulties and get beyond it than the beef sector.</p> <p>  Another question, I think from the Chairman, was what we could do with the new CAP that would be beneficial in mitigating climate change.  One thing we need to look at in this regard is some of the flexibilities that will potentially be offered under the new CAP to tailor the CAP to our own national needs and objectives.  Clearly, since we are here today, the impact of agriculture on climate change is one of those concerns.  The previous CAP reform - that is, the current CAP - has been very heavily criticised in all quarters, from the perspectives of farmers and environmentalists and right across Europe, as not having been very effective in its greening measures.  As for the greening measures that were introduced, the original proposals were probably more extensive than the final agreement, which watered down the objectives that were set out from the greening measures.  However, if we had greening measures under the new CAP which linked payments, for example, to some of the actions which Teagasc has identified and which are actually profit-enhancing for farmers or of relatively low cost to farmers, then we might see greater uptake of some of those measures which are part of our MAC curve and which might help to address some of the concerns about greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  Finally, I think Deputy Healy-Rae asked the question whether we are worried about the hurt that this whole issue is likely to cause farmers.  The way to think about that question is that dealing with climate change will have costs across society as a whole.</p><p>We need to balance those costs so it does not result in a situation where any sector is disproportionately burdened by addressing the issue.  If there were no costs associated with addressing climate change, we would not be here today.  We would have arrived at a decision about how to deal with climate change and we would go off and deal with it.  If any sectors of society consider themselves to be losers as a result of dealing with climate change, there is a political question about how to deal with the issue of emissions reductions across the economy as a whole.</p></speech>

My colleague, who is an organic dairy farmer, will take the others because he has practical experience of this.  There was a question about increasing the land used for organic production and how to achieve that.  Opening up a new scheme would be a really good start.  Our existing target for organics is 5%, yet we only ring fence 2% of land area for organics under the rural development budget.  To have a target and allocate finances accordingly would be good.  We have not had a scheme open since 2015.  How do we increase it?  We have a huge waiting list.  A scheme would be good.  It is probably not such a good idea to open it right now because the demand is in the tillage sector.  It will benefit all the other sectors.  I hate the term "grow organically"; it is a "Grand Designs" term that keeps being used.  It needs to be done from the ground up.  More tillage and a more sustainable local supply of feed will benefit existing farmers.  Under organic regulations, 60%, and it will soon be 70%, of animal feed has to come from one's own farm.  It is built within a regulatory requirement.</p> <p>  Organic offers a real win-win situation.  It has a significant impact on climate change in a positive way.  A very tangible and market-driven policy is needed.  The Minister has put a new strategic group together to look at where we go with organics and it is very much welcomed.  It is needed.  We have a seat on that panel.  It will look at how to grow organics and the infrastructure that is needed, including logistics and distribution requirements.  It is fragmented because there has been a stop-start approach.  We opened up the scheme in 2012 and then we stopped it for a few years.  We opened one in 2015 and then we closed it.  It needs to be opened up every year and should include a certain number of people.  It might need to be based on criteria but that is down to the market to decide.  It needs to be opened up every year to allow people to come through.  It will never grow because much of the time it just gets fed scraps.  Nothing that gets fed scraps will grow and prosper.  There is a huge market we can look at that is evident in the European market.  The existing Food Wise strategy does not include organics.  It is not even mentioned.  What can I say because it is not even there?  It would be nice if the new strategy group could get it included in the Food Wise strategy.  </p> <p>  Germany is aiming for 20% organic production.  Sweden is already at over 15% and Estonia is at 18%.  It goes on.  These countries are not growing organics for any other reason than that the market is there and it helps them to meet their climate change targets.  They are doing it to achieve environmental targets and avoid paying fines.  To me, it is a win-win situation.  It is not a pre-industrial revolution type of farming system.  There is massive innovation in it and much more can be done.  A lot more research could be done on organics.  Quite a lot needs to happen.  Hopefully it will be pooled together by the new strategic group.  Around the Paris basin areas, when they are tackling pollution under the Water Framework Directive and specifically in compliance with the Nitrates Directive, they use organics to do it.  They are targeting their organics in those areas because they have a problem.  In Denmark, 8% of all retail sales are organic.  It has grown the organic sector because it had a nitrates problem.  That is what started much of the change to organics in the first place and then suddenly it caught on.  They asked themselves what was not to like about it and decided to push it even further.  Denmark is doing a fantastic job on it now.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny asked about imported feed.  Organics is currently importing 9,000 tonnes of feed a year; it needs 10,000 ha extra just to meet the current demand.  It is not all for animal feed; breweries, bakeries, distillers and beer production are also concerned.  There is a bigger range of products involved, much of which need feed.  The bulk of that feed is not necessarily grown in the UK but is shipped via the UK.  Brexit will cause a problem with that so we desperately need tillage here.  We are looking at a &euro;700 to &euro;800 gross margin on tillage.  In terms of its economic viability, tillage is a very attractive option.  We import 55% of our vegetables, most of which are potatoes and cabbages, not only citrus fruits.  In organics, the figure is 72%.  Our organisation is just about to launch a European innovation partnership, EIP, as the lead partner.  It will be the first market orientated EIP that has ever been done, which is great, so hopefully we will succeed.  It will look at the supply and demand of vegetables versus retail demand.  It is a three-year project that will kick off in June.  We are looking to get a collaborative group of organic horticulturists, from Donegal to Wexford, to produce as if they were one farm and to use their different geographical locations.  By taking advantage of the difference in soil type and conditions, they can supply the retail demand.  There is huge potential there.  The Bord Bia figures are accurate but are not broken down into organic and conventional product.  We estimate that we are importing somewhere in the region of &euro;26 million worth of products.  They are products we can grow here.  I am not talking about citrus fruits; I am talking about products we can grow here.  There is a massive increase; 46% of organic food is sold through the discounters so it is not a niche market anymore.  It is not expensive.  It is slightly more expensive.  The farmer gets a better farm gate price and he should be applauded for that because it is a viable price.  </p> <p>  In terms of the Brexit crisis and the projection for the beef and dairy sectors in three years' time and whether we have thought it through and how we will work and fit within organics, the farming method is recognised but it needs more ranges of products and it certainly needs more processors.  There is a monopoly on processors.  We will not bring it up here but everybody knows it.  In the beef trade, there is one main processor who is earning a lot.  I am not saying it is a negative thing but everything needs competition for it to be healthy.  We have concentrated an awful lot on just beef.  We do not really even have a market for our organic lamb.  We need more ranges of products.  When there is a bigger range of products, as we are finding now, the retailers will use more products.  There is a lovely little organic shop down in Tralee, which the committee might know of, and it does a fantastic range of different products from its own farm.  That is what starts to increase sales.  If one has a shop only selling beef, not many people will go in, but if it is selling a whole range of products, it will boost the whole sector.  There are huge opportunities within the organic sector.  </p> <p>  I do not want to get into the science now  because I did not refer to it in my submission, but in terms of organics and what happens next, a 90% nitrogen load comes from agriculture into the sea, as was mentioned earlier.  It has been reported that the pollution comes from agriculture.</p><p>For example, shellfish from class A shellfish water may be exported or otherwise must go through declaration and such processes.  As earlier stated, if one can reduce pollution in terms of inputs such as nitrogen fertiliser, which is sometimes not a very efficient use of nitrogen, class A shellfish waters can be maintained.  These systems are all interlinked.</p><p> There has been over 33% growth in organics in the Irish market in the past 24 months.  I accept that it started from a low base but it is improving and the retailers with whom we have discussed this have very ambitious targets for the future.  One of the reasons for those ambitious targets is the fact that they are spending a little more.  An organic grower does not have to and will not supply below cost price.  A processor, packer or anything else of organic products must pay the right price if they want to be able to label a product as organic, and we should strongly encourage that.  Growers should stand strong in terms of pricing and should not sell the product if they do not achieve the price they require.</p><p> There has been double digit growth in organic products across the EU in recent years and growers cannot keep up with demand.  The current EU capacity for organic sales is a little more than &euro;32 billion and has increased tenfold in recent years.  Consumers are now far more aware of the virtues of organic foods and their benefits in terms of the environment.  What is not to like about organic produce?  It is a win-win.</p><p> Deputy Pringle made the point that organic farmers state there is little point having Irish farmers dramatically change their approach only to result in insignificant or possibly no impact on a global problem.  That is not what we were suggesting.  I cut my initial address short and apologise if the point I made in that regard was unclear.  We suggest having a whole food system.  For example, if there is much emphasis on farmers to reduce emissions, that impacts on agriculture, but if a farmer reduces the amount of fertiliser he or she uses, the contribution goes to the benefit of industry such as manufacturing rather than agriculture.  There must be an incentive such that it is worth people's while to reduce emissions because otherwise they will be put at a loss to achieve certain targets.  We have exponentially increased our use of plastic packaging over the past ten years and that is rightly getting much media attention.  I have the figures in that regard in my office but do not have it with me.  If a farmer is going to be forced to destock or take other measures to meet climate change mitigation but the industry keeps wrapping everything in plastic, that mitigates the benefit of the measures taken at an agricultural level.  The plastic is of no value because it just goes into landfill and produces methane which we do not attempt to capture.  That is the point I was trying to convey in my initial address and I apologise if I was unclear in that regard.</p><p> We need a coherent strategy within a food system.  That is a big ask and may be somewhat idealistic but we need a far more coherent system in terms of how we look at food.  Should agriculture be responsible for all mitigating measures?  A farmer can get a contractor to come to his or her farm and, therefore, not have a resultant carbon footprint contribution, but if the farmer uses his or her own machinery to harvest his or her own crops, he or she will be liable for such carbon footprint contribution.  That is an example of incentivising in the wrong way and fudging the figures.  There must be better encouragement of sustainable farming and also, more importantly, of food and sustainable diets.  I am not saying to eat less meat but, rather, to eat better quality meat and pay more for it.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly asked about an organic solution to the problem of climate change.  Organic produce has a significance in terms of food tourism.  It is a high-value product with a very positive image.  Some 86% of aquaculture here is organic, and that is used to market those products to the European market.  It is interesting that very little of that product is sold in Ireland.  There is an awful lot behind an organic label or logo in terms of what it means.</p><p> Deputy Healy-Rae asked about diesel vehicles and the use of such machinery.  We must encourage more use of the circular economy such as increased use of biogas and such products from anaerobic digestion.  There is a large plant in Donegal that will soon produce some interesting results in terms of biogas production.  We must foster a circular economy.</p><p> As regards how worried we are about the 2040 plan and the targets that must be achieved by 2030, farmers should see it as a golden opportunity.  Irish agriculture has an image of producing environmentally friendly produce and farmers should prove that is so and get it right.  If a farmer can get a better farm income, slightly destock, reduce fertiliser use etc. and farm within the capacity of his or her farmland, there is the potential for a win-win.  The plan need not be viewed in a negative light.</p><p> As regards the point made by Dr. O'Mara regarding fertiliser use, there is research on emissions in terms of product per yield gap in terms of per kilo and per hectare product.  I mean no disrespect to Teagasc, which does an excellent job, but the argument it has made is part of the problem and is almost a skewing of the figures.  If we get rid of mineral fertiliser, that would lead to an 18% reduction in EU agricultural emissions, although that does not account for the yield reduction that would arise.  I do not suggest that all farmers should go organic but, rather, am just putting forth a hypothetical scenario.  In terms of the EU greenhouse gas emission inventories and targets, such reductions would be accounted for under industries such as the fertiliser industry but not in agriculture.  To reduce mineral fertiliser use, the actual use of which is 45% of the total EU nitrogen input, would be to reduce soil-bound nitrous oxide emissions by 45%, or 20% of total EU agricultural emissions.  One would have to add in alternative sources such as lagoons for nitrogen fixing and so on.  However, it would result in a 10% reduction overnight should that be implemented.  I am not suggesting the committee should favour that because it would be bad for our business but if we were genuine about tackling the issue, it could be done.</p></speech>

Teagasc is doing so through measures such as trying to get the maximum value out of slurry and using nitrogen fixing clover where appropriate.  We have a big research programme into the incorporation of clover in pastures and the judicious use of nitrogen fertilisers.  Nobody wants to waste nitrogen fertilisers because they cost a lot of money and can contribute to environmental issues in terms of both water quality and greenhouse gas emissions.  We are looking at how we can reduce the inputs of nitrogen fertilisers into our intensive systems.  If one took nitrogen fertiliser out of the equation, it would reduce emissions, although possibly not to the same extent in Ireland as in the EU as a whole, but there would be a dramatic impact on the level of production in the country.  It would drop by more than the 18% reduction in emissions, which would affect the carbon footprint.  However, Ms Westbrook is not suggesting we do all of that.</p></speech>

I am a dairy farmer who converted to organic in 2015.  I was quite an intensive farmer and using the maximum amount of nitrogen permitted.  I started off milking 35 cows in 2004, moved up to 160 cows in 2015 and then decided to go organic because I believe it is a huge step in the right direction in regard to climate change.  A big part of the problem in Ireland is that we are far too dependent on the <i>status quo</i>.  In the dairy and other sectors of agriculture we are trying to maintain things as they are, but that will not be possible because there will be constant pressure on farmers from outside sources and we will be fighting an uphill battle.  We are going against the prevailing energy.  The industry is looking at and being driven by CO<sub>2</sub>emissions per kilo of food, which is a blinkered approach and takes no account of water pollution, soil degradation or biodiversity loss.  Critics will say and are saying that to claim that we are the most efficient dairy or beef producer in this system is akin to saying we have the most efficient coal-producing stations.  We are playing into the hands of those who say plant protein is a far more efficient way of producing protein.  We are also playing into the hands of producers in North America who say that they are reducing their emissions per kilo of food through the use of hormones.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, when considered per euro of food, we are the least efficient.  None of these hits the point.  We can cherry-pick statistics but, ultimately, we will need to align ourselves with productivity.  The last century was all about output.  On my farm, we made dramatic increases in output.  What is productivity?  It is output per unit of input.  Biodiversity loss and soil degradation are all real input costs.  They are externalities at the moment; farmers are not paying for them.  However, we will have to pay for them and we have to align ourselves with this.  There is no point in fooling ourselves that it will be otherwise.  The more we are aligned with this, the more successful we will be.</p><p> What have I done on my farm?  Mr. Kent mentioned diverse pastures.  In recent years, UCD carried out smart grass trials that produced a 90% reduction in methane emissions.  While that has not been greatly publicised, it is absolutely massive.  The concept of smart grass was devised over 100 years ago.  It is all about putting more carbon into soils because they are deeper rooted plants.  We are vastly underestimating the amount of carbon we can sequester into our soils because we are working from a limited point of view in not looking beyond a rye grass monoculture.  We are in this box.  This is constructive criticism.  There is a massive lack of research into organic and biological farming and this is really holding the industry back.  Diverse pastures have a huge role to play.</p><p> The issue of whether we can produce enough protein came up.  I have no doubt that we can do so.  It does not all have to be in grains.  Dr. O'Mara mentioned that roughly 20% of the dairy diet is in concentrate form and approximately half of that is imported.  If a cow eats 5.5 tonnes, more than 1 tonne of it is in concentrates.  That can be vastly reduced by using good management practices as developed in Moorepark.  It is much lower than that; it can be down at 250 kg or 300 kg.  There is scope to produce all our food and become GM free.  If we really want to go about this, we can do it.</p><p> There is a big misconception - it will be overcome in the next few years - that organic is low-output farming.  However, to my mind it is more productive farming.  Research on red clover by Teagasc in Grange produced 15 tonnes of dry matter per year over three-year trials.  In Moorepark, plot trials on white clover produced over 13 tonnes.  All of this was with zero nitrogen inputs.  The same applies to smart grass.  As a result of the fact that there are a lot of legumes in the sward, nitrogen will limit the production of the sward.  We can do much more but, unfortunately, there is a major lack of research into this because there is no industry benefit.  No one other than farmers will make money from this.</p><p> The real solutions to the issues of climate change lie in management and it will come from farmers.  Unfortunately, it is not being promoted.  Due to the fact that we are living in a world of information technology and the Internet, it is gathering pace and it will happen despite the lack of research being done and despite all of this.  I am very positive that it will happen.</p><p> I meet farmers every day.  I know many people who are moving towards biological organic farming even though there is no scheme in place.  A good analogy is back in the 1990s when the Irish dairy industry was very cow-centred.  We had a relative breeding index, RBI, system which rewarded just production or output.  Everyone thought of 2,000-gallon cows.  The whole system was going that way.  I accept that Teagasc was also promoting that system.  Eventually, pressure from farmers, including those who had come back from New Zealand and had seen a different, more grass-orientated approach, built up to the point where we changed how we managed dairy farming in Ireland and we took a more grass-centred approach.</p><p> An even bigger revolution is happening at the moment.  We are taking a step further back and are looking at soil.  It will be farmer driven because the research is stuck in a box and cannot see outside that box at the moment.  I have no doubt they will come in line in the coming years.  Most of the problems lie with nitrogen fertiliser.  We can do without it if we start putting the proper research into it.</p><p> Slurry was mentioned a few times.  On my farm, I am fermenting slurry.  It is possible to add humates to slurry.  Humates are binding up the nitrogen.  It is possible to add humates to nitrogen fertiliser.  Not enough is being done in promoting that.  A lot of work is being done on nitrate inhibitors.  These are all industry motivated; there is money to be made from them.  However, the things that do not generate money are not happening.  Humates with nitrogen-reduction programmes have been shown to be successful in America and Australia.  There is a massive revolution of biological farmers in these countries where they are vastly reducing their nitrogen inputs and still out-producing the conventional farms in those countries.</p><p> The same applies to feed additives, in respect of which there is also much research.  Again, it has been largely industry motivated.  Seaweed minerals have been shown to reduce methane emissions by 100%.  This is a natural resource that we have all around our shores.  We are ignoring the obvious solutions.</p><p> Forestry is being greatly promoted as a way of offsetting.  Again, I think this is a flawed approach.  While it is not quite monoculture, it will lead to other problems.  Trees are all growing at the same stage in close proximity and there is no undergrowth.  We have seen phosphorus problems in water because we are just bleeding phosphorus from the soil where there is no understorey and trees at different stages.  We are just creating the next problem if we do not take a balanced approach.</p><p> Organic farming and a biological approach to farming will be the biggest single biggest factor.  It is what we have to do.  Agriculture of this century is all about becoming efficient with our inputs while maintaining productivity.  I have a very positive outlook if we embrace that.</p></speech>

While I do not agree with everything he said, there is much very positive stuff from the industry.  Some of the work we are doing in the Dairy Sustainability Ireland initiative goes back to the first principles Mr. McHugh has outlined.  Before we even address the climate change issue, we need to go back to the first principles of what is happening in water quality in our land.  We have a brilliant story of water quality in our land in our industry, but it is declining.  Our reputation is based on getting that back up and the soil is at the heart of that through nutrient management programmes, growing more grass, getting more profitability for farmers and reducing fertiliser inputs.  The fundamental piece is behavioural change for farmers and that they get more income.  I am lucky enough to be working in the dairy industry.  For the record I am also an organic beef farmer; Ms Westbrook can check her organisation's records.</p></speech>

It is a bit like veganism; each to their own on the organic piece.  No one size fits all.  Based on the tenets the various witnesses today have espoused it is clear that most of us are working in the right direction.  The Dairy Sustainability Ireland initiative is the first involving every individual dairy company, all the farm organisations relevant to dairy and all the State organisations, including the EPA.  The EPA is not there for the craic.  I appreciate what Deputy Pringle has said in asking if it is green-washing and another version of Origin Green.  It cannot be.  We are being forced into this.  Almost 95% of our dairy produce is exported.  If we are to compete after Brexit, the companies -  Danone, Wyeth and Nestl&eacute; - that will buy those dairy products to go into ingredients need those sustainability credentials and not just talk about them.  Without profitable farmers in those 18,000 farms all over the island, we do not have a dairy industry.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about mitigation.  It will be slow at the start and will look at input management that will have a result in water improvements, etc.</p><p>However, leading on to that - and I think Mr. McHugh outlined some of the emerging technologies - if it is successful, then we will move to roll it out among the co-operatives and processors.  They are the ones who lead it down into farming.  Then we can roll on to solar panels.  We have seen what the European Investment Bank is doing in the Netherlands.  We are seeing anaerobic digestion technologies and we looked into seaweed technologies.  I assure the committee that when I saw the articles about the type of seaweed on the coral reef in Australia, I looked into the matter.  It is the only one that works thus far, with only one trial.  However, we are certainly looking at technological things that perhaps we can push through Dairy Sustainability Ireland because we have everyone in that.</p><p> In respect of Deputy Martin Kenny's question about extra grass instead of feed, that is a fundamental tenet and outcome of this Dairy Sustainability Ireland first phase initiative.  We are trying to grow more grass and go for more dry matter per hectare.  We are using Teagasc, other partnerships and science to try to drive that on and try to reduce it.</p></speech>

It is a difficult thing to measure so to count it would be difficult.  However, the challenge as to why we do not credit for it is a technical thing.  Something has to be done different now than was being done pre-1990 in order to get credit.  The grasslands were presumably sequestering carbon in the 1970s and 1980s, so they are only doing similar sequestration now.  We would need additional sequestration.  That is why forestry is additional sequestration.  It is one thing-----</p></speech>

That should be sufficient to draw down extra funding.  It would reduce our nitrogen inputs, increase our outputs and increase the carbon sequestration.  A little bit of chicory could be added.  I have done it myself very successfully.  There is a particular tool attachment for the back of a slurry tank, a Moscha swivel spout.  That should be passed for doing low emissions.  It is suitable for doing that rather than the trailing shoe systems, which are too far apart to do that.</p> <p>  I would have to award "man of the match" to Mr. McHugh.  It is a tremendous performance and a breath of fresh air.  This is where farming is going.  We have to measure farming not on yield per acre of product.  We going to have to have a yield of profit.  Some of the most profitable tillage farmers I know now are organic.  However, Ms Westbrook is going to have to get more members into the tillage end.  There are fantastic returns there.  On zero chemical inputs, there are returns from organic oats of &euro;900.  Barley is the same story.  There are guys spending &euro;400 on chemicals to get a &euro;50 profit - if that - from conventional farming, as we will call it now.</p> <p>  We have to go back to the drawing board with farming.  We need more research.  As an organisation, we are not pushing farmers to produce more because we have no vested interest in harvesting levies.  We just take a membership, so we tell it as it is.  The ICSA does not take levies.  We are not production oriented.  We want farmers to make more profit, we want sustainability and we want to keep farmers on the land.  In remote parts, farmers have had a very difficult last week.  I have visited farms in mountain areas and in lowland areas.  Sheds have fallen down and killed sheep.  There is going to have to be funding for some of these people.  They are in a vulnerable position.  Some people in the glasshouse industry talk about vegetable production.  There is a massive one in Wexford.  It just shows the vulnerability we have with climate.  It might be infrequent timewise but when it happens it is a disaster for the individuals involved.</p></speech>

I am representing industry here.  I come a background as an organic farmer.  I do believe that aspect either.  However, the farmer has to follow the money and the industry has to follow the money and the profitability.  I do a lot of work in Europe.  At the weekend I was stranded in Belgium and we saw organic milk in the supermarket.  It was about half the category but because it is commoditised, it is cheaper than regular milk.</p> <p>  We had a big debate in Ireland regarding Kerrygold butter from an overall GMO-free perspective.  I refer to the cost of getting all the farmers into GMO-free and organic and then seeing what would be the price of Kerrygold.  It is &euro;1.70 and organic labels are &euro;1.30.</p></speech>

The actual product that is GMO-free is not edible.  It is a terrible bland white product that could not be spread on bread.  We are not comparing like with like.  Kerrygold has only 3% GMO addition.  It is a fantastic product but we need to get a higher price for it.</p></speech>

At the start of quotas in 1983, our dairy industry was the same size as its counterpart in New Zealand.  We were held back for two generations by quotas.  We have been making great leaps forwards.  In the past three years, we have gone from 5.5 billion litres processed in 2015 to 7.5 billion litres this year.  Those extra litres are not commodity litres, they are bringing profits back to farms.</p> <p>  They have been borne out in terms of the work Teagasc has done on actual farm incomes.  The farmer with an average dairy herd is earning about &euro;70,000 a year versus what my father earns from an organic beef herd, about &euro;19,000 or &euro;20,000.  That is the CAP payment plus a bit of the organic payment.  It is a no-brainer.  If we want wealth for farming communities in every parish in Ireland, we have a massive advantage here.  We are the accredited lowest carbon emitter of dairy per kilogram produced.  Regardless of organic or non-organic, that is EU accredited.  It is something to be massively proud of, so we have to build on that and use some of Mr. McHugh's ideas across all farms.  I refer to the successes on farms and the work of Ms Westbrook and others.  We have to drive that on and use some of the lessons Mr. McHugh has highlighted in order to get all farmers - even those who want to go the conventional route - up and running.</p> <p>  In respect of Brexit, what is happening is depressing.  We are supposed to be discussing climate change but I am of the view that the Irish dairy industry will ride Brexit out.  This year, we are projecting that over 50% of Irish dairy will go beyond the EU and the UK.  It will cause us damage but I think we have such a good competitive advantage, because of our grass-based system, we are probably going to ride it out.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked about the potential for organic dairy.   In the industry, we think there is a fabulous organic opportunity for farmers like Mr. McHugh and other farmers around Ireland.  One of our members does an organic product and they cannot get the organic skim and organic base.  They are gone to Denmark to get it and they are manufacturing it in Ireland and exporting it.</p></speech>

In fairness, Aurivo is making strides in the north west with the organic brand allotted from its An Grian&aacute;n factory farm.  That is its only real factory farm in Ireland.  It is an accredited organic farm.  However, it will take a cluster of farms to build on Ms Westbrook's piece to see if it is an opportunity for us.  I refer especially to higher value.  It all about achieving higher value to make sure the money will go back to the farmer.</p> <p>  On Deputy Danny Healy Rae's contribution, I disagree with some of his argumentation, but as a countryman, I agree with a lot of it.  As to why we should be taking the sustainability initiative seriously, we are moving to a stage where for every 20 litres of milk we produce on the island, 19 will have to be got off our rock.  The Germans, Africans, Chinese and Brazilians who are looking to buy milk in Kenmare, Kilgarvan or Ballinasloe need to have the production certified.  They need proof that what we are claiming about our green credentials has been certified as sustainable not only by Dairy Industry Ireland or even Teagasc and Bord Bia but also by third parties.  For us to be able to sell to my man in Baghdad, the company needs to see evidence to prove what we are claiming, that it is organic or whatever else, and that it has been certified by third parties.</p></speech>

I fully understand members are busy; after all, this is their workplace.  </p> <p>  The ASTI appreciates the opportunity to be present.  It welcomes the space the meeting affords the teaching profession to communicate its views to legislators.  That is something we value and we would like to think it will be sustained into the future.  It is not something every other organisation enjoys.  It is very important that we communicate that message.  I know that the committee has received our submission, but members may not have had an opportunity to read it in detail.  The two core messages are that there must be more richness in our assessment and that there must be a greater spread of the assessment load across the school year, but we must also ensure the State examinations are assessed by the State Examinations Commission.  That is the only way we can have the quality assurance and control the system has enjoyed to date.  They are the two key message in our submission.</p> <p>  In the time available to me I wish to make two or three points.  This discussion is actually timely because 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the commission on the points system which, as members know, was a seminal event in looking at assessment and examinations in our system.  The commission made a number of recommendations, two of which are germane to our discussion.  First, it strongly argued for the retention of external assessment for the leaving certificate examinations but equally strongly recommended that more diverse modes of assessment be introduced to supplement the written examinations.  Since the publication of the report in 2001, all of the reviews of the subject and programmes that have taken place have heeded that recommendation.  For example, in the case of Irish and modern foreign languages, there are oral and aural examinations which form part of the overall mark in the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  There is project work in the case of history and geography.  In the case of home economics, students get to demonstrate that they can cook as part of the examination.  In the practical subjects of music, art, technology and science there are practical and performance tasks to be performed.  The practical assessment for leaving certificate science subjects will come on stream.  Therefore, in the case of practical work which is spread over time, there is continuous assessment under the examination system.  When the assessment is for the purposes of the State examinations, it is not conducted by the teacher but by the State Examinations Commission.  That system has merit and stability, but more to the point and most important from the point of view of education, there is quality control.  It is objective, fair and transparent.  </p> <p>  State examinations are meant to tell society a number of things, core among which is that they tell the student and his or her family how he or she has progressed in his or her learning, but they are also tell society how individuals and the system as a whole are progressing.  The view of the ASTI has always been, since time immemorial, that because of the role played by the State examinations, the assessment must remain located in the State Examinations Commission.</p> <p>  By international standards, we have a high performing education system.  The last PISA, programme for international student assessment, report found that of the 37 OECD countries, Ireland was third in literacy levels, which is really amazing when we are being compared with countries that have hundreds of times the population of Ireland.  Ireland was 13th in the case of science and mathematics.  By international evidence, we have a high performing education system with good quality control.</p></speech>

Assessment in schools takes three forms: formative, which takes place in schools every day, for example, in the marking of homework, copies, etc; the summative assessment, which is used to measure the breadth and depth of knowledge acquired, for example, in the State examinations at the end of the year; and diagnostic testing to measure the capacity of a student to carry out tasks, for example, aptitude or special needs testing.  Each of these forms of assessment takes place frequently in schools.  By its nature, formative assessment is continuous.</p> <p>  It should be noted that in the State examinations additional forms of assessment, as Ms Leydon said, take place in many subjects in the leaving certificate examinations.  They are embedded in the new revised junior cycle programme.  For example, oral and practical tests take place in many language and practical subjects.  Of the 32 curricular subjects in the leaving certificate programme, 17 have a mixture of assessment components, between the terminal examination and the practicals, the orals, the aurals and course work.  All of the recently revised junior cycle subject specifications have a second assessment component which is assessed by the State Examinations Commission.  They enable students to demonstrate wider abilities than could be shown in a written examination alone.</p><p>We are not fully through that procedure yet and all the subjects are not on stream but as that happens, parents and students will see that a lot more.</p><p> The suggestion is sometimes made that continuous assessment reduces student stress.  However, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, believes that there is a real risk that continuous assessment would simply lead to students experiencing continuous stress with no breaks between assessments.  Furthermore, it should be noted that an excess of assessments can infringe on time to learn and explore topics of interest.</p><p> There are potentially significant risks arising from the use of continuous assessment in the State examinations.  These include the reputational risk to the existing, widely respected system, to which Ms Leydon has referred, risk to student contact time and the risk of over-assessment.</p><p> It is also worth noting that the Department for Education in England has recently moved away from continuous assessment for the purposes of the lower secondary education, the general certificate of secondary education, GCSE.  This move was largely motivated by fears about a lack of rigour in the assessments and also because continuous assessment can cause difficulties if students move school during the junior cycle and it also causes difficulty for adult learners who return to do the junior cycle or the leaving certificate on a part-time basis.</p><p> Teachers already operate a system that is superior, we believe, than continuous assessment and that is formative assessment.  Formative assessment is where students are given feedback on a daily basis so they can learn from that as opposed to continuous assessment where they hand up a piece of work and they do not get feedback on that piece of work.  It is also embedded in the new junior cycle, as I have said.</p><p> The structure and the content of courses designed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, typically take full account of the variety of assessment modes that are available and of the need to equip students for a world that is ever-changing.</p><p> The TUI asks the committee to note that any ill-advised introduction of a continuous assessment could undermine public trust in both the junior cycle, which we are currently just halfway through and the leaving certificate.  This would have adverse implications on the approximately.</p><p> In conclusion, TUI believes that any move towards continuous assessment system could negatively affect the quality and the reputation of the Irish public education system.</p></speech>

The USI welcomes the joint committee's investigation of the potential use of the continuous assessment model in State examinations.  USI has worked for many years on issues of quality and enhancement of education, primarily at third level, but has often taken a view of the need for wider educational reform.  USI is broadly supportive of the efforts at third level and especially at higher education in regard to continuous assessment, recognising and championing the need to develop a model of student partnership and we are eager to see efforts expand beyond the post-secondary sector.</p> <p>  The committee should be aware that USI has largely approached this submission from the view of third level and specifically higher education, and throughout the submission we have attempted to highlight the significant need for a more joined up approach to educational reform in Ireland.  Each phase - primary, lower and upper secondary and tertiary - cannot continue to be reformed in silos.  Further, consultation and input from students, staff and relevant organisations, and the public, should be facilitated in a more informative and collaborative way if we are to truly understand continuous assessment and the need for it.</p> <p>  The topic of continuous assessment across State examination presents an opportunity to do that.  I draw the committee's attention to the three key priorities that we listed in the overview, namely, that the committee should formulate a clear view of the value of continuous assessment, rather than view it as an international pressure; that the committee should embrace the opportunity to consult on this issue in a way that is inclusive of students, parents, and practitioners; and that the committee should utilise this opportunity to focus on transition from one phase of education to another, with continuous assessment as a key enabler to a successful transition, retention and student success.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I want to reiterate something in the submission, namely, that the senior cycle review currently being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and its relationship to this work needs to be carefully considered.  I also want to encourage the committee to involve the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU, in this work.  USI and ISSU enjoy a strong partnership and that represents a key opportunity to look at how that holistic and joined up approach to educational reform can be undertaken.</p></speech>

We welcome efforts to evaluate and adjust current practices and examination methods within the education system to better reflect the talents and achievements of students and to better prepare them for further education and their future lives and careers.</p> <p>  While fully accepting that some method is required to assess the knowledge that students gain through their post primary education, the current system is primarily based on one-off testing, namely, the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  This reflects more as a memory test mostly suited to rote learning rather than genuinely assessing a student&rsquo;s learning, knowledge, ability or acumen for a subject.</p> <p>  Indeed, many studies and informed discussions suggest that ongoing assessment has very significant value towards students learning and engagement while also being a better tool to establish the true depth of a student&rsquo;s knowledge.</p> <p>  Through nurturing a student&rsquo;s strengths and interests our education system can create self-motivated thinkers who learn and understand the benefits of discovery through research and evaluation.  Assessment methods should enable and examine a student&rsquo;s true depth of knowledge, overall ability and critical thinking on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  NPCpp is also concerned that the current system of evaluation maximises stress on students who often memorise to regurgitate in a moment and then forget.  It does little for many towards assisting their learning or retained knowledge.  Once off examination can be brutal instruments undertaken at a particularly stressful time in most children&rsquo;s lives and does not sufficiently assess a student&rsquo;s overall performance and learning during their time at school.</p> <p>  Indeed, from the calls received from parents and sometimes students themselves, it would appear that exam anxiety is a very common reality in teenagers and to some students and their parents can be quite devastating.  This was also highlighted to us in calls to the helpline we had in place last summer.</p> <p>  Significant stress in teenage students definitely occurs as a result of the anxiety caused by the current method of assessment and the pressurised study regime that derives from it.  Educational or work opportunities associated with the outcome of the exam, the students' self-esteem with regards to their grades, judgments from friends, family and teachers in relation to their performance are among the main causes of stress in teenagers reported to us.  Comparisons to friends and siblings based on once off exam results are also feared.  Let us not forget that the stress the students are under can and does reflect on their families as well.</p> <p>  NPCpp acknowledge that some changes have already been made and that some subjects already utilise forms of continuous assessment and project works and believe that, where this is the case, there is wide acceptance of the benefits towards fairness and better evaluation.</p> <p>  NPCpp affirms that our curriculum and method of assessment should be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure that our education system is fit for purpose and delivering fairly.  Changes, when made in subjects, curriculum and assessment methods, etc., need to be regularly reviewed to ensure that they actually deliver the benefits as envisaged and will require constant updating to retain relevance in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing world and to ensure that Ireland remains to the fore in quality education.</p> <p>  In summary, NPCpp believes that the current examination method is not fully serving our children to their maximum potential and our education system, curriculum and methods of assessment particularly, must be reviewed and changed to incorporate increased levels of continuous assessment, to ensure that it is delivering what every child in our country deserves - a quality education that prepares him or her for his or her future life.  We also acknowledge the changes cannot happen overnight and that significant investment will have to be injected by government in developing continuous assessment methods and further teacher training will ensure continuous assessments completed by students are free from plagiarism and are carried out in modern and fully equipped school environments.  We owe it to our young people to ensure that best practice is employed in our assessment methods of their learning and ultimately benefits all the people of Ireland and our nation.</p></speech>

Our opening statement and contributions to the discussion are based and are heavily informed by the written submissions we understand the committee has already received from our colleagues in UCC, UCD, NUI Galway and the University of Limerick.</p><p>This opening statement and our contributions to the discussion are based on and heavily informed by the written submissions we understand the joint committee has already received from our colleagues in UCC, UCD, the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick.  Our aim today is simply to highlight some of the main potential benefits and risks for the State examinations system that may be associated with continuous assessment and to list some of the most important enabling measures and conditions that we see as being needed for continuous assessment to be used in State exams in pursuit of the overall goals of the State's education and skills strategies and policies.</p><p> Continuous assessment is, very simply, a way to ensure that all learners have opportunities to succeed.  This is what teachers do every day in their classrooms and good teachers do it very well.  By continually observing learners, monitoring what they know and can do, teachers can ensure all learners are making progress in a holistic way, irrespective of the type of examination system in place.  With the high stakes terminal leaving certificate examinations currently in place in Ireland, it means much of this good practice is often sacrificed in order to prepare for the exam.</p><p> Regular, ongoing assessment also means that teachers can use a range of assessment tools and methods to assess learners in a variety of different ways, developing confidence in their knowledge of what the learners know and can do.  Research indicates that this allows for much greater flexibility in teaching and learning and provides a more accurate and robust overview of student progress and performance than methods that provide a single "snapshot" through formal examination.</p><p> There are particular benefits that continuous assessment can bring to the well-being of students.  It is likely to reduce the pressure associated with preparing for final exams, for example, and continuous assessment gives a better rounded and nuanced profile of the student over time.  If correctly designed, it can play to a student's interests and strengths.  Continuous assessment activities focus on student understanding rather than their ability to memorise.  Assessment should require learners to think, express their thoughts and demonstrate their skills.  This enables learners to display a much deeper understanding than if they were simply memorising information for a test.  This greater emphasis on skills related to critical thinking, reflection, teamwork and creativity are appropriately assessed over a continuum in time and through multiple methods.  A consistent critique of high stakes one-off examinations is the narrowing impact on what and how students learn.</p><p> With respect to risks, there is certainly a risk to the integrity of the exam system and a number of measures would need to be put in place to counter that potential risk.  There is a serious risk around validity, reliability and consistency in examinations across the many thousands of teachers who would need to be involved and the different assessment measures.  A rigorous and comprehensive external monitoring and moderation process organised by the Department and the State Examinations Commission would be needed if we move to this sort of system.  There would need to be much initial training, continuing professional development, ongoing support and resources, including the necessary time to allow teachers to engage with this successfully. </p><p> There has been much recent positive change to the junior certificate and there is an impetus for change at the senior cycle.  However, the junior cycle reform is still a work in progress and there is no data, as of yet, on the effectiveness or experiences arising from these classroom-based assessments.  We need some rigorous investigation and research into international best practice, including the various forms of assessment that could be best used in the leaving certificate context.  This would involve consulting with a wide range of stakeholders and bringing them on board.</p></speech>

Continuous assessment, <i>per se</i>, will not be a panacea or a one-size-fits-all solution.  Much appropriate training and development will be needed but there are very good models in further and higher education about how this can be managed over time very successfully, with good external quality assurance and monitoring mechanisms.  We would be delighted to engage with the committee further in these matters.</p></speech>

I have a great interest in the area, and not necessarily in the context of the current debate on some of the proposed reforms of the leaving certificate.  It relates to students' anxiety, stress and mental health.  It even starts as young as primary school, as we see children worrying about spelling tests on Fridays.  Children tend to compare themselves with other children from a very young age and feel they are not good enough or cannot do something as well as another student.  That can stay with a person and it is a constant battle to try to build children's confidence.</p> <p>  I am not questioning the quality of teaching or the curriculum of the leaving certificate but I question the way we currently assess students.  It is not a fair system and it is weighted in favour of students who might come from a more affluent background and may be able to afford grinds or extra support.  If students are in any way panicked or stressed, or if they suffer from anxiety at all, it will be exacerbated during exams.  Most of us would know many people who say the leaving certificate was one of the worst if not the worst experience of their life.  I include myself in that.  If we have a system like that, it is clearly failing.</p> <p>  Continuous assessment does not necessarily need to be from fourth year onwards but we could look at the model in some colleges, where 60% of marks are awarded for exams and 40% comes from continuous assessment.  A student must pass the exam in order to pass a particular subject.  I do not see the difficulty with it being run by the State Examinations Commission.  Some teachers take issue with being the person who must assess a student constantly and the fairness in it.  It is a reasonable point.  We need to move from the model of having just one exam.  Depending on subject choice and day on which the exam takes place, a student might study for two years but have everything examined in four or five days.  If exams start on a Wednesday, all the exams might be completed by the following Wednesday.  With other subject choices, there might be a gap of a week in which a student can study.  It is completely unfair as it currently stands.</p> <p>  Would a level of continuous assessment be a fairer way of examining students?  If not, what would the witnesses suggest as a change to the current leaving certificate?  There are many stories and everybody knows the level of stress and anxiety in students.  People cannot say it does not have an impact on students when it does.  Mr. Browne made the point that there is an effect on families as well.  It is becoming clearer every year.  It does not help that when the leaving certificate examinations start, there is hype in the media about the number of students doing it and what they thought of the first English paper.  We should not have any of that as we are constantly drawing attention to it.  On the day of the results, there are one or two people with six or seven A grades, which is great for them, but that does not reflect the majority of people.  Students who may already doubt themselves and have issues of confidence and anxiety will look at them and see somebody else who is again better than them.  We know there are major mental health issues with young people.  I am not saying this is the only reason for it but it is a major and increasing factor.</p> <p>  If the witnesses could change one element of the current leaving certificate structure, what would it be?  What should be done differently from a mental health perspective?  For example, I know some schools practise mindfulness, doing it for maybe five or ten minutes every day.  I know we must consider resources and what can be done but there are practical ways to try to address the mental health issues of students.</p></speech>

Is there evidence to support the contrary view?  Given their already burdensome schedule, will teachers be able to appropriately grade or correct additional assignments?

It is important that the committee feeds into the work being done on the leaving certificate examination by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  I share the concerns expressed by previous speakers about the stress experienced by young people.  The leaving certificate places great emphasis on the final written examination.  As Ms Leydon and Ms Irwin stated, there is also an element of assessment in the oral examinations and so forth but it is primarily based on the final written examination.  This approach places severe pressure on young people, especially those who are not particularly strong in written examinations.  The system should be modified to make it fairer to young people with different skills, for example, co-operative and critical thinking skills.  How can we advance this objective?</p> <p>  I have history in this area as I have sat across a table from some of the witnesses.  I know the teaching unions must negotiate on behalf of their members.  I had a particularly interesting experience working with the higher education sector on modifying grading systems and so forth.  I am interested in hearing the views of the teaching unions on the new grading systems for the leaving certificate. </p> <p>  The recently introduced junior cycle reforms were negotiated.  I am interested in how teachers, students and parents are responding to these changes.  I remember attending a meeting in Kilkenny facilitated by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the 2000s while serving as an opposition spokesperson on education.  Representatives of the Irish Second-Level Students Union to which Mr. Hassan referred attended and provided feedback from second level school students.  We have not made much progress in the intervening years.  How do we move forward and reduce the severe pressure on school pupils?  I do not know what the witnesses' views are but I find league tables appalling.  We need to move away from measuring schools' success on the basis of the percentage of students who progress to higher education because there are many other pathways available to school leavers.</p> <p>  In its written submission, the Irish Universities Association refers to mitigating risks and ensuring continuous assessment has robust criteria defined in sets of standardised but flexible rubrics.  It also refers to making learning and teaching outcomes visible for students, staff and parents and making teaching and learning accountable.  It notes that a terminal examination system can be shrouded in secrecy and normative assessment.  I presume this is the point Deputy Funchion was making when she argued that people from certain backgrounds have an advantage in written examinations. </p> <p>  All of us, from all backgrounds, agree that we need to modify the system in some way to reduce pressure on students and achieve formative results of assessment and focus on engaging with students in the learning process.  This may not be primarily the examination function of assessment, if one likes, but we need to be able to offer feedback to students.  The NCCA's written submission refers to processes and outcomes of learning.  Rather than judging young people, education is supposed to be about the process of learning and facilitating young people to become lifelong learners.  These may be somewhat abstract points.  How can we move forward to achieve something better for all students, not only those who are good at written examinations or can afford to pay for grinds or repeat the leaving certificate?</p></speech>

No one here is more experienced than she is in the area of education.  All speakers made valid points.  I note that 50% of students now take grinds, which surely mitigates against those who come from a disadvantaged or vulnerable background.  This must be borne in mind.</p> <p>  It is interesting to note in the written submissions and the views expressed by those representing teachers and students a divergence of opinion on this matter.  We all want students to have a positive, holistic experience of education.  We want them to be educated for life and helped to learn the skills and resilience they will need to find employment and live their lives.</p> <p>  Ms Leydon referred to benchmarking the Irish system against the systems of other European countries and noted that we are doing well in the PISA rankings.  While it is important to benchmark, would transitioning to continuous assessment facilitate effective benchmarking against other European countries?  Would such a transition and enabling greater student engagement have a significant impact on early school leaving?  I expect it would.  It is very important that we should not focus only on students who will do well in the points system but also support those who are at the bottom of the class, so to speak, in terms of achievement and attainment.  Does the current educational model impact on the use and take-up of new technology?  I expect that it probably does.  Does the system have the capacity to make the transition to continuous assessment?  What needs to be done in this regard, both in the system and in terms of teacher training?  I acknowledge that this will cause great upheaval for students and teachers.</p> <p>  I propose to open the discussion again to stakeholders.  I will take speakers in the order in which they indicate.  We will then have a second round of questions from members. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Irwin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#H00400"><p>I will make a few brief points.  Like Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I know exactly what it was like to get the junior cycle to where it is now and it is not yet fully on stream.  As my colleague pointed out, it will be a number of years before we see the effect of classroom based assessments.  Every subject will have two classroom based assessments taken during the year.  Students will have an assessment task that is marked by the State Examinations Commission.  In a way, they will have experienced a form of continuous assessment.  It will take a long time to embed this in the system, which will be necessary before we make changes to the senior cycle.</p> <p>  On the issue of anxiety and stress, from my experience of teaching in further education where all courses are taught through continuous assessment - I have taught students aged from 16 to 83 years - certain students experienced stress more frequently in the continuous assessment model because they were anxious in any case.  Rather than only experiencing it at the end of the year, these students felt anxious every time they were given an assessment.  This meant they felt more anxious throughout the year.  I acknowledge, however, that some students did not experience anxiety.  The main issue is the CAO points race because it causes most of the stress students experience.</p><p>We need to change the whole focus on the leaving certificate result or when the leaving certificate starts.  I have never yet seen a student featured on television who got their leaving certificate applied or PLC results or who completed an apprenticeship - all these areas that those of us in the education sector are told to promote but which are not promoted.  So much pressure from the media and the third level sector is on going on to third level and that should not be the case.</p><p> I am totally against league tables.  They measure one form of assessment and do not take the holistic learning of a student into consideration.  The day of the leaving certificate results, we do not hear about the student who struggled every day to go into school, who got a D and who passed.  I have had students like that and it meant more to me, and to them, than the students who got an A1 because these students were always going to get an A1.  It was the student one encouraged to come in every single day who should be out there to show people what they can achieve.</p><p> Workload will be a major issue.  We have a teacher supply crisis, pay discrimination and very low morale in the profession.  However, they are engaging in the CPD for junior cycle, which is an extensive programme.  To try to put this on top of changing the junior cycle will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for teachers.  They just do not have the capacity to do it.</p><p> I welcome what Deputy Funchion said, which is that it will be assessed by the State Examinations Commission.  We have huge faith in the commission.  I do not know if it has the capacity or whether it would be funded to have the capacity to extend the work it does.  We do not have any objection to a second assessment component if it is externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission so that it is an objective analysis of the students' work.  I am not speaking on behalf of the State Examinations Commission but I would have fears about whether it would have the capacity to do it.  It would certainly have the ability but the question is whether or not it has the capacity.</p><p> Regarding the Chairman's question about whether it would impact on early school leaving, a recent study by the OECD entitled, Education at a Glance, showed that Ireland has a 91% completion of upper secondary education where the EU average is 67% so we are very successful at present.  I accept that if there are more second assessment components, we do not have an issue with it but it should be independently assessed by the State Examinations Commission.  In fairness to the NCCA, in respect of the work it does in devising the programmes, it takes on board the views of the development groups and has more practical elements.  Music for the new junior cycle is worth 30% practical while home economics is worth 50% practical.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Browne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#J00200"><p>I will make a few observations.  Deputy McLoughlin asked whether we had any evidence that continuous assessment alleviates stress, etc., in students.  We have only anecdotal evidence in terms of phone calls received by the National Parents Council.  We would often ask the students what model works best for them.  An example given to us involves construction studies.  My figures may not be exactly correct but a day practical covers 20% of the marks while a project covers 25% so straightaway, they have attained almost half of the marks before the actual terminal examination.  Students have told us that this works for them but, as I say, there is no empirical evidence of that.</p> <p>  With regard to the final examination, I would like to add that it often does not suit our most academically bright children.  They can also suffer from nerves on the day of the examination and underperform due to the stress it causes them.  I concur with what Ms Irwin said.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about league tables.  I have described them here previously as laudable at best.  They make no allowance for students who go on to do apprenticeships.  I think a stigma has developed around the leaving certificate applied and those who complete it.  I have children myself.  Some children are academically gifted while others are practically gifted and will go on and do apprenticeships so the area of apprenticeships and the leaving certificate applied should be given more focus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Hassan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#J00300"><p>I will try to cover as much of that as I can.  The CAO race is probably the bigger factor but a high-stakes examination is still one of the root causes.  We are focused on rote learning.  To return to Deputy Funchion's question about whether there is one thing we could look at and start to do, it is gradual reform.  Certainly the experience from higher education is that the move towards continuous assessment needs to be done gradually for the benefit of an underfunded system, the staff who are involved in the CPD that is required and the students and their ability to adapt to a changing environment.  We need to realise that everyone has to adapt to the move to continuous assessment because we have focused on a high-stakes examination and rote learning in the past.</p> <p>  To return to the point about transition, the evidence to say that a move to continuous assessment will have a positive impact on well-being is not necessarily there because we have not gone out to find that evidence.  We have not done the research and we have not started to make the necessary moves towards what I would view as continuous assessment to start to see the benefit of that.  I draw members' attention to the transition report from the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education which concluded that there was no link between academic performance in the CAO and the ability of the student to successfully transition and not struggle.  Students struggled across the board with the transition, particularly in that first academic semester and the first year.  We know that drop out at that level is around one in six.  The majority of students will drop out in first year so transition is a big issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moira Leydon" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#J00400"><p>I am glad Mr. Hassan used the word "transition" because we have certain solutions to the problem we identified.  I am picking on three themes that have come across very strongly.  At the risk of being teacherly, I think we are talking about two different things.  We are talking about assessment and how it is spread over the year, etc., but we are also talking about the role of the leaving certificate, to be very blunt, as a selection mechanism for third level education.  I prefaced my remarks by saying this is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the commission on the points system.  This was the very issue it sought to address.  Continuous assessment is exactly what it is.  It is spread over the two or three year cycle.  Actually, it is pretty well embedded in our system.  For example, in Gaeilge, 40% of the marks for the examination at junior and senior cycle are for oral communication skills.  This is exactly what it should be for a language because if someone cannot communicate orally, their communication capacity is diminished.  The same is true for the practicals for music and the sciences.  As the junior cycle rolls out, that facility is there.  Continuous assessment is not really the challenge for our system.</p> <p>  The perennial challenge for our system is the fact that the leaving certificate is a very high-stakes examination and will remain so as long as it continues in that selection role for third level.  As legislators, members of this committee are in the business of finding solutions.  I was doing some reading around this matter this morning.  I think we should all revisit the transitions project of 2011 when Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland prepared a very well-researched and thoughtful paper in which she set out three potential solutions to this high-stakes selection function and how we can reduce stress and what has been called the backwash effect on teaching and learning.  I would certainly suggest that members revisit that report to see how far the three core recommendations in it have been implemented.  At the risk of being shot down by my third level colleagues, the one area where the least progress has been made has been entry to third level.  We have changed the grading structure and conducted very reputable research on predictability in the leaving certificate examination.  The conclusion was that leaving certificate examinations do, by and large, test the higher cognitive skills so it is not all about rote learning, etc., so we need to revisit that.</p> <p>  I think we have taken our eye off the ball over the past decade.</p><p>The Deputy referred to what I would describe as significant socioeconomic patterns in student achievement.  That is still with us.  It has not gone away.  Every system struggles with this.  We should look very carefully at how we can, as a system, put more resources and supports into our schools in order to break these cycles of disadvantage and lower achievement.  I cannot quote the most recent but there have been evaluations of DEIS and ESRI research on the subject.  One recent study showed that more than 64% of students deemed disadvantaged are outside the DEIS system.  Those students are in schools where they are not getting the extra supports.  They are not necessarily in schools which have a dedicated focus on dealing with disadvantage.  The research on disadvantage shows that it is not so much the model of assessment that is critical to students' achievement levels.  Rather it is whole school policies for school attendance and retention, high expectations of students by teachers and, more critically, a feeling of student engagement and being part of the school.  That is what teachers often talk about - the school as a community.  As Ms Irwin has said, our retention rate is up there at the top because schools make a huge effort in this regard.  If 64% of our students who are not achieving because of background are not in DEIS schools, we need to think very seriously about supplementary models.</p><p> Coming back to the issues of well-being and stress, it is really to the credit of our legislators and our education community that student well-being has been at the heart of our debates on curriculum at the junior cycle through health promotion in schools, youth mental health guidelines and our new child protection policies.  It is absolutely critical that we follow up on these good intentions and build the capacity of schools to realise them.  </p><p> To be teacherly, I will say there are issues with continuous assessment in respect of how to do it better.  We have a balance.  We can always get a better balance, but we must address the selection function of the leaving certificate.  Some 67% of our students transfer to higher education, which is defined as the institute of technology sector and third level sector.  The iar-Aire was very much part of this policy development.  We are really in a very good space at the moment with regard to further education and training, the amount of apprenticeships coming on board, the sense of enthusiasm out there and the promotion of these alternative post-school pathways.  Ms Irwin referred to the junior cycle bedding down and that over time we might see conclusions.  I believe that over time - over five years or so - we will see the impact of that further education policy and the opening up of apprenticeships.  It will loosen the nexus between the leaving certificate and the selection function.  I ask the committee to revisit the transitions project.  That would be a good step.</p></speech>

It was all interesting.  I am sure Ms Leydon is aware that the committee held hearings on positive mental health and education and on the area of apprenticeships and that we have issued recommendations to the Minister in respect of both of those areas.  We sing from the same hymn sheet without a shadow of a doubt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lewis Purser" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#K00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will make a few general remarks and then try to respond to some of the more precise questions which the committee has raised.  When we discuss the topic of assessment we have to remind ourselves of the purpose of assessment.  What are we trying to do?  We are trying to establish how well students have achieved the level of knowledge, skills and competences which the programme was designed to equip them with.  Obviously there are multiple ways to undertake such assessment.  Any form of assessment will involve some form of stress, but there are well established ways of spreading that stress over multiple methods and over periods of time.  In most cases students will learn to deal with that stress and that is a quite a useful life skill to develop.</p> <p>  The purpose of assessment is important because if we are looking at what we want the students to have achieved as part of their programme of learning - in higher education we refer to this as the learning outcomes - and if we are explicit about what those learning outcomes should be and what outcomes are desirable, then the assessment methods need to be aligned to ensure that those learning outcomes are being achieved and to ascertain the extent of that achievement.  Different methods will be useful for measuring different types of outcomes.  </p> <p>  In Ireland we have a very robust national framework of qualifications which is very highly regarded internationally.  The further education sector and higher education sector engage extensively with this and structure their programmes around it.  QQI, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, conducts all its quality assurance on the basis of the national framework.  I would contend that the State Examinations Commission, and the State examinations system in general, has engaged to a lesser extent with the national framework of qualifications and has been less explicit about the learning outcomes which should be achieved; about how the knowledge, skills and competences which we would like learners to have achieved at key stages in their learning careers are tested; and about the optimal way to do that.  There is quite a lot of literature on that topic.  There is a lot of experience in other countries and, as I have referred to, there is very good experience in the further education sector.  There has also been some quite good experience in the higher education sector over the last ten years. </p> <p>  There was a particular query about addressing student stress and diverse types of learners.  There is a considerable body of research which shows that a broader assessment base, as opposed to a very narrow assessment base at a fixed point in time, is eminently more suitable for meeting the diverse range of learning strengths and needs that we find in our high-participation system.  Ireland has a very inclusive system but I am not sure that the assessment part of that system meets the needs of this very broad range of learners.  The current examination model restricts the opportunities for those students, for example, who have special education needs to demonstrate their learning in the way that is best suited to their own requirements.  Students who experience difficulties with aspects of literacy, memory, concentration, mobility or anxiety are immediately disadvantaged by aspects of our State examinations system.  That is currently the situation.</p> <p>  There was also a query on how we should step towards implementation.  I mentioned earlier, and I believe this is supported by a number of my colleagues on the witness bench, that some very positive change is taking place in the junior certificate but that we would be wise initially to carry through the full set of reforms involving continuous assessment at junior cycle.  We need to help teachers manage the change.  The junior cycle culminates in a State examination with lower stakes - the junior certificate.  This will help address teachers' attitudes towards risk taking, because we are talking about moving outside comfort zones, taking a little bit more risk and being more comfortable with a broader range of assessment practices.  </p> <p>  There is quite a limited culture of continuous assessment in our post-primary schools, at least on a formal basis.  Not all subjects allow continuous assessment to count towards State certification.  Some subjects use it very well, particularly some of the languages and some of the laboratory based subjects, but if compared with the way in which state examinations take place in a number of other European countries - and I do not think the United Kingdom is necessarily a good benchmark - we are certainly behind the times.  If we are looking to assess the 21st century generic competences that employers increasingly call for and the need for which is recognised in society for all our learners, including those who are academically brilliant and those who are more vocationally oriented, we need to do something about the assessment method which we use.</p></speech>

I tend to agree with the point made by both Ms Irwin and Mr. Purser about the need to see how the junior cycle changes bed in.  Although I asked how this process could be moved forward and expressed frustration at how long we had been talking about this, I understand that we have to take it step by step.  There will be a learning process in changing the junior cycle which will feed into any changes to the senior cycle.  I take that point.  Ms Leydon referred to &Aacute;ine Hyland's report.  I suggest that we circulate that to the members of the committee.  We all need to be reminded of it even if we did originally read it.  It would be useful in terms of how we proceed.  I am not sure that I have further questions except a very specific question about how each of the organisations is actually engaging with the process which the NCCA has undertaken.  Obviously we are engaging with the process.</p><p>Are there related issues of which the committee should be aware?  I assume that all the witnesses are directly involved in the ongoing discussions.</p><p> We need to learn from the junior cycle outcomes, the work that is being done at the higher education level, as well as apprenticeships and all the other alternatives such as further education and so on.  At the same time, we must start thinking about and certainly adapting our mindsets as to how we might proactively and positively engage with the reform process for the leaving certificate examination in order to address the real problems we all acknowledge exist.  Despite having very good educational outcomes in Ireland generally, many people still find the leaving certificate examination to be problematic. </p></speech>

While funding is an issue, one way to solve the problem is to expand the school completion programme because it does a lot of good work.  Many schools that do not have a DEIS status participate in the school completion programme.  The programme makes a great difference to the lives of many students.  For example, one of my constituents contacted me recently about a child being very stressed about the leaving certificate examination.  Luckily, the student attends a school that participates in the school completion programme and, therefore, had the opportunity to access counselling nearly straight away.  If a school is not part of the programme then a parent or guardian must source and pay for counselling privately because the waiting lists are so long in the public system.  The school completion programme is good but is often overlooked.  Unfortunately, the scheme is no longer operated by the Department of Education and Skills and is now provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which I do not consider to be a good idea.  The committee should consider the programme and call for its expansion.</p></speech>

Would continuous assessment create a better environment for students?  Would it reduce the amount of academic stress currently experienced by students by distributing the stress over a period where several assessments take place?</p> <p>  The committee has discussed the CAO race on several occasions.  Today, the witnesses have made the interesting remark that emphasis is placed on third level education rather than apprenticeships.  In the past while, the committee has met many groups that called for a greater emphasis to be placed on apprenticeships, as there is a shortage of apprentices in various sectors.  At present, all of the emphasis is placed on securing enough points to enter third level institutions or universities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the matter.</p></speech>

The general feeling in the room at the launch event was there were many lessons to be learned from international perspectives on how to consult with stakeholders, students, staff and teachers.  However, when the review process was outlined at the end of the day, there was also a feeling that it was not as inclusive as it should have been, especially considering the speakers who spoke earlier.</p> <p>  As for what steps to take, the review provides an opportunity to consider issues such as the length of time it takes to get the results of final examinations.  While the junior cycle review must takes its course, steps can be considered immediately.  Many final examinations amount to between 70% and 80% of the total marks that can be awarded.  The review is welcome but it needs to be more inclusive.</p> <p>  On spreading academic stress over a longer period, the USI has defended the value of continuous assessment in our submission.  We first must define continuous assessment.  As far as I am concerned, continuous assessment in its purest form simply relates to the timing of assessments and is not related to whether it is an examination or course work.  We need to be mindful of that aspect. There is a risk that continuous assessment might spread academic stress.  Assessment should follow the curriculum rather than the other way around.  Continuous assessment requires resources in all sectors and that comes back to the transitions.  It is key that continuous assessment be defined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Irwin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018030600002#L00600"><p>I also attended the launch of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment review of the senior cycle examination and wish to disclose a conflict of interest by declaring that I am a member of that council.</p> <p>  In respect of any review by the NCCA of the senior cycle examination, the TUI is concerned that there be teacher buy-in from the start because teachers will operate any reform.  In May, a sample of either 40 or 50 schools will be selected by management to conduct research on the current senior cycle and the existing programmes.  The TUI has clearly told the NCCA that teachers in those schools must be consulted about whether they want to be part of the scheme.  There are schools that want to participate but management has not selected them.  Also, the schools selected must include disadvantaged schools, mixed education schools, girls' schools and must include schools in regions as far away as north Donegal and as close as city centre Dublin.  The research must include all aspects otherwise the findings will not truly reflect the current situation.  </p> <p>  On the issue of continuous assessment, the TUI is concerned that breaking up assessment points would not reduce stress for students.  When I hear the term "continuous assessment" I think, from the perspective of further education, that it is a lot of assessment.  For example, I deliver a level 4 module on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance, QQI, framework that has 14 assessments.  Therefore, when we hear the term, "continuous assessment", we think that will mean 14 pieces of work for one subject.  If one practical element takes place at one time of the year, as mentioned by Deputy McLoughlin, then that is very different.  I agree with Mr. Hassan that we need to define what is meant by continuous assessment.  Again, I repeat that it must be externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission.</p> <p>  It also is important to consider the current assessment timetable in schools, which is extremely busy at present.  One will not get an holistic picture of what students experience by analysing the timetable for one subject because most students study ten subjects at junior cycle.  I agree that we need examinations to take place on a phased basis.  One should not schedule the assessments for home economics and materials technology or woodwork at the same time, as that would increase stress.  Recently, we analysed the timetable for assessments as part of the new junior cycle when the programme was fully embedded and included all of the subjects.  We discovered that assessment takes place nearly every month.  One must be mindful of the increased workload generated by classroom-based assessment from the point of view of school management, teachers and students.  If one is teaching two or three subjects and if there is classroom-based assessment, that will increase both teacher workload and stress for students.  All of those aspects must be taken into consideration.  </p></speech>

The ASTI is on the council and we will engage with any public consultation.  It would be misleading of me to not state explicitly that the ASTI is not in the business of countenancing any proposal that links teachers assessing students for the State examination.  That would be the red line we would not cross.  Yes, one can supplement and balance written examinations with all sorts of practical examinations, oral examination, aural examinations etc.  If a proposal emerges, however, that teachers would assess and award marks that would go towards the final State examination, then we would be back where we started, unfortunately.  Such a proposal is not in anyone's interest.  While we will engage, that will be the point from which we will start.</p> <p>  Deputy Tony McLoughlin suggested that examination stress could be reduced by continual assessments.  Young people face challenges that we have no idea about and it is quite terrifying.  Examination stress is not the only stress experienced by young people.  We have had another fantastic debate on this matter.  I must compliment the legislators for spearheading a debate on social media and its impact on young people's well-being.  Achievement stress and academic stress is one dimension in one dimension of that.  Perhaps continuous assessment can alleviate such stress.  As Ms Irwin has said, however, a cursory analysis of the timetable for a child studying ten subjects will reveal there are tests at the end of each week, end of term tests and classroom-based assessments, CBAs, or one could be in third year or could have practical work to be undertaken.  The one lesson we have all learned from the junior cycle is that assessment should not drive the curriculum.  Instead, the curriculum should drive the assessment.  </p> <p>  I get the feeling that there is a nuanced understanding of assessment and what role it should play.</p><p>Spreading it out can alleviate stress, but there is much more that legislators can do for student well-being.  Bringing some of the social media giants to heel and making them deliver on their corporate social responsibilities is a good way of dealing with this societal issue.</p></speech>

I have had the good fortune to be a part of the computer science working group over the past 12 months.  We are content with how that will be assessed, in that it is a 70:30 split.  The 70% will be for the terminal exam, but there will also be a project worth 30%.  It is heading in the right direction.  We have representation on the NCCA's senior and junior cycle working groups.</p> <p>  I agree with my colleagues that, from a parental point of view on continuous assessment, we are not advocating monthly or weekly assignments.  The word "continuous" should probably be dropped and replaced with something else.  I will repeat the example I gave earlier.  I did construction studies and that model worked well, in that there was the day practical, a project and the terminal exam.  The continuous assessment has to be defined and resourced and training must be provided.</p> <p>  I cannot concur with Deputy McLoughlin enough on apprenticeships.  Try getting a plumber or electrician.  It cannot be done.  Those trades people probably earn more than all of us put together.</p></speech>

Questions were raised about the recently launched NCCA reform process.  The universities are supportive of it.  Obviously, it is still in its infancy, but we understand it to be moving forward cautiously and trying to develop evidence and a coherent approach in order to bring stakeholders with it.  Rushing anything in the current environment would be a mistake, but there is already a great deal of good practice in the system that we need to bring to the surface, make people more aware of, and with the concept of which we need to make them more comfortable.</p> <p>  Interesting and important work will come out of the NCCA's detailed consultation with the 40 schools, which I understand should be representative of the second level system across the country.  The NCCA will take those findings, put together a series of proposals and hold a second broad public consultation, which will point the way forward.</p> <p>  The universities contribute to all the NCCA's senior cycle subject development groups and are pleased to do so but, as Mr. Browne mentioned, new subjects are coming on stream and are presenting exciting developments, for example, computer science, new languages, and politics and society, which are moving away from some of our older understandings of what the leaving certificate looks like.  There are models in the new subjects that could be adapted into some of the more traditional subjects.</p> <p>  A number of committee members mentioned the transitions reform process.  A part of the rationale for reforming the leaving certificate grading system was to provide a little extra space at each grade band to allow scope for innovation in the system and a broader set of assessment options when the time comes.  Under the previous grading system, the transparency of the leaving certificate required students to be exactly aware of what they needed or could have got, so the pressure was ratcheted up even further when they were close to a different grade.  With broader grade bands, there is scope within them to innovate, for teachers to use their best professional competences and judgment and for the State Examinations Commission to build on that.  We have put in place the parameters for many exciting things to happen over the next five years.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that it would be a pity to lose that opportunity.</p></speech>

We are preparing the next financial framework which will accompany the European Commission's proposals in May in respect of the financial outlook and financial framework for the period 2021 to the end of 2027.</p> <p>  The reason I am travelling to the capitals of all member states to meet the governments and the parliaments is to understand the expectations of our national colleagues in respect of responsibilities which we all see as European responsibilities.  Related to and compared with the existing method, we see that there are new responsibilities in dealing with issues such as migration, the provision of development aid in Africa and the refugee crisis in the Middle East such that border protection and control and defence and defence research could be as important as the fight against terrorism.  </p> <p>  In parallel, we have the ongoing traditional responsibilities arising from the treaty covering areas such as cohesion policies and the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have two problems in that regard.  We have a problem on the revenue side because the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.  After the transition phase, we will be at the loss of its input of between &euro;12 billion and &euro;14 billion.</p><p>On the expenditure side, it is up to the European Council and the European Parliament to decide.  If we see added value in investing or moderating and working together at European level to fight against terrorism or resolve migration issues and so, we will need the money to finance the investment via our European programmes in the next decade.  </p><p> We are undertaking spending reviews, with a view to modernising existing programmes and the way to simplify the rules.  We have to examine which cuts would be acceptable.  The halving of the gap created by Brexit, in addition to our new responsibilities, means that we will have to accept some cuts, but we will have to avoid damaging traditional programmes.  However, member states do not always have the same interests.  Some countries suggest that, in the interests of cohesion, we should invest more in agricultural policies, whereas others say a reduction of 30% in this area could be acceptable.</p><p> We have a budget ceiling or dimension which, in general, under the existing framework, year by year, is approximately 1% of gross national income.  It is crystal clear that if this ceiling is prolonged and remains at the same level, we will have no chance of closing the gap due to Brexit and financing the meeting of new responsibilities.  In my view, the ceiling should be a little higher and the formula should be set at 1/x%.  This is necessary.  Investing at European level means that we realise added value.  We have to bring clear arguments and proof that we will create added value by investing at European level.  If there is to be added value, we will need the money.  This is about the national budget and new resources and we have a window for negotiations.  </p><p> The Commission's document will come out in May and the European elections will be held by the end of May 2019.  Therefore, the earlier we negotiate the better for farmers, researchers, regions and all of our partners.  We would then have clarity and certainty about the available funding and the programmes and rules that would apply to the financial framework post-2020.  </p><p> The question I address to members of the committee is what do they expect from the European Union because at the end of the day it is about unanimity?  We need 27 Finance Ministers, 27 Ministers at the General Affairs Council, 27 Heads of State and Government and 27 national parliaments to agree.  It is not the Commission's annual financial framework but our common framework.  It is a framework for 440 million citizens, 27 member states and the future of the European Union.</p></speech>

The multi-annual financial framework, MFF, is the EU's seven year budget but with Britain being one of the major contributors, Brexit has left a hole in all of the budgets, as the Commissioner said.  Again, as he said, the choice is between cutting and adding more revenue.  Any cut that is likely to be made includes the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, because that is the biggest budget line and in order to raise more revenue the Commission is looking at extending the EU's resources.  Can the Commissioner tell us about the rebates of some of the wealthier countries and the amount that equates to?  If these rebates were removed, how less important would the withdrawal of Britain's contributions be?</p></speech>

It was an agreement between the then Prime Minister Thatcher and the Council and the European Parliament and we have a system of rebates related to the British rebate.  Our position is that with the UK leaving, these rebates cannot survive.  We are bringing our next MFF without rebates, only with resources coming from member states related to gross national income, GNI, and with some new and other resources without rebate.  Nobody knows what the outcome will be afterwards because it is about unanimity.  I cannot exclude at the end of the day ending up with no rebate.  In general, maybe we need some of them.  Member states which are quite critical net payers include the Netherlands, Sweden or Denmark.  It is a question of the negotiations but our starting point is that there will be no rebate.</p></speech>

Now we are analysing the situation and the basis on which we are developing revenues, the amount of money, the systems, the methodology and this is one point on a technical level but on a political level as well, to see if the methodology is future-proofed in an ongoing way or has anything to be changed?  Should it be just related to GNI, and in which years, or to labour market demography migration?  Are there other relevant points which should play a role in coming to the levels to be paid member state by member state?</p></speech>

It should not be too bureaucratic.  If it is too complicated, it will not be convincing.  GNI ongoing is a fair system with maybe some additional instruments to help to come to a complete figure that member states have to pay.  One has to compare revenues and expenditures - payments to member states.</p><p>For example, if there were to be a hard Brexit, although I hope there is not, I am sure in a new multi-annual financial framework, MFF, we could do a lot via a new instrument against asymmetric shocks, via, indirectly, the Juncker plan, or via connecting to an EU facility.  Nobody knows how much money a member state from 2021 up to 2027 will receive.  To compare payments or revenues and to compare payments to members states and their projects is quite an open picture.  Cohesion is clear, more or less.  CAP is clear but all other programmes - take Horizon 2020 - depend on important projects, convincing projects and priorities or problematic developments in which we have to assist and to help.</p></speech>

I want to refer to CAP.  This is hugely important.  If we accept that there is going to be a hole in the budget, CAP is in the firing line, as the Commissioner said.

To think that with the UK leaving that there will be no cut anywhere is a mission impossible.  I do not want to reduce the amount of money for Erasmus+ or for Horizon.  I want to speak about acceptable cuts, meaning from minus 5% up to minus 10% in cohesion and maybe in CAP.  It is an open debate.</p></speech>

We hear a lot about solidarity and a lot of words around that.  I acknowledge that the EU has stood with Ireland but I really cannot impress on the Commissioner how much a double whammy of Brexit and a cut to CAP would hurt Irish agriculture.  Over the last week Irish agriculture has suffered because of the extreme weather.</p> <p>  When we talk about the rebates to the wealthier countries, we could talk about money that the EU wastes in terms of the arms industry and military development.  Having CAP on the chopping board is not acceptable and I would say it is a matter of choices.  Our own MEP, Mr. Matt Carthy, has fought strongly on this point.</p> <p>  My message to the Commissioner today is that it would absolutely ruin Irish agriculture, particularly in the region where I come from, if there were cuts to CAP on top of Brexit.  That needs to be seriously considered from the Commissioner's point of view.</p></speech>

If we park the issue of outstanding commitments to existing programmes and when all of that washes itself through, what is the annual structural gap in terms of the Brexit bill, the shortfall as a result of the UK no longer making a recurring annual contribution?

Trying to reach agreement on any expenditure cuts is incredibly difficult.  We know all about that in this country given the crisis we have come through in the past ten years and the fiscal consolidation that was necessary.  How great a challenge will it be for the European Union to agree a new MFF, a new annual budget, in a post-Brexit environment where we are facing the type of shortfall in the budget that the Commissioner has spoken about, whether it be &euro;12 billion or more than that, and the challenges that poses by way of member states paying more money in, and cuts to expenditure programmes like CAP which Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about?  How difficult and how challenging will that be over the period ahead to reach agreement on those very difficult issues?</p></speech>

From the Commission communication to the Parliament and the Council, the Commission reflection paper on the future of EU finances causes me to fear that the direction of spending points to the type of Europe that unfortunately we have.  It points to a Europe which is a fortress Europe, a racist Europe, an increasingly militarised Europe and a Europe which uses taxpayers' money to finance private development and private profits.</p><p>To go through each of those areas, the first relates to military expenditure within the EU.  In the previous MFF, not the current one, there was &euro;1.4 billion allocated for security research.  In the current MFF that we are in until 2020, there is &euro;3.8 billion allocated.  Am I right to take from the Commission's communication that the amount of money allocated to what is euphemistically called "defence research" will likely be increased, or the Commission would advocate an increase, in the next MFF?  The Commission's communication refers to how best to support a true European defence Union.  It reads: "Given the scale of existing national defence research budgets .... the research window of the Fund would need an estimated budget of at least EUR 3.5 billion over the period to make a substantial difference".  It also reads that at least around &euro;7 billion would be needed to co-finance part of the cost of defence industrial development, assisting the military industrial complex and that a separate funding mechanism of around &euro;10 billion for that period would increase the EU's ability to financially support operations with defence implications.  Is the Commission in favour of substantially increasing the amount of money allocated to defence in the next MFF?</p></speech>

Most of our member states are NATO members and NATO members agreed to invest 2% of their GDP in defence.  It is an agreement of all our Ministers of defence and foreign affairs, not my agreement.  The average Europe is investing is about 1.4%, so we have a gap.  We can bring clear arguments that to standardise on a European level, to prepare tenders on a European level and to co-finance on a European level is much more efficient than to standardise and invest 28 times in parallel because the US is much more successful in investing and in getting back services, products and weapons systems.  Why should Europe develop ten drone systems in parallel?  It is better to have a European joint undertaking, a European team, and the defence union is the network therefore, agreed by 25 member states.  It is in the taxpayer's interest to invest on a European level and to get more back than just to invest 25, 27 or 28 times in parallel.</p></speech>

Does the Commissioner agree that no European citizen's money, even if it is under the guise of dual-use, which is how this money ends up with Israeli armaments companies - I am against this direction the Commission is going in any case - should end up with Israeli armaments companies?  Surely that is a bottom line, given their flouting of international law and given their oppression of Palestinians.</p></speech>

Please come to Brussels, let us speak about these arguments and let us see which projects are not acceptable to the Deputy.  The Commission has Horizon 2020.  The Commission has about &euro;11 billion a year.  That is not nothing but it is not so much and it is really related to civil projects, to innovation, to digital projects.  For example, sometimes these partners are from outside of Europe, but mainly they are European partners.  I invite the Deputy to come to me and to come together with the Commission's people from Directorate-General RTD.  Then the Deputy can see how convincing European innovation and research projects are because against Silicon Valley and the Pentagon and against Beijing and Made in China 2025, no member state, not Ireland, not Germany, and no company, not Siemens, not Phillips, standing alone is strong enough to compete.  Together we have a chance and Europe needs its own innovative and digital sovereignty.  Europe does not have this at the moment.</p></speech>

I was a member of the European Parliament.  I made these arguments and I will be concrete.  Elbit received an EU contribution of over &euro;400,000 for its participation in the FLYSEC project which integrates new technologies on video surveillance, intelligent remote image processing and biometrics combined with big data analysis, open source intelligence and crowd sourcing.  It is an Israeli armaments company.  It is used against the Palestinians, people who have their land occupied.  The same applies in different systems, for Israeli aerospace systems, for Technion.  This is a very simple question.  Does the Commissioner agree that no EU money, money that comes from European citizens, should end up with Israeli armaments companies?</p></speech>

It seems again that the direction that this is going goes further in the direction of the so-called "Juncker investment plan", the European Fund for Strategic Investment.  The Commission envisages more money would be allocated to that in the coming MFF.  Could the Commissioner confirm that?</p><p>The language around it is about mobilising private investment.  The mathematics for the Juncker plan were ridiculous.  It started with &euro;8 billion and ended up with &euro;350 billion magicked out of nothing.  However, it illustrated the fact that it was predicated on private investment.  Is this not about the public taking the risk of investment in infrastructure and the private sector ending up with profit gains in schools, hospitals or whatever?  It is like a public private partnership model that always results in the public taking the risk and the private sector taking the profit.</p></speech>

The Junker plan is a plan of the European Parliament and of the Council.  We do not take all of the risks; we are taking some risk.  We are reducing the level of risk via the EIB and the Juncker plan.  These so-called new financial instruments are not just European instruments.  It is a usual instrument used by many member states and by countries inside and outside Europe for funding to reduce the risk and to give some guarantees to attract projects and to activate private investors.</p></speech>

The figure of 2% of GDP was agreed to by Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers, NATO members and governments.  If all of the EU 28 were NATO members and had a GDP of &euro;15,000 billion per year, it would mean a figure of &euro;300 billion.  At the moment we are investing &euro;10 billion; therefore, there is a gap of &euro;90 billion which could be closed by having a figure of 1% or 1.5% on a European level.  If these European programmes succeed, activate and realise added value, figures of &euro;1 billion and &euro;500 million should be a starting point, not the whole story.</p></speech>

The CAP presents a major issue for Ireland.  One of main beneficiaries of the EU budget is the CAP.  The Commissioner has mentioned that we are likely to see a 5% to 10% reduction in that type of programme, yet, on the other hand, there will be an increase in military or defence spending in Europe.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it has to be decided and agreed to, but the preparatory work sees a cut of between 5% and 10% for the CAP.

It will be hard to swallow for Irish citizens.  This is where the European Union sometimes loses touch with its citizens.  On the one hand, preparations are being made to cut core programmes that support smaller farmers, in particular, on average and sometimes very low incomes, while, on the other, resources from national taxpayers are going towards increased military spending.  What does the Commissioner say to the farmer in west Donegal on an average income of &euro;6,000?  Will he say his or her support payments will be cut but that he or she is not to worry because the European Union will defend him or her because it is ramping up spending on military programmes and using Irish taxpayers' money to do so?</p></speech>

It must take ownership of these proposals.  Saying the Netherlands wants to cut more does not cut it.  That is what leads to people turning away from the European project.  They will argue, legitimately in certain cases, that the priorities are wrong.  There is a guaranteed increase in military spending, but everything else is on the chopping table.</p></speech>

I say to the Commissioner that he has the opportunity to communicate through this committee to farmers who will potentially see their programme payments cut.  I am giving him that opportunity, but he is obviously not going to take it in the way I thought he would.</p> <p>  There is a second point.  The proposal from the Commission is to increase the figure from 1% to 1.1% or 1.2% of gross national income, GNI.  The European Parliament favours an increase of 1.3%.  In response to Deputy Michael McGrath the Commissioner spoke about a 50:50 split between cuts and increases in contributions.  What would be required in terms of the increase in the percentage of GNI to avoid cuts to the multi-annual financial framework?</p></speech>

If we are just to close the Brexit gap with fresh money, a figure of 1.1x% would be enough.  In completing European Monetary Union to develop some new instruments and investments against asymmetric shocks or reform delivery tools, or to integrate the European development aid fund we would have, within a complete picture, a ceiling of up to 1.3%.</p></speech>

In the next eight weeks I will travel to eight more member states to meet representatives of eight more national parliaments.  For the moment I am being quite open and sensitive.  There is the question of whether we should integrate the European development aid fund, as the Parliament is demanding.  It represents a figure of about 0.03% of the whole dimension.  Outside x would be different, as inside x should be.  As I mentioned, there is a package coming on 6 December which will deepen European Monetary Union.  It is developing three new financial instruments and we need a clear order or expectation from the eurozone Council as to which amount of money it would prefer for the reform delivery tool.  It is to assist and invest when there is an asymmetric shock and so on.  That will bring me to a concrete x which may be 1.11%, 1.17% or 1.19%</p></speech>

Does the Commissioner have ideas in that regard?  I can provide a Sinn F&eacute;in document that contains a number of proposals that we believe would be helpful.  Among them is that North-South co-operation would be treated as a qualifying combination for inter-regional programmes.  Is that something Mr. Oettinger believes is possible?</p><p>We have also argued for the establishment of a task force, based on the Barroso task force established to support the Good Friday Agreement, with an all-Ireland mandate to work with all the different national actors to support the maximum level of funding.  It was unique to Ireland and recognition from Europe of the importance of the Good Friday Agreement.  A Brexit initiative would be important there.  There are a number of other matters and the third I will mention is the securing of a PEACE programme beyond the 2020 horizon.  With those or any other element suggested by the witness, where does he see the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, as a support?  The only question is the scale of that impact of Brexit at this point.</p></speech>

It is not really credible to answer those questions today.  If there is a hard Brexit, we will need additional and different instruments for the European Union and Ireland.  That is in contrast to there being a customs union, for example.  It will depend on such things.  The 2 May date is just a starting point for negotiations.  I am sure that before the end of this year we will know the detail of what will face the EU 27, the UK and Ireland.  That will inform what MFF we will need in the interests of Ireland and the whole EU 27.</p></speech>

I will take up the last point.  It is important there should be an understanding across Europe that Brexit will ultimately be a negative-sum game, probably for all of Europe and particularly for Ireland.  Whether it is a hard or soft Brexit will determine how negatively it will have an impact on our economy.  Either way, it will not be a positive for us in any way, shape or form.  Throughout the budgetary negotiations for 2020 and beyond, there must be a focus not just on the money that will be lost from losing Britain as a contributor but also on the impact that economies like ours will suffer because we are such a close trading partner with Britain.  There is a need for some budgetary steps to counteract that, whether that is in terms of the peace process or in trade in general.  Our proximity to Britain will be a key consideration.</p> <p>  The Commissioner made a point in his opening statement, saying that losing Britain as a contributor and not having cuts is impossible.  That is not the case.  We have proposed that countries which contribute may contribute more.  In Ireland our Taoiseach has said we are open to doing that if other countries do the same.  What is the Commissioner's sense from the other countries he has visited?  Is there an openness to increasing contributions in some ways?  At the heart of my points today is the fact that new measures are fine but they require new money.  With the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the Irish agricultural sector, which will suffer some of the worst impacts of Brexit, there would be a double-whammy if there was an impact on trade along with a reduction in the CAP budget.  Security is absolutely important for the EU but food security is also very important.  Ensuring there is a good carbon footprint for the food we produce is very important.</p><p>The positive environment impacts of sustainable farming are also very important to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018030600002#P00200"><p>We are analysing the starting position of all member state governments and parliaments.  At the moment, a majority of member states are ready to accept the higher ceiling and invest a little more money in the European Union's multi-annual financial framework.  A figure of 1.1% seems to be acceptable to most of them and a figure of 1.2% seems to be acceptable to some of them.  However, and this is not a secret, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, made crystal clear last week that for him the figure should be 1.0%.  The new Chancellor of Austria made a similar strong and clear announcement.  It is up to me, not us, to convince them and perhaps Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Italy - let us wait and see what happens in Italy after the elections - to invest a little more.  To be in the driver's seat, I must be ambitious but realistic.  Being overambitious would result in my proposal being rejected and we would then have nothing.  Looking back to 2005, perhaps the Commission was too ambitious then because the European Council rejected its proposal, leaving the Commission totally out of the game.  I need a balanced proposal that is ambitious but realistic.  I have to ensure we have enough tools in the framework to be relevant, important and acceptable to all of our 27 governments and national parliaments.</p></speech>

Just as he was frank in informing us what the Netherlands and Denmark want in various areas, I hope he will, in the other eight countries he must still visit and throughout the negotiations, reiterate the points he hears in Ireland.  New measures require new money and the Common Agricultural Policy is extremely important.  Food security and sustainability are a key element of the CAP and that must not be lost in the discussions.</p></speech>

I have a particular interest in the 80 million people with disabilities in Europe.  The European Union is in the unique position of being the only non-state party to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It follows that the EU must not only comply with the convention, but also advance the inclusion of people with disabilities across its competencies.  This should guide and incentivise the greatest possible degree of compliance in terms of mainstreaming in the multi-annual financial framework and the EU's semester process.  Similarly, compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is intrinsic to achieving the European pillar of social rights and the sustainable development goals.  The multi-annual financial framework and semester process are key mechanisms for achieving and implementing these and other objectives.  How does Commissioner Oettinger envisage the semester process and MFF being able to advance these objectives at European level?</p><p> Over the past decade, the European Union has demonstrated that it can act with determination, strength and resolve when dealing with crises.  However, as everyone will agree, poverty, exclusion and inequality have increased to unacceptable levels across the EU and the people worst affected are those who are already marginalised and disadvantaged.  In that respect, I speak for people with disabilities.  The EU must urgently take strong, determined and resolute action to improve the lives of people with disabilities in line with commitments in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As I stated, there are 80 million people in the EU with disabilities.  I will make three simple points about disability.  First, disability results in increased poverty for those affected.  Second, it increases their exclusion and that of their families in a range of ways.  Third, when the first two factors are combined, there is a loss of hope.</p><p> A number of speakers referred to defence.  The European Union is a precious and unique regional entity and no other entity in the world comes close to it as a model.  Notwithstanding that, the Union has problems and it strikes me that disintegration and the breaking down from within is as great a threat as are external threats.  I am not disputing that the EU faces external threats but sometimes threats are imported or develop from within.  One of the greatest defence mechanisms for entities such as the EU and its member states is to strengthen social cohesion.  This requires a specific focus on people and families on the margins, even if the instinct may be to argue that doing this would be unaffordable.  There is no doubt this is necessary when one considers how people with disabilities are affected across a range of indicators, including employment, poverty and education status.</p><p> Commissioner Oettinger set the scene, with which we in Ireland are familiar from the past decade.  The European Union's revenue is declining while expenditure is increasing and it is acquiring new responsibilities.  The Commissioner referred, for example, to migration, development aid, refugees, border controls and terrorism but did not mention Europeans with disabilities.</p></speech>

However, while the issues I listed were new responsibilities, Commissioner Oettinger also referred to existing responsibilities.  The European Union has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is important to remember that both the EU and UN were born out of the Second World War.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights dates back to 1948, yet 60 years later, the UN was forced to point out that its members, which include all EU member states, had not viewed people with disabilities as among the human beings who should have their rights advanced.  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a statement, 60 years after the universal declaration, that is necessary to insert a "how to do" mechanism, as it were, to ensure people with disabilities can board trains, go to school and find jobs.  This is a serious international issue.</p> <p>  Commissioner Oettinger referred to the Holocaust.  We remember the awful fate of 6 million Jews.  Some 300,000 people with disabilities were murdered by the Nazi regime, many of whom were German.  No laws were introduced at Nuremberg to make that possible.  The point I am making is that the humanity of people with disabilities is not viewed as being as strong as that of others.</p><p>There needs to be a commitment through the protection of - the holding of the line - and improving supports for people with disabilities in the period ahead if ratification of the UN convention is to mean anything.</p></speech>

They are obligations for us as an employer inside the Commission and in terms of European Union citizenship.  We want to see them practised in member states and as part of the complete picture in the European Union and beyond in development aid and neighbourhood policies and so on.  Inside the Commission we are doing a lot in the interests of all of our staff via inclusion programmes to have fair, attractive and flexible working places, as well as via a clear order to ensure there is no discrimination and have a policy whereby people can let us know if anything goes wrong.  We are an engaged employer and sometimes pioneering.  </p> <p>   The European Semester, including the process and recommendations, was born at a time of financial and economic crisis.  It is an ongoing process primarily related to economic analysis and recommendations.  With the two pillars generated by our communication last autumn and the Gothenburg Summit conclusions, increasingly European Monetary Union and the Single Market in the European Union must be completed by clear societal rules.  With limited room to manoeuvre in the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, perhaps we might invest more in the direction demanded by Ireland, but for the moment the majority of member states are quite defensive.  They do not accept that the European Union is doing too much in societal fields.  They have stated it is up to us, that it is a national and regional competence and that we can act and react in our own dimension, as we are closer to people and, therefore, know better what has to be done.  It should and will be a European dimension.</p></speech>

I understand a hard Brexit would leave a &euro;200 million per week gap in the European Union's budget.  Essentially, it would make a major hole in the Commission's budget.  On the options being examined, can the Commissioner tell us how it is proposed to fill the hole in the budget?  He has talked about increasing the contributions made by member states from 1% to 1.1% or 1.2%.  Will he clarify where his thoughts are focused at this time?</p> <p>  Another option is creating an entirely new income flow from new forms of taxation or changes to rates or by achieving efficiencies in the case of existing taxes.</p><p>For example, we know that a group of member states are now having very advanced conversations about digital taxation.  I do not know how the Commissioner views the matter.  If there is such a development, how does he anticipate it would impact on the Commission's budget?  Increasing the existing VAT contributions is another possibility.  Ireland is now in an economic recovery period but we still have major financial obstacles to overcome in order to get us back to where we were ten years ago.</p><p> I have a few questions on specific programmes.  One of the greatest threats to the European Union, as a political entity, is the spectre of youth unemployment right across the European Union.  The youth unemployment rate is appallingly high in Greece and, to be honest, it is quite shocking in Italy.  When I was the Minister for Social Protection I introduced a lot of youth employment measures in Ireland in the course of the last Government.  As a result, we more than halved the rate of youth unemployment in that period.  Why is youth unemployment a persistent problem in so many countries?  Does the Commission have further plans to assist young people who are shut out of the jobs market?  I compliment Senator Dolan on his remarks because what has happened to many young people has also happened to others who suffer from a disability but would really like to be part of the workforce.</p><p> Young people are very concerned about the future of the ERASMUS programme in the event of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  The free movement of young people in Europe is critical to their sense of Europe and the ERASMUS programme is very important to those who go to college.  I ask Commissioner Oettinger to tell us how he foresees this matter unfolding.  Will a special side deal be negotiated for the ERASMUS programme, as suggested by many of the British universities? </p><p> I have two more questions on a hard Brexit.  Does the Commissioner have a sense of the areas where the European Union might assist Ireland?  I am aware that the Union does not want a hard Brexit in Northern Ireland but I am sure he will appreciate that the matter is a very pressing political issue for us.  It also means that if there was a hard border we would have to develop our ports in Dublin, Cork and Rosslare.  Has the European Union considered plans to counter that eventuality?</p><p> Finally, as the Commissioner will know, Ireland is a neutral country.  Recently, the European Union has indicated that a 2% target for defence spending is desirable.  Germany, which is the Commissioner's own country, for a number of reasons is not necessarily an integral part of military alliances.  People in Ireland really value the fact that their country is neutral but we participate in peacekeeping missions around the world under the auspices of the UN and the Irish Parliament.  Will the new defence configuration pose a challenge to Irish neutrality? </p></speech>

A figure of &euro;200 million per day makes up the entire investment of the UK.  However, in light of what it is getting back, the figure is far less in the end at between &euro;12 billion, &euro;13 billion or &euro;14 billion per year net.  There is an ongoing figure of &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.  We are working with &euro;1.1 billion because some things are not clear.  Should we integrate the European development aid fund into the budget or should it stay outside?  Which amount of money must we foresee for new programmes against asymmetric shocks for a reform delivery tool deepening and completing our European monetary union?</p> <p>  With regard to digital taxation, there is a clear demand from seven or eight member states to prepare a legislative proposal.  In parallel is the ongoing work by the OECD.  We are waiting to see what its conviction is.  In general, OTT digital platforms use a lot of data.  Billions of data come from European citizens using their services but nearly none of their revenue comes to Europe.  If we look at Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Qualcomm, Microsoft and all the others, we can see that to have a bigger share of the value chain should be in our common interest.  There is no decision for the moment.  We are checking the situation and will then come to the Council and member states when there is a realistic option.</p> <p>  What can we do if there is a hard Brexit?  The Commission and Mr. Barnier are really near to the Irish Government and Chambers Ireland and are looking at the risks facing the EU 27 and Ireland, in particular.  Ireland's ports were mentioned.  If we need more capacity to transport products from Ireland to the EU 27 and from Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp to one of Ireland's ports, we can invest in respect of connecting to Europe.  We have more flexibility via our reform of the financial regulation.  We can take money from this programme to co-finance a project that is important for Ireland if there is a super-hard Brexit.  </p> <p>  I agree with the point about Erasmus+.  Erasmus+ is one of the few programmes I do not want to see reduced.  I want to invest more.  It is up to the UK.  Erasmus+ and Horizon are open to third countries.  Switzerland is taking part.  It is up to London to decide whether it is in the interest of Oxford, Cambridge or London to be a part of Horizon and whether Erasmus+, an open programme, should be for English and Scottish young people.  It then must pay something so that the younger generation can take part.  We would prefer such a European approach - a continental approach - in the interest of our younger generation and the younger generation in the UK.  </p> <p>  I agree with the point made about youth unemployment.  We can see how different Europe is.</p><p>There are some regions that are very successful with no or almost no youth unemployment.  An example would be the Baltic states, Sweden, Denmark or Germany.  We are investing more than ever via a European budget to combat youth unemployment.  My problem is that the absorption rate is not high enough.  Countries cannot use the amount of money we are offering them because the administrations are unable to use it, finance projects and reform and redirect their labour markets.  We are not a centralised European Union.  We are a union of member states and we need competent and efficient national and regional administrations.  The absorption rate is really not convincing.  I could give the committee some more background information.  Look at Spain.  It is really incredible.  There is a lot of money in Brussels and it cannot use it.  It is the same with the southern part of Italy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018030600002#U00200"><p>As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I thank the Chairman for extending an invitation to me to attend this meeting and I thank Commissioner Oettinger for attending for this exchange of views.  It is much appreciated.  My understanding is that he is here to hear our thoughts on this process and the MFF.  I will not comb over all the issues that have already been discussed but will briefly give my view of what has been discussed.</p> <p>  In respect of overall funding, the question for every member state is whether funding for key areas we care about will be cut and if it will be cut, by how much.  The next question is whether our contributions will increase.  Obviously, the two are connected.  If we do not want to see a reduction in funding, we must increase our contributions.  Overall, broadly speaking, there is broad support across our Parliament in most political parties and within Government for some increase because we recognise that there is a huge deficit to be met post-2020 and we must all meet that together as a team, as Commissioner Oettinger noted.  </p> <p>  One of our biggest sectors is agriculture.  The CAP is a more important issue for us than it will be for other member states.  We are keenly aware that the three main member states who are supportive of CAP are France, Ireland and the UK so with the loss of the UK, the voice for CAP weakens.  Again, we are aware of this.  However, we would also make the argument that the money it generates within our economy allows us to pay our net contributions to the EU.  When Commissioner Oettinger goes to the eight remaining member states he is visiting, could he try to impress upon them the importance of CAP for the entire EU and not just those member states that may rely on it more than others?    </p> <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight met with members of the EU budget committee two weeks ago and had a very in-depth discussion about Brexit.  One of the interesting points that was made by the members of that committee was that as a Union, we need to respond more robustly to the refugee crisis and those countries that are dealing with that issue more than others and that we cannot allow those member states that are at the forefront and at the borders to shoulder all of those demands.  I would make the same point with regard to Brexit.  This is a huge crisis for us.  It is very challenging and has the potential to be hugely detrimental to our country - more than other countries.  I appreciate that every member state will be affected in some way.  As a small country on the periphery of Europe beyond the UK, we need to see real and robust support from the EU and not just talking and supportive words.  We need financial supports to deal with the possible fallout from this.  It would be important for our citizens to see that the EU family is there to back us up when we need it.  Equally, I accept that we have responsibilities in terms of the migration crisis and other crises that may come down the line in the future.  We are all part of a Union and that should mean something.  </p> <p>  Defence is my portfolio within my party.  Unlike some of the other contributors earlier, I am very supportive of increasing our defence budget, which I think is far too low.  However, efficiencies need to be made.</p><p>I think that is the same for the entire EU budget.  If we are advocating for increased spending and increased contributions, we should also talk about the efficiencies we can make across the board in how we run our business.  That will go some way towards convincing other member states that 1% is not enough and they need to come up towards 1.1%, 1.2% or maybe 1.3%.</p><p> Regarding defence, three or four weeks ago I attended a meeting in Brussels as part of the OSCE.  The purpose of that meeting was to consider how Belgium dealt with the terrorists attacks in Brussels in 2016.  We met the Belgian Minister for justice and the parliamentary committee which carried out a review on how the city and country reacted in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, how they dealt with victims and what they are doing now to deal with the threat of terrorism.  I am sure the Commissioner will agree the threat is real for every member state.  While it may be more prevalent in others than it is in Ireland, nobody is immune.  From that brief visit I learned that the threat is becoming very sophisticated and more of a challenge, and therefore becoming more costly to deal with.  Technology is advancing all the time and we need to be a step or two ahead, but at the moment we are always a step or two behind.</p><p> Regarding working together, the Commissioner made a very good point.  Why have multiple member states developing or trying to develop the same technology?  Working together makes perfect sense to me.  Recently Ireland has committed to participate in two EU projects in the area of defence.  One is in the Training Mission Competence Centre, which will train our personnel for future challenges that may come down the line.  The second is in maritime surveillance.  When we talk about defence spending, defence budget and working together, it is not all about arms, bombs and tanks.  It is about working together to build the technologies and share the knowledge we have to gain efficiencies and, as the Commissioner said, present value to the taxpayer.  It is not acceptable for some member states to sit back and say, "Well, this isn't really a problem for us now.  We don't see a threat in our country, so we will leave you to deal with that on your own."  It goes against what it means to be part of a union.  From my perspective and that of my party, we see the value in sensible and reasonable defence spending to meet the challenges today and in the future.</p><p> I finish on a point mentioned by Deputy Burton.  I welcome that youth participation is one of the key areas the Commission wants to focus on post-2020.  For younger people we need to do more on communicating and showing the value of the European Union for younger people.  The issues facing young people are the same in most countries.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to purchase their first homes.  People are having their families later.  The cost of education is rising.  All of these challenges mean it is a very difficult time for those in their 20s or 30s.  The European Union has a role to play in that.  What is the planned budget for youth participation?  What initiatives is the Commission considering?  We need to do our best to communicate those to our younger citizens across the EU to show the value of the Union into the future.</p></speech>

Does the Commissioner see any upside to Brexit?  Is there any way in which Brexit could be of benefit to Ireland and Europe?  I do not believe there is any upside.  What type of empirical work has the Commission completed in respect of the impact of a soft Brexit versus a hard Brexit for individual countries?  That would inform the approach the Commission would take.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions.  He mentioned that the overall defence budget would be about 2%.  How will it be distributed?  Will it be given to member states or will there be a new centre set up in Europe as a focus for an organised European defence?</p><p>Will there be a specific budget for European energy security?  If so how will it operate given that we are not self-sufficient in oil and gas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-06a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018030600002#W00200"><p>The Commissioner has heard the concerns about Brexit, which are clearly understood.  There is no upside to Brexit.  It is important to remember that Ireland took one for the team, as it were, in the financial crisis and we continue to carry the burden of that.  The banks do not function as they should and we continue to pay back huge amounts of money arising from that crash.  During that period, the SME sector was decimated, as was farming.  Rural areas are under considerable pressure to catch up with some of the bigger urban centres, particularly Dublin.  There is the budget under CAP in terms of rural development.  The second one is market related expenditure and direct payments.  On the social side of it is economic, social and territorial cohesion.  No one has mentioned fishing today.  Those involved in fishing have suffered immensely in the past ten years.</p><p>Ireland is doing well now.  I do not want the Commissioner to leave here without knowing that behind that national story there is another story about rural areas that cannot be ignored in terms of funding through CAP and other measures, especially the social element of it.  Therefore, the Commissioner has a very difficult job to do.  If any of these programmes are cut to the extent of 30% or whatever it might be in the end, it will have a devastating effect on our economy.  Farming is the backbone of our economy - food and dairy production for export.  All of that has been affected in the past by banking.  Many farmers are under pressure regarding their financial structure within our institutions and are receiving absolutely no support from the banks.  To compound it by having a cut in the supports from Europe will be devastating for those sectors that are beginning to improve but are carrying enormous debt from the past.  Therefore, there is a special case to be made for Ireland in terms of the banking crisis, in terms of Brexit and in terms of what we are trying to cope with <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our economy.  Central to that economy is Irish farming, rural Ireland and the SME sector.</p><p>Deputy Lisa Chambers made a point regarding convincing young people about their future in Europe.  I believe we need to convince all the citizens in the European Union of the importance of Europe because many would ask serious questions about Europe and its future.  In the context of these discussions, someone has to explain in detail the cost of the administration of Europe.  Someone has to explain the importance of Europe and where we are going.  However, we cannot forget the sectors within our economy that still have serious problems.  It is important for the Commissioner to understand that not every boat has risen and that many are still under water.  I ask the Commissioner to take those last few questions and make a closing statement.</p></speech>

Tomorrow I will be in Zagreb, Friday in Sofia, and Sunday in Berlin.  Day by day the European project needs more ambassadors than just the Commission.  It is our project.  Members of the committee and I - all of us - have to do better and do more.</p><p>Brussels bashing is the most popular game of many national governments.  If anything goes wrong it is because of these stupid bureaucrats.  If we are successful, it is because of national governments.  This game is not acceptable.  It is our European Union.  I have to convince all of our citizens and I do my best, but members of the committee have to do it also.  We have to do it.  It is not the Commission's obligation; it is a common obligation.  It is our project.  It is a project of Ireland, Germany, France, Malta and Cyprus.  It is an obligation for the Commission and all people with a mandate and a level of authority having prominence, as members of the committee have and as I have.  I do my best - not more, but I do my best.  There is no reason to accuse anybody - not members of the committee or me.<br/><br/>Maybe it was because of rural areas, agriculture and fisheries that the Commission's candidate coming from Ireland is now the Commissioner in charge.  Is that a surprise?  Considerable lobbying led to an Irish Commissioner having DG AGRI and not having another portfolio.  It is the best guarantee that the next Common Agricultural Policy is in the interest of our rural areas, our farmers and maybe especially Irish farmers.  I have a perfect relationship with him; members can be sure that we are closest partners.  In my MFF we developed from him and from me - not from me against him.  It is about trust and confidence.  I trust you and I ask you to trust me as well.  <br/><br/>Regarding energy security, I was in charge of energy for five years, which is a long time, working on electricity grids, gas pipelines, connections between Ireland and the UK, energy efficiency, diversification of routes and sources, and LNG.  Today we are much more independent and in a much better situation than we were ten years ago through investing in wind energy, supporting renewable energies and so on.  The energy union of just one energy Single Market is our vision.<br/><br/>There will be new headquarters for European defence policies, but it is not the Commission's headquarters.  The headquarters were developed through agreement of 25 member states.  We can co-finance, activate some money and organise tenders in order to be more efficient and realise added value.<br/><br/>Brexit will bring no benefit.  It is hugely damaging for the UK and it is negative for the EU 27 as well.  The winner is China and maybe President Trump.  However, we need to be cautious because these people like <i>divide et impera</i>; that is their game.  Therefore we should work together as the EU 27 in a deeper and more efficient manner than ever.  This is about the White Book process, the Bratislava and Rome process.  We have to try to stabilise and deepen our European Union after Brexit and to reduce the damage Brexit will bring.  Here Ireland is at the centre of all our work.  There is no week without a debate in the college about Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK.  Michel Barnier is really brilliant and I ask members to trust him.  Task Force 50 is competent and I ask members to trust it.</p><p>Our problem is we have a weak negotiating partner.  It is a divided government and a totally divided coalition and if we have to negotiate, it is better to have a strong partner, a reliable partner, than to have a weak partner changing its mind week by week and having no clear priority.  We are asking for the UK's priorities and we have no clear picture for the moment but we are developing several instruments and options to act and react immediately, as soon as we know what the outcome is.  In regard to this MFF and beyond, if the committee wants to meet me again I am available to come here or the committee is invited to come to Brussels, whether in June, in September or in December to discuss common reactions of the EU 27 and Irish reactions when we see the outcome and the result of the Brexit negotiations.  I know quite well the exports, the imports and the daily operative developments and that people living here are working there.  It is one island in an economic dimension.  </p><p> I must go to meet the Taoiseach as I am late.  Afterwards there is a conference with the chamber of commerce.

Is sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin a chuireamar an aighneacht seo isteach maidir leis an ngn&oacute; at&aacute; idir l&aacute;mha inniu againn.  Ba mhaith liom a aithint ag an t&uacute;s ar fad an obair iontach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an oifig sin, agus go &aacute;irithe iarChoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, a d'&eacute;irigh as, &aacute;fach, de bharr gur theip air, a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;, dul i bhfeidhm ar an gc&oacute;ras agus nach raibh s&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an dul chun cinn a rinneadh.

Go traidisi&uacute;nta bh&iacute;odh go leor daoine le Gaeilge, gan dabht, &oacute;n nGaeltacht ag teacht isteach sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; agus iadsan ar f&aacute;il agus caighde&aacute;n ard acu sa d&aacute; theanga.

M&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin aml&iacute;ne agus an 20% sin a chur ar f&aacute;il, caithfimid smaoineamh ar c&eacute;n fhad a th&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; sin.

Gan dabht, is g&aacute; infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh anseo.  D&eacute;anann an St&aacute;t infheist&iacute;ocht go laeth&uacute;il sa Bh&eacute;arla.

N&iacute; mian le Gaeilgeoir&iacute; a bheith ina nGaeilgeoir&iacute; cantalacha agus achrannacha nuair a lorga&iacute;onn siad seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Go minic, n&oacute; n&iacute;os minice n&aacute; a mhalairt, b'shin a sh&iacute;leann an St&aacute;t nuair a th&eacute;ann duine i mbun iarrachta teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis an St&aacute;t tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, mar nach bhfuil s&eacute; ann do na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il.  Faraor, t&aacute; taith&iacute; againn go l&eacute;ir, b&iacute;odh s&eacute; san earn&aacute;il oideachais, sl&aacute;inte n&oacute; in aon earn&aacute;il eile, go mb&iacute;onn ar Ghaeil iomp&uacute; ar an mB&eacute;arla chun aon dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh leis an St&aacute;t.  N&iacute; thugann s&eacute; sin cothrom na f&eacute;inne.  Is &iacute;sli&uacute; st&aacute;dais ioml&aacute;in at&aacute; ansin don Ghaeilge.</p><p> Agus sinn ag caint anois ar Sheachtain na Gaeilge agus ar thaca&iacute;ochta&iacute; don Ghaeilge, agus gach duine agus gach aon ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ag caint faoi na ruda&iacute; iontacha go l&eacute;ir a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge, m&aacute; t&aacute;imid s&aacute;sta luach a chur ar an teanga, s&iacute;limse go bhfuil an teanga n&iacute;os luachmhaire n&aacute; gn&eacute;ithe eile den chult&uacute;r agus go bhfuil an cult&uacute;r i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os boichte gan an teanga a bheith ann.  Nach ann don chult&uacute;r, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, gan an teanga?  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir in aon t&iacute;r eile n&oacute; in aon chult&uacute;r eile an d&aacute; rud a stoitheadh agus a scaradh &oacute;na ch&eacute;ile.  S&iacute;leann daoine go minic sa t&iacute;r seo gur f&eacute;idir linn cuid den chult&uacute;r a bhaineann len&aacute;r bhf&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht f&eacute;in a bheith againn gan an teanga.  Is boichte i bhfad a bheimid m&aacute; leanfaimid orainn s&iacute;os an b&oacute;thar seo.  T&aacute; deis againn anois infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh sna ruda&iacute; at&aacute; luaite agam agus is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; thar a bheith in am do bhaill an choiste seo a nglacann go bhfuil siad d&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus paiseanta agus go bhfuil sp&eacute;is acu sa Ghaeilge dul i bhfeidhm ar an gc&oacute;ras go ginear&aacute;lta le gur f&eacute;idir linn dul i bhfeidhm ar na p&aacute;irtithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la lena dheimhni&uacute; go bhfuilimid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin gceist seo.

Maidir le cumas daoine &oacute;ga an Ghaeilge a labhairt, cloisimid go r&iacute;-mhinic &eacute;, gach dara l&aacute;, go gcaitheann daoine &oacute;ga an oiread sin de bhlianta sna scoileanna agus go bhfuil siad ag teacht amach gan de chumas acu comhr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  S&iacute;leann COGG gur ceart aghaidh a thabhairt air seo mar &aacute;bhar pr&aacute;inne agus mar th&uacute;s air seo gur g&aacute; f&eacute;achaint ar scr&uacute;d&uacute; agus ar shiollabas na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta.  F&oacute;gra&iacute;odh sa bhliain 2007 go raibh athr&uacute; ag teacht ar an siollabas.

D&eacute;antar &eacute; seo sa Bhreatain Bheag, san Alban agus i dt&iacute;ortha eile le breis is teanga oifigi&uacute;il amh&aacute;in ar fud an domhain.  Bh&iacute; an Taoiseach reatha, an Teachta Leo Varadkar, nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina Aire Iompair, Turas&oacute;ireachta agus Sp&oacute;irt ar son an mholadh seo.  Chuir Cathaoirleach an comhchoiste Oireachtais ar iompair, an Teachta Fergus &Oacute; Dubhda, in i&uacute;l ag an gcoiste seo roimh na Nollaig go raibh s&eacute; ar son an mholadh seo.  Ghlac an comhchoiste iompair leis an moladh c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach mbeadh s&eacute; curtha san &aacute;ireamh sna ceannteidil agus sa Bhille at&aacute; le teacht?  N&iacute;l aon duine ag caint faoi na comhartha&iacute; a athr&uacute; thar o&iacute;che ach iad a athr&uacute; de r&eacute;ir is gur g&aacute; iad a athnuachan n&oacute; cinn nua a chrochadh.</p><p> Ar n&oacute;s sa Bhreatain Bheag, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ini&uacute;chadh d&eacute;anta ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga &oacute; thaobh na teanga de ar reachta&iacute;ocht mholta agus ar aon strait&eacute;is phoibl&iacute; a bhaineann le teanga oifigi&uacute;il a chur chun cinn, mar shampla, an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Ceann de na heasnaimh is m&oacute; at&aacute; ann le cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise n&aacute; nach bhfuil aon dream neamhsple&aacute;ch ag d&eacute;anamh monat&oacute;ireachta air.  S&iacute;limid gurb &eacute; seo rud gur bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a chur sa reachta&iacute;ocht leis an dualgas sin a thabhairt don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin ach sa Bhreatain Bheag, mar a luaigh m&eacute;, t&aacute; siad tosaithe ag breathn&uacute; ar reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ag dul tr&iacute;d gach Roinn ann.  N&iacute;l aon f&aacute;th nach nd&eacute;anfadh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in &Eacute;irinn an rud ceanann c&eacute;anna.</p><p> Ba ch&oacute;ir go dtiocfadh gach comhlacht poibl&iacute; agus gach feidhm de chuid an chomhlachta poibl&iacute; a bheidh idirghn&iacute;omha&iacute;ocht ag an bpobal leis agus a roinnfear ar chomhlacht eile faoi r&eacute;im an Achta go huathoibr&iacute;och.  T&oacute;g, mar shampla, Dublin Bikes.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, m&aacute; dh&eacute;anann Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath a dhualgas a thamligean &oacute; thaobh rothair a chur ar f&aacute;il sa chathair go dt&iacute; comhlacht neamhsple&aacute;ch, n&iacute; thagann an comhlacht sin faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus n&iacute;l g&aacute; don chomhlacht aon sheirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il don phobal tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Mar gheall air sin, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liomsa f&oacute;s cl&aacute;r&uacute; ar l&iacute;ne le Dublin Bikes tr&iacute; Ghaeilge chun na rothair a fh&aacute;il ar iasacht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin mar an gc&eacute;anna d'aon dhuine le Gaeilge.  T&aacute;imid ag lorg go dtiocfadh siad go huathoibr&iacute;och faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la m&aacute; t&aacute; siad ag pl&eacute; leis an bpobal n&oacute; ag f&aacute;il oibre &oacute; chomhlacht St&aacute;it.</p><p> N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh dreamanna ar n&oacute;s An Post in ann dualgais a 9 den Acht reatha a sheachaint maidir le h&aacute;bhair marga&iacute;ochta a cuirtear ar f&aacute;il don phobal mar gheall nach raibh na dualgais soil&eacute;ir a dh&oacute;thain in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  M&aacute; dh&eacute;anann comhlacht poibl&iacute; n&oacute; Roinn teagmh&aacute;il ar bith leis an bpobal, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an teagmh&aacute;il sin d&eacute;anta go d&aacute;theangach n&oacute; i nGaeilge amh&aacute;in agus n&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir ligint d&rsquo;eisceachta&iacute; mar at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  Faighimse ruda&iacute; i mo bhosca poist go rialta agus den chuid is m&oacute; b&iacute;onn siad as B&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in.  An f&aacute;th leis sin n&aacute; go bhfuil sol&uacute;bthacht f&aacute;gtha san Acht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; marga&iacute;ochta agus eile.  T&aacute; g&aacute; ann &eacute; sin a bhaint amach agus a chinnti&uacute; nach dtarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; a thuilleadh.</p><p> Th&aacute;inig moladh praitici&uacute;il agus r&eacute;as&uacute;nta chun tosaigh le d&eacute;ana&iacute; sa chonradh agus ba ch&oacute;ir &eacute; a chur san &aacute;ireamh in aon Acht nua.  Is &eacute; sin go mbeidh an ceart c&eacute;anna ag aon duine ag obair sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s lena chuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh leis an St&aacute;t tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Mar shampla, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an pr&oacute;iseas ard&uacute; c&eacute;ime, an pr&oacute;iseas meas&uacute;naithe foirne agus comhfhreagras inmhe&aacute;nach don fhoireann agus araile ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge do na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s&iacute; le Gaeilge.  Conas gur f&eacute;idir linn st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh a bheadh s&aacute;sta an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id go lean&uacute;nach a choth&uacute; muna bhfuil an St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras f&eacute;in ag freastal orthu?  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh daoine a spreagadh chun Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id go lean&uacute;nach sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras, is cinnte go gcaithfidh an St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras freastal orthu sa ch&eacute;ad &aacute;it.</p><p> Cuirtear cosc uaireanta ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge san ionad oibre gan bun n&aacute; barr a bheith leis an gcosc c&eacute;anna.  Is plean&aacute;il teanga f&iacute;or-&eacute;ifeachtach sa treo m&iacute;cheart &eacute; ar g&aacute; &aacute; chosc m&aacute; t&aacute;imid le cur le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa tsocha&iacute; seo.</p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as &eacute;isteacht liom inniu.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom aon cheisteanna at&aacute; ag an gcoiste a fhreagairt n&oacute; aon soil&eacute;iri&uacute; at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il a thabhairt.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an aitheasc sin an-suimi&uacute;il.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; anseo don ch&eacute;ad seisi&uacute;n don chruinni&uacute; seo.  Mar sin, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuilimid ag an staid seo leis an mBille seo.  T&aacute; an Bille &aacute; phl&eacute; againn le fada an l&aacute; sna Tithe anseo.  T&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; maithe sa Bhille agus caithfimid iad a aithint.  T&aacute; laigeachta&iacute; ann freisin agus sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil coiste ann.  Beimid in ann d&iacute;ri&uacute; orthu agus, m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir, iad a dheisi&uacute;.</p> <p>  T&aacute; go leor in aghaidh na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; siad ag iarraidh cur isteach ar an nGaeilge toisc an costas a bhaineann leis an teanga.  Nuair a fheicimid ar Bille cos&uacute;il leis an gceann seo, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir, m&aacute; dh&eacute;anann an Rialtas ruda&iacute; i gceart &oacute;n t&uacute;s, nach mbeadh aon costas breise i gc&aacute;s i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Mar shampla, m&aacute; chuireann siad comhartha&iacute; b&oacute;thair dh&aacute;theangach as seo amach, n&iacute; bheadh costas ag baint leis sin ar chor ar bith.  Labhair mise leis an Aire, an Teachta Ross, faoin rud seo.  D'iarr m&eacute; air an mbeadh s&eacute; s&aacute;sta dul leis seo agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; liom i rith an comhr&aacute; de c&uacute;ig n&oacute; deich n&oacute;imead a bh&iacute; againn nach mbeadh fadhb ar bith aige leis na ruda&iacute; seo.  T&aacute; na comhartha&iacute; seo i bhfeidhm in Aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus n&iacute;l daoine caillte i Timbuktu n&oacute; i Tenerife ag an bomaite.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil daoine in ann iad a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; siad &aacute; n-&uacute;s&aacute;id go forleathan thar lear.  Ba cheart go mbeadh in ann leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an rud seo.</p> <p>  B&iacute;onn an Rialtas i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag gear&aacute;n faoin gcostas a bhaineann le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do shaor&aacute;naigh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  D&aacute; earca&iacute;tear daoine at&aacute; in ann a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, n&iacute; bheadh aon chostas ag baint leis sin ar chor ar bith.</p> <p>  Beidh gear&aacute;n ann faoi na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agus ba cheart d&uacute;inn iad a phl&eacute;.  An bhfuil an comhr&eacute;ir a luadh sodh&eacute;anta?  Beidh an Rialtas ag r&aacute; go gcaithfimid &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i sl&iacute; fadt&eacute;armach.  N&iacute; haonta&iacute;m leis an tuairim sin.  An bhfuil 2020 mar spriocbhliain sodh&eacute;anta chun &eacute; a chur i bhfeidhm?  Caithfeadh impleachta&iacute; a bheith ann maidir le neamhcomhl&iacute;onadh leis na rialacha agus leis an dl&iacute; agus na r&aacute;itis agus tuarasc&aacute;il a thagann as Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.</p><p>Is l&eacute;ir d'&eacute;inne at&aacute; ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an &aacute;bhar seo go mb&iacute;onn na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag tabhairt neamhaird don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil ruda&iacute; ag dul i bhfeabhas le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas, ach t&aacute; a fhios agam go mb&iacute;onn eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it cos&uacute;il le hOifig na nOibreacha Poibl&iacute; f&oacute;s ag s&aacute;r&uacute; a gcuid dualgais maidir leis an dl&iacute;.  Nuair a chuirtear glaoch ar Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga, t&eacute;ann s&eacute; i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an eagra&iacute;ocht at&aacute; i gceist agus deis&iacute;tear an fhadhb.  B&iacute;onn s&eacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna an ch&eacute;ad uair eile, &aacute;fach.  B&iacute;onn s&eacute; briste ar&iacute;s.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin an-chuid ama, airgid agus iarrachta am&uacute;.  N&iacute; bheadh an fhadhb sin ann ar chor ar bith d&aacute; mbeadh bata m&oacute;r de chine&aacute;l &eacute;igin i gceist.  Ba cheart go mbeadh cair&eacute;ad &eacute;igin i gceist freisin chun cabhr&uacute; leis na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a gcuid dualgais a chomhl&iacute;onadh.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh do rud beag nach bhfuil luaite go dt&iacute; seo.  Baineann s&eacute; le feachtas ollmh&oacute;r a bh&iacute; ann tr&iacute; mh&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre mh&iacute; &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; go leor eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus comhlachta&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; sa t&iacute;r seo ar bhonn cead&uacute;nais a fhaigheann siad &oacute;n Rialtas.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh ar na bainc agus na comhlachta&iacute; &aacute;rachais, mar shampla.  &Uacute;s&aacute;ideann go leor comhlachta&iacute; idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta an Ghaeilge i slite iontacha, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte go bhfuil go leor comhlachta&iacute; &Eacute;ireannacha f&oacute;s ann a dh&eacute;anann neamhaird ioml&aacute;n ar an teanga.  N&iacute; thuigeann siad an deis, n&oacute; an competitive advantage, at&aacute; i gceist anseo.  An ceart d&uacute;inn rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh chun dualgas a chur ar na bainc, n&oacute; na comhlachta&iacute; &aacute;rachais, n&iacute;os m&oacute; measa a thaispe&aacute;int agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id?  Is f&eacute;idir linn a chruth&uacute; go bhfuil dualgais ar chomhlachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; anseo an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Chuala muid c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin gur cuireadh iachall ar dhuine taobh istigh in AA Ireland a bh&iacute; ag labhairt Gaeilge le custaim&eacute;ir ar a thoil f&eacute;in athr&uacute; go B&eacute;arla.  C&eacute;ard ba cheart don Rialtas agus don St&aacute;t a dh&eacute;anamh sna c&aacute;sanna sin?</p></speech>
