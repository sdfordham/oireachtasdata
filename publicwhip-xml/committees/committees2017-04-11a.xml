A sum of &euro;15 million has been set aside for the roll out of the national broadband plan this year.  Clearly the Minister does not expect to have too many homes connected under the national broadband plan if &euro;15 million is all that is being set aside.  I am anxious for the Minister to give us an indication of when he expects that tender to go to the marketplace.  I refer to the acceptance by the Minister and his Department that eir is legitimate in its desire to connect the 300,000 homes or premises identified by it back in 2015.  Does he believe that will now have an impact in terms of putting the tender to the marketplace?  Will he let us know if he has had any legal or other communication from the two remaining bidders and if, in light of any communication or concerns they might have, he expects there will be any delay in the roll out of the tender?</p> <p>  On Eircode, the Minister and I have had various different communications both in committee and in the D&aacute;il about whether it is a viable method any more.  Will he update the committee on his opinion?  Will he explain how one gets an Eircode?  I had an interesting case in my constituency office recently where somebody who has built a home and wants broadband in it was asked for their Eircode.  They did not have an Eircode and sought one.  They could not get an Eircode and they have been bounced around and may have to wait for one.</p><p>In order to procure broadband, which they really want - they are not overly exercised about postcodes - they have been told they need to get a postcode and it will assist them in getting broadband.  They are not able to get postcodes.  The Minister might throw some light on that matter for me.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has indicated that it is not his responsibility.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will accept responsibility for providing such postcodes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12017041100002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I refer to the &euro;15 million of the &euro;20 million allocated in 2017 for the national broadband plan.  Does the Minister consider the money to be adequate if the procurement process will be closed this year, as he said it would be?  The earlier false dawns were not the fault of the Minister, but the programme for Government stated this was all supposed to happen late last year.  The process then carried over into this year because, we were told, it is very complicated from a legal point of view.  Will the &euro;15 million be adequate to complete the procurement process this year?  I am concerned about the timeline.</p> <p>  In terms of the national broadband plan, I have looked at the map that was given to us last week carefully, in particular the breakdown by county.  Eir and the Department may say they are not cherry-picking, but in my county or the one next door, Kildare, in particular south Kildare, I can see on the map the heavy blue sections where it is commercially viable to provide broadband.  The light blue sections show where Eir will provide broadband on a commercial basis.</p> <p>  I am very happy that more people will get broadband, because more people need to be connected.  I can clearly identify from the maps the pockets of population in terms of towns, villages and large-scale developments.  People outside of those areas are outside of the broadband system.  Large tracts of land, including some in the Minister's constituency, will not be covered. </p> <p>  I know Eir is exercised about what I have said, which is fair enough.  There are three commercial bidders.  If the rich pickings in areas that are easy to get to are taken out of the equation, it causes a difficulty in terms of the overall tendering process and the level of interest from other bidders.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether contact has been made by the other two bidders regarding the commercial or legal difficulties that may arise on the back of the decision and announcement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12017041100002#C00700"><p>I will deal with postcodes first.  I will group the questions together, because that is probably the easiest way to proceed.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked about the percentage of people who know their postcode.  I do not have those figures available to me.  Anecdotally from my own experience, and I am sure every member of the committee would find the same, people in rural areas in particular are now seeing the value of their postcodes since they have been available on Google maps and satellite systems.  They no longer have to give directions.  If they give their postcodes they can be inputted into the satellite navigation system.  </p> <p>  As Members know, this is now available to the ambulance service in its centres so it can deploy ambulances and ensure that ambulances actually go to the correct properties.  As I said to Deputy Dooley, townlands like Milltown are littered on over this country.  People are in a panic when they have to give directions to make sure ambulances go to the correct locations.  We have heard of numerous examples regarding ambulances, in particular in Kerry where there was some national publicity about ambulances that went to townlands in north Kerry when an emergency was in south Kerry.  If people know their postcodes that will address that particular issue.</p> <p>  There has been an increased interest in postcodes.  Since postcodes were launched in 2015, there have been &euro;10 million look-ups and just short of 20,000 hits a day on the postcode finder.  A direction has been issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Form to all Government Departments and agencies that when they are revising their data systems they make provision for postcodes.  Some have done so already.  The register of electors now contains postcodes, which makes it easier to identify individuals and families and access them in order to carry out physical visits.</p> <p>  It is catching on.  Far more businesses are using postcodes and the second anniversary will occur mid-year.  Members will see at that stage there are more contracts in regard to users of the service.  Considering that this is a long game and is not supposed to have a very short impact, nonetheless it has already had a significant impact.  It is dealing with issues that are affecting people such as directions, in particular emergency services.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked me how one gets a postcode.  First, data is collated by An Post which is sent to GeoDirectory, an agency of An Post which liaises directly with Eircode.  I know from representations I have received as Minister that there seems to be a delay in the system.  I met the new chief executive of GeoDirectory earlier today and raise the issue with him.  I understand later this week there will be a meeting between GeoDirectory and Eircode to see whether they can resolve some of the outstanding issues.  The Deputy is correct.  There is frustration about the current system.</p> <p>  The national broadband plan has two aspects.  One is the commercial aspect.  Across Ireland, 1.4 million homes have been connected under the commercial aspect of the national broadband plan.  Commercial companies are spending about &euro;1.6 million per day rolling out a network as we speak.  It involves fibre to homes and the cabinet, wireless and mobile broadband.  The final cohort involves approximately 750,000 premises. </p> <p>  We conducted an analysis of urban areas where commercial operators said they would provide broadband commercially and realised that about 84,500 premises were unlikely to get high-speed broadband to their homes.  We included them in the intervention area.  That brought the figure to over 800,000 premises across the country.  Deputy Dooley is correct.  Eir has said for a long time that it would provide high-speed broadband to 300,000 homes in rural areas.  We have all had experience of Eir giving commitments in the past. </p> <p>  We have made it crystal clear within my Department that we would amend the map for Eir or any other operator if it was prepared to sign a commitment agreement.  We entered into discussions with Eir on that in late October or early November.  Those discussions concluded at the end of last month.  On foot of that, we signed the contract.   That now means that fibre will be brought in 90% of cases to those 300,000 homes at a rate of passing one house every minute of every working day over the next 90 weeks.</p><p>It is my intention that after the completion of this, the momentum will continue until every single home has access to high-speed broadband.  As I have said before in the House and publicly, I am not getting hung up on dates.  I am focused on delivery.  I have been able to bring forward the delivery of broadband services with which people can get speeds equivalent to 1,000 Mbps.  This is the same as 200 high-definition Netflix channels going at the one time in the one home with no drop-off in service.  That is the type of broadband that is only available in places like South Korea.  Even parts of New York do not have that type of service.</p><p> We are bringing a future-proofed network to rural areas.  Deputy Stanley asked me if the company is cherry-picking.  The non-commercial aspect of the national broadband plan clearly deals with this in that the State would intervene where it was not commercially viable for an operator to provide high-speed broadband to those premises.  Where there is a commercial operator willing to do that, then the State cannot intervene because of EU state aid rules.  We have made sure that this company, which is spending &euro;200 million of its money, will be tied into a contract in which we have bound it to targets on a quarterly and annual basis, so it ensures at least 30,000 homes a quarter are passed and that 95% of people who apply for a connection get one within 20 days.  That is a significant improvement on the current situation.</p><p> If I am Minister in 90 weeks&rsquo; time, in my term I will have overseen one in four premises getting access to high-speed broadband.  That is a significant improvement on the situation we had last year when people were canvassing and we had a deplorable broadband situation.  We are not neglecting the people outside the light blue and dark blue areas.  I accept the people in the amber areas are on the final stage of the State intervention in the national broadband plan.  We are working with mobile phone companies and wireless operators to assist them in the roll-out of their networks with the release of the 3.6 GHz spectrum.  We are working with local authorities and the National Roads Authority to release ducting.  The mobile and wireless broadband task force is making significant progress in tackling bottlenecks, which is assisting companies on a commercial basis in rolling out networks to the four corners of this country.  In tandem with that, we have provided funds to RTE to begin to release the 700 MHz spectrum which will provide 5G coverage.  It is my firm view that this should be done on a geographical rather than a population basis.  This will mean that the whole country will have access to 5G broadband.</p><p> The &euro;15 million will be adequate to complete the procurement process.  We are already going through the procurement and tender process.  We are working on a 1,000 page, 25-year contract.  It has to be future-proofed for those 25 years and it is important that we get it right.</p><p> The only communication I have seen from the other two bidders is what has been put out in their statements.  The announcement we made this day last week would not come as a surprise to them.  I am determined to make sure Eir fulfils its role and the winning bidders fulfil their roles so we can have high-speed broadband provided to every single rural premises as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1240" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12017041100002#D00200"><p>I welcome the arrangement and agreement the Minister has come to with Eir.  It is positive news and is welcome.  I compliment the Minister on his personal interest in moving this matter forward.  It is a significant issue in rural Ireland.  At last people see something positive is happening and some day soon all will be connected to a proper level of broadband service.</p> <p>  On the Eir agreement, what oversight is in place for that?  Who measures the delivery and performance?  What strictures are in place in the event of it not reaching its targets and objectives?  The Minister mentioned that he would have momentum built at that stage and would be rolling it out further.  What are his views on building on that momentum?  What mechanisms will he use to achieve that?  What is the timescale involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12017041100002#D00300"><p>It is good news that homes are being connected and there is a timeline for it.  However, I still have concerns about the 300,000 homes to be connected.  I will put the connection of the 750,000 homes in the following scenario.  The Minister has 75 acres of land and he wants to sell them to me.  However, in the meantime, he decides to sell off 30 of the best acres to Deputy Lowry, for example.  That means 45 acres of marginal land are left which is less attractive.</p> <p>  If this broadband roll-out is done as a package, it is aggregated out better.  Whichever one of the three bidders does it and is dealing with the full 750,000 households, it means the easy-to-reach ones will be done in this 90-week bundle as they are more commercially viable.  The aggregate cost of trying to get to the hard-to-reach houses in the more difficult areas of counties Roscommon or Laois would balance out.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that 300,000 easy-to-reach homes will be connected in the plan.  It is happy days for them and many people in my constituency will benefit from it.  However, like the 30 good acres which were sold, for the 400,000 homes outside of that, it will be less attractive for the companies to connect them.  Will a larger subvention be required per household from the taxpayer because whoever takes on these 400,000 premises has a harder job to do?</p></speech>

It is there for everybody to see exactly what Eir has signed up to.  It will be reporting quarterly to us and we will be publishing those figures.</p> <p>  Taking Deputy Stanley&rsquo;s example we are not selling land but putting infrastructure into it.  It is more like we are draining the land.  If we put a drain through the good 30 acres, the marginal land will benefit more.  One has to go through the good land to get to the bad land anyway.  We are going to have fibre built out to one third of farms across this country over the next 89 weeks.  Whoever is the successful bidder, or bidders, for the final two thirds of farms which need broadband, they can plug into that network that is already constructed.</p><p>Part of the heavy lifting is done in relation to that.  <br/><br/>We honestly do not know about costs and potential costs because we are in the procurement process so we will have to see what comes back on foot of that.  Eir is spending &euro;200 million of its own money.  To answer Deputy Lowry's question, we have bound it to a contract which has built-in penalties.  The detail of the penalties and their financial implications are confidential.  That is one of the few things that is not on the contract that is available on the website.  We have set binding targets for every single quarter over the next 89 weeks.  Eir will return those figures to us and we will spot check those.  It is very easy to see where the cable has or has not been laid.  I have asked the officials to give me a full list of the areas across the country so as I travel around the country I can look and see for myself if the cable is on the poles or not.  We will do individual spot-checks to see if they have passed a particular area.  It is also our intention to publish that information as it becomes available to us.  For example, in my own parish of Drum, where it has already brought the fibre out, people will tell you very quickly if Eir has said it has delivered broadband to that area and the cable is not there.  By putting as much information as possible into the public domain, people will identify it very quickly.  We will publish the targets as they are delivered upon on <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>, listing the areas where broadband has been provided.  As the fibre is delivered to particular areas, they will turn from light blue to dark blue on the website, so people can see as it is being rolled out across the country.  <br/><br/>On building on momentum, in a lot of cases subcontractors do this work.  Many of those are working for all the operators.  They will be able to continue on with the roll-out of that network.  We hope to be in a position to have the vast majority of the country completed by 2020, based on the current rate of roll-out.  Deputy Stanley is correct that the further down that road one gets, one will get to more isolated locations.  That is why we have never given a definitive commitment that it will be a fibre solution to every single home.  We have never given a definitive answer for when the last home will be connected because we just do not know.  If we are talking about going up the side of a mountain, it is very difficult to say what the technical challenges are going to be for individual premises in individual locations.  The last community in the country to get electricity was 40 or 50 years after the first one because of some of the technology challenges.  I do not envisage anything like that happening on this occasion.<br/><br/>It is also important to remember that we already have two cable networks going to the vast majority of premises in Ireland already, the electricity network and the telephone network.  In one form or another, all the operators are looking to piggy-back on some or all of that network so that should help to assist the physical roll-out of that network when the contract is ultimately awarded.</p></speech>

It covers items such as the trading online voucher scheme which has &euro;3 million allocated.  It was disappointingly under-spent last year.  I know that some members of this committee have been very active in going out to businesses and encouraging them to trade online and I encourage other members of the committee and Members of the Oireachtas to do likewise.  We are providing a grant of up to &euro;2,500, a 50-50 grant, for a business to establish a website and to put in the back office sales aspect needed to take payments online.  Up to 30% of that grant aid is also available for online marketing.  It gives businesses which are currently offline the opportunity to start trading online.  It is for any business of up to ten employees.  People can apply through their local enterprise office.</p> <p>  The other aspects of that vote are the national digital strategy including the benefit scheme, there is &euro;1.6 million allocated for that, and the cyber security operational funding for which &euro;1.95 million is allocated and which we expect will be ramped up over coming years as capacity in that area is increased.  There is  &euro;0.4 million is allocated for the emergency call answering services and we are in the middle of a tender process for that now.</p></speech>

I have seen many businesses in my own constituency avail of it and the local enterprise office has been very proactive in pushing it out and encouraging its usage.  When my own constituency office highlighted it, it was inundated with local businesses coming in and asking questions about how they could avail of it.  It is a success story all round.  I also take the Minister's point that there was not the take-up there might have been, as there were allocations that were not drawn down.</p> <p>  According to the local enterprise office which was to the forefront of pushing out the scheme, there was some feedback from the businesses that the scheme was all or nothing.  They could draw down the voucher of up to &euro;2,500 but some of them may have just wanted to take &euro;1,000 to do a bit of dabbling, put up a website and get it going and then maybe six months later they could put in a back office, with a sales side or whatever it was, but they could not draw down in tranches.  Apparently, this was a problem for some businesses especially if they were putting their first toe into the water of the Internet, that they drew down a small amount, thinking they could complete the job later in the year but were then told that they had put in their application.  They would nearly have been better off putting in for the full &euro;2,500 but then they may not have had immediate use for that.  I am sure they could have found it but it would not have been the optimum use.  Maybe the Minister and the Department could look at whether in the future the scheme could be allocated in installments or drawn down as it is used.  The local enterprise office has said that while it is a very useful and popular scheme that has been a practical issue.</p></speech>

Last year's target was to issue 3,000 vouchers by the end of 2016.  We are at 2,930.  Off the top of my head, the average spend on it is roughly &euro;1,400.  This has a huge impact.  It increases sales by an average of one fifth, it increases employment by one third and two thirds of those businesses are now trading internationally.  In my own constituency, in Cormicans, a business selling school books which operated entirely out of two shops, one in Roscommon and one in Athlone, started trading online.  Now they have sold Irish school books into the Middle East.</p><p>There is potential for every business.  Money is going into provincial towns from international sources that would never have gone into those towns in the first place.  I actively encourage people to avail of it.</p><p> The administration involved in breaking it down on a step-by-step basis would be quite complicated, and that is the reason it has not been done to date.  We have reviewed the operation of the scheme and will be announcing changes to it to assist people with it, but it has been a phenomenal success.  We are trying to deal with some of the anomalies in it.  That issue has not come to my attention to date, but we will look at it.</p></speech>

RTE and TG4 are funded through a mix of commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising, Exchequer grant payments and licence fee revenues.  Broadcast licensing fee receipts are estimated to be &euro;222 million in 2017.  The broadcasting programme provides &euro;190.7 million in TV licence fee receipts to RTE to enable the company to meet its statutory obligations as a national public service broadcaster.  In addition, the programme provides &euro;4.2 million in TV licence fee receipts and &euro;29.5 million in grant payments to TG4 to produce a comprehensive range of programming in the Irish language.  Programme B also forms new Irish television and radio programmes through the broadcasting fund, operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The fund receives 7% of net television licence fee receipts, which amounts to &euro;14.7 million in 2017.</p></speech>

There is huge concern, particularly for low and middle income households that there would be no increase in that fee and that the improvements would come by way of the &euro;40 million that is not being collected.  I do not know how accurate the reports are, but there is a company that is already involved in collecting licence fees in England and there certainly have been difficulties with it in terms of the methods it is using to collect money.  Issues could arise from that.  I would be concerned about a bunch of heavies going around to collect licence fees.  We have seen this in other areas.  Up to now it has been An Post.  In general, it has been reasonably professional in how it has been carried out but I just wanted to flag that concern.  We have discussed other options in this forum and in the Chamber.  There are other methods that could be looked at that are used internationally and they should be examined carefully.</p> <p>  I know there is a difficulty with trying to tackle high wages at RTE because some of the people who are on the largest sums of money in RTE are contracting companies.  That should be looked at.  The idea of somebody getting &euro;250,000 for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning does not wash with the public, particularly in light of the fact that we are asking the public to put in more money and asking for greater compliance.  We want people to get value for money for their licence fee.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in want a strong public broadcasting sector.  It is important that we maintain, retain and improve it.  </p> <p>  The key points are that we should ensure there is no increase in the licence fee and that we do try to improve compliance without using private contractors.  There is also the excessive wages of a small number of people.  It is a semi-State company.  I know that there is a legal point made about these people being self-employed.  That is also being used in the construction industry for a separate set of reasons, but in the case of RTE it appears to be used as a way to ensure that people are paid excessive incomes where they are not direct employees.</p></speech>

That is 500 people between 2008 and 2013.  Since December 2015 pay restoration has begun at the broadcaster, beginning with the lowest paid workers.  Individual contracts are a matter for the company itself and not a matter that I, as Minister for Communication, Climate Action and Environment, can get involved in.</p> <p>  It is not my intention or plan, as I have said here before, to increase the television licence fee.  I have made that crystal clear to RTE.  There are opportunities there where people are not paying for the service and expect everyone else to pay for it.  If we increase the TV licence fee the people who pay for everything and get nothing are the ones who are going to have to pay again for this and the people who are prepared to pay for nothing will get away with it again.  We will bring forward legislation in the coming weeks which will be brought before the committee at the heads of Bill stage for its views on it.  We hope to be able to allow me, as Minister, to seek a tender for the TV licence inspection regime.  It is my intention that local post offices will still sell the TV licence and people will still be able to purchase one in them.</p><p>An Post currently holds the contract in regard to television licence inspection.  Under the existing legislation, I cannot put that out to tender but I am seeking the flexibility to allow me to do so.  An Post may bid for the new contract, as might others.  I do not know at this stage who might be interested in it.  We have issued an expression of interest notice.  As I said, I do not have the power or the authority to put that contract to tender.  There is a significant scale of evasion - &euro;40 million is a substantial amount of money.  As I said earlier, there has been a significant fall-off in advertising.  There is now more money being spent on advertising in the digital market than on terrestrial television.  This is a growing trend.  If we want to have quality programming and news and current affairs on our terrestrial channels, then we will have to pay for it.  We need that in a functioning democracy.</p></speech>

The &euro;72.5 million provided for the better energy grant programmes, operated by the SEAI, include the better energy home scheme to provide grants towards a range of energy efficiency measures to home owners, the better energy warmer home scheme to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures free-of-charge to low income households and the better energy communities programme to encourage community-based partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock and poor energy homes.</p> <p>  The three schemes are anticipated to deliver energy savings of 182 gigawatts per hour in 2017 and will provide around 8,200 low-income homes with energy efficiency measures while continuing to stimulate activity in the retrofit industry, supporting approximately 3,000 jobs.  The energy programme also provides for expenditure to fund applied energy research and demonstration programmes and projects.</p></speech>

A problem has arisen in regard to some of the houses built between the 1950s and 2007.  Many of these houses were never insulated and are difficult to insulate now, and many of the people living in them are experiencing fuel poverty.  Are there plans to target these houses which are in dire need of insulation?  I can point to examples of houses built in 2005 and 2006 which have been insulated and re-insulated while around the corner from them there are houses that were built in the 1930s with no insulation, which are inhabited by vulnerable people such as pensioners and people in receipt of disability benefits.  I acknowledge that much good work is being done.</p></speech>

Most or all of those houses should have been insulated at this stage.  If not, we need to know about them.  These houses were the easiest to retrofit and that work should now be completed.  A number of community organisations have operated a rolling scheme over the past number of years to deal with those homes.  As far as I can recall, over 300,000 houses have been completed at this stage.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that only limited retrofitting of houses with solid walls is possible.  Some of them were done and some were not.  Earlier this year, under the better energy and warmer homes schemes, I announced that houses in respect of which it was only possible to insulate the attic would be revisited with a view to their being externally or internally insulated free of charge.  This will cost, on average, &euro;20,000 per home, which is a substantial amount of money.  Up to now, families whose attics were insulated were ineligible for a second round.  Under the new measure, they are no longer deemed ineligible.  The remaining houses in respect of which there was no retrofit of attics or otherwise because they had solid walls will also be externally or internally insulated.  </p> <p>  The Deputy will be interested to know that we are currently finalising details of a pilot scheme for the approximately one in five homes, particularly in the midlands, whose only source of heating is solid fuel, mainly turf.</p></speech>

Under the pilot scheme, we will be spending approximately &euro;20,000 on those homes in terms of retrofitting, insulation and the installation of a renewable source of heating.</p> <p>  In regard to the warmer homes scheme, we are also considering the use of a renewable source of heating for houses eligible under that scheme.  This may be an attractive scheme to elderly people in particular who are no longer able to carry turf to the range and find it difficult to take out ashes and so on.  They can then act as the benchmark for other people in the community to have that work done.  </p> <p>  We also need to address the issue of fuel poverty.  Fuel poverty is not only a problem for people on low incomes.  There are many families paying mortgages, child care costs and so on that have very limited disposable income.  We are also considering the introduction of a retrofit scheme for such families under the better energy homes scheme.  Under that scheme, families would eligible for a 50% grant.  For families that have cash or have access to capital, that is great.  We are working with the SEAI, the NTMA and the European Investment Bank to put a suite of funding models in place for domestic customers.  This will allow families to pay for this work incrementally on their electricity or gas bills over an extended timeframe.  Some families may be able to raise a loan to part-fund the work and others may be able to come up with the cash necessary, but there are a number of funding models available to them to put the matching 50% funding in place.  We are putting aside &euro;5 million for this scheme this year to deal with some of the technical challenges arising, including taking fossil fuels out of those homes.</p><p>The private capital that is available will be used to significantly ramp up those schemes from this year on.</p></speech>

What research is being done and what is the goal of the programmes?  Are they renewable energy programmes?  In a similar vein, C7 covers subscriptions to international organisations.  Which organisations are they?  Members attended a renewable energy conference towards the end of last year.  While the Brexit fall-out and international co-operation are very important, things like the interconnector came up at the conference which involves a difficulty since we no longer have a land bridge to mainland Europe in terms of energy interconnection.  There were a few suggestions doing the rounds around that.  It may be that international organisations come into that space.  I am looking for an overview on those two headings to see what we are doing there.</p></speech>

When the next COP takes place in Bonn later this year, I would like to see representation from the committee in attendance.  It would be very useful for members to have the opportunity to meet with colleagues from all over the world.  Having members in attendance would allow us to liaise to cover a great many more of the seminars taking place.  Some really interesting work is going on there.  At a technical and expert level, we have only a limited team of people.  While we had some assistance from a number of NGOs that attended, I was disappointed having spoken to other delegations and found that quite a lot of them included parliamentary representation.  As such, I urge the committee to ensure there is a strong representation the next time.  Climate issues go right across the board.  This is not just a matter of the climate agenda and the environment, but of agriculture and transport also.  It may be that members from other committees could also be involved in some of the sessions.</p> <p>  To answer the question, the subscriptions are to the International Energy Agency, to which, in fact, I am giving the keynote address in Paris in June on behalf of Ireland, the Energy Charter Secretariat, the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum.  The energy research programmes involve the ESRI, the International Energy Research Centre, and the Energy Policy and Statistical Support Unit.  Those three bodies are very much involved in providing data and information to me as Minister and to the Department.  We have used that data in our negotiations on the ETS and the non-ETS sides at European level.  The other major research areas include renewable energy research development and deployment for which &euro;1.2 million has been allocated and the Department's research and development on energy policy to which &euro;500,000 has been allocated.  The large bulk of the money, which is &euro;4.75 million, relates to ocean energy development.</p> <p>  The reason we have invested significant money into ocean energy development is that nine tenths of the area under Ireland's jurisdiction is underwater.  We have probably one of the best ocean energy resources in the world.  Ourselves, Portugal and Scotland are probably at the leading edge in relation to this.  Scotland, in particular, is well ahead of us.  As Minister, I signed a co-operation agreement with six other northern European states, both EU member states and non-EEA states, to consider how we can co-operate together and share data and research.  We have three test facilities in Ireland for ocean energy, including a lab-scale research facility in Cork, a quarter-scale research facility in Galway Bay and a full-scale facility off the coast of Mayo.  We also have the added attraction of a grid connection into the Shannon Estuary at Moneypoint and an allocation of funding under the REFIT scheme to take up to 30 GW of ocean energy.  I have recently spoken to the NTMA and the European Investment Bank and I note that organisations like that are prepared to fund projects should they come to commercial operation stage off the Irish coast.  We are very much open for business in that regard which is why a significant amount of our money is invested in the area.</p> <p>  On the SEAI side, there are a number of other research programmes involving energy and business, an energy efficiency action plan and public sector energy efficiency support.  In that regard, I note that one of the initiatives we delivered last year and which has not been highlighted enough was that, working with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, we have an agreement that if a State Department, agency or any other body, including a hospital or other unit, saves money in relation to energy, it can hold onto it.  For the first time within the public sector, there is an incentive to get into the whole area of energy efficiency.  Up to now, that was only really available to the private sector because if a saving was made, for example, in Portlaoise hospital, it was absorbed back into the HSE and, eventually, the Department of Health.  Now, the hospital can actually hold onto any money it saves on foot of energy efficiency.</p> <p>  The other funding areas include renewable energy information, sustainable energy zones, of which there is one in Dundalk, EU obligations, better energy financing, the PAYS scheme, the better energy smart grid, electric vehicles, exemplar projects, technological assistance, SME energy efficiency and industrial engagement.</p></speech>

The programme provides funding of &euro;3.7 million for mining services, including &euro;1.6 million for remediation works at the historic mining sites at Silvermines and Avoca.  The programme also includes an allocation of just over &euro;12 million for Geological Survey of Ireland services, including &euro;8 million for the Tellus mapping and INFOMAR projects.</p> <p>  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne mounted geophysical measurements and ground geochemical samplings.  Data from the project will facilitate the improvement of geological maps, new radon mapping and agricultural mineral maps.  Data from the Tellus project will also facilitate better land use planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  I acknowledge the role of the Geological Survey of Ireland in providing equipment and up-to-date mapping in respect of the attempt to recover the helicopter, Rescue 116.  I commend everyone involved and acknowledge the tragic loss of life for the families.  The INFOMAR project also involves updating navigation charts and has been used by the Admiralty in the UK in updating all charts worldwide.</p><p>It is something with which they are discovering things in close proximity to the surface of water, including rock shards that were heretofore not found.  It has huge implications for improving safety for seafarers.</p></speech>

It is something I raised when the Minerals Development Bill was before the House a few weeks ago.  A notion has come from recent research that rare earth minerals which are very valuable and used in iPhones and other consumer technology manifest in slag heaps in a mine previously in use which was abandoned or discontinued and thought to have exhausted its commercial potential.  In recent research at the Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geosciences, iCRAG, which I think is a Science Foundation Ireland centre for geological research it has been discovered that some of these rare earth minerals are present in some of the slag heaps.  This presents an opportunity because typically it is the site of a mine which has been abandoned or is disused and which may or may not have been remediated or cleansed and dealt with.  Some of the mines may be quite old and may not have been subjected to the full rigours of development.  At the same time, they contain a valuable commodity in the form of these rare earth minerals.  I know that I mentioned the Minerals Development Bill, but it was news to me and I think it is a relatively recent discovery.  Have there been any forays into that area?  Has it been covered in geological surveys, or is it in the Department's work plan for the year ahead to investigate the opportunities that may present?</p></speech>

It makes sense to utilise resources to be found in slag heaps or pits.  I hope to have more information in advance of Committee Stage.  The name of the Department includes the word "Environment" which entails recycling and everything that goes with it.  It is something the Department needs to promote.</p></speech>

I know that officials from Tipperary County Council and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with assistance from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, are investigating unexplained cattle deaths.  However, I do not want to cause alarm because they may not be related to the contamination.  They could be related to many things such as paint or batteries or whatever else may have been dumped.  It is one of the most serious issues that has been raised.  There are different sites, including the Gortmore and Magcobar mine sites.  There are ongoing plans to undertake a hydroelectric project on the Magcobar site.  Remediation work has been carried out at Gortmore at a cost of about &euro;6 million.  The facility is over 60 ha in size and a permanent disposal site for tailings.  Remediation work by the Department has taken place to a very high standard.  Previous remediation work is being monitored.  There have been a number of horses grazing on the land since it is privately owned.  While concern has been expressed about whether they are causing damage, I have been assured that they are not, but the matter is being constantly monitored by my Department.  There are ongoing investigations by the local authority and the Department and monitoring by the EPA of the entire complex to ensure there is full and final remediation.  The last remaining element of the project at Gortmore involves the Garryard tailing site.  It represents a distinct, separate phase which is not critical to the overall success of the work completed to date.  This part of the project is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;10 million.</p></speech>

The Loughs Agency is a North-South body which is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  The programme also includes a sum of &euro;11.6 million to meet non-pay, current and capital expenditure by the two agencies.</p></speech>

In recent conversations I have had it was suggested that in much of western Europe stocks were under pressure.  What level of conservation has been achieved by Inland Fisheries Ireland?  I appreciate that there are wider factors which are outside its remit, but how are we faring in that regard?  Are we seeing even limited successes and beginning to claw back?  I know that salmon stocks, in particular, as well as stocks of other species, are under severe pressure.  I think some new orders ran throughout the year, extending different limitations to fisheries.  There is much work ongoing, but I am concerned that it is all in the wrong direction.  I appreciate that there are global factors at play, but how are we doing as a nation, particularly the State agencies tasked with this responsibility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12017041100002#J02500"><p>There are two particular stocks, salmon and eel, of particular concern to the Department.  Salmon stocks have not performed as expected, anticipated or hoped for following the ban on drift netting in 2007.  It was considered there would be an exponential increase in salmon stocks.</p><p>While the increase in salmon numbers was very positive in the first year after the ban, they declined suddenly thereafter, much to the disappointment of all involved.  The reasons for the decline are multifaceted and we are unable to pinpoint them.  The worrying decline in Atlantic salmon numbers may be the result of global warming, a decline in feed resources in the Atlantic or sea lice.</p><p> Stock management in rivers is based on the advice of the standing scientific committee which reflects best practice internationally.  The committee sets a conservation limit based on fish counters over an average period of five years and then assesses whether the 147 rivers, sections of rivers and estuaries are open or closed for fishing or catch and release.  I have asked the Department to initiate a review of the catch and release policy in advance of the 2018 season.  Many anglers believe it would be advantageous to have a catch and release policy on all closed rivers.  Having more people fishing on these rivers would reduce the level of poaching as anglers would be able to observe poaching and, if one likes, act as guardians of the rivers.  When rivers are closed, the only people on them are the poachers.  I have asked officials to examine this issue in advance of the 2018 season. </p><p> The 2007 Council eel regulation was drafted in response to the endangered status of the European eel.  It is probable that any recovery of the Irish eel will take place over a long timeframe because the species is defined as critically endangered.  For this reason, eel fishing has effectively been banned.  Scientific fishery research is being carried out to glean the best advice on Irish eel stocks.  The research was announced in November 2015 and a number of former eel fishermen are involved to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to long-term potential for recovery.  In the short to medium term the prognosis for the restoration of the eel fishery is not good.</p></speech>

A backlog of cases will occur following the change proposed in legislation due to be adopted.  The new legislation will result in a large number of legal actions.  Is the &euro;2 million increase sufficient to deal with this backlog or does it even cover these cases?</p> <p>  The Minister of State is correct regarding the protection of eels and the EU regulation in this matter.  However, a number of former eel fishermen who accepted the approach taken at the time went out of business.  They were engaged legitimately in eel fishing which was their livelihood.  If a similar decision had been taken in mainstream agriculture, a financial package would have been provided either before the ban or soon afterwards for those who were about to lose their livelihoods.  Has progress been made in providing a modest compensation package for former eel fishermen who were put out of business by the ban on eel fishing?</p></speech>

I hope this important legislation will be passed without undue delay in the D&aacute;il to ensure Inland Fisheries Ireland will have proper powers of prosecution.  It has not been brought to my attention that costs will arise from a backlog of cases.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has not raised any issue in that regard.  My officials will engage with the agency to ascertain if there are issues, but I do not believe that is the case.  Inland Fisheries Ireland takes routine cases and arising from the cases that were lost, anyone who goes out poaching today, tomorrow or in the coming months will still be liable to prosecution based on the existing law.  The new legislation, when enacted, will copperfasten the prosecution rights of Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p> <p>  On the eel fishery, a bid for a hardship scheme is being costed and considered.  Given the competing demands for money, the issue is being examined in advance of the 2018 Estimates.  The scheme is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The environment and waste management programme includes an allocation of &euro;17.7 million towards staffing costs and &euro;13.8 million towards the non-pay, current and capital costs of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The programme includes &euro;11 million in grant aid funding for the remediation of landfill sites, the disposal of historical tyre stockpiles and the repatriation of North-South waste.  Also included in the programme is &euro;1.75 million to fund a range of Irish academic and research institutions involved in economic modelling and analysis which supports the development of the national mitigation plan and the national adaptation framework, as specified in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p></speech>

For some time significant issues have arisen in the remediation of the Kerdiffstown landfill site near Sallins in my constituency.  An ambitious plan is in place with Kildare County Council aimed at remediating the site and developing a public park and other amenities on the site.  I am not sure if this work is provided for in the subhead as I note the allocation has been reduced.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the site in question was taken over by Kildare County Council and preparations are well progressed for its remediation in the coming years.  Applications for the necessary permissions are expected to be lodged this year.  Significant funding from the Vote has been expended on the site to date.  Subject to procurement procedures that are to follow, several tens of millions of euro are expected to be required to remediate the site.  Kildare County Council is likely to draw down funding of approximately &euro;4.5 million this year alone, making it the largest single beneficiary under the subhead by some distance.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

The Environment Fund is spent on activities and schemes to reduce waste and to increase environmental awareness.  Income to the fund in 2016 was almost &euro;57 million, but this is expected to reduce significantly over this year and next year due to landfill capacity constraints, the full operational opening of the thermal treatment plant in Poolbeg and the export of waste for treatment abroad.  Expenditures from the Environment Fund allocations, totally &euro;39.4 million, were approved by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in January 2016.  I recently approved allocations totalling &euro;38.76 million from the Environment Fund for 2017.  Some programmes formerly funded from the fund will be funded directly from the Exchequer in 2017.  These include the full amount of &euro;8.5 million of the Environmental Protection Agency's capital budget for research and development, &euro;3 million for the international environment subscriptions and &euro;1.6 million for waste policy initiatives.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, this fund is falling off.  There are two reasons.  One is that people use plastic bags less often and the second is that landfill capacity is less available now than it was a number of years ago.  On the question about the profile of the fund over the last number of years, I do not have that to hand.  The yield from the plastic bag levy is &euro;9 million.  The Environment Fund for 2015 was &euro;46.09 million and it was &euro;56.85 million for 2016.  The projection for 2017 is &euro;45.3 million.  If the Deputy wants more historical figures we will have to get them for him.</p></speech>

I commenced my career in local government as a temporary clerical officer.  Having served at all administrative and managerial levels, I was appointed as chief executive of Clare County Council in 2009.  As chief executive of a large local authority, I gained extensive senior-level practical experience in developing and implementing strategy, change management and partnership and stakeholder engagement and significant experience of governance at executive and political levels.  I possess State board experience, having been appointed to the board of the Shannon Airport Authority in May 2013.  I was subsequently appointed to the board of Shannon Group plc on its incorporation in August 2014.  I continue to serve as a non-executive director of the group.</p> <p>  When I applied to the Public Appointments Service to be considered for the position of chairperson of the HSA, I considered that I met the requirements of the person specification as advertised.  I applied for the position on the basis of my genuine belief in the importance of the role and objectives of the HSA.  The principal objectives of the HSA are to ensure workers in Ireland, and people affected by work, return home safely to their families and everyone is protected from the harmful effects of chemicals.  As the former chief executive of a multifunctional authority which employed over 1,000 indoor and outdoor, technical and administrative workers, I appreciate the importance of achieving such objectives.  Responsibility for occupational safety and health and chemicals policy has been formally delegated to the Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business, Deputy Breen.  I understand the Minister of State met members of the board of the HSA in recent months and has been closely involved in promoting a range of safety initiatives targeted at high-risk sectors.  I expect to meet the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, very soon.</p> <p>  Like many public bodies, the HSA has seen a reduction in its financial and human resources over the past eight years.  Specialist technical expertise levels are less than those required.  It is important for the HSA to be empowered to rebuild its capacity and capability.  I welcome the increase provided in the HSA's 2017 budget for extra payroll funding.  I welcome the non-pay funding that has been allocated specifically for Brexit-related purposes.  It is unlikely that Brexit will have any medium-term impact on the regulation of occupational safety and health at EU level or in Ireland.  However, potentially significant impacts may arise with regard to chemical regulations and aspects of chemicals policy which are essential to the continued operation of many Irish and foreign direct investment enterprises.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the economy.  They need simple tools and guidance to help them to manage workplace safety and health.  In recent years, the HSA has invested significant resources to enable enterprises to achieve compliance in the simplest and most cost-effective manner.  A culture of health and safety compliance contributes positively towards national competitiveness by reducing the costs of workplace injury and illness.  Balanced and proportionate regulation acts as an aid to ensuring there is an even playing field in competitive areas.</p> <p>  The HSA's strategy for the period from 2016 to 2018 refers specifically to work-related health and the promotion of well-being and positive mental health.  The HSA is working with the Department of Health and other bodies to ensure workplaces in Ireland protect the health and well-being of employees and, furthermore, encourage people to improve their own health and well-being.  Sadly, there were 45 work-related deaths in 2016.  The highest number of fatalities - 21 - was in the agriculture sector.  As I come from a rural background in the west of Ireland, I appreciate the impact of farm fatalities on communities and accept that agriculture is a major challenge for the HSA.  I understand the HSA, in conjunction with the farm safety partnership advisory committee, has sought to broaden the type of contact the HSA has with farmers and to find the most effective means of spreading the message of prevention within the farming community.  The upturn in the construction sector will also pose a continuing challenge.</p><p>I understand that the HSA plans to increase the level of construction inspections based on the risk profile of the sector in its 2017 work programme.</p><p> The HSA's remit is broad, spanning more than 200 Acts, regulations and conventions.  The authority seeks legal compliance through motivating, influencing, promotion, information, education, inspection and enforcement.  Its vision is "healthy, safe and productive lives".  Achieving that vision, particularly in the context of such a broad remit, is a significant challenge.  I trust that committee members will appreciate that I have not as yet attended a board meeting of the HSA or had the opportunity to explore in depth the issues relating to the authority.  However, on the basis of the briefings that I have received to date, I am fortunate that the most recent chairman, Mr. Michael Horgan, and his board, the previous chairpersons and boards, the chief executive and his team have established and maintained an organisation that is capable of achieving that vision.  I look forward to chairing the board of the authority and playing my part in achieving that vision so as to ensure that workers return home safely to their families.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it today.</p></speech>

I must attend a debate on a Bill in the Seanad.  I thank Mr. Coughlan for his presentation.  The role that he is taking on is an important and serious one and I wish him well.  The well-being and safety of workers are of paramount importance to us all.</p> <p>  I noted Mr. Coughlan's mention of agriculture, in which regard much remains to be done to protect people, especially young people, from the dangers associated with the fact that they just so happen to be domiciled in businesses run by their parents and families.

I wish Mr. Coughlan well.  He has a comprehensive CV from what I read of it and he seems suited to the job.  I have no doubt from listening to him that he intends to make the role his own.  He will be instrumental.  It is great to hear that he comes from a farming background.  Besides deaths, a number of serious injuries caused by farm accidents are never reported.  This problem was one of Mr. Coughlan's main points.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Coughlan the best of luck with his work.  Undoubtedly, he will be a great success.</p></speech>

I have a particular interest in this matter, as it was prominent in my role as a trade union official.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Acts of the 1990s were some of the best legislation ever passed, but the problem then seemed to be that people could have the best legislation possible just so long as there were no inspections.  In my years there, the number of inspections was insufficient to meet the level of need.  It is unfair to ask this of Mr. Coughlan before he starts, but what are his views on the resource issue as it affects inspections?  What assurance can he give us of a substantial increase in resources?</p></speech>

I noted his reference to a trade union background.  He will be familiar with the fact that the HSA's board is tripartite, in that it is representative of employers, employees and the Minister.  That works well and is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Regarding resources, there were 10,400 inspections in 2016 and I understand that there will be an increase in resources in 2017, although I have not yet had a chance to examine that matter in depth.  Before being briefed on the HSA, I did not realise how important a certain element was.  While the authority has a reactive enforcement role in terms of inspections following incidents, the bulk of its inspections are carried out on an advisory basis.  According to the statistics on the outcomes of inspections, 41% resulted in written advice, 48% resulted in verbal advice and 11% resulted in enforcement.  The role of inspections - not just in terms of enforcement, but also advice - is critical for health and safety.  Resources have become available and additional inspectors are being recruited, which is a good sign.  At budget time, I hope that it will be possible for Oireachtas Members to increase the HSA's level of resources.</p></speech>

I congratulate him and wish him well in his post.</p> <p>  In County Limerick, which neighbours the county for which Mr. Coughlan was county manager, agricultural safety is a major issue.  Construction safety is also an issue according to his presentation.  That industry is beginning to expand again.  From my own campaigning, though, I have picked up on issues relating to mental health in the workplace.  I will offer a suggestion for future consideration.  Agriculture and construction are male-oriented industries, in that most of their workers are male.  Men find it challenging to discuss mental health issues and express their views.  Unfortunately, this is apparent in some of the figures on a number of tragedies in recent years.</p> <p>  While we are all trying to promote positive well-being and mental health through education, more could be done in the workplace, especially as regards male-oriented work.  I understand that females also work in those industries, but the workers are predominantly male.  An initiative or vision should be put in place in the coming years to identify trends and communicate about mental health well-being to these people through their work.  Whatever help Mr. Coughlan requires from our side, I would be more than willing to give it.  It is time that we be more innovative on this matter.  Our intentions are always in the right place, but finding innovative solutions is difficult.  Now that the issue has been mentioned, mental health is coming more to the fore commercially with a view towards saving on sick days and the like because of stress.  We could have a double whammy and educate people on health and safety through the workplace.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his questions and I understand his point.  One of the HSA's strategic priorities between 2016 and 2018 is to focus on work-related health risks.  It is only when one delves into the detail of the role of the HSA that one realises that it is not all about safety inspections and the physical environment in which people work.  It is easy to recognise physical risks, but the HSA also has responsibility for the health element.  As the Deputy said, it is more difficult to identify non-physical risks in the workplace, for example, risks to mental health.  Health and work-related health risks will form a strategic priority and focus for the HSA.  Much of the work that has to be done in that space must be done through partnerships and engaging with stakeholders.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the HSE.  There are a number of stakeholders and partners.</p><p>For example, a range of partners are involved in the farm safety advisory group and that is the way the Health and Safety Authority will have to work in the future.  It will have to create alliances and work with stakeholders, because these are not just problems for the Health and Safety Authority.  They are also problems for the farm community and the construction sector.  I said that one of the valuable lessons I learned in local government, particularly as chief executive, was the importance of working in partnership with different agencies, bodies and organisations and that will be my focus in my term in the HSA.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to hear how he intends to approach the job.  Is this the biggest organisation of which he has been chairperson?  His CV shows that he has been on a number of boards over the years.  Why did he apply for this post?  Did it particularly interest him or was it just because it was available and suited his skills set?</p> <p>  Can Mr. Coughlan take us through the process?  He said it was advertised through the Public Appointments Service.  How many, if any, interviews did he have?  Can he tell us what he hopes to achieve in his term as chairperson?

I also have a background in corporate governance and have qualifications in that subject.</p> <p>  I applied for the position having retired about a year ago, after 40 years in local government.  I felt, however, that I was too young to fully retire and that I had more to give.  I had a knowledge of the public sector, which I could continue to use in order to make a contribution, and I was very interested in taking up either a board position or a chair position which would allow me to do that.  When I was appointed as chief executive of Clare County Council, one of my priorities was health and safety and I embedded health and safety into the organisation.  There was a particular reason for doing that and Clare County Council won the national award during my term for health and safety in a local authority.  I integrated health and safety into performance monitoring and development so health and safety was an area in which I was particularly interested.  When the chair and board positions were advertised, I applied because I had a genuine interest in the area.</p> <p>  The position was advertised and I had to submit a CV.  I had to make a comprehensive submission on how I met the requirements of the position.  I had also to say why I felt I would be a good chair of the Health and Safety Authority and my background knowledge of health and safety, my corporate governance knowledge, my managerial knowledge and my change management knowledge were included in the covering letter I submitted with my CV.  I applied to the Public Appointments Service and went through its process, to which I am not a party and on which I cannot, therefore, comment.  I was, however, delighted to be advised by the Department that I had been recommended as chair. </p></speech>

The Health and Safety Authority is a very efficient, well-run organisation.  In one way it stands alone, at arm's length from the Department, and I hope it will continue to operate efficiently.  I hope the organisation will continue to be adaptable and can change according to external circumstances.  Strategic priorities have been set for 2016-18, one of which concerns work-related health risks, and I hope the HSA will concentrate on that area.  Safety chemicals accreditation is another area, as is changing the organisation as necessary to make sure it is fit for purpose.  I hope that at the end of my term the HSA will be recognised, nationally and internationally, as best in class.  I cannot do that on my own and will have to do it with the executive and fellow board members, with the Department and with all other stakeholders.</p></speech>

If he makes the HSA best in class, it should mean there will be fewer fatalities and accidents, which would be very welcome.  I commend him on his reference to positive mental health, an area to which the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, referred in the last presentation.  It is important that we focus on that issue in the workplace.  He recognised the fact that the construction industry will pose a challenge because of the good things it will be doing in the future in the area of infrastructure and building houses.  He said there will be an increase in inspections in this area so we will see how we get on with them.  I wish him the best of luck for the future.</p></speech>

I see the vision of the authority as focusing on healthy, safe and productive lives.  Mr Coughlan said he would play his part to achieve that vision so as to ensure that workers returned home safely to their families every day.  This is something we can all aspire to because 45 work-related deaths in 2016 means that 45 families were destroyed.  In the next few years we are, hopefully, going to see a glut of young apprentices in the construction industry and in farming and health and safety are very important.  We have come through a period of rogue builders and it is very important for any parent who sends a child out to do an apprenticeship that the health and safety checks are in place.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. Coughlan for coming here to engage with us today.  I wish him success in this role and we look forward to meeting with him again in the future.  The clerk to the committee will write to the Minister informing her that we have completed our engagement with Mr. Coughlan and a transcript of this meeting will be provided.</p></speech>

In terms of the perspectives that I hope to bring to the committee, they come from my being a researcher in employment law with a particular emphasis on atypical or non-standard work.  I am also a practising barrister of many years experience who has represented employees and employers.  Therefore, I hope that I am well placed to comment in a balanced way on this proposed legislation.</p> <p>  I commend the sponsor of this Bill.  The legislation is a very significant step in strengthening further the rights of atypical workers and those working in precarious forms of employment.  However, in my view there are a number of potential difficulties with the Bill as currently drafted that require reconsideration.  As the legislation attempts to deal with the issue of banded hours it ought to strive to be fair, effective and sufficiently balanced in terms of the interests of workers and employers.  The first of the areas that I would like to focus on is the balance that has been struck in the Bill, as currently drafted, between flexibility and security.  A cornerstone of European employment law is the combination of flexibility and security that has given rise to an EU law concept of what is termed "flexicurity".  </p> <p>  In terms of the balance between flexibility and security in this proposed legislation, I have a number of comments to make.  First, in terms of the flexibility principle, section 3, as currently drafted, lacks sufficient flexibility for a number of reasons.  The first point I will emphasise is the stringency of the potential defence that an employer has under this section.  I have concerns about the constitutionality of this section on the basis that the test laid down is onerous.  The test laid down in section 3(4) makes reference to severe financial difficulties and the substantial risk of redundancies or an unsustainability of the business among other things.  I would favour the replacement of the current test with a test of objective justification.  The latter test can be found in the other three Acts on the Statute Book that deal with atypical work.  Those are the part-time, fixed-term and temporary agency work Acts.  </p> <p>  Section 3 lacks flexibility due to the way two employers are treated in the very same way and I will explain.  Let us consider an employer has legitimate reasons for not acceding to the request made under section 3(1).  Under the Bill, as currently worded, if that employer does not provide a sufficiently reasoned decision explaining that then he or she will be treated in exactly the same way as another employer where he or she sets out to conjure up spurious reasons to deny the claim even though the latter employer can well afford to grant the claim.</p> <p>  Section 4, as currently worded, uses mandatory language to state that the Workplace Relations Commission will order the employer to increase the worker's hours to the next band.  In my view, it is unsatisfactory that no differentiation is made between an employer who does not set out clearly or in a sufficiently reasoned way very good reasons and the employer who has no good reason.  At present both types of employer are treated in exactly the same way. </p> <p>  There is another element to the flexicurity goal.  In terms of security of employment for vulnerable workers, it is important to move away from the notion of job security and the idea of holding down one job for all of one's lifetime.  Instead, we should consider security of employment more generally.  I mean employability or making an individual more employable by having protections in place that are balanced against the needs of businesses.  This aim could be better achieved.  I urge the committee to consider protection for workers in terms of penalisation.  The Bill, as currently drafted, enables a worker to seek the right to move up to an increased band but grants no protection to the worker against unfair dismissal or adverse treatment that flows from his or her request.  That is a conspicuous lacuna or gap in the existing Bill that ought to remedied.</p> <p>  In terms of the obligations on the employer such as notification and displaying hours, I refer to the type of analysis used in Court of Justice case law on objective justification.  I question whether there is a need for such onerous requirements in terms of display and translation.  I also note that there is no provision in the current wording for redress to be sought in the event of non-compliance with the notification provisions.</p> <p>  I welcome the Bill.  It is an important additional step to protect vulnerable workers.  I am concerned about the constitutionality of the legislation in terms of the balance being struck between flexibility and security.  In my view the Bill as it stands is insufficiently flexible.</p><p>The committee might consider introducing more flexibility.  I go back to my example of the conscientious employer who legitimately cannot provide the additional hours but who, perhaps due to time delay, cannot obtain the relevant financial information in the 21-day period, for example.  The committee could consider importing a provision to enable the Workplace Relations Commission to draw inferences from the failure to provide the response in a reasoned way within 21 days.  Such provisions relating to atypical workers are in the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and the part-time legislation.  That would be a more proportionate way to deal with different cases in a sufficiently differentiated way.</p><p> On balance, the Bill is very welcome.  I have a number of other observations to make and I hope I will have the opportunity to do so during the discussion.</p></speech>

On matters of policy, we have remained neutral in respect of this legislation, as we do on other legislation.

The society is aware that the committee has been consulting with various interested parties on the Bill.  We have reviewed and considered some of the representations made to date.  Given that the committee has already received numerous representations, highlighting legal issues and potential concerns, we do not want to rehearse those either in our written submission or in this oral submission.  We sought to limit our comments to the two most important provisions in the Bill.</p> <p>  The society acknowledges concerns which have given rise to this Bill and which have been put before the committee regarding certain practices affecting some casual employees working under if-and-when contracts.  The society absolutely endorses and supports any efforts for greater protection of workers where such protection is necessary.  The most obvious example is that of workers who are on a part-time contract, for example, for ten hours a week, and who over time, perhaps a number of years, may well have actually been rostered to work more hours, such as 25 to 30 hours.  Obviously there has been some media focus on this in recent years.  Undeniably where there is such an obvious practice of consistently depriving a worker of the contractual right to the hours that he or she consistently works, this justifies a change in the law in order to offer such workers protection.  However, the society has concerns that the Bill, as drafted, may place a disproportionate burden on employers.  This, in turn, gives rise to potential constitutional concerns regarding the Bill.  </p> <p>  During previous consultation before the committee, various speakers emphasised that the intention of the Bill was to give a worker a contractual right to the existing working hours already in place, but it should not give rise to workers gaining a right to demand additional hours.  We have concerns that section 3 appears to expressly allow for this.  The Bill makes express provision for an employee to be moved to an "increased" weekly band of hours, where the band requested "exceeds" the average hours worked weekly in the previous six-month period.  It does not provide for workers requesting to be moved, as a matter of contract, to the band of hours which corresponds to the average weekly hours worked.  It expressly provides that the worker should request the next, or higher, band of hours.</p> <p>  We recommend that the committee should consider the constitutionality of such a provision as to require an employer to increase workers' hours above those usually worked, even on an average basis, may be disproportionate.  It is conceivable that under the Bill as drafted an employee could build up their contractual hours by making repeated consecutive requests every six months.  Clearly that was not envisaged by the proposers initially, nor is it envisaged today.  That would need to be considered.</p> <p>  Our second main concern is that the threshold to be reached by an employer to lawfully deny a request to provide increased contractual hours appears quite high and may be excessive.  The Long Title to the Bill provides that the employer must consider an employee's request for an increase in hours and to "permit refusal only on objectively justified grounds".  Notwithstanding the Long Title, that is the only reference to objective justification in the Bill.  Thereafter, the Bill is silent.  Specifically, section 4(3), as Dr. Ryan pointed out, provides that the request can only be refused by demonstrating that the business is in severe financial difficulty such that there is a substantial risk that either people will be laid off or that the sustainability of the business would be adversely affected.  Clearly the language used in the drafting of the Bill has been very deliberate in specifying "severe financial difficulty" and "substantial risk" of those dire financial difficulties.</p> <p>  The justification for refusal appears narrow and fails to allow for any other form of objective justification.  The committee might consider whether the threshold for an employer refusing a request should be lowered, as there appear to be numerous examples of situations which might objectively justify a refusal, other than being in dire financial straits.</p> <p>  We recommend that the committee may need to look closely as the constitutional aspects of the Bill and in particular the scope of the Bill on two fronts.  One is the potential to seek and obtain higher hours than those previously worked and the second is the considerable limitation on the basis on which employers can refuse such a request.</p></speech>

I am intrigued by the submission by the Law Society of Ireland.  As Ms Hyde mentioned at the beginning, its members represent employers and trade unions across the board.  I cannot help noticing that its submission, unlike that of Dr. Ryan, does not make reference to how to strengthen legislation for workers' rights.  That is somewhat strange for an organisation that claims to be neutral on this.  How did the representatives of the Law Society of Ireland miss the points that Dr. Ryan made or do they disagree with him?  I specifically refer to his point on the notable omission in the current Bill of any protection from penalisation.  As someone from Sinn F&eacute;in I accept this; we think that is an area that needs to be considered.  He also referred to an amendment to the Unfair Dismissals Act to allow for redress for unfair dismissal.  The Law Society of Ireland made a number of points here, but did not make a single point on how the Bill might be strengthened for workers.  Why is that?</p></speech>

Given the time allowed on foot of the invitation to be present, for which we are grateful, we deliberately did not seek to go over all the relevant sections or indeed to support or acknowledge some of the other recommendations or observations offered, including Dr. Ryan's regarding potential improvements from a worker's perspective.</p> <p>  As Ms Hyde, as chair of the committee observed, we act for both sides of the equation.  We identified concerns over potential challenge to the legislation.  That does not mean to say we do not agree with potential improvements, including, for example, compensation as an alternative to merely making an order for an increase in hours, or a suggestion that some form of penalisation clause might be built in to protect a worker.  Our not making that express recommendation does not mean we do not acknowledge that these issues exist.</p> <p>  The two main concerns we have with the Bill as drafted relate to potential constitutional challenge.  These are the two most striking points that occurred to us and perhaps were ones that did not seem to have been acknowledged, particularly the potential for block-building regarding requests.  It is not necessarily in circumstances that we are making representations for employers that we observe that an employee could conceivably make repeated requests every six months to effectively ramp up their hours over a period of time.</p></speech>

For example, from the point of view of the individual employee, the vulnerable worker being protected by a legislative measure, the concern is that if that legislative measure is itself struck down then the vulnerable worker will lose that protection.</p></speech>

I do see any point in its submission that identifies an issue of concern from the point of view of protecting workers.  I am disappointed that that is the case.</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan's submission suggested that consideration could be given to banning if-and-when contracts.  He also says that proportionality concerns arise there and he says that "consideration should be given to rendering such arrangements presumptively unlawful unless that presumption is rebutted by an employer through the invocation of objective justification grounds".  I was struck by that as an alternative potential path that we could look at.  Could Dr. Ryan tell us a bit more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Desmond Ryan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#H00300"><p>To give the committee some context, what I was alluding to was an existing legal provision from the fixed-term workers directive which has been transposed into Irish law under the 2003 Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act.  That directive expressly states that fixed-term contract arrangements are not to be regarded as the norm in terms of the ideal form of working.  They require to be justified if they are going to be used.  As the committee will be aware, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, an employer has to explain why it is having recourse to a fixed-term contract as opposed to giving somebody an indefinite contract, effectively a permanent job.  The employability concern that I referred to earlier is very well captured by that legal provision because it says that if an individual worker is to be employed on a form of employment contract that lacks long-term security, that has to be capable of being explained.  That is a principle that could be very effective in regard to if-and-when contracts.  To return to the Senator's point about balance, I recognise that employers may contend that to have an outright ban or a blanket rule precluding zero hours or if-and-when contracts would be a disproportionate interference with the way in which particular employers need to run their business.  It seems to me that a more balanced approach would be to say, in recognition of that argument but furthering also the employees right to a degree of security of employment, that the particular business must be able to explain why for its business an if-and-when or zero hours arrangement is necessary.  We then go back to the established legal principles in terms of objectively justifying a particular measure.</p> <p>  I would also emphasise, from recourse to comparative studies of other jurisdictions, in the United Kingdom, for example, that there is not an outright ban on zero hours contracts but what has been done there is that specific regulations have been brought in which ban exclusivity clauses.  In other words, if an employer tries to say that they want their workers on zero hour contracts but they are also preventing them from working for a competitor, that is unlawful under United Kingdom legislation.  There are ways in which what is perceived as a specific abuse of zero-hours or if-and-when contracts can be managed without banning them outright and in general, in light of the experience of the other three Acts on atypical work - part-time, fixed-term and agency work - outright bans in regard to atypical work are not desirable.  What is needed is more nuance which tries to strike that balance.  I agree with Mr. Neville's point about objective grounds being used both in the defence, currently in section 3(4), but also more broadly in regard to the committee's concern about banning zero-hour contracts.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses believe that an amended version of this Bill could be integrated into existing legislation or would it require amendments to various pieces of legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Desmond Ryan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#H00500"><p>It certainly would require either amendments to or direct incorporation with various pieces of legislation.  One difficulty with which we are all very familiar as employment lawyers or practitioners is the piecemeal legislative situation in regard to a myriad number of Acts of the Oireachtas dealing with specific issues.  That is realistic in terms of the need to address specific issues as they arise, but that is where we are on the legislative picture.  In my written submission, in regard to the consolidation of these protections, it seems potentially anomalous and undesirable that, for example, the existing provisions in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, in sections 17 and 18, would coexist alongside the provision in section 5 of this Bill in terms of the obligation to provide the information about availability.  That seems likely to give rise to very significant duplication of resources but also confusion as to the notification obligations.</p> <p>  I also mentioned the concern about unfair dismissal.  As the committee will be aware, and I know it has been rehearsed in other submissions, there is a 12-month service requirement qualifying period.  A major concern I have in the current Bill - I return to the text of the Long Title and the aim of this legislation which is to protect employees, to protect workers - is that if I speak up and look for my employer to give me an additional band of hours, under the current wording I have no recourse if I am summarily dismissed for having done that.  Even if the employer accedes to my request and gives me the additional hours, I still have no recourse for unfair dismissal unless I have the 12 month qualifying period.  To return to the Chairman's comment, I believe that consideration is necessary as to how these measures would tie in with the existing legislation on unfair dismissal and with the time period, and also to look at it from the perspective of the employer insofar as the employer is already dealing with its obligations under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act.  Take an employee on a fixed-term contract of six-months duration, how is that situation going to be reconciled with the provision in section 3 in regard to a six-month window?  What mismatch would there be, if any, between the entitlements that the worker could have under this legislation in the context of the fixed-term work legislation?  A related point is the need to have consistency of definitions.  As the committee will be aware, the definition of "worker" is that borrowed from the Industrial Relations Act.  </p> <p>  A point I would make more generally, coming from that point, is that this Bill seeks in a very commendable way to protect workers, but it seems to me to be trying to unify two very different approaches, one from an industrial relations perspective, which is evident in the borrowing of the definition of "worker" from the 1990 Act on the one hand, and on the other, the protective legislation in the employment law sphere.  I already mentioned the part-time, fixed-term and agency work Acts.  Those pieces of protective legislation give a framework within which this type of protection for the precarious worker could be achieved on a footing that would potentially be more balanced.</p></speech>

Like the previous group, they have acted on both sides, be it employer or employee.  Both have expressed the view that the legislation as drafted by the sponsor may be, or is, unconstitutional.  It is significant if that is the case, so could the witnesses expand on this?</p></speech>

I want to make a point about Article 26 and the Employment Equality Bill, a Supreme Court challenge to the employment equality draft legislation prior to its subsequent enactment in a different form in the 1998 Employment Equality Act, which I do not believe has been raised in any of the submissions.</p><p>A particular provision in that Bill imposing an obligation on employers in the context of the disability ground was deemed to be unconstitutional.  There was a specific reference by the Supreme Court to the fact that the proposed legislation would have required employers to disclose to third parties the financial status of their business.  That is a very important statement in the Supreme Court decision in the Article 26 employment equality case because the concern expressed about an obligation being placed on employers to disclose their financial status is one which seems to me to be particularly pressing in this context.  I question whether that is proportionate to the aim being pursued in circumstances where there could be all manner of reasons an employer may not be well placed to accede to the request.  As long as it can explain that in a transparent and objective manner, it would still strike the balance sought to be achieved in the legislation.</p><p> I also share the concerns which have been expressed by the representatives of the Law Society in relation to the use of the word "accede" in section 3(1).  There is a real risk there of unconstitutionality.  One way to deal with that would be to prefer wording like "meets" or "covers" or "is already in accordance with or reflects the situation".  If we boil it down, what the committee and the sponsor of the Bill are trying to do is ensure for employees that their contracts of employment reflect the reality of the work they are doing.  That is a basic right and there is a dignity interest in that.  There is also a clarity and a certainty that comes with it.  In fairness, that is not the same thing as saying that an individual worker should be entitled to accrue rights which he or she never had prior to seeking them.  Before she moved to the Supreme Court, Ms Justice Laffoy determined a case in the High Court under the fixed-term work legislation.  In McArdle, she specifically clarified that the effect of being able to have one's rights vindicated under the fixed-term work Act and to be entitled to a contract of indefinite duration did not and could not enable an employee to secure better rights or a better job than he or she had prior to bringing a claim.  That is very authoritative dicta from an extremely respected now Supreme Court judge in employment law.  It is an important principle in the context of considering the potential constitutionality concerns.</p></speech>

Senator Gavan commented on the potential imbalance in our observations, but the Law Society seeks to identify two main concerns in relation to the Bill as drafted which might allow interested parties, more likely on the employer side, to challenge the two specific provisions highlighted which are, most obviously, potentially susceptible to challenge.  The first is that the proposers of the Bill want to ensure, laudably, that there is no abuse of an arrangement.  I acknowledge that to be not only commended but supported by the Law Society.  However, while there is a six-month timeframe of a look-back in this draft Bill, in reality over the course of a longer period, perhaps a number of years, an employee may be kept on a lower number of hours than is actually being worked.  It is obvious to all concerned that an abuse of that type should not be supported and should be stopped.  The difficulty with the Bill is that, contrary to the stated intention, it does not simply provide for the employee to be brought up to the average hours he or she was working.  It expressly goes further than that.  We are merely highlighting it as the Law Society and acknowledging in the interests of both parties that it is a susceptible exposure.  There is a potential area of concern that it could be challenged on the basis that constitutional property rights are potentially being breached in circumstances where an employee who historically has been working 25 to 30 hours over a number of years gets bumped up to a higher band of hours.  While it might be laudable that the worker should be brought up to the number of hours he or she has been working over a number of years, he or she now actually gets more hours.  That is not what was stated to be the intention and it would be a potential concern from the prospect of challenge.</p> <p>  The second major concern in relation to challenge is as follows.  Speakers have referred to proportionality.  It seems clear that there has to be a proportionate response to the concerns of workers not being entitled to receive as a matter of contract the hours they work over a period of time.  Obviously, when an employer receives this request, it needs, in order to protect the workers, to be able to offer a reasonable explanation as to why it is either going to accede or refuse.  As the Bill is drafted, the bar is set so high that it gives rise to constitutional property right concerns where the employer would say he or she cannot but accede to this because the only way he or she can lawfully deny the request under the legislation is to prove with financial data if necessary that he or she is in severe financial difficulty such that the business is in jeopardy.  Setting the bar so high gives rise to a concern about proportionate interests and the lack of reference to objective justification which is contained in the Long Title.  That objective justification should provide for an employer being reasonably entitled to offer an explanation which, if objectively justified, would then permit it to lawfully refuse.  As drafted, the Bill has no such objective justification defence.  It is merely provided that unless the employer is in severe financial difficulty, it has no choice but to accede to the request.</p></speech>

Where there is a call for a pay rise and the company says while it would love to give one, it cannot afford it, there is a well-established practice in the Workplace Relations Commission whereby it appoints an independent person to look at the books privately and without exposing them to anybody else.  The person can come back and say whether the firm can afford it.  It has never been a problem.  There has never been a challenge while the practice has been in place for years.  Why could that same system not operate here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Desmond Ryan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#J00600"><p>This point goes directly to the potential hybrid between the industrial relations influence of the Bill and the protective employment legislation influence of it.  A couple of technical points are very relevant to the Senator's question.  Any appeal from the Workplace Relations Commission as provided for in section 4(6) goes to the Labour Court and that appeal is to be heard, unless there are very compelling reasons otherwise, in public with the parties identified and the determination published.  That is unlike the situation in the Workplace Relations Commission to which the Senator alluded.  The consequences of exposure or a finding of breach under section 4 of this Bill would have severe and, it appears, irrevocable implications for the employer.  There is no provision in the legislation as drafted - and this goes back to Deputy Collins's question on constitutionality - for the employer in the context of a diminishing profitability or need for expanded hours to seek to have the worker revert back to the previous hours, nor is there provision in respect of inferences.  I urge the committee to consider the inferences point as going specifically to this question.  If we think about the 21-day time period in section 3, after the worker makes the request and while the employer is trying to collate the data to assess the financial viability of the proposal, a further 20 requests may come in within ten days.  These requests themselves will have implications for the data and whether the hours are going to be available.  Suddenly there are only 11 days left within which to take this reasoned decision and communicate it.  The complete lack of any basis to allow the employer either to look for extra time or explain why it could not provide the decision is a problem in the proposal.  I emphasise again that in terms of the aim that is being pursued it can be done.  However, it needs much more nuance in section 3.</p></speech>

Flexicurity seeks to promote and harness circumstances where there is a balance of flexibility and security for the individual worker.  This measure, which seeks to pursue that aim, would be in accordance with that ideal.  However, as we have all indicated, the Bill as currently presented would pose significant problems and is not in accordance with the Court of Justice's approach with regard to objective justification for the employer being able to defend a claim.  Certainly, what is being pursued by the Bill is very much in accordance with European employment and social policy and is a good thing.</p></speech>

In terms of where there are the so-called if-and-when arrangements, which are identified by the Limerick study, my view is that there is a gap or lacuna in the existing legislative protection whereby there is no basis on which, at least pursuant to statute, an employee can require that the reality for that employee is reflected in their contractual status.  As I said, that is an important right which an employee has and it is something which could be strengthened by legislation.</p></speech>

They can simply stop giving them hours.  That appears to be a huge imbalance.  Does Mr. Neville agree?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Neville" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#K00600"><p>If there are situations where over a relevant period of time - the Bill provides for a six month look back although various commentators have suggested that this might be too short a timeframe - there is a consistent pattern of workers receiving more hours over that period, it is absolutely unsurprising that there should be a change in the law to allow that worker to make a request of their employer to bring them up to their de facto hours.  That is laudable.  If there is a suggestion in the submission that this is something which is not to be promoted, I can emphasise on behalf of the society that it is something that should be actively promoted.  All we seek to do is say that notwithstanding the laudable aspirations of the Bill, and it should be promoted, the balance must be struck for fear that the Bill could fall down and be susceptible to challenge, which would ultimately be to the detriment of workers.</p></speech>

The witnesses have said on numerous occasions that various commentators have said X, Y and Z and they have quoted from them.  Most of the contributors who have appeared before the committee to date have had problems with this before they came in the door.  I do not believe they wish to legislate for the issue.  Representatives of the unions will appear before the committee after these witnesses, and the witnesses might have more things to say after the union representatives appear so that we have more balance.  They might quote from some of the union representatives and Deputy Cullinane.  I am concerned that the witnesses are quoting people who, when they appeared before the committee, offered no solution to the problem we have, which is zero-hour, if-and-when and banded hours contracts.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses aware of comparable legislation in other jurisdictions with which we might be able to compare what this Bill is trying to achieve?</p></speech>

That is recognised as unduly constricting a worker's ability to generate income and take up work elsewhere and it has been dealt with specifically in that legislation.  That is a more nuanced response to the concern about banning zero-hour contracts.  It shows how legislation is capable of achieving that.  Incidentally, English law specifically removes the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims.  In that jurisdiction, the qualifying period is two years, which is longer than it is here, but it waives it where the person contends that they have been penalised for raising this concern about working on a zero-hours contract for another employer.</p></speech>

However, it does nothing with respect to an employer who has a huge pool of labour and each week picks who will get hours.  Why would the witness not ban zero-hour contracts?  What possible damage could be done by just outlawing them?</p></speech>

Of course, this is subject to safeguards protecting the workers.  One safeguard is to make that argument as, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, one can only make it successfully if one can show that one's specific business need justifies a fixed-term contract or, in this case, a zero-hours contract.  It is not a free for all.  It is not the case that some empty incantation can be invoked by the employer.  They must be able to demonstrate concrete reasons.  The case law on this is very robust.  It says that the employer cannot simply have recourse to an empty formula but must explain, with reference to its business and its specific sectoral need, why it can only offer this type of contract.  To return to the question of why we cannot simply ban zero-hour contracts, obviously that approach is open but it admits of no possible circumstance where it could be permissible or desirable as a contract model.  Again, I refer to the other forms of what are referred to as atypical work such as part-time, fixed-term and agency work and the recognition that, in certain circumstances, they can suit the needs both of employers and workers.  As long as there is a degree of regulation ensuring a minimum safeguard for the employee they are not necessarily, in and of themselves, to be prohibited.</p></speech>

There are no circumstances in which it would suit an employee to not know how many hours they will get in the following week.  Employees want to know.  Even if it is only five hours, they want to know that it is five hours so they can plan for child care or to do other work.  I can think of no circumstance, and if the witness can think of one he should suggest it, where an employee would want a situation where he or she does not know how many hours they will work the following week.</p></speech>

This was referred to in the questions posed to us in being invited here and included, for example, an individual's capacity to save money and to have a modicum of a sense of security within the role they are carrying out.  Much of the literature on atypical work and more casualised forms of work shows that having access to less rigid or Procrustean models of work can avail workers at certain stages of their lives when they particularly want flexibility and are not able to take on rigid commitments week to week.  I agree with the point the Senator made that it is difficult to conceive of a zero-hours contract promoting flexibility for the worker.  However, I question the propriety of having an outright ban.</p> <p>  The other point that must be made is that zero-hours contracts as referred to in section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, for example, is a different concept from a zero-hours contract in the UK and the regulations I mentioned.  If one wanted an outright ban, one would have to be clear as to what zero-hours contract is being referred to.</p><p>For example, in that legislation, there is a minimum payment commitment for hours not being provided.  The first matter in consideration of any ban would be to clarify whether there is any degree of reciprocity or mutuality involved in the relationship.  Even zero-hour contracts as envisaged by section 18 of the 1997 Act contain a minimum floor of security for the worker with regard to payment which zero-hour contracts in other jurisdictions do not have.</p></speech>

The study, which was carried out by the University of Limerick, found that there was considerable evidence of low-hour contracts in some sectors of the Irish economy.  The report proposes a number of changes to legislation to give workers more certainty regarding their hours of work.  Congress supports the recommendations in the University of Limerick study and we believe that the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016, which has been referred to this committee for consideration, is an important step in bringing to an end the exploitation of thousands of workers in workplaces.</p> <p>  The correspondence inviting us to appear before the committee this evening asked us to give consideration to a number of specific matters.  Our views on these matters are summarised in points made in paragraphs 6 to 9 of this submission.</p> <p>  Congress and our affiliated unions have been pointing out that there are significant negative implications for individuals working on low-hour contracts.  Workers who are employed on low-hour contracts have little predictability about the scheduling or number of hours they will be required to work in any given week.  They have uncertainty about their income which often leads to difficulties, including lack of capacity to access financial credit, managing work and family life and generally have poorer terms and conditions than those who work full-time hours.</p> <p>  The most extreme form of low-hour contracts are those contracts that do not specify and guarantee working hours, so called zero-hour contracts.  Congress is strongly of the view that there should be a legal prohibition on such contracts.  We believe that this was the intention behind some of the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  However, in reality, the passing of this legislation has not prevented employers from using zero-hour contracts.  We strongly believe that workers should have a legal right to a guaranteed minimum number of working hours.</p> <p>  Some employer organisations have raised concerns about the impact on small business of any further regulation of working time.  We do not believe that any new law which seeks to give greater certainty to workers about their working time will have a negative impact on small business.  The Banded Hours Contracts Bill 2016 seeks to balance the needs of employers with the need to give workers more predictability about when they are required at work.  It has been suggested that the remit of the Low Pay Commission should be expanded to allow it to give consideration to proposals on banded hours.  Congress believes that it has been demonstrated conclusively that further regulation of working time is required.  Asking the Low Pay Commission to review the proposal on banded hours contracts will only delay the implementation of the required changes to the law on working time.</p> <p>  Congress is therefore seeking changes to legislation that would provide for the following.  The first is a right in law to a guaranteed minimum number of working hours and a legal prohibition on zero-hour contracts.  Another change is a right to be paid compensation, at the appropriate hourly rate of pay, when no work is made available.  Another is an amendment to the Terms of Employment (Information) Act to require an employer to provide a written statement of terms and conditions of employment, including working hours, from day 1 of employment.  The final change is the right of employees to claim an alteration to their contract of employment in respect of working hours if, over a specified reference period, their actual working hours are in excess of their contracted hours as provided for in the Banded Hours Bill 2016.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members most sincerely, on behalf of health workers engaged on precarious and zero hour contracts working in community health, for the opportunity to make this brief submission to the joint Oireachtas committee today.  I would ask that they note that SIPTU health division fully concurs with and supports the submission presented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions General Secretary Ms Patricia King here this evening.  In the course of this brief submission, which centres on community health support workers, I will refer to the Government-approved study on this subject.  This study was conducted by the University of Limerick.  I will also rely on my direct experience in advocating for and supporting vulnerable health workers exploited through the practice of zero hours contracts, which are repugnant to the principles of a fair and just workplace.  <br/><br/>  The State&rsquo;s main employer in the health sector is the Health Service Executive.  Until 2013 the HSE practised zero hour contracts.  This practice was ended by SIPTU&rsquo;s successful campaign which resulted in a binding Labour Court recommendation CD/12/527 issued on 16 September 2013.  This Labour Court recommendation compelled the HSE to ensure that each community and home help employee, directly employed by the HSE, would have a minimum of hours which the worker could not fall below and that should the hours not be available the employee would receive payment and the hours would be banked for future use in the service.  While we see this outcome as an advance in the right direction, the progress made was limited to workers who are organised within the trade union family and who, just as important, successfully communicated to both the public and public representatives the injustice they were suffering.  Ongoing efforts to secure the same outcome in HSE-funded section 39 employments have thus far been actively resisted and frustrated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which has committed to resolve the issue of zero hour contracts and employees' rights to access to the State&rsquo;s grievance and dispute resolution machinery.  This agreement is an integral element of the Lansdowne Road agreement, and as of today has not been implemented by the HSE.  It is SIPTU&rsquo;s experience that health workers exposed to precarious or zero hour contracts are predominantly female; are low paid or on minimum wage; are mainly working in isolated settings such as home care; have basic education or are early school leavers; are in a higher age bracket, from 35 to 49 years and 50 to 65 years; have received very limited or zero employer-sponsored education; are likely to be non-Irish employees, with rates of 12% excluding nursing homes, which according to the last employer census stands at 51% non-Irish; are exposed to part-time work; work in community settings; are likely to be lone parents as they are more prevalent in the heath care sector than any other sector of the care industry; are highly flexible; are highly vulnerable to private sector tendering process; have limited or no opportunity to personal development education; are working in an unregulated industry; are unregistered workers; and may require State pay support through the Department of Social Protection to mitigate against the poverty trap.<br/><br/>  Government policy in addressing the changing demographics of our nation has shifted over the past two decades to caring for elderly and disabled citizens in their home and community.  SIPTU supports this policy in recognition that, unless absolutely necessary, citizens requiring care should in the first instance be cared for in their home or community, whether it be a rural or urban setting.  However, SIPTU is determined that health care provided in the service user's home or community must be equal to that of care offered in an institutional setting.  We also are determined that it must also be regulated by HIQA to ensure that this desired benchmark is upheld and advanced in the interest of the service user and those workers charged with delivering care in what can be described as an isolated challenging setting.  With the exception of agreements reached with the HSE to offer a floor of rights which includes basic hours, significant numbers of section 39 employers - HSE funded - have removed themselves from any forum which attempts to even the playing field for vulnerable employees.  The private sector, also in receipt of huge funds from the Exchequer via HSE service level agreements, have also in the main behaved in a similar fashion.  SIPTU is determined to ensure that taxpayers' money spent on community care is not based on a casualised, vulnerable and undervalued workforce.<br/><br/>Community care and home care must issue a contract of employment reflecting in the first instance a minimum floor of hours with the optional right to work additional hours when available reflecting the flexibility required in this sector.  <br/><br/>Government policy must ensure that the industry is regulated and that care workers are registered. <br/><br/>In order for the highest standards of care to be provided in the home and community settings, the Government must support and resource FETAC training and education for these workers.  Such a policy would also allow for these workers to advance their skills and create opportunities for them to work in other areas of health care.<br/><br/>The Government and its agencies contracting services to section 39 and private sector providers must, through their service level agreements, stipulate the requirement that zero hour contracts cannot be applied and that a worker's right to have his or her grievance or dispute addressed by, for example, the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court, must be be a right which cannot be obstructed or frustrated. <br/><br/>These points, if applied, will prevent the home care community care setting from being casualised and will ensure that workers and the vulnerable clients they care for are protected by the highest standards.  SIPTU is opposed to taxpayers' money being issued to employers who believe that is some way they are remote from employment and justice in the workplace.  SIPTU also believes that the taxpayer expects vulnerable workers to be treated fairly and have their rights upheld in the workplace.<br/><br/><b>Chairman:</b>I will start with a few questions.  Previous speakers before the committee have had numerous concerns around the drafting of the Bill, highlighting in particular that there may be some constitutional issues placing a disproportionate burden on employers.  We are trying to get a balanced approach here, so the witnesses might address that.  We have heard a lot of evidence over the last few months.<br/><br/>The question of unintended consequences was raised, and in fairness to the drafter of the Bill that was never the intention.  Quite a few different organisations have flagged that there may be unintended consequences.<br/><br/>Does SIPTU currently have any agreement with employers using a banded hour system?</p></speech>

I listened to the employers' contribution to the committee and also to Deputy Cullinane, who instigated this Bill in the first place.  From the employers' side I could not understand how they could construe that there would be any burden placed or imposed upon them in this, in that every employee would only be able to seek to have the pattern of hours that they are currently working assured in a banded hours scenario.  One could not make the claim without having the pattern of hours and attendance, so it seemed to me - if I am permitted to say it - that there was a deep lack of understanding as to what the Bill was about and how it would work in practical terms.  There were many comments on burdens on employers, but they bore no relationship at all to what was in the Bill.  If I work in a particular company, this Bill promotes a six months look-back-----</p></speech>

The Unfair Dismissals Act terms kick in after 12 months of employment.  Someone who is only in employment for six months is taking a big risk approaching an employer with a claim because, notwithstanding the very good employers who are out there, there are employers who are quite capable of mishandling or misusing a situation whereby somebody puts forward a claim and within a relatively short period of time finds himself or herself unemployed.</p><p>That person has little or no comeback by virtue of not being covered by the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The argument that the period should be 12 months plus could be considered.  There is certainly an argument to the effect that a period of 18 months would provide certainty regarding unfair dismissals and address a number of sectors in which there are peaks and valleys in terms of how busy they are.  Employers could argue that the pattern of hours was only due to the fact that it was coming up to Christmas, Easter, the summer holidays or the like.  A period of 18 months is probably more likely to give a more balanced view of an employee's claim of a pattern, as it would take in all eventualities.  This is open to debate.  Deputy David Cullinane stated he was open to considering it.</p></speech>

The burden has been overstated by employers either because they are opposing the Bill or do not understand it.</p></speech>

We welcome the Bill.  It is good and has the potential to address most of the abuses and exploitation found not only in the retail sector but also in the hospitality, education and, as Mr. Bell pointed out, health sectors.</p> <p>  Does the question on a balanced approach show a lack of understanding of the problem?  One cannot balance exploitation against workers' rights.  There is no equation - it is exploitation and an abuse of power by employers.  How can any worker expect to live without knowing what his or her wages will be from week to week?  The only contractual commitment a sizable number of retailers make to an employee on starting is that he or she will work 15 hours per week.  People might work 39 hours per week for two, three or ten years, but if they move up the service scale, their rates will increase, they will join a union or they will say something they should not and their hours will be changed suddenly.  Not only will their days change, but their rosters and times will also change, with a dramatic reduction in their working hours to 15, the only commitment employers are prepared to make.  This has nothing to do with balance; it is sheer exploitation.  Every worker should at least have some idea of how much he or she will earn from week to week.  Otherwise, employees will be blocked from taking out loans.  Bank managers look at their contracts, see that they are only guaranteed 15 hours per week and do not care how many hours they actually work.  This issue must be addressed.  In asking about a balanced approach one misses the problem.</p> <p>  With the exception of one that, under the Chairman's guidance, I will not mention, we have reached banded hours agreements with the majority of retailers along the same lines as the provisions included in the Bill.  If retailers can operate within the guidelines and have the necessary flexibility to run their businesses on a profitable basis-----</p></speech>

An employee must work 19.5 hours to be entitled to family income supplement, FIS.  Not only do employers control people's behaviour by messing around with their hours, they can mess up their part-time social welfare entitlements and FIS payments also.  The control of this power has a chilling impact on many employees and their behaviour.  It is unfair, unbalanced and an abuse of power.  Asking whether we can balance the rights of employers with those of employees is akin to asking whether we can balance workers' rights with the right of employers to exploit their employees.

If we call the State sector what we generally regard as being the public sector, shift patterns and various bands of hours are commonplace.  They are also commonplace in airports, airlines and so on by virtue of the nature of the business where they include early morning and late night working.  Shift roster patterns are a nightmare to manage in particular industries, but these industries agree that they would not survive if they did not have these patterns.</p> <p>  I would not regard the two issues raised as unintended consequences.  A worker can only make a claim if he or she is working the hours.  If someone's contract includes a period of 15 hours and it can be established that the pattern in the past six, 12, 18 or however many months has been that he or she is working between 20 and 25 hours, the legislation allows that pattern to be banded.  As Mr. Douglas stated, this provides certainty of hours and income.  However, if the employee is not working the hours in the first place, he or she cannot make the claim.</p> <p>  Currently, an employer decides for how long employees work and what income they will receives.  He or she picks and chooses at will which of them will be offered the work, often at very short notice.  This is an unbalanced relationship.  The balance of power in the matter of hours and earnings lies entirely with the employer.</p><p>While I do not think this measure would solve all of the imbalance that exists, I suggest it would be an effort to address some of that imbalance.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms King's comment that this important Bill is a "step in bringing to an end the exploitation of thousands of workers in workplaces".  It is important to note that she stressed that Congress does "not believe that any new law which seeks to give greater certainty to workers about their working time will have a negative impact on small business" because other contributors have suggested differently.  I was also struck by something else she said.  Many groups have come to this committee to speak about this Bill or to give us private briefings on it.</p> <p>  The presentation we were given by IBEC last week clearly showed its deep lack of understanding of the Bill and its contents.  I will give IBEC a bye because it might be the case that it was not trying to mislead us, but instead simply did not understand the Bill.  Having said that, the briefing from IBEC on the Bill and its contents - or, more particularly, what is not contained in the Bill - was very biased.  I think IBEC threw in many red herrings in an attempt to complicate something that is not especially complicated.  It has tried to make it sound like the Bill will do much more than it will do, particularly with regard to its impact on businesses.  I have asked a number of groups to propose other ways of solving this problem.  Every member of the committee agrees that the problems associated with low-hours or zero-hour contracts, banded hours and if-and-when contracts need to be solved.  As Mr. Douglas has outlined, such contracts are preventing people from being able to get mortgages and loans.  It is hard to organise child care when one does not know what hours one is going to be working next week.  As Mr. Douglas said, it should be emphasised that employers are messing around with people's social welfare by changing the number of days they work and the times at which they have to come into work.  Such practices make some people unable to apply for social welfare.  I commend Ms King and Mr. Douglas on their presentations.</p></speech>

It is very welcome to hear the voice of organised workers for the first time.  We have had a number of presentations from employers' groups, including some that I did not know existed.  Perhaps that is a reflection on me and my naivety.  It is important for the committee to get an idea of how widespread is this problem.  I am conscious that some of my colleagues are not present.</p> <p>  The employers' groups have made two contradictory arguments.  They have argued that this problem affects a small number of people.  At the same time, they have argued that if these changes are made, it will be a disaster for the economy.  Mr. Bell has highlighted how widespread the use of if-and-when and zero-hour contracts is in the health sector.  I invite the others who are present to talk about how widespread it is in other sectors and to say whether they think it is growing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#O00800"><p>No, 75% of all workers in accommodation and food earn less than &euro;400.  That 75,000 workers earn the minimum wage or less provides a fairly good picture of the size of low pay.  I would regard anybody who is earning &euro;400 or less as being definitively categorised as a low-paid worker.  Furthermore, 32% of all workers are in the next tranche, which comprises those who earn between &euro;400 and &euro;800 a week.  The figures I have provided for these sectors are a good indicator that low pay and low hours go together.  The proposed Bill does not deal precisely with some of the issues mentioned in our submission, such as the problems associated with zero-hour contracts and the need for a minimum number of hours.  We are advocating strongly for the five points set out in the submission.  For the purposes of this conversation, we are talking about banded hours.  The figures I have mentioned clearly indicate how this issue fits into an overview of the economy and of employment in Ireland.  There are just under 2 million workers in Ireland, of whom 365,000 are regarded as self-employed.  Therefore, there are 1.65 million direct workers in part-time or full-time employment.  That gives a good outline of the size of the low-pay issue.  Ireland ranks second among OECD countries - behind only the US - in the low-pay category.  We have a very bad track record in this area.  I ask Ms Buckley to hone in on the accommodation and food sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethel Buckley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#O00900"><p>I thank Ms King.  It is important for me to respond to a question that was asked earlier by saying that the services division of SIPTU, which represents workers in the private sector, has reached numerous voluntary agreements with employers that are trading successfully in respect of banded-hours contracts.  I will restate the nature of these agreements.  A worker can claim the banded hours that he or she has been working but cannot claim for additional new hours.  Some of the employers with which we have agreements are very large and successful.  I will not name them because I want to comply with what the Chair said earlier.  They include some of the most successful wholesale and distribution companies.  If those good unionised employers had been given an opportunity to be here, they would say that these agreements with trade unions allow them to plan their businesses successfully.  They also take pride in offering quality employment that people can actually live on in the certainty that they will earn living wages.  Like previous speakers, I would like to put it on the record that we have already reached such agreements voluntarily with employers.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, a positive story is not coming through in the hospitality sector at present.  We regularly deal with workers in this large sector of the economy, which is generally not unionised, who are fearful of organising unions because they know of numerous examples in the industry of workers who have been discriminated against and have faced recriminations after taking such steps.  Last year, there were many media reports of dismissal for unionising and asserting the right to fair employment and good working conditions.  The prevalence of low pay, low working hours, zero-hour contracts and the lack of certainty of earnings in the hospitality sector reflects the fact that employers in that sector appear to be pursuing an employment strategy based on having a large pool of casualised workers available to them.  I would say that until the 2000s, the hospitality sector offered decent employment to people.  Somebody could do the group cert or the leaving cert and then go to CERT, which was a State body, to be trained in a craft skill as an apprentice chef, commis chef, chef de partie or silver service waiter or waitress.  This would enable him or her to get a job in a hotel and stay in that hotel to earn a living, raise a family and own a home.  Now the vast majority of workers in the Irish hotel industry cannot aspire to owning a home or rearing their own family without State subsidy in the form of family income supplement.</p><p>Legislators and policymakers need to consider whether this country wants to pursue an employment model where profitable private sector employers are being subsidised by the State in pursuing casualised employment with low levels of working hours, zero hour contracts and low pay.  That is what is happening in the industry.</p><p> A veto is being pursued by the hotel and catering industry &ndash; the entire hospitality industry to which Ms King referred &ndash; regarding engagement with the machinery of the State in addressing these matters, which are joint labour committees.  They are to where the low pay industries have traditionally gone.  Worker and employer representatives sit down and deal with the particular issues in their industry.  They reach an agreement, which becomes the statutory minimum.  Hotel and catering employers are currently refusing to do that.  </p><p> If one compares that to employers in the private sector in industries which are agreeing to sit down and negotiate with employee representatives, one finds there is a very different pattern.  For example, the contract cleaning and private security industries have agreements that address wages.  Nobody is going to get rich as a private security guard or contract cleaner, but people can raise families on the wages they earn because they are the result of collective bargaining.</p><p> Joint labour committees and EROs can agree working hour patterns that reflect the particular characteristics of an industry.  We have concluded a negotiation which will, I hope, do that very thing in the security industry, namely give certainty of hours to security guards.  It is an industry in the private sector where the employer body has agreed to put in place guarantees and conditions regarding working hours.  If the security industry can do it, I do not know why other industries cannot.  I wish to reiterate the points made by Ms King regarding the Unfair Dismissals Act, which were very clear.</p></speech>

For the benefit of my colleague, Senator Reilly, I wish to repeat that we had been led to believe that this was a relatively small-scale problem.  That was never my experience as a trade union official.  Based on what we have heard from our colleagues, this affects a range of sectors.  It is the model for the hospitality sector which, as the witnesses rightly pointed out, receives a subsidy of &euro;650 million a year while refusing to engage with industrial relations bodies.  It is also extremely widespread across private health care, from what Mr. Bell has said.  I believe it is rampant across retail.  Am I missing out on any sectors such as education?</p></speech>

One of the positives about the Low Pay Commission is that it has urged the CSO to do more work in this area.  Over the past two years the CSO has increased its capacity to produce these figures.  The figures I mentioned relate to the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015.  That is a good picture.  It is doing very worthwhile work.</p></speech>

There would be an argument that a person who worked for 12 months plus one day would be covered by the unfair dismissals legislation and, therefore, it is a case of job done.  As a trade union official, if I was to make an argument that there is a concerted pattern over a long period of time a stronger argument could be made.  That is my judgment and is a personal view having represented workers for years.  If one is able to convince someone that one is looking back over a solid period of time the chances are that one will convince him or her of that view.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, we have engaged with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and have campaigned for years.  We have met many Ministers over the years and in the past couple of months, and have tried to convince them that they need to put in place legislation which deals not just with banded hours but also zero hour contracts, minimum hours of attendance at work and so on, a lot of which would be based on the UL review which the last Government sponsored.  </p> <p>  Employers have also had such discussions.  Luckily for both groups they have not been in the same room, but we have argued the points with officials in the Department.  </p></speech>

Many employers had an issue with the part of the Bill requiring them to state quite clearly in writing how many hours were available to a particular person for a week in two different languages.

My candid view is that employers are able to handle complex tasks, including management tasks, with workers who do not speak English as a first language.  In the main, English is the language we use.  Employers in accommodation and food outlets are able to manage staff and direct them to do what they want to be done, to ensure that everybody understand their instructions and that employees understand what is happening if they are being dismissed and so on.  It is a fairly feeble position to try to argue that it would be a bit difficult to outline banded hours in Polish, Lithuanian, Estonian or whatever other language.</p></speech>

Rather, it would refer to everyone.  That is a major issue for a large factory employing 800 people.  The proposal states that each employer shall display, on a weekly or monthly basis in a prominent position or positions a notice or notices in the form and manner such as the notice is reasonably likely to be understood by the workers concerned.  There are 800 workers in Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb in Waterford and some employers asked how such a business could display everyone's working hours.  The points were made to us as a committee.</p></speech>

It does not state categorically in the Bill that it would only affect these particular workers.  It states in the Bill that it would encompass every worker.  That is where employers felt there would be unintended consequences and this would be one of them.</p></speech>

That is often the case in a Bill.  The basis of the Bill, however, is that if one's contract is different from one's pattern or work, one has the opportunity to make a claim.  In most organised employments it does not arise because, for the reasons Mr. Douglas has outlined, there are already collective agreements.  The labour inspectorate and its current rules, for instance, already require employers to meet certain standards in respect of information to employees.  Indeed the labour inspectorate can already require the employer to comply by putting up notices, if they do not already do so, in respect of certain aspects of the employment.  That is already a feature anyway.  I am quite sure employers would say they would find it burdensome to do so in a number of languages, but that is all that is required.  They must ensure, as part of the labour inspectorate's rules, that the employees understand the message of compliance notices and so on.  I am not sure that there is anything substantive in the claim that there would be unintended consequences that would then cause them a great burden, which I think is the point employers may have been making.</p></speech>

We are all concerned that workers have been taken advantage of with these zero-hour contracts and the whole issue of banded hours.  The statistic given here today, that 32.4% of workers are earning &euro;400 or less gross, is a disturbing figure and certainly one the committee will want to look at long and hard.  We are very proud of the fact that we have gotten so many people back at work, but we want to make sure that the wages they earn allow them a decent standard of living.  Clearly that piece of information was not something that had been highlighted to us before Ms King came in here today.  For that point alone I would like to thank her.</p> <p>  In respect of the overall Bill itself, are there any issues with it that Ms King would like to see changed to improve things from the worker's perspective or is she happy that the Bill is complete?</p></speech>

That is not provided for in this Bill.  The issue of notifying employees of the number of hours in any week that they are required to work should be in law.  As was set out in the University of Limerick, UL, review, the matter of people being paid for a minimum number of hours at their rate of pay should be set down in legislation.  Again, it would stop much of the unbalanced relationship whereby the employer is entitled to call people to work and then send them home having earned nothing.  In a lot of cases, it would have cost an employee to go to work, then when he or she gets there, there is no work and the employee is sent home.  If the person does not take up the work, he or she is no longer on the list to be called for work.  Again, this is more of the unbalanced relationship.</p> <p>  We believe that there should be legislation as the UL review has set out.  That issue is very prevalent, for instance, in education.  Somebody can be called in to do an hour's work then the classes are changed, and he or she is not needed to do the lecture and is told to go home.  Certain parts of the education sector have very bad practice in this regard.  We have debated and discussed this many times.  From our perspective, we would like to see legislation which, at the very least, attempted to address zero-hours contracts, the minimum number of hours and the requirement for an employer to be able to set out what hours an employee will be requested to work per week or per day, whichever is appropriate.  This should be set out at a very early stage, probably on day one.  We believer an amendment to the Terms of Employment (Information) Act or a new composite Bill would be the most appropriate instrument to achieve this.  Those pieces are fundamental in trying to address this imbalance in the relationship between worker and employer.  We would like to see legislation that started to deal with those issues at the very least.</p></speech>

Effectively, somebody who is guaranteed or contracted for ten hours a week but in fact works 20, 25 or 30 hours a week, on a regular and continual basis, would be given the ability to look back over a reference period, state that he or she had actually worked 20 or 25 hours week on a continual or regular basis and make a claim for that certainty or for those hours.</p> <p>  That does not place an additional financial burden or an extra cost on the employer because the employer is already paying.  The employee is doing those hours on a regular basis and is getting paid for them.  They are not worked for nothing.  The employee is getting paid for them, which means the employer is already paying for those hours.  All this does is give that person a degree of certainty in respect of their own financial arrangements and personal circumstances.  It is not an additional cost or extra financial burden on the employers.  They are already paying it anyway.</p></speech>

I sit on the Low Pay Commission and the issue of students and where they sit in the order of things comes up quite a lot, particularly when employers come in to make submissions to the commission.  The holy all of it is why do we differentiate.  If someone is coming to do a day's work, an hour's work or two hours' work and is going to do the work to the required standard, that person deserves to get paid a decent wage for doing it.  If he or she is available to work two hours a day or 15 or 20 hours a week, the employer is obliged to pay a decent and fair rate for the labour, once he or she does the required work.  I am not sure I understand the difference between the non-student and the student worker.</p> <p>  I have heard some arguments made, though I would regard them as weak, that these people are training.  The training issue is dealt with in the minimum wage.  There is provision for that.  I hope the apprenticeship will be a growing feature of our economy, to boost training access for people and so on.  All of that, and how people are treated in the training mode, is dealt with in law through the industrial training orders.  If one is making oneself available and has a contract with an employer to do the job, it really makes no difference if one does not fit into either of those categories.</p><p>If one does not fit into either of those categories, the fact that one is making oneself available and has a contract with one's employer to do the job really does not make any difference.  If one is doing the job and getting paid, one should get a decent rate for doing the job.  That would be my argument.  I argue that at the Low Pay Commission all the time.  I do not think that being a student makes any difference to it.</p></speech>

I fully agree with the principles of what the witness just espoused.  People doing the same work, whether students or not, should get paid the same.  The question was more about the flexibility that both students and employers would seek, though some have abused that arrangement, as we have all acknowledged here.  There are students who would value that flexibility of being able to work a few hours during the week, a few more at the weekends and maybe not work a few weeks when they have exams coming up.  They are then able to work a lot more during the holiday period.  The perspective of how this Bill impacts on them is where the employers were coming from, or so I thought.  It is not that it would result in paying people less, rather that by having a less than flexible piece of legislation that would not cater for that could disadvantage these people.  That was the way I understood it and the concern I would have.  We all agree that we need to tighten up the legislation because the abuse of workers that is clearly taking place in certain instances by some employers who have been anything but scrupulous in their application of fair law needs to be addressed.  At the same time, I do not want to create a hammer to break a nut.  That is the concern.</p></speech>

As explained earlier to the committee, we have quite a number of banded hour agreements and collective agreements with all the major retailers bar one at this stage.  That covers students, young people, women and men.  There is no difference.  A worker is a worker; he or she is entitled to the same rate of pay.  It does not cause any problems for these very profitable retailers to employ students or not to employ students.  In fact, students like certainty.  They like to know when they can get off to college and when they get time to do their exams.  They do not like being exploited.</p> <p>  This is not about creating a balance between flexibility and workers' rights.  There is an abuse of power here.  It is about people not knowing from one week to the next how much money they are going to earn.  Will they have enough money to pay their rent, student accommodation, books and tuition fees?  That is wrong and we have to call it wrong.  Whether it is a student, a young worker, a female worker or some other worker, it is wrong.  All we are asking is for a decency threshold.  We have heard from Ms King that the figures are alarming.  The employers in general cross all sectors - retail, hospitality, security and a whole other range.  They have passed on their responsibility to provide decent jobs and a decent living wage to the State.  The State is picking up the pieces through family income supplement, social welfare supplements, benefits and part-time dole.  These workers can no longer contribute to the Exchequer because they are not earning enough to pay tax.  They cannot be consumers in the local economy and create other jobs by having money to spend.  They are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty.  The State is picking up the pieces.</p> <p>  We need to call it for what it is.  It is mass exploitation.  Whether it is students or young workers, precarious employment is wrong and we need to put a stop to it quickly.  Zero-hour contracts and precarious employment are becoming too prevalent in the Irish economy.  We are second only to America as OECD countries in the prevalence of low-paid jobs.  We are a low-paid economy and this is going to have massive impacts on the Irish economy not only on our ability to provide services for people in terms of resources, but also on creating a consumer economy in which people have money to spend in the local economy.  We have to deal with it and this Bill goes a long way to dealing with it.</p></speech>

It may have been across the same business unit, such as two or three different bars owned by the one bar owner or whatever.  What kind of implication would this legislation have for the flexibility of workers who might have ten hours in one place and are trying to get four to seven hours somewhere else?  Can the witnesses see any deficiencies around that or any obstacles for somebody trying to do that?</p></speech>

It works its workers between 15 and 39 hours a week but only guarantees them 15.  They could be working 30 or 35 hours a week for years, but for some reason that could be dropped to 15.  An employee cannot then go to look for a second job because the employee cannot tell the second employer when he or she is available.  He or she will not know when he or she will be available from week to week.  Those employees are trapped in that job and trapped in poverty.</p></speech>

I have been in retail now for 37 years.  The least offenders are small employers in the retail sector.  The big players are the ones with the fancy scheduling machines and computers that have the employees up and down.  They know when a customer is going to come in any given week.  They will have the employee in for a half an hour.  When that customer goes, they tell the employee to come back in for another half an hour next week.  These are mass employers and profitable companies that have passed on their responsibility to provide decent jobs and that pay dividends to their massive shareholders wherever they are.  That is the reality of it.  Let us call a spade a spade.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-11a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017041100002#R01200"><p>There would not be a problem if an employee was with an employer and the offer was five hours, the employee was getting five hours and was not in a position whereby he or she is contracted for five hours but wanted for ten.  In that case, the employer will only honour in contract the five hours and the employee is guaranteed only that.  That is the point.  There is little opportunity for a downside to this.  That is why we have such difficulty understanding employers' opposition.  In fairness, I watched the full session with the employers here.  I heard a lot of the committee members question the employers.  Senator Reilly made the point that he put to us about the unintended consequences involving students and the whole lot.  We cannot understand what the employers are bringing as opposition to this.  As Mr. Richie Browne has said, people are already getting paid the money and the patterns are already established.  Therefore, it is about control.  That is what the employers are objecting to.  It is about holding on to the unbalanced relationship.  The employers can work the employees for as long as they like, for as little as they like and for as much as they like.  They have that in the low-pay area.  I have publicly said that several times.  It is for as long as they like, for as much as they like and for as little as they like, other than the minimum wage.  That is what we are talking about here.  The segment of the employment population subjected to that is a growing segment.  That is the point.  This is not about the burden of anything.  It is about the loss of control.  We have argued and lobbied that this is an entirely unbalanced area and needs to be dealt with.  It is a very strong policy failure that it is not dealt with.</p></speech>

On some occasions, it predominantly impacts on female workers.  They are told the hours are going to be reduced, but if they wish to pick up the hours they had, they can work for an agency.  This is a manipulation.  It involves the State employer saying that it has to reduce the hours because its budget is gone, but if the employee follows on another link, he or she can work those hours for the same client by jumping onto that ship.</p><p>If a worker is working an average of 20 hours for a period of, say, 18 months, as Ms King has suggested, the employer would have to provide those hours or the funding for them.  I know exactly the position Deputy Neville is describing.  In the health services, some people have to juggle employers; sometimes, however, it is for the worst reasons.  The proposal is just to demonstrate that I am not actually working those people the hours that they are required to give that service.</p></speech>

Concerns have been expressed across all sides about workers' rights.  I ask the committee to look at point 10 on the ICTU statement, which is a simple summary of what congress is asking for.  I think we can all agree on these points.  We can all agree that workers should be entitled to a guaranteed minimum number of working hours.  There is nothing unreasonable about that.  The right to be paid compensation at the appropriate hourly rate of pay where no work is made available is perfectly reasonable.  I do not think anyone from any party would object to the right to terms and conditions of employment.  Finally, there is the right to claim an alteration to their contract but only on the basis of looking back, perhaps over as long a period as 18 months, as Ms King has said.</p> <p>  I hope all of us could sign up to those points.  As Ms King has pointed out, we could make a difference to a huge segment of the population.  The political point I would make is that the economic recovery is quite imbalanced.  We could have a way of making a real difference to people at the low-pay end of the spectrum by adopting these proposals.  I would hope they would not be politically contentious because they should not be.</p></speech>

We must not forget that the State steps in to subsidise employers that, based on their profit levels, are very well capable of paying more than they are paying.  The State steps in with social transfers such as family income supplement, FIS and so on, to alleviate the at-risk-of-poverty categories in our society.  That is the way it works.  We do not think it is the right way.  It is about the redistribution of wealth.  That really is the basis of all of the argument when we analyse it.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach, na Teachta&iacute; agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.  As chair of the National Museum of Ireland, I am pleased to be in a position to co-operate with the committee.  I understand the committee has a very special and deep interest in HR issues as they pertain to the National Museum of Ireland.  I also wish to refer to the statement just made by the Chairman as to the limitations and legal obligations of witnesses.  In addition to his citation, I wish to place firmly on the record that the National Museum of Ireland has an absolute obligation as an employer to maintain confidentiality and respect for all our employees, past and present.  This obligation of confidentiality is absolutely paramount and therefore precludes us as the employer from commenting on or answering any questions relating to current or former employees.  I hope our colleagues, the members, will understand this position and our obligation.</p> <p>  In preparation for this engagement, I have reflected generally on the issue of HR.  Over the past 20 years, I have served on the national executive and international executive of a trade union, sat on the boards of both statutory and not-for-profit organisations, chaired four boards and run two organisations including my current business, which employs 14 staff.  It is my experience that even in the smallest organisation, even where practices are very good, HR issues do arise.  I would be surprised if there is anyone in this room who has not had to deal with a HR or industrial relations, IR, issue.  I say this not to excuse the HR problems the museum has experienced but everything deserves a context.</p> <p>  In my statement and in the time allowed to me I will not speak on every detail we submitted to the committee for its consideration.  Rather, I have chosen to highlight some key points and hope by the end of this hearing that the committee will have the adequate information to further its deliberations and make whatever recommendations it sees fit.</p> <p>  In many ways, in an organisation that is older than the State itself, it is only possible for us to account for the HR function at the museum in more recent years.  It is important at this point to state that Mr. &Oacute; Floinn, the director, has been in place since 2013 and I have been in place as board chair since July 2016.  Therefore, we can only really discuss with any great sense of conviction the issues to which we have been exposed in our time.</p> <p>  It is important to make the general point that the museum in its long lifetime has had many parents, moving around a number of Government Departments before eventually becoming an autonomous body 12 years ago.</p><p> The year 2005 marked when the board was appointed to the museum and the HR function started to be devolved from the Department with responsibility for the arts.  By 2008, the museum's HR unit had achieved a full staff complement.  By the following year, the unit had started to haemorrhage.  By 2011, the training and recruitment officer, the HR officer and the HR manager had either left or retired.  In addition, a public sector recruitment moratorium and a huge reduction in funding prevented the museum from addressing the deficits.  At this point, the Department started to consider the establishment of a shared services unit with the National Museum and the National Library of Ireland.  At the same time, the management of the museum and staff associations sought a review by the LRC of the HR function and situation.  The review highlighted poor communications and poor dispute resolution by the museum.  A forum chaired by the LRC set about resolving the issues through restructuring and strategic planning among other wide-ranging measures, which have been supplied to the committee in the pack that we issued last week.  In 2013, much of the HR function and associated staff effectively went back to the museum, but the function was not returned to the museum until last year.  As the committee can see, even within that short space of time, the HR function has had many parents.  It has not remained static or in one place and it has not been developed.</p><p> The HR function now rests with the museum corporate services unit and is managed by the head of operations.  A key action of that unit was the health and well-being survey, the results and recommendations of which were published in November.  I am aware that the information was shared with the committee.  The results showed that there were continuing issues relating to staff morale, HR processes and trust.  A programme of implementing measures to address these issues is now under way.</p><p> I wish to draw the attention of members to the fact that we have included a summary of complaints, personal injury cases and cases before mediation in the submission that was furnished to the committee last week.  For the record, I would like to state that there are no cases of bullying or harassment currently under investigation or currently subject to mediation at the National Museum of Ireland.  We continue to deal with a small number of HR matters.  Given the nature of HR that I alluded to at the very start, HR will always probably feature as part of our work and as issues. </p><p> HR issues have cost the museum and the State both in terms of reputation and financially.  Any negative impact on those who have been affected is something that is of concern to me, the board and the management of the National Museum of Ireland.  Since taking office in July 2016, the board of the National Museum has worked very hard with the executive to ensure that we achieve high standards in all of the functions vested in us in our enabling legislation.  We are well advanced, as this committee may be aware because we invited it to participate in the consultation on our master plan or long-term sustainable roadmap for the next 20 years and beyond.  We have also completed the process of appointing internal auditors.  They will be charged with the function of auditing all our internal controls and systems, including the HR function.  Recently we allocated one of our full meetings to reviewing a report that we asked the executive to prepare on the museum's HR function.  We have since agreed a range of measures to achieve excellency in our HR function.  That is what we have sought to do, to achieve excellency in HR.  The decision we took as a board to consider HR was taken well ahead of media and political interest in the museum's HR area.  Since considering the report and agreeing a board resolution on the matter, I am also pleased to say that we are being actively supported by the Minister and her Department to enact a series of HR measures.  We are working more at a macro-organisational matter to implement the master plan.</p><p> When I appeared before this committee back in September, I said that I was ambitious for the museum and so was my board.  That is why we joined the board, prepared applications and went through a process to be appointed as public servants to the National Museum of Ireland.  I am really committed to excellence and planning for the future.</p><p>Over the past number of months, we have developed a dynamic relationship with the Department.  We are entering an exciting time in the whole arena of culture and heritage through the Creative Ireland project and recent policy decisions.  The museum needs a strong organisation and cohort who function well and respond to change and opportunities ahead.  I view this as a highly achievable outcome.  <br/><br/>I would like to use this opportunity to say something about the negative headlines and the profiling of the HR issue at the museum.  As some members will know, I am a big fan of the museum.  Before I became the chairperson, I visited at least one museum a month, if not more.  As chairperson of the museum, I visit at least one of the museum's sites once a week, sometimes more and sometimes twice or three times.  In the past nine months, I have come in contact with some hugely dynamic people who work at the museum and do the State a huge public service.  Last year, as people will be aware, the museum created with very little resources an exhibition entitled Proclaiming a Republic.  As I have done previously, I urge the committee to engage with the exhibition as it is an excellent showcase of the 1916 Rising and the events around it.  To date, 170,000 visitors have seen the exhibition.  <br/><br/>At the end of March, I was pleased to open an exhibition of contemporary work that celebrates 60 years of a diplomatic relationship between Ireland and Japan.  The exhibition focused on the Sodeisha movement.  The project is important for us as a museum because over the past 100 years our collecting policy focused on gathering items that told the story of Ireland and, in many ways, we missed out on some of the cultural developments around the globe.  The Sodeisha movement was instrumental in changing ceramic arts around the world.  I know that it has been hugely influential on Irish ceramic artists.  The decision by the museum to collect contemporary international collections has been an important departure for me.  The exhibition also defines and celebrates Ireland's relationship with Japan.  <br/><br/>I noted in recent weeks our outreach collaboration with the national neighbourhood programme operated by the Dublin City Council.  The museum has demonstrated that it is one of the excellent partners in the initiative where community engagement, particularly in the more disadvantaged communities surrounding the museum's catchment area, has ensured that people can engage and explore the museums in ways that they have not previously done so.<br/><br/>I am pleased to say that on Easter Monday we will open the Proclaiming a Republic exhibition from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. as part of the Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca celebrations.  Normally we are closed on Mondays but staff have facilitated the event.<br/><br/>I have given a snapshot of developments at the museum.  They are in addition to our daily functions around caring for, acquiring and documenting collections to serve the State.  All of those achievements would not have happened if staff did not go over and beyond the call of normal duty.  It demonstrates the passion and interest that staff have in the museum's work. <br/><br/>I have established an effective working relationship with the director and management of the museum.  I serve with a very committed and hardworking board who all work on a <i>pro bono </i>basis as part of our contribution to the National Museum of Ireland.  The kind of dedication and commitment that I have experienced at the museum is not headline making but it is mostly what one sees and experiences when one interacts with the museum.<br/><br/>As a country, we have been picking ourselves up off the ground and the museum is not alone.  The museum will commence a journey with a new master plan over the coming months.  It is future facing but learning lessons from the past.  We are oiling all of the wheels so that we can move best to serve the public in the decades and centuries ahead.  I believe HR is part of management and will always be there.  The stronger the HR function is, the fewer problems will emerge, which is what we are trying to achieve.  I am happy to take further questions.</p></speech>

There is a great number of good, hardworking people in the National Museum of Ireland and we applaud them for the work they have done over the past number of years.  Much good work is being done in the development of exhibitions and making those exhibitions accessible to the citizens of the country.  Ms Heaney is correct that there are two sides to every experience.  Where there are human resources, there are human resources issues.  That is the nature of it.  The reason the committee has sought to focus on the issue and, if one likes, shine a light on it is to help Ms Heaney's team, hopefully, to draw a line under what has been experienced and motivate the Department to take an added interest in reforming the situations.</p> <p>  By way of background, I have received information with regard to the situation in the National Museum of Ireland in recent years.  In 2011, a firm of psychotherapists and psychologists was employed by the National Museum of Ireland to deal with the issues of low morale and bullying within the National Museum of Ireland.  Subsequently, they sent a letter to the Minister.  The letter stated that they, in their relatively long experience of providing staff care employee assistance programmes to many different types of organisations, had never previously encountered what appeared from their perspective to be a prolonged, systemic and institutionalised bullying of the general staff by some senior members of the administrative staff.   I understand the trade unions, which have also been involved in working with the staff, have stated the same.  They felt the experience of staff in that scenario has been an outlier.</p> <p>  I have gone through some of the different costs incurred by the National Museum of Ireland over the years and I estimate that &euro;1.5 million to &euro;1.8 million has been spent on consultants' reports, agencies or legal settlements of some sort to deal with the issue.  There has also been a number of investigations and reports.  The Labour Relations Commission was involved in one report in 2013.  Its report stated that 88% of staff viewed morale in the museum to be poor; that staff had stated that there was a negative industrial relations culture typified by mutual mistrust, adversarialism and poor communications and consultation; that there was a poor dialogue between senior management and staff, a poor history of individual conflict resolution and poor team spirit; and that there was an acknowledgement by management of a poor industrial relations culture, etc.</p> <p>  In 2016, a Work Positive Profile report, which I obtained under the freedom of information regime, was commissioned and published.  The report appears to echo the findings of the Labour Relations Commission's report in 2013.  It stated 20% of employees reported that they were often or always subject to bullying while a further 20% stated they were sometimes victims of bullying.  Cumulatively, that is 40% of staff within the National Museum of Ireland.  More than 40% of employees were deemed to be at risk of developing anxiety or depression and almost 70% of respondents felt that employee morale was poor to very poor, with poor communication and a lack of trust of employees.  Seven in ten employees wanted mental health support to deal with stress and depression.  Staff contentedness in the National Museum of Ireland was deemed to be at the bottom fifth of that of Irish companies.</p> <p>  Further, I understand that at least three cases have been brought to the High Court with regard to alleged bullying.  I know the witnesses will not be able to speak to any of those cases in particular, nor do I wish to speak to them except to give that reflection about the experience.  I believe other particular staff issues have gone to the High Court that do not relate purely to allegations of bullying.</p> <p>  These are typically men and women who have strong characters and work hard in the profession they love.  When speaking to them, these individuals told me they have had shattered lives and experienced emotional collapse and major stress.  Some attribute other illnesses, etc., in their lives to this although that cannot be proven in any way at all.</p><p>I am told one of the key problems over the years is that typically the first thing people are asked to do when they bring complaints is to redefine those complaints as non-complaints.  A process would then happen to deal with it.  If they did not, they were pressurised to withdraw complaints.  If that did not happen, the National Museum of Ireland would often then have a strong team of solicitors and be quick and ready to build a legal and financial wall around these complaints to ensure that they did not proceed any further.  I was even told - perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Floinn will be able to answer it - that someone who had a major difficulty with the National Museum of Ireland and had left it and was in a new place of employment was hand-delivered a letter by a member of the senior management of the National Museum of Ireland in that new place of work.  Perhaps that could be addressed later.</p><p> There is also the issue of protected disclosures.  I had a discussion with the Minister about this over the past number of months.  It is a disputed, at best, one could say, protected disclosure.  Has the National Museum of Ireland received a complaint which had "This is a protected disclosure" as a sentence within its first paragraph?  Has the museum dealt with the contents of the protected disclosure?  Was the disputed protected disclosure given to the individual who was the subject of these complaints as well?  Perhaps those questions could be addressed first.</p></speech>

If I can, I will move onto the issue of the finance department.  A report was commissioned by the National Museum of Ireland and Capita focused on the finance department.  I understand that the finance department has been part of the difficulties within the National Museum of Ireland over the past number of years.  The Capita report stated that an individual should be promoted to the position of finance manager, or the position created.  I have spoken to individuals who have worked in that position.  Their view was that the finance manager would not necessarily be involved in meetings on the financial management of the museum.  The Capita report got to the heart of it and stated that there should be someone in that position and that the individual should be empowered with the task of ensuring that function was delivered properly.  Since that Capita report has been put in place, has the position been created and filled?</p></speech>

The intention is that these contract positions will be replaced by permanent members of staff.  We are aware of the Capita report.  We intend to fill one of those posts, the assistant accountant, as a permanent position.  We are in a recruitment phase and that post will be filled later on this year.  In regard to the position of accountant, because we are in a transition period of moving to shared financial services system across the public service, we need to maintain continuity of expertise which the individual who is in the post at present has built up in the past two or three years.  It is our intention that all financial management will be carried out by the museum and not by consultants.</p></speech>

The reason I asked these questions is that it has come to our knowledge that for a long period of time, back to 2011, there has been reports written by psychotherapists and psychiatrists and a large number of internal reports commissioned by the National Museum itself which shows a significant level of unease and difficulties among staff there.  This has happened over a period of at least eight years, that we know about.  We have an opportunity to see if we can help fix that issue, to see if we can shine a light on it to see if we can bring it to the attention of the Department at such a level that the Department will have to deal with it and to give the necessary supports to the Chairman of the Board and the director of the museum to see if we can resolve these issues.  If it were the case that these were one-off reports or one-off items, it would not be my intention to bring it to the committee's knowledge, but the fact that this has been ongoing for such a long time, it would be wrong to allow this to proceed without a general focus on it.</p><p>If we want to discuss further the method in which we do that, I am very open to taking on board the views of the committee on this.  Perhaps we should adjourn and go into private session and refocus on the rules of engagement to do so.  It is my desire that we shine the necessary focus on it. </p></speech>

That is a forum for dealing with industrial relations issues and collective dispute resolution.  The staff forum has now been agreed and it will hold its first meeting in May.  Part of that delay arose because there was a detailed process of consultation with staff associations on the composition and the terms of reference on these two forums because nothing existed before this and I was determined that if we were going to do this, we would do it right.  We now have mechanisms in place for staff to be nominated to those forums by their staff associations.  That is all in place.  In the meantime we were doing dispute resolution in terms of the individual dispute resolution by the same process, the grievance procedures were completely reviewed and re-written and the dignity in work policy was similarly done.  They are the actions that arose out of the reports.</p></speech>

The restructuring which was agreed in May 2014 is only finishing now because it has taken that long to fill the posts.   That was set back at a time when we were dealing with employment control framework figures where the museum had to reduce its staffing numbers.  It was a very difficult time for the museum to negotiate through that.  That process is now coming to an end and the last number of posts are being filled over the coming months.</p></speech>

Part of that review will include what staffing is required for the museum.  We have been assured that we will get the support of the Department in relation to implementing that review.</p></speech>

I set out a number of measures on the HR function and want to reiterate that HR issues exist in all organisations.</p> <p>  I want to come back on points that were made about the staff survey prior to the adjournment.  I am a fan of good quality research and research methodologies.  The survey was exactly that - a survey.  I consider canvassing staff for feedback to be a good practice in HR, not something that should be distributed to the media for headlines.  It is a useful tool for management to address HR concerns, but it is not the only tool.  If we were to do more adequate research, that would require funds.  I want to correct the record, that all staff completed the survey, they did not, about two-thirds did.  We need to be very clear about that.  </p> <p>  There were also some positives in that survey.  I want to state that about 93% of staff said they were happy to come to work.  That is what I observed.  In case a message goes out there that there are not good staff and good attitudes to work in the museum, my experience is that there are.  I acknowledge there are problems but we are working incredibly hard to address them.</p><p>I assure the committee that my board and I put in roughly eight to 20 hours  voluntary service per week to address a number of challenges we have as a board and we try to balance all the challenges, giving due attention to each one.  I think we will be able with the committee's support to bring the museum into the future with a proper roadmap that very much takes into consideration the shape of our collections and how we present them.  I previously raised issues concerning the long-term future of the storage of our collections.  These are all significant policy issues with which we must grapple.  It is not just a matter of HR; the museum has a wide remit.  The legislation is substantial.  I have it here.  I carry it around with me.  I am always reminded of our wide-ranging functions.</p></speech>

It is educational, inspiring and central to how we understand ourselves as a people.  This is why I feel it is useful for us to focus on trying to reform and fix it and make sure it is more accessible to the general public.  I take completely Ms Heaney's point that the new board is voluntary and has an enormous task and I wish the museum great luck with that task over the next number of years.  Perhaps in about six months to a year we could have a discussion to see how the issues that have been outlined in the reports are being implemented.</p></speech>

I was just reading Culture 2025, which will play such a major part in our lives.  I wish to ask the witnesses two questions.  First, are they looking forward to hosting the Seanad?  Do they wish to comment on that?  We are looking forward to going there.  Second, before we leave, what is the most interesting object in either of the museums which the witnesses think we should go to see?</p></speech>

I have my favourite objects as well, but regarding the ceramics room and facilitating the Seanad, I think one of the lessons the Houses of the Oireachtas have learned, the museum has learned and our other neighbour has perhaps learned is that it is better to work collaboratively.  The National Museum of Ireland has quite a number of shortcomings.  I outlined when I made my first presentation here the fact that we have a beautiful but leaking roof in the rotunda that needs to be fixed.  We have many infrastructural problems.  I also mentioned the fact that we do not have a lift, so anyone with a mobility issue cannot access the upper galleries in our national museum.  I am not happy about that.  What we can do collaboratively to improve access and the condition of these historic buildings are two very important matters.  At that level, there has been more than one good outcome.  Not only will the Seanad be able to sit somewhere very convenient to the facilities of Leinster House, but we also now have a much better collaborative working relationship.  The Ceann Comhairle is leading on that and we very much appreciate that support.</p></speech>

I will address it to Mr. &Oacute; Floinn and we will excuse Ms Heaney and thank her for coming before the committee.  The <i>Lusitania</i>is one of the most important sites off the coast of Ireland.  It is a national gravesite and a serious archaeological and historical site in its own right.  Is it the case that there have been quite strict criteria for dives and supervision of dives from the Department in partnership with the National Museum of Ireland?</p><p> I have taken a look at some of the evidence concerning what has happened in recent times.  We know that there seemed to be a change in those criteria and that supervision, and this seems to have happened unilaterally within the Department.  There was a mishap in the dive that occurred as a result of this in that the key telegraph machine it went down to recover was lost.  It fell from a retrieval process so, if found, it is likely to be fairly damaged.  The National Museum of Ireland has a role in this process.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Floinn think it is a good idea that the criteria and the supervision changed?</p></speech>

The licensing authority is actually the Department and the Minister.  We have an advisory role, as we do regarding archaeological excavations in so far as they relate to archaeological finds.  The normal practice is that an archaeologist is present when a dive happens.  If there are sports divers or divers who are professional but not qualified, they are accompanied by diving archaeologists.  As I understand it, in this instance, which occurred in July last year, no archaeologist was present on the dive.  This was brought to our attention in the museum, and I subsequently contacted the National Monuments Service to express my concern at the fact that there appeared to have been a departure from the normal practice.  As I understand it from the National Monuments Service, this was an exceptional case because of the particular instances whereby there was a window of opportunity to dive.  We were very concerned that this would lead to a precedent for the future but I am assured by the National Monuments Service that this was an exceptional case and that the normal situation would pertain in the future.</p></speech>
