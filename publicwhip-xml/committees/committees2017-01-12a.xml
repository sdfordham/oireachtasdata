Mr. Grant is managing director of Irish Water, while Mr. Marley is Ervia's group finance director.  We will make a brief presentation.</p> <p>  We have been asked to address the funding of Irish Water since its establishment and its projected funding for the next ten to 15 years.  In our presentation we will set out why this funding is needed, the full amount used to date and the funding we believe we will need in the next ten to 15 years.  Most importantly, we will explain what has been delivered to date with the funding we have received and what we will deliver in the future with the funding we are seeking.</p> <p>  I assume everyone has the slides in front of him or her.  Looking at slide 4, a review of water services carried out in 2011 as part of the water sector reform programme identified significant shortcomings in water services in Ireland.  These shortcomings have been well rehearsed in public in the past 18 months, but I will put them in context.  Up to 50% of the water we produce expensively is lost through leakages.  In 2013, 24,000 people were subject to long-term boil water notices, that is, they had had to boil water for a number of years.  Over 1 million citizens were at risk of contamination of water supplied by 121 water treatment plants.  One in three wastewater treatment plants is overloaded, which means that the volume of material they are receiving is greater than the volume they can handle.</p><p>Therefore we are putting wastewater which is not at a required standard back into our receiving waters and 70% of our sewer network is leaking.  We were then pumping raw sewage, which is untreated, into our rivers and our receiving waters in 44 locations and 150,000 properties had lead services and much more in terms of deficits and lack of service quality was identified in that report.  </p><p> We have been here before.  In the 1970s, Ireland's gas network was in a similar condition with cast iron pipes, very poor infrastructural condition, significant gas leakages, actual explosions and the risk of explosion on the network.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was established as a public utility in 1976 to address this situation.  Over the next number of decades, it undertook a massive rehabilitation and network expansion programme to repair the network and to take advantage of the natural indigenous gas that was found off the west coast of Ireland.  That investment programme by that public utility has resulted in a situation where today we have one of the most modern and secure gas network infrastructures in Europe.  We have a similar situation with our water services but it is a much more complex challenge, mainly because of the scale of the assets on the ground.  We have 900 water treatment plants, over 1,000 wastewater treatment plants, 63,000 km of water mains and 32,000 km of sewers serving our water and wastewater infrastructure needs in Ireland today.  That scale and complexity right across the country makes it a challenge greater than what was faced by Bord G&aacute;is in 1976.  It is exactly the same type of challenge, just much larger.  The decision was made to create a single public utility to take responsibility for managing our water services.</p><p> The benefit of a utility is that it brings a structured approach to addressing these challenges and a standard approach to asset management.  That is the specification, design and the performance expectation that we set out for the assets.  There is a standard approach to how we operate and maintain those assets.  It also brings a national approach to investing all of the capital that is needed.  That means we are optimising the capital and minimising the amount of capital we need to get the greatest benefit in terms of improving our assets, improving our infrastructure and delivering the service.  A single public utility also creates a company that can attract external funding and financing and that has been proven by all of the other Irish utilities we have.  They are very attractive as organisations to attract external funding for the significant capital investment needed to repair our infrastructure.  The systematic and structural approach to managing those assets and the economies of scale one gets from a single organisation mean we can reduce the costs of those services, deliver much more efficient service and deliver much better customer service to the consumers of the product.  </p><p> In mid-2012, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was given the mandate to set up this new public utility.  It leveraged its experience and capabilities to set up the Irish Water organisation.  One will see from my presentation that we have created in Irish Water an organisational model that is identical to the one that exists in Bord G&aacute;is Networks.  It is exactly the same fundamental building blocks that one has in any utility but it was modified to meet the needs of a water utility.  </p><p> The operation of all modern utilities in the world today is underpinned by eight key systems.  It is these systems and the processes associated with those systems that bring the standardised approach to operating, maintaining and running our water utility.  This allows us to build, operate and maintain the assets and drive efficiencies in an organised and structured manner.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has these eight systems in existence, as it did in 2012, within its Gas Networks Ireland business.  It built a second version of those systems, modified to suit a water utility, for Irish Water.  Over an 18-month period, a programme was put in place in which those systems were built, modified to suit a water company and integrated so they all worked and transferred data between one other.  It got them up and running for Irish Water to be able to take over water services at the beginning of 2014.  To do that, the company used specialist external companies.  These were software engineers, hardware engineers and system integrators to help us build those eight systems over that 18-month period.  This is the standard practice for all utilities worldwide.  That is the investment of &euro;173 million that established Irish Water.</p><p>In doing that, just like any other utility, we did use external companies who were experts in systems integration and software modification to put together that full organisation plus those systems and capabilities.  That investment of &euro;173 million created a new Irish company with all of those systems and capabilities in 18 months and we have benchmarked this at &euro;100 million less than would have been done by any other company starting from scratch.</p><p> As well as creating Irish Water, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann changed from being Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to becoming Ervia, which is a 100% Irish-owned semi-State company.  We are owned by the people of Ireland.  They are our shareholder but we are represented, if one likes, by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, who is the shareholding Minister with overall responsibility for Ervia, Gas Networks Ireland and Irish Water.  The operation of that company is overseen by an independent board whose role it is to ensure that Ervia and the subsidiary companies are well governed and that we deliver on the objectives that are set for us as an organisation.  The final slide sets out the board members who are serving as Ervia's board today.   They bring strong financial, HR, business and utility experience to bear on the company.  There is strong engineering and infrastructure experience in water, energy, telecoms and transport among the board members of the organisation.  The board oversees me and my management team in regard to how we run Ervia, Irish Water and Gas Networks Ireland as subsidiary utilities in order to ensure we deliver on the business plans and objectives that have been set for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017011200002#L00200"><p>I am the managing director of Irish Water.  I will take a few minutes to talk about some aspects of Irish Water, starting with the period before the set-up of the company.  For the previous decade or two, rising standards and the constant challenge of new technologies had put real pressure on the model that existed.  Between complexities around the funding model, the fragmented structure and the lack of upskilling of resources at the level needed within each local authority to be able to manage those assets, what we saw was that big capital investments were made and, over time, those assets degraded and their lifetime performance did not match expectations.  This has given rise to the deficits we have in drinking water, particularly the inconsistency of compliance in many parts of the country, the difficulty of meeting capacity, particularly in the greater Dublin area but also in other urban areas, and the very significant compliance issues in regard to wastewater, whereby 70% of all the communities are served by plants that are not compliant.  Wastewater capacity deficits are often caused by overloading due to lack of management of trade discharges and the growth in the economy, all of which leads to service outages and breakdowns that absorb too much money and operating costs because of the condition of the assets.</p> <p>  The challenge we face is to achieve catch-up on compliance, particularly around drinking water as an absolute priority initially, because it concerns the safety of the water we drink, but also in regard to wastewater to stop pollution and make sure we protect the environment.  I refer to the urgency of meeting housing need and development need, particularly in parts of the country where that is a real pressure, and to making rapid significant changes to our operating model and therefore to the work practices and expertise that is available in our operations.  We must be able to use the technology to be as efficient as possible in order to devote resources to making sure that when we spend money on operations, it is delivering service.  All of that must be supported by certainty of funding, not for one year or for two, but looking ahead five to ten years, because that is the key to this.</p> <p>  What Irish Water has put in place has delivered an asset management capability which is about having information, standards, policies and specifications that are standard across the industry.  We must be able to carry out a needs assessment across the entire asset base and to prioritise that to do the right things with the money we have.  One never has enough money to do all the things one wants to do in an infrastructure-intensive business and, therefore, one must prioritise.  We are beginning to put together detailed strategic and sectoral investment plans that have national and regional application.  This is done with wide consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, particularly statutory stakeholders such as planning authorities and in the context of delivering the data, the analytics and the business information that are now available to every part of the organisation.</p> <p>  Allied to that, we must have a capital delivery machine that drives out very substantial amounts of capital in the most efficient way possible.  That means programme and project management.  It means having the environmental, legal, planning and engineering skills to be able to deliver very complex statutory processes in regard to planning, site acquisition and all the permits that are required.  It means having the supply chain of designers, contractors and specialists that are essential to the delivery of such a programme and, obviously, the contract and procurement arrangements and health and safety and quality management processes to ensure the right result for the expenditure.</p><p> In terms of operations and maintenance, we have overall responsibility to co-ordinate the operation of the services across the country.  We have to set the targets, define the budgets and ensure that local authorities are working to the objectives we share with them.  We want to ensure that the asset maintenance delivery is planned as much as possible so we anticipate and avoid failures.  Clearly, we have to respond to outages and look after our critical assets in particular because they have a huge impact when they fail and we see the consequences of that every day.  We need to use the process instrumentation and the control visibility we now have to anticipate problems and send dispatch crews more quickly to deal with issues where that is possible and get resolution for customers.</p><p> We have a facility that allows us to take customer calls and transfer them to the individual local authority within seven minutes.  Where the system works very well, the work gets done, the report comes back and goes back out to the customer.  Increasingly that is happening and that is at the heart of good customer service.</p><p> We also have the capacity to deal with the impact of outages, of course, and in particular for vulnerable customers.  About 30,000 properties are registered as vulnerable and they are a particular focus whenever there is a problem.  Clearly we need to have an efficient means of billing and collection of revenues from the non-domestic sector in terms of traders charged and connections.  We also need to have the necessary support services to work effectively and productively with the economic regulator and with the environmental and health authorities, in particular the EPA, which is our environmental regulator.</p><p> Irish Water delivers water and provides wastewater services to 1.7 million customers, between domestic and non-domestic premises.  That equates to almost 1.7 billion litres of water every day with almost as much wastewater collected, treated and discharged to receiving waters.  We have 2,000 significant treatment plants and 95,000 km of network.  We dealt with 140,000 customer queries last year.  On average 4,000 work orders go out every month to crews throughout the country.  We made 3,500 new connections last year and that will rise significantly in coming years.</p><p> We manage a pipeline of work in the capital programme of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  That indicates the scale of the pipeline needed to deliver the target level of annual investment of &euro;600 million.  At any one time we are managing that level of work through the process from feasibility study through to handover.  We currently have 20 capital programmes where we are upgrading assets across the country.  These include disinfection, cleaning reservoirs, rehabilitating sewerage works, aeration plants and so on.  There are nearly 500 projects at the moment.  We are spending &euro;7.5 million every month on that work.  That is improving health and safety, and improving operation on existing assets.  We plan to double that over the next 12 months.</p><p> We manage a huge amount of procurement.  Between operations and capital, we outsource approximately &euro;750 million a year and that will rise further.  We deal with all the budget management issues relating to that.  We also manage all of the long-term asset planning, environmental management regulatory compliance and so on.</p><p> In the period 2015-16, having published our 25-year plan, looking ahead to the ambitions we have and that we share with members of the committee and the Government for the future of our water services, we established that broadly speaking to bring everything up to the level that would deliver against those ambitions would cost over &euro;13 billion, which is clearly far more than could be spent in any single investment cycle.  We have had to prioritise that with an immediate &euro;5.5 billion target by the end of 2021, followed by two further five-year periods of &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;4 billion, respectively.  That is based on the anticipated work and capital maintenance needed to keep the assets we are building now up to scratch during that period.</p><p> Slide 17 shows the breakdown of that across drinking water, wastewater and general infrastructure, which means leakage management and networks, but critically upgrading and maintaining the existing assets and keeping those in as-good-as-new condition.  That will absorb that &euro;5.5 billion and we will talk later about what that will deliver.</p><p> Slide 18 shows that the investment over the past three years and for the next five is well distributed across the country, but there are particular black spots.  For example, drinking water has been a particular problem in Roscommon, Galway, Donegal, Tipperary and Kerry.  Wastewater has been a particular problem in Dublin, Cork, Donegal and Waterford.  Those are counties where specific problems have existed historically for a very long time.</p><p> Looking beyond 2021, in the next period we will have to do an enormous amount of work to rationalise our water supply so that we have sustainable sources, with far fewer treatment plants but to the right standards.  We will have to continue to deal with leakage and lead and also with critical assets, some of which have been in place since the 19th century.  On wastewater, there is a great deal to do in terms of the ambitions in our river basin plans and our EPA licences that we will not be able to get to in the short term.  There are significant flood risk issues in urban areas that will have to be tackled and we will have to begin the work of dealing with brick and masonry sewers that have been in place since the 19th century that are in danger of collapse.</p><p> Coping with growth and dealing with strategic development zones that are being contemplated in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere will continue to require money.  We have identified two major strategic projects for the future water supply and drainage systems for Dublin.  The latter will be based in the north of the county.  These will be required by the mid-2020s and delivering them will be a major challenge from a funding perspective.  We continue to insist that very substantial funding will be needed to maintain the existing assets and to keep rebuilding them.  The plants, particularly those built in the past ten or 15 years, will require significant funding just to keep them working correctly.  </p><p> Looking beyond that, we can already see the sort of work that will have to be done right out into the mid-2030s.  Ultimately, the cast iron and asbestos cement pipes must be replaced and that will take a long time.  The rationalisation of our regional supplies and dealing with climate change and its impact on our facilities will be a challenge.  We know already that some of our current sources in the eastern region will not have the water flows in summer that they have now and we will have to cater for that.  Equally, we will have greater flood densities.</p><p> The cost and challenge of keeping very complex assets up to good-as-new standard will be there for us.  We can say that in the period to 2016 we have already delivered some real and tangible benefits.  We have dealt with - put on and taken off -  boil water notices for 145,000 people.  That represented critical risks for those supplies and while we know that the job is not finished yet, we have gotten much better at identifying the problems and responding more quickly.  We have replaced about 840 km of pipe or laid new pipe and a further 1,000 km have been targeted for replacement as soon as possible.  We have built nine new water treatment plants and upgraded 18.  We have introduced pressure management in almost 250 sites around the country and have installed 884,000 domestic water meters.  In terms of wastewater, 32 wastewater plants have been upgraded and 27 new ones built.  A lot of monitoring equipment has been installed and plant optimisation is going on in 436 of our wastewater sites.  Members will know from the EPA reports that maintenance and operation is a factor in non-compliance at many of our plants.  A lot of work is also happening in terms of health and safety at the plants.  Our submission contains some pictures of plants which are fairly typical of the treatment plants with which members will be familiar.  </p><p> We set out very clearly - some might say bravely - in our business plan that by 2021 we would have delivered a range of tangible benefits for this country from the investment of &euro;5.5 billion with which it was anticipated we would be provided.  In terms of drinking water, we committed to eliminating boil water notices and to de-risking the plants that currently serve 700,000 people but which served 940,000 when we took over.  In terms of critical capacity in the greater Dublin area and the other growth centres throughout the country, we will have dealt with that sufficiently to meet demand.  We will meet the fundamental compliance challenges for which the European Court of Justice is prosecuting us under the urban wastewater directives and will have made a decent start on reducing the leakage.  What we have set out in our submission today is the definite progress we have made on that path through to 2016.  It is fair to say that we are on track, provided we can keep it going with the funding.</p></speech>

The first chart shows capital expenditure, in 2015 values, for the period 2014 to 2021, with a significant increase in such investment during that time.</p><p>The level of capital investment is more than doubling in the period to meet the needs outlined by Mr. Grant.  Members will see from the breakdown that the &euro;5.5 billion investment is spread over water and wastewater quality and capacity, as well as other critical infrastructure.  The second chart shows the value of assets that Irish Water is managing at the moment and the growth in those assets out to 2021.  The value rises from approximately &euro;2 billion in 2015 up to close to &euro;5 billion by 2021.  That is a massive increase in the scale of the business.  It is more than a doubling in terms of the scale of the assets that have to be built, in the first instance, and then operated and maintained.  That does not include the &euro;8 billion that is factored in for the post-2021 period out to 2033.  The scale of the business is going to grow rapidly.  What that means for the operating cost base of the business is outlined on page 26 of our submission.  Despite the fact that the asset base is growing - more than doubling over the period 2014 to 2021 - and that the service targets we are setting will are improving, the actual cost base is not increasing.  The cost base is going to decrease from 2014 to 2015 by &euro;253 million in 2015 values.  That translates into &euro;272 million in nominal values.  We are targeting these efficiencies because, in benchmarking terms, we know that the legacy costs of running this utility are up to two times more than international practice.  We are driving out efficiencies and the regulator has a role to play in that as well.</p><p> The growth operating expense, Opex, is highlighted in green on the first chart on page 26.  We have factored that in on top and we have also included first fix expenditure in 2015 and 2016.  In terms of the efficiencies, it is the up-front investment we have made in terms of the capabilities of the people we have brought in, the processes we have introduced and the systems that we have implemented that is allowing us to scale up the business very rapidly while managing the costs downwards.  Without that investment we would not be able to do that.  Those efficiencies are going to come from economies of scale and best practice in terms of our operations.  </p><p> The data on page 27 outlines what all of that actually means in terms of funding requirements.  We have broken this out into two cycles, namely 2014 to 2016 and 2017 to 2021.  The second five-year cycle in particular is important and is a typical regulatory cycle.  We are managing long-term assets so one must look at them over at least a five-year period.  In fact, one plans over a much longer period than that.  Members can see that the funding to date from 2014 to 2016 was &euro;3.7 billion.  In terms of the funding split, &euro;2.2 billion has come from revenue, &euro;700 million has come from State equity and &euro;800 million from external commercial borrowings.  That has been used to address operating costs of &euro;2.1 billion and capital investment of &euro;1.6 billion.  The data for the five-year period to 2021 shows that the funding requirement is &euro;8 billion.  The plan is for revenue of &euro;5 billion, equity from the State of just under &euro;1 billion and borrowings of &euro;2 billion.</p><p> From an Irish Water perspective, what is important is that these are long-term assets that are critical for the future development of the State and as such, they require long-term strategic planning.  In terms of delivering that, there is a requirement for certainty on funding and not just funding on an annual basis but at a minimum on a five-year basis, which is a typical regulatory price control period.  In the UK, price control periods can be up to seven years but in Ireland they are generally five years.  One needs certainty of funding so that one can plan the timing and delivery of the infrastructure.</p></speech>

I am one of the three commissioners with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  I am accompanied by Ms Sheenagh Rooney, director of operations for water at the commission.  We will make the presentation together.  We want to briefly present to the committee on the CER and its role in regulating Irish Water and holding it to account for the efficient delivery of water services and customer service.</p> <p>  As slide 3 of the presentation shows, our mission as set out in our strategic plan is the regulation of water, energy and energy safety in the public interest.  The public interest is at the heart of everything we do.  The CER has six strategic goals which relate to ensuring: a reliable supply of clean water and efficient treatment of wastewater; that regulation is the best international practice; that prices charged are fair and reasonable; that energy and gas are safely supplied; that the lights stay on; and that gas continues to flow.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the CER's specific role - under legislation - in the context of water.  Our overriding role is to protect the interests of water and wastewater customers, especially in customer protection.  The CER ensures Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with codes of practice and a customer handbook, which is essentially the rules - set by the commission- by which Irish Water must comply with regard to the customer service standard delivered by Irish Water.  If the latter fails to deliver to that standard, the CER also offers a dispute resolution service to settle any dispute between customers and Irish Water.  Under the legislation we also provide economic regulation of Irish Water.  This is achieved by approving Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed water charges plan.  The essential elements of that regulation are the approval or setting of a revenue cap on what Irish Water is allowed to earn, how that translates into tariffs, whether they be they domestic or non-domestic tariffs and how it translates into a connection policy and the charges which domestic or non-domestic customers would pay for connection to the Irish Water system.  The CER also has a role in the monitoring of Irish Water&rsquo;s performance across a range of areas including customer service, water quality, security of supply, and delivery of Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plan.  We seek co-operation with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is one of our functions.  We have a strong co-operative working relationship with the EPA, although we have different statutory functions.  We are about to conclude a memorandum of understanding with the EPA in respect of that role. The CER established, and continues to provide support to and work with, the Public Water Forum, which represents the voice of the water consumer.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight some of the CER's achievements to date.  I have already alluded to customer protection and the fact that the CER has produced a customer handbook that sets out obligations on Irish Water.  That has now been turned into a series of codes of practice and the customer charter by Irish Water.  We are gathering data, preparing compliance reports on that data and publishing the reports for public consumption.  In addition, in protecting the interests of Irish Water customers and ensuring delivery of services at least cost - and specifically regarding the complaints and customer protection elements - the complaints resolution service is now established under the auspices of our customer care team.  We have a full customer contact and query resolution service in operation for Irish Water customers.  In challenging Irish Water to deliver efficiencies, the CER has now completed two revenue controls.</p><p>Under the first revenue control, we cut Irish Water's proposed revenue requirement by &euro;183 million or 8.5%.  This covered the period October 2014 to 2016.  In the second revenue control, which was completed before Christmas last year, we cut Irish Water's proposed costs by 8.2% for the years 2017 to 2018, which resulted in a saving to customers of &euro;165 million.  </p><p> Specifically referring to its operating expenditure, we now require Irish Water to deliver a 20% reduction in its operating costs in the period 2015 to 2018.  As at the end of 2016, Irish Water has delivered 14% of those savings.  We have also established a performance assessment framework which is essentially a series of key performance indicators.  These are the means by which we will hold Irish Water to account for delivering service improvements while delivering efficiencies at the same time.  There is a point at the end of the slide about Irish Water's achievements but they have already been adequately covered by Irish Water.  </p><p> I will now hand over to Ms Sheenagh Rooney who will talk a little more about how we do our job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sheenagh Rooney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017011200002#Q00200"><p>I will go into a little bit more detail about how we actually do our job with regard to the economic regulation of Irish Water.  As Dr. Paul McGowan said, as economic regulator of Irish Water, we are responsible for all of Irish Water's charges and a key part of that process is assessing and forming a view on Irish Water's costs behind those charges.  We do that after Irish Water makes a submission to us, as the regulator.  A key part of our ongoing challenge is to get Irish Water essentially to deliver efficiencies, reducing the cost of its operation and the day-to-day running costs of Irish Water.  That should help facilitate greater investment, which is much needed, in the capital expenditure and the water service infrastructure on the ground.  Ultimately, this should lead to improvements for customers.</p> <p>  We have completed two revenue controls to date, which were two-year revenue controls.  Normally with gas and electricity, we conduct five-year revenue controls.  The two-year revenue controls reflect Irish Water essentially being in start-up phase and discovering more data.  We have felt up to now that the two two-year revenue controls have been appropriate but we will look at the length of the revenue control going forward.  When we have assessed the operational costs and appropriate amount of capital expenditure, as proposed by Irish Water, and formed a view on that and the right amount of efficiency challenge to put on Irish Water, we then calculate the revenue requirement, which essentially is the income that Irish Water should be allowed in any given year to cover its operational costs, depreciation and return on the capital investment to date.  As part of the revenue review process, we are always looking at what Irish Water is seeking to deliver for the money invested, both in terms of output and outcomes.  We work on the basis that the income will be there to meet the revenue requirement.  That is met from a variety of sources at the moment.  As part of the water charges plan, we also approved the charges for non-domestic customers and connection charges.  At present, they are those that were already being levied by the local authorities but Irish Water is working on proposals for enduring policies in this regard which would be consulted in the future.</p> <p>  I will move on to the most recent revenue control we submitted.  The first revenue control target from 2014 to 2016 was set on Irish Water to reduce its operational costs by 14%.  It did this and has sufficiently outlined the service improvements for customers arising out of that.  Focusing on the recent revenue control, on which we published a decision paper in December last year, for the forthcoming period 2017 to 2018, the challenge for Irish Water is to continue to reduce costs whilst improving service, but also to facilitate growth at the same time.  </p> <p>  One of the key points in terms of the savings we are requesting from Irish Water over the next two years is that a total of &euro;165 million savings has been pointed out.</p><p>That comes from a &euro;128 million reduction in operational costs and a &euro;136 million decrease in capital investment that were sought.  We will continue to monitor Irish Water's performance <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>these targets.<br/><br/>Some of the detail in the breakdown of Irish Water's operational costs and capital expenditure is relevant when we come to judging what is an appropriate savings target to set for Irish Water.  There is a little more detail on that in the slides provided to the committee.  There is a chart, on the left hand side, on operating costs proposed by Irish Water from 2017 and 2018.  One key point in this slide is that, as has already been alluded to, there is an amount of legacy costs associated with Irish Water and over 70% of the operational costs of Irish Water are associated either with the costs of the service level agreements, which is the cost of the local authorities delivering the services on the ground, or the design, build and operating costs of contracts that were in place and novated to Irish Water to design, build and operate water infrastructure on the ground.  That 70% is a large proportion of the overall operating costs.<br/><br/>We have approved a &euro;1.1 billion capital investment programme on the capital side for 2017-18.  That came from our review of Irish Water's most recent capital investment plan which covered the period 2017-2021.  As has been outlined in relation to the compliance challenge in the water sector, over 50% of those costs are concentrated on projects.<br/><br/>To concentrate a little more on what we do, our process and the level of detail we get into in determining the savings challenge that should be put on Irish Water, we follow a standard regulatory approach.  It is the same as that adopted for years in relation to electricity and gas, and which is adopted by independent regulators throughout the world regarding water regulation.  We have a lot of experience in revenue reviews of network companies.  We regulate EirGrid, ESB Networks, and Gas Networks Ireland, and we have seen the benefits that are there for consumers in terms of regulation leading to decreases in operational costs.  This leads to greater investment on the capital side, particularly in, for example, the electricity networks where continuity of supply targets have improved greatly over the years through the investment that has been facilitated by network regulation.  That is what we will be hoping to do in Irish Water.<br/><br/>We use a number of techniques to determine the appropriate challenge or saving that we should require from Irish Water in the forthcoming two years.  We are always focused on challenging but achievable targets.  We want to focus on targets that challenge Irish Water to reduce costs but also that it cannot compromise the level of service customers who are receiving water services already receive.  That is particularly challenging in the current environment.<br/><br/>We benchmark Irish Water against other water utility companies elsewhere - I will cover that in a little more detail in a moment - but we also look in detail at Irish Water's costs on a bottom-up basis.  For example, if we were looking at a capital submission, we would be looking at how Irish Water determined the right priorities for investment and how those decisions were made, the process behind them and how the costs were built up.  This is part of the analysis that goes into determining whether the costs are reasonable.<br/><br/>A key part of the CER process is consultation.  We are required under legislation to consult and we do so on all the decisions that we make.  As has been said, we engage with the Public Water Forum and all our documentation is published and in the public domain.<br/><br/>Another key issue for us in the revenue review, as Dr. McGowan stated, is monitoring thereafter the performance of Irish Water on the targets that it states it will achieve.  We do that in a number of ways, be it on the customer side or on the capital investment programme side, by putting in place a framework in that regard or through the performance assessment framework.  That was mentioned already and will form a good basis of data over time.</p><p> On benchmarking and our point of view on it, benchmarking is a key piece of the jigsaw in determining the right target to put on Irish Water.  We are able to look at the efficiency of Irish Water relative to English and Welsh utilities, looking at all its operational costing, including the costs that I have pointed out.  These are mature water utilities which have been in existence for years and they have a particularly good data set.  Looking at that analysis, we can look a the gap between where Irish Water is now in terms of efficiency, and obviously there are inefficiencies in Irish Water and it has a lot of legacy costs in place, and where we would like it to get to over time and the standard we would like it to achieve.  We then have to determine what it is capable of achieving.  One way in which we do that is looking at neighbouring jurisdictions, for example, Scottish Water and Northern Ireland Water, and what they were able to achieve in terms of efficiency at a similar stage of evolution to Irish Water.</p><p> After that we look at the particular characteristics of Irish Water, be it the scale of the compliance challenge, the fact it is a two-year revenue review and not a five-year revenue review, or the operating model that is in place.  That is how we determine what we believe to be an appropriate target for Irish Water for that period in terms of savings for the customer.  As Dr. McGowan has summarised, where that has left us with the revenue review for 2017-2018 is a request for Irish Water to reduce costs by 20% as a global target between 2015 and 2018.</p></speech>

We also have a major project under way to establish a non-domestic tariff framework for Irish Water and a connection charging policy for all customers of the utility.  We will also put in place a monitoring framework for Irish Water's capital investment plan by the end of 2017.  We will be looking to put in place the key performance indicators, and the measurement and reporting of some of these KPIs, within 2017.</p> <p>  Another of our priorities is to engage with this review process and to continue our engagement with the Public Water Forum, as the voice of Irish Water, and with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and other regulatory authorities.  At the end of this year we will need to start determining how we will put together the revenue control for the years 2019 onwards, because it will take in excess of 12 months to carry out such a significant revenue control review.  We are happy to address any questions the committee might have and to assist it in any way that we can.</p></speech>

When it is quantifying the amount of money that is being saved, is it looking at what is suffered as result of that saving or just that it expects this efficiency due to economies of scale and such issues?  In its submission, I was quite concerned at the mention of the metering process.  How does the CER consider that it would be part of its role to consider anything to do with metering?  I cannot understand why it would contribute to that.  I would not see it as a regulatory issue.</p><p>The witnesses talk about abandoning metering due to the cost, but 75% of it is finished.  Why do the witnesses think it is their role to comment on it?</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any data from the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, on companies, either indigenous or foreign, that have not set up in Ireland because of the lack of water security to the mid-2020s?  The agrifood business and others need a lot of water.  What sort of economic impact has the lack of investment in water services by the Government before the last election had?  In respect of infringing EU regulations, have we any idea what the potential costs to the Exchequer are if we do not get our supply up to scratch?  Do we know how much money will be required to fix it so that we do not get into trouble?  What investment is required to comply with the requirements of EU directives? </p></speech>

Despite the best intentions of Irish Water and the regulator, public confidence in the entity or utility is not what one would expect.  The manner in which it was constructed, the funding model and charging regime confirm that.  Subsequent efforts by Government have only compounded this issue.  It is not the entity or the utility that is in question now, neither are the need for investment in the network and the capital costs associated with that.</p> <p>  The question of Irish Water's performance is contained in a commitment by Government to put in place an independent external advisory body on a statutory basis and legislation should flow in the coming months in this regard, irrespective of this issue.  This should include publishing advice to the Government, quarterly reports to the Members of the Oireachtas, with particular regard to many of the issues raised by the regulator.  Public confidence is not what it should be and the witnesses have not guaranteed that, nor are they likely to do so despite their best intentions.  There has to be cost reduction and efficiency improvements, issues relating to procurement, infrastructure, delivery, leakage reductions, improvements in water quality, elimination of boil water notices, responsiveness to the needs of community and enterprise, and so forth.</p> <p>  This committee is charged with examining the funding model for the implementation of the programme.  The expert commission for example has said it believes the best way to do that is to end charges and allow the Government be the main customer of Irish Water.  That being the case we need to establish the impact that has on Irish Water's ability to deliver the service for water and wastewater infrastructure.</p><p>In regard to metering, the expert commission recommended that Irish Water should complete a comprehensive programme of district metering, which would identify system-wide leakage and would manage the network.  Irish Water has stated previously that the ending of metering is in effect the end of water charges.  Irish Water's capital investment plan 2017-21 provides for a capital investment programme of &euro;5.5 billion.  Will this now be revised?  Has Irish Water or the regulator costed a completed district metering system?  If so, has that cost been compared with the cost envisaged for a domestic metering system?  The capital plan to 2021 references a figure of &euro;574 million in respect of water charges.  What is the impact of the loss of water charges?  What will be the impact of a district metering system as compared with a domestic metering system?</p><p> In regard to capital investment requirements, the &euro;13 billion proposed for address of total deficiencies is an estimated amount.  Is it a gross amount that excludes efficiencies?  What is the timeframe for the completion of those targets in terms of the proposed &euro;13 billion investment?  Will this be affected by the new separate revenue system, as is envisaged?  On borrowing capacity, what is the current borrowing cost associated with Irish Water borrowings?  If the State is to be a sole customer of domestic water tariffs, is it feasible for Irish Water to borrow on the markets, which it does through its parent Ervia?  Has an analysis been undertaken of the shift proposed by the expert commission report?  Will the cessation of water metering damage the borrowing capacity of Irish Water?  It is widely known that it is cheaper for the Government to borrow through the NTMA than it is for Ervia to do so in respect of Irish Water because of the lack of water charges income based on the initial construct, which has failed.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that point.  </p><p> In regard to efficiencies-----</p></speech>

First, to answer Deputy O'Connell's points specifically about metering, we were asked a number of questions concerning metering by the committee.  We offered ideas and views regarding the future of metering on the basis of the committee's request.  That was the genesis of those answers.  Metering is a regulatory matter.  It forms the basis in utility regulation for a large element of charging regimes right across energy, water and other utilities.  We recognise that the first phase of the metering was a decision taken by Government.  The decision was novated, so to speak, to Irish Water and to us.  Future consideration of further roll-out of metering - for example, to customers in apartment buildings and those houses that had not been metered in the first phase - was always going to be something that we would consider in due course in terms of its overall cost benefit, the cost of doing it and what its benefits would be.  Ultimately, we would have worked with Irish Water to determine the most efficient approach to close out the metering programme.  A regulator would have a very close interest in this.</p></speech>

What Dr. McGowan is saying is that when he talks about stopping the metering programme, this concerns areas where there are challenges with metering.  He is not referring to metering overall.</p></speech>

What we said was that to proceed with another major programme of metering investment, given that, as we see it, the expert commission's proposal was that the vast majority of water should be paid for by the State and that only excessive use should be charged to customers, in that context, at this time, there are other priorities for capital investment.  However, we said we could come back and consider whether there is a case for further metering in due course but, in the meantime, other options could be considered.  This was the context in which we replied to the committee.  We did not boldly state that metering should be abandoned.  We just said "at this time".</p></speech>

This would mean that despite the savings we have requested from it, we still expect it to achieve the customer improvement targets it has set out for itself.  We have come to this judgment because we have considered what other water utilities have managed to do at the same stage of evolution as Irish Water.  Scottish Water managed to achieve cuts and savings while improving service, as did Northern Ireland Water, and we expect the same from Irish Water.</p></speech>

We would look to work with the committee, Irish Water and others to identify whether there are means by which other users, or the profiles of other users, who may be excessive users might be metered in order to determine the level of excessive usage or whether there is some other means by which excessive use could be determined.</p></speech>

We should be holding Irish Water to account for the same level of efficiencies regardless of whether they are directly charging customers.  There are many jurisdictions, Northern Ireland being one, where there is not a direct charge to households for water, yet Northern Ireland Water has been held to account for delivering sizeable efficiencies.  We would expect the same of Irish Water.</p></speech>

One was to ask if there were data which would suggest that companies have not come to Ireland because of a deficit in infrastructure.  We have no knowledge or information of that.  In fact in Ireland, IDA Ireland, all the utilities and the local authorities have an incredibly positive track record of making sure infrastructure is in place when new industry or investment needs it.  While we have no information on that, we are working with a lot of foreign direct investment companies today which need significant capacity for expansion.  We are working and will make sure that no company coming into this country will have a problem with a deficit in either water or wastewater infrastructure.  We also have been approached by a number of foreign direct investment companies which have seen our investment programme and state that if they saw the resilience in clean water supply that Irish Water is aiming to get, they would be interested in bringing more industry to the country.  The proof of the value of the utility is coming to bear in this regard.  I will pass the Deputy's second question on EU infringement to Mr. Grant to answer.</p></speech>

That is why those figures are represented in our plan to 2021.  We hold out the prospect that if we do everything we have committed to do by 2021, we would be broadly compliant on those issues on which we are currently being challenged by Europe.  On Deputy Cowen's query on metering, we have concluded and wound up the contracts at 884,000 meters out of an initial target of 1.05 million and, as stated previously, have delivered 58% meter coverage.  Of the balance, many of those could not be found and were complex.  That speaks to the point that any further metering gets progressively more difficult and no country can have 100% metering.  There always is a default position where there are unmetered properties.  We could address that over time.<br/><br/>On district metering specifically, it is something we will have established right across the network as part of the leakage management programme.  A good deal has been done already.  Over the period from 2000 to 2010, approximately &euro;130 million was spent on district meter establishment.  These are meters into defined areas of roughly 1,500 premises.  It is very important that I make the point that these do not find leakage on premises.  It is not possible from district meters to conclude anything about individual premises.  There are typically approximately 1,500 premises within a district meter area.  It gives a very good idea of leakage as a whole.  Follow-up operational activity may well find high usage in a particular premises or a leak on a premises but that is the <i>ad hoc</i>process of going around.  One has to have a default position.  If there was a charging regime for those, it would have to be a default position, except in those cases where, through the normal work of leak detection, one finds somebody using a lot of water and then can follow up on it.  There is a process for that already.</p></speech>

Was a spend of 60% or 70% already in train before this programme began?</p></speech>

As a result, boundary valves had been opened and, unfortunately, those systems were no longer working effectively.  Our job has been to reinstate them, complete the work and use them to drive our find-and-fix programmes, which is what we are setting up now.</p></speech>

What we try to do is break a network up into defined areas of about 1,500 premises and that allows us to target leakage and to prioritise.  That is all that does.  It does not take us any further.  Obviously, domestic metering is about the individual premises and its use.  It is probably fair to say, and we will come back to it in the next session, that we have saved approximately 17 million litres a day on domestic premises because of following up the first fix programme.</p></speech>

The first was on the cost of borrowing and the second was when we will finalise the numbers in terms of the &euro;13 billion.  I will take the first part.  The &euro;5 billion is fixed and we have delivered the programme up to 2016 on target.  The remainder of that stays because the metering programme was phase one, which we have completed.  We have nothing in metering for phase two, so that will not change.  The &euro;13 billion is our best estimate based on the state of the assets we found.  We will refine that every planning period.  Will it go up?  It is quite possible.  We do not know but it is a fair estimate for the work we have done to date as to what we need.  I will hand over to Mr. Marley who will talk about the cost of borrowings.</p></speech>

That would not be typical for a utility but it would be typical for a start-up utility.  We fund our gas business on a ten-year, 15-year or 20-year basis, so that is the type of money one would get.  If we compare the current cost of Irish Water borrowing on a one-year basis with that of Government borrowing on a one-year basis, there is a difference of approximately 1.4%, which is in the region of &euro;13 million.  In reality, if the Government were to fund us, rather than us getting one-year facilities that we have with eight international banks, it would not fund on a one-year basis.  Very little money is raised by the State on a one-year basis.  It is more likely on a ten-year plus basis so the difference would be more likely 0.5%, which is approximately &euro;5 million.  If we compare the cost of funding our gas business on a ten-year basis with the State borrowing cost on a ten-year basis, there is a difference of approximately &euro;4 million or 0.5%.</p></speech>

In response to a previous question on his commentary about another phase of rolling out domestic water meters, he said that in the context of the expert commission's report, it would not be prudent to proceed with another roll-out because it has proposed, by and large, that domestic water would be provided by general taxation.  That is his position.  Has he examined this from a cost control perspective?  If that is the case, does the commission see savings being made regarding the non-roll-out of domestic water meters?</p><p>In an answer to an Teachta O'Connell's question earlier, the possibility of parking the roll-out was mentioned.  Could that actually increase costs?  We could have increased labour or contractual costs, so could that add costs?  If this has been looked at from a cost control perspective, has it been looked at from the point of view of reducing costs in terms of revenue controls?</p></speech>

What we said was that if we were going to look at a further phase of domestic water metering, it would require a detailed analysis, with a public consultation to determine the overall cost benefits would.</p></speech>

My next question is to Mr. McNicholas.  Given that we are obviously focused on funding, is Irish Water of the view now that it is no longer possible to base its future funding on an off-balance sheet funding model , either in the short, medium or long term?  The same question goes to the commissioner as well.</p></speech>

It would have to be looked at very carefully.  It is not in the remit of Irish Water to do that, but it could be looked at in that context.  It may be possible to look at off-balance sheet funding on that basis.</p></speech>

First of all, from a cost perspective, has there been any cost-benefit analysis of that?  Second, if there is to be rationalising, will those assets remain under the control of Irish Water or would they be farmed out to private companies?  Is it the intention that they would remain in public ownership under Irish Water?</p></speech>

The design-build-operate type contract has been used for the past 15 years or so to build and operate plants for a defined period, the larger plants in particular.  We have changed the model a bit to make it more flexible in order that we are not committed to long-term private sector operation.  As we build capacity of the utility, we would hope to do much more of that and bring it back within the operation of the organisation itself.  Rationalisation is something we see as a key feature of drinking water supplies going forward, with larger, more sustainable sources.  We do not see rationalisation of wastewater as a prospect.  Wastewater has to be treated at the town or village that it is produced at.</p></speech>

With respect, I would like to make one final point, which I will direct at the Chairman.  The expert commission's report refers to a NewERA report which was prepared for Government on funding options.

The expert commission described the report, which was not available to the commission, as "essential to a complete an accurate assessment of financing options".  When Sinn F&eacute;in submitted a freedom of information request for a copy of the report, we were informed that this is not yet possible, although it may be possible to furnish a redacted version.

They say it is good for one's health to get up early in the mornings.  There are many communities in Cork city and county who force me to get up very early to meet some of the Irish Water metering crews at the entrances of various housing estates.</p><p>On the issue of operating costs, the expert commission report states that the majority of ordinary households should not have to pay the water charge through direct charges and that only a minority of what are described as water wasters should do so.  It suggests a couple of ways of achieving that outcome.  It posits the idea that perhaps 90% of domestic users would not pay water charges and perhaps 10%  would pay a water charge.  From the point of view of costs, is it not crazy economics to then meter, bill and collect data from every home simply to collect charges from 10% of domestic users?  Any ordinary person would conclude that such a proposal amounts to crazy economics.  I ask the witnesses to comment.</p><p>Representatives of the Commission for Energy Regulation spoke about parking the metering programme.  Do the representatives of Irish Water agree that the programme should be parked?  Do they also agree that this would mean, <i>ipso facto</i>, that the charges must be scrapped, by which I mean that all charges, including the so-called excessive usage charge, would be impossible to pursue without-----</p></speech>

Let us consider that for a moment.  According to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>of 5 January last, the Minister said that he expected the free water allowance per adult to be agreed by the D&aacute;il to be 123 litres per day, or a little more.  I do not know how the Minister knows that, but we will leave that aside.  The document sent to us during the week for this meeting, the response to the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, contains a graph on page 10 regarding the consumption levels per number of leak and non-leak households per day.  If one takes a figure above the 123 litres - this ties in with metering and the costs relating to metering - and pitches it at 130 litres, for example, one will see from the graph that a majority of one-person households would still pay a charge, a little more or a little less than 50% of the two-person households would pay the charge and there would be a lesser number for the three, four and five-person households.  On the issue of costs, it appears from those figures that it is really only viable to roll out the metering programme in its entirety if Irish Water opts for something like that.  The proposal of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, would mean that somewhere north of half a million households in the country would continue to pay the water charge.  Will the witness comment on that as it relates to meters and the operating costs of the meters?  Does the witness agree that, on the basis of 123 litres per person per day, a relatively large percentage of the population would continue to be asked to pay water charges and will he give an estimate of the number of households that might be?  Am I correct that it would be more than half a million households on the basis of the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Coveney?</p></speech>

We will only install meters if it is the policy and we are directed to do so.  Obviously, one must meter every household if one wishes to find leaks or flows above a certain level.  That is the only way to do it.  Our meters show, for example, that there are night-time flows in 7% of houses.  Regarding the 123 litres, that is the average <i>per capita</i>consumption.  It is right in the middle of consumption levels.  As to who would pay, that is purely a matter of policy.</p></speech>

If we were to opt for 123 litres per person per day or even a little higher at 125 litres or 130 litres, and this relates to metering and operating costs, looking at that graph, am I correct that on the basis of such a policy a large minority of households would still pay some direct charge and that it might amount to approximately half a million households?

I am seeking clarification.  Mr. Marley spoke about assets in his presentation so perhaps he will respond.  With regard to borrowing, is that borrowing against the assets?  Given that the assets are not protected at all in the Acts in respect of being borrowed against, unlike the capital shares, does that effectively mean there is potential for those assets to be stripped, which would be de facto privatisation?  Has the borrowing to date been against the assets or will it be into the future?  Could he explain that further?</p></speech>

People lend to a utility on the basis of the certainty of the revenue of the company.  People lend to us because they can see the five-year regulatory price control and know there is a relative certainty on the revenue and they know the company will be able to pay back the money.  The loan is not made on the basis of the assets.</p></speech>

As expected, saving have been made in procurement because now one has one utility procuring versus 34 previously, and in the region of &euro;34 million has been saved.  Other savings one would expect to see is in the cost of labour and savings of &euro;21 million have been made.  In regard to the roll-out of minor capital works, one would see the benefit of a greater level of national co-ordination and there was a saving of &euro;5 million.  There have been process improvements, as well as efficiencies in energy and chemical usage.  We can see savings in the areas in which we would expect to see them because one is moving from the provision of services across 34 local authorities doing different things to different standards <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>it being controlled by a single utility.  What we do not have is the cost of what was delivered by the local authorities.</p></speech>

I am not sure why neither body dealing with it has not provided them.  I appreciate the Chair's offer to try and get those figures.</p> <p>  On the same topic, I ask Irish Water to elaborate.  Mr. McNicholas spoke about the set-up cost of Irish Water.  As practising politicians, we deal all day, every day with myth versus reality.  Commentators, including elements of the media and all sorts of politicians, are good at hyping myth, getting the public's anger up and so on, and there is a general perception abroad with a certain cohort, certainly egged on by an enthusiastic media in many quarters, that Irish Water is an expensive waste of time and money.  I ask Mr. McNicholas to elaborate on the &euro;173 million in set-up costs, particularly the &euro;60 million on consultants that caused all the furore back in the day with Mr. Grant's predecessor, Mr. Tierney.  Perhaps Mr. McNicholas would lay out the cold facts.  He stated that it cost &euro;100 million less than any other utility of its type to set up.  I refer to the savings at the time.  Perhaps Mr. McNicholas would provide clarity on that and some media might portray that side of it as well in the interest of balance.</p></speech>

Deputy Daly is correct.  There is a view that &euro;70 million was spent setting up Irish Water.  That is not correct.  We invested &euro;70 million in building these eight utility systems that have delivered the efficiency, the service and the capital projects.  The &euro;70 million was spent on international experts, software engineers, hardware engineers and systems integrators, as in every other utility, to build those eight utility systems.  The &euro;173 million was the total cost of everything, from the design of the organisation, the set-up of the organisation, the definition of the processes, the creation of the organisation to putting these eight systems in place in order that a modern utility could be run and could take responsibility for everything that is happening nationally.  No other utility has done anything of that scale for the same cost.</p> <p>  The &euro;173 million benchmarked is &euro;100 million less.  For example, Thames Water in the UK took one of those systems and spent &pound;150 million on it.  From my own 35 years experience in utilities, I know one cannot deliver that level of software, that level of systems and that level of process without significant capital investment.  The &euro;70 million on those experts - they were international experts who do it for every utility - was necessary and, ultimately, was really efficient and delivered at the end of the day a national utility with the systems and processes which comprise a national asset.  The committee has heard the regulator, not us, set out the efficiencies and the level of work we are doing to repair that infrastructure.  We did not waste &euro;60 million on consultants.  We invested &euro;70 million with systems experts and software engineers and hardware engineers.  We delivered a utility, we delivered the systems and the processes in 18 months for at least &euro;100 million less than any other utility could do it and we did it because another Irish utility, Bord G&aacute;is, had that experience and capability.  An Irish company built a new Irish company faster and better than anyone would do it internationally.  I am stopping at that.</p></speech>

Mr. Grant spoke about the short term, the medium term and the long term and what was required for long-term investment.  Deputy Cowen asked whether this &euro;13.5 billion was a draft figure and Mr. Grant replied that it was a fair estimate.  I ask Ervia to expand a little on that.  Is this a gross figure excluding efficiencies?  What is the timeframe for the completion of the targets in this &euro;13.5 billion in long-term investment Ervia states is required?</p> <p>  Similarly, I address this to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Has CER reviewed the &euro;13.5 billion investment requirement outlined by Irish Water?  Will this &euro;13.5 billion be subject to the 20% cost-efficiency saving target?  Does CER believe that the recommendations of the expert commission to place the Government as the primary customer of Irish Water will harm the efficiency drive of Irish Water?</p></speech>

In the next five years, we will basically be involved in upgrading water and wastewater treatment plants to meet the compliance targets for safe drinking water, as well as meeting basic requirements for treating wastewater to the required standards.  We will be dealing with leakage and will be meeting growth requirements.  We will do practically nothing in those five years to deal with some of the old culverts which are under Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, and which are leaking salt water and freshwater.  We are pumping that to treatment plants and it is making matters both difficult and expensive .  Very little of the work will get done, but we are spending money on investigating the position so that we can quantify the priorities and define where they will be.</p> <p>  In the second period from 2022 to 2025 or 2026, we are suggesting that a major new water source for Dublin will be required.  We are also suggesting that a major new north Dublin drainage scheme will be required because we will have reached the limit of what the arterial system serving Ringsend can now deliver.  These are the kind of examples about which we are talking.</p> <p>  The sum of &euro;13.5 billion was based on using a standard pricing tool against all the upgrades that we can now identify as being needed across the country's entire asset base.  The sum of &euro;5.5 billion is set out between now and 2021.  We will give that to the regulator in tranches of expenditure or periods that the regulator will examine.  For example, we have a two-year period from 2017 to 2018 that the regulator has looked at in detail.  The following period will hopefully be for five years.  We will submit that five-year period for detailed scrutiny, including the projects we have prioritised, and so on for the succeeding periods.  In its own time, each period will be sent forward as part of a prioritised package to be scrutinised in detail.  The &euro;13.5 billion is our current view looking at the entire landscape of things we need to do, including, for example, the old Victorian sewers and water mains that need to be replaced.  All of those projects are aimed at getting leakage down to at least 25% and arguably as close to 20% as we can get.  That means getting rid of cast iron and asbestos cement.  It basically means getting our assets up to the level where instead of an average age of 70 or 80 years, we get it down to 25 or 30 years.</p></speech>

However, part of the two-year capital investment that we have just signed off was on the basis of a five-year capital investment programme they submitted to us.  We needed to look at projects that were already in flight and those just beginning, so we had to look at a longer period.</p> <p>  The 20% Opex efficiency that was referred to is an efficiency in the four years 2015 to 2018.  We looked at separate Capex efficiencies.  For example, in the decision we issued on Irish Water's capital investment programme for the next two years, we included a 10.2% overall efficiency on their capital programme.  Effectively that means we expect them to deliver the same amount of capital investments at 10% less.  These efficiencies then become available to plough into other capital projects.</p> <p>  As regards the efficiency drive, there are fully-metered and non-metered models throughout the world where utilities have been challenged with delivering efficiencies.  We still expect Irish Water to deliver substantial efficiencies.  It is our task to challenge them to deliver those efficiencies.  It will, however, be a challenge to also examine the whole area of conservation at household level.  That is why in a separate session we put forward some ideas as to how conservation measures might be brought in under various areas, such as building regulations or other avenues, to continue the conservation element at household level.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Mr. McNicholas efficiently covered the question of the &euro;100 million savings benchmark.  Some of my questions relate specifically to the contractual position that has been reported in the media on metering, which I am not entirely sure is the case.  Perhaps Mr. McNicholas can clarify that.</p> <p>  Irish Water entered into a contractual position to install 1 million meters, is that correct?</p></speech>

Some 884,000 meters have been installed so, give or take, 116,000 meters have yet to be installed.</p><p>I understand that the total cost of installation is &euro;465 million, which, I appreciate, based on a wholly inappropriate average, works out at &euro;526 per meter.  The installation of the remaining 332,000 meters would - on the basis that meters cannot be installed in 20% of premises - bring us to 80%.  What is estimated installation cost in respect of those 80% of domestic households?  Will our guests indicate the estimated cost of installing each meter in order that the committee might come up with a figure in respect of both economies and an on-demand meter installation programme?</p></speech>

We have completed that programme, with 870,000 meters installed.  The remaining 200,000 plus installations are technically complex and, therefore, we do not believe we will install them in this phase.  As I said, the phase 1 metering programme is complete.  We have no contractual or material obligations to any contractor or any cost associated with anything beyond that.  No contract was given for any committed amount of work.  Contractors were paid only for work done.  We had no obligation to give them work and, therefore, we have no wind-up costs associated with regard to phase 1 metering.  My colleague, Mr. Grant, will respond to the Deputy's question on the cost of each meter installed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017011200002#EE00300"><p>In terms of what we have delivered, the cost of each of the 884,000 meters installed was &euro;526.  The budget was &euro;584 per unit and so the final cost was efficient.  It is important to point out that this large programme of work was possible because we were able to identify the number of properties to which it was possible to make a single connection.  The difficulty from here on in is that there are all kinds of complications in terms of backyard services, shared services, old buildings and so on.  If, therefore, an attempt was made to force the pace on metering in the future, it could be inefficient and expensive.  It would make more sense to have meters installed as the network is developed.  For example, we will be replacing a lot of pipes as part of the leakage programme over the next ten or 15 years and, therefore, it would be much more economical to install meters as part of that programme of work.  New developments should always have the capacity for metering.  The meter is very cheap once the right box is installed.  Approximately 11% of properties are apartments in shared buildings and these can never have individual meters but they can have bulk meters.  There are different approaches that could be taken.  It would be a much more sophisticated, longer-term and better-managed process to extend metering beyond where we are now.</p></speech>

There may be some properties in respect of which meters could be installed easily enough, technically speaking.  Many were passed over because the stopcock could not be found or because it was not possible to prove a connection to a household, all of which costs money.  The Deputy is correct that, in general, future metering, except in situations of redevelopment of the network, will cost more proportionately.</p></speech>

That said, we are a multi-utility and we also install gas meters.  We are doing a lot of work.  As stated by Mr. Grant, we would look at doing the work as efficiently as possible.  For example, if we have a crew on site carrying out other work we would have the benefit of that crew but no cost in that regard in terms of getting water meters installed.  If a policy decision is made to have more meters installed, we will deliver them in the most efficient way possible.</p></speech>

The delegates should correct me if I am wrong.  The pipe is more than 100 years old and could collapse at any moment.  The total capital cost, the potential impact on more than 300,000 customers in Dublin city and the constant deferral of repair plans, heretofore by Dublin City Council and more recently to a certain degree by Irish Water, must be considered.  Is there a fear or concern within Irish Water that as a result of deferral or having to bear the capital cost of such a huge job, it will continue to be pushed back until such time as a specific grant is given by the Government for one specific project in the absence of domestic water charges and an additional revenue stream for Irish Water?</p></speech>

I refer back to the question asked by Deputy Jim Daly.  I gather from the responses that neither Irish Water nor the Commission for Energy Regulation can state whether a single utility is providing the service at a lower cost than the 34 local authorities.  All they can actually state is that Irish Water has reduced its costs by 14% since 2014.  Is that a fair reflection of the answers to the question?</p></speech>

What we cannot show is the quantum.  We have looked at the benchmark heading into 2014 based on costs in 2013 and know that we are delivering it at a lower cost.  We are not claiming that we are delivering it at anything less than the number the regulator is validating - the saving of &euro;70 million to date.  It is on a like-for-like basis for the 34 local authorities at the end of 2013 and based on Irish Water working with the local authorities at the end of 2016.  We have made a saving of &euro;70 million in procurement in terms of how we organise the work and overall headcount reductions.</p></speech>

Planning permission had been received and we proceeded to contract.  We modified many more, including, for example, the Waterford plants, and they have been completed.  I cannot give the exact number, but it is increasing all the time.  It was a continual programme.  We continued with the projects that had been committed to and contracted.

Regardless of whether some of those projects made sense, at least they were delivering improved services.  The first thing we did was to maintain continuity of service.  Nobody experienced any diminution in service during the transfer of services from 34 local authorities to a single utility on the operational side, and the front-line services.  This is a credit to the local authority staff.  We took hold of the capital works and rationalised them.  It would have made no sense, however, and it would be scandalous for us to have stopped and thrown out work that was done.  We have added significant new projects also.  We do not know the mix of them but there were some in flight and some were at the early design stage.  We took that over and added to that.  This is the total commutative outcome to the end of 2016.</p></speech>

My other question relates to costs.  The expert group recommendation is that we do not bill households for individual bill charges.  In order to feed into the committee's work, will the witnesses give a breakdown of the cost of the billing cycle, the reading of meters, sending out the bills, the revenue collection process, and the costs of the tender for selecting the debt collection agency? We also need the costs for operating the call centre.  We need a breakdown of those figures because it would have an impact on the ongoing savings that could be achieved from cancelling the project.  Do the Irish Water representatives have those figures to hand or can they provide them to us?</p></speech>

The final question - I believe I am still just about within time - relates to the metering programme and the efficiency of the expenditure on the metering programme.  According to Irish Water's own figures, the first-fix scheme has saved 17 million litres of water at a cost of &euro;465 million by means of the installation of the meters to detect the 1% of unaccounted for water in total in the system.  Does that represent efficiency and value for money?</p></speech>

My first question has largely been answered through responses to queries by Deputy Butler so I will not go into detail on the matter to which it relates.  That matter involves the healthy tension between the CER, as the regulator, and Irish Water - Ervia - as the deliverer of services.  I note the difference in the presentations between Irish Water's plan up to 2021 and beyond and the CER's covering the two years 2017-2018.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the balance of public interest in getting value for money and efficiencies and in the delivery of clean water and waste services.</p> <p>  My other two questions relate to borrowings.  The witnesses gave the figures for borrowings and the various timeframes involved.  The Irish Water submission to the committee - in response to questions put to the company - says that a commitment to retain the company in public ownership would, in general, be regarded favourably by external financiers.</p><p>We did not deal with public ownership today but this is an issue to do with funding so I ask again whether Irish Water and particularly Ervia, because of its experience with gas, could confirm that a commitment for long-term public ownership can be a positive in terms of external borrowings.</p><p> The Chairman pulled up other speakers on the issue of metering-----</p></speech>

Other speakers managed to do that as well.  Dr. McGowan said that metering is a regulatory matter but I presume the reason he is suggesting that it be parked is partly because of the deliberations of this committee and the questions we have to answer.  He also said he does not have a position or an answer as to how excessive use would be measured.  I know that is a topic for a future meeting but we should put both bodies on notice that for this committee to make any decisions on the question of whether metering is an appropriate way to measure excessive use, we would need some information before that particular session from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, in terms of its role with regard to regulation and from Irish Water.  In this document it supplied to us it suggests that from the metering it has done it has a good deal of information on what should be a generous and appropriate free allowance to householders above which excessive use would be charged, if we so decide.  Can the witnesses confirm that they would be able to give us that information?  It is suggested in this document that it be given to the CER but that information would be useful for this committee.  We will hear from representatives of other bodies such as Scottish Water etc., who presumably will be able to give us that kind of information but it is important.  We are talking about capital but in terms of our future decisions and while we have the witnesses here, I do not want to be told at the next meeting that they still do not have any information on that area.  I want to put that on the record and ask them to comment on whether they would be able to give us what would be useful data on dealing with a fair and generous household allowance, which everybody agrees with, and how it deals with excess-----</p></speech>

We do not decide the policy.  The data will be available.  It is important to say, in terms of the 42% of people who are not metered, that if they do not have a meter there is no way practically to determine excessive usage.  One has to have a default position on that.  Over time, we may find somebody by the normal purposes of operational control but we will not be able to determine the user's usage unless they have a meter.</p></speech>

Irish Water put a submission to us in terms of the money it needed for 2017-2018.  That is what we recently made a determination on.  In that, there is only &euro;2 million available that Irish Water has sought with regard to meters.  One of the key points we were making is that if more money was to be made available to roll out further phases of metering, particularly in the time period we have just reviewed, that money would either have to come from somewhere else or something else that was a priority would no longer be able to be done.  There is only &euro;2 million there at present.</p></speech>

I am reinforcing the point Irish Water made, namely, that it was set up essentially as a business to install water meters that would charge for water.  There was no conservation element to it.  I will come to the funding element.</p></speech>

Irish Water was not set up as a metering business, it was established as a utility to address the infrastructural deficits that exist.  Its primary responsibility was to fix the problem with water and wastewater.  One element of that was to install water meters but its primary responsibility is to do as Mr. Grant has outlined, that is, to get at the state of the infrastructure, put plans in place and deliver the infrastructure.</p><p> Separately, the question is whether meters installed incentivise conservation.  All of the evidence will determine that if a person is charged for a service and knows how much he or she is using because it can be measured, it incentivises conservation.  The key issue with conservation and meters is that if there is no direct charge for the service, it is more difficult to see how it can be conserved.  Metering drives conservation for two reasons, namely, people have information about their usage and if they are paying for a service, they know they can make savings.  There is a direct and simple correlation between a meter, a charge and conservation.</p></speech>

I would like to contradict the answer I received because there is a substantial body of evidence that contradicts Mr. McNicholas's view.  There is no suggestion that a gas meter promotes conservation of gas and there is no evidence that an electricity meter promotes the conservation of electricity.  On the contrary, if Irish Water considers its brother and sister companies, for example, the ESB, it will find that it is alternative and additional conservation measures, whether solar energy or energy-saving appliances, that help consumers to conserve energy, not meters.  This is one of the opportunities Irish Water missed in terms of introducing smart metering to allow people to see how much water they are consuming.  The only way a household can determine how much water it is using with the metering system installed by Irish Water is by reading their water bill or lifting up the lid of the meter and reading it.  There is no other way of knowing what is the water consumption of household appliances.  Irish Water missed a golden opportunity to implement a seriously smart metering project.</p> <p>  I have two questions on commercial water rates. </p></speech>

The submission further states that if leaks are excluded, the figure falls to 1.27% of households.  It further states that other factors might reduce the figure further, for instance, age and health.  It is further stated that the excessive use charge will not generate significant income.  I ask Irish Water and the regulator how it can be cost-effective to implement an excessive use charge on the basis of such very limited excessive usage.  Surely, it cannot be cost-effective.  The regulator has stated that Irish Water should not proceed with metering, that it should stop it or park it or whatever but not go ahead with it in any case.  I think it was suggested that if metering were to continue, it would make less money available for other water and wastewater related services.

The commission proposed that water be funded through general taxation and that each household be given an average allowance determined by the regulator.  Dr. McGowan has said the CER will consult the public before the allowance and the penalties for excessive usage are decided upon.  Does the CER have a timeframe for that public consultation?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that we would consider the level at which the allowance would be set and how it would fit within the context of the overall settlement.  This would be a significant project because it would involve a lot of public consultation through the gathering of views from the likes of the Public Water Forum and other users.</p></speech>

For example, a policy decision could be taken on what the allowance should be.  Then we would have to work with that.  Alternatively, we could be tasked with determining what the allowance should be.  We have said we could do that but, as I said, that is a significant piece of public consultation and would take between six and 12 months, approximately, depending on the complexity of the issue.</p></speech>

If we are to go with the commission's recommendation that consumers be charged for excessive use, as Irish Water has outlined, we will have no way of knowing how a household is performing.  I would hate to think of how this committee would manage if 58% of households in the country did not have a meter because we would have no statistics showing how we could improve.  It costs &euro;1 or thereabouts to treat a litre of water.  We are talking about treated water; the water that falls out of the sky is not free.  It is an important point on which to finish.</p></speech>

Both he and his colleagues will respond to questions.</p><p>I remind members, guests and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones, iPhones and BlackBerrys are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even when left in silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  I also ask them to refrain from switching phones on and off as that can also interfere with the sound equipment for several minutes at a time.</p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome our guests and ask Mr. Fearon to make his opening address.</p></speech>

I apologise that one of our members, Mr. Damian McGinty, the author of our statement, could not make it.  I am spokesperson for the group.  I live, work and have my business approximately two miles from the Border.  I have been there for about 40 years.  I am accompanied by Mr. Bernard Boyle who runs an accountancy business in the village of Forkhill near the Border in south Armagh and Mr. John Sheridan who comes from a farming background.  He is a farmer in south-west Fermanagh.</p> <p>  Border Communities Against Brexit came about because of the real concern that the voices of people living in the Border region were not being listened to when it came to the implications of Brexit.  Ours is a broad, cross-community and a non-party political group.  We invite everybody who shares our concerns to join us in building an effective campaign.  We have come together to ensure the North's democratically expressed wish, expressed by 56% of its people, to remain within the European Union is respected.  We wish to ensure the views of local communities will be heard when the big decisions affecting their future are taken in London, Dublin and Brussels.  The prospect of a new European frontier stretching from Dundalk to Derry, some 300 miles, is not acceptable to those of us living and working in Border areas, North and South.</p> <p>  Our day of action in October was a huge success.  There was a huge groundswell of public support, with thousands attending our co-ordinated rallies.  It also demonstrated to everybody how unworkable a hard border would be.  We met Ministers at the North-South Ministerial Council and attended the all-island civic dialogue in Kilmainham.  We take the opportunity to thank all of the political parties we have met and the Office of the Taoiseach for their support so far.  We are due to meet the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Lord Dunlop.</p><p>We intend to travel to Europe to meet EU decision makers to make them fully aware of the implications of Brexit for the North, especially for the Border communities.<br/><br/>If Brexit proceeds under the current constitutional arrangements, the Border dividing Ireland will become an external border of the EU, possibly classified by the Union as a third country.  There is no reassurance for us in hearing both the British and Irish Governments state publicly that they do not wish to see the reintroduction of Border controls and customs posts and the closure of hundreds of Border roads.  This may not be up to them alone to determine.  Like me, many committee members will probably recall what it was like when there were customs post here.  We remember the time of lengthy delays and traffic backlogs crossing the Border.  Every other external border of the EU has physical and economic controls.  Why should we believe that the Border dividing Ireland would be any different?<br/><br/>The current arrangements for Europe managing its external eastern border are the responsibility of Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency.  Frontex supports, co-ordinates and develops European border management in line with EU treaties, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as other international obligations.<b></b>Frontex seeks to ensure the co-ordination of the actions of the member states in the implementation of measures, thereby contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and of surveillance of the external borders of the member states.  Frontex is responsible for the implementation of the hard border that exists on the EU's eastern front.  All small roads are closed and people are forced through large designated checkpoints.  In Ireland, there are approximately 270 roads that traverse the Border and in the past, approximately 17 of those were designated as official Border crossings.  In Slovakia, there are three crossings at Ubla, Vy&scaron;n&eacute; Nemeck&eacute; and Z&aacute;hony.  These are large-scale crossing with six to eight lanes where passports, visas, vehicles and their contents are checked.  Currently, if one lives more than 50 miles from the European border, one must apply a week in advance to gain entry.  Anyone living within 50 miles can apply for a yearly pass.<br/><br/><b></b>Frontex states that migration is the main issue but it also deals with matters such as the smuggling of excise goods, stolen vehicles and human trafficking.  Unfortunately, we know too well of the damaging effect of smuggling and the rise of criminality in our Border areas.  Add to that the fact that Britain could have different tariffs on excise goods such as cigarettes and fuel, as well as the forced closure of hundreds of Border roads, and one can foresee a huge rise in resentment caused by a new physical frontier.  Apart from the very damaging economic effects on business, a hard Border would also be a disaster for the 30,000 workers who cross the Border daily, the tens of thousands who visit family and friends as well as the tens of thousands who travel for sporting fixtures and holidays, both North and South, on a regular basis.<br/><br/>At a broader political level, a hard Border is potentially much more disastrous.  The EU's financial assistance to thousands of community groups involved in peace building and its fantastic support in developing the economy through infrastructural developments such as motorways, train links and telecommunications and supporting businesses to set up and create jobs, has utterly transformed the North of this island in the past 25 years.  No one has been left out or excluded.  The total financial assistance from the EU co-funded programmes in the North from 2014 to 2020 is &euro;3.5 billion, while in the period from 2007 to 2013 the total was &euro;3.4 billion.  The &pound;2.3 billion of EU financial support to the rural community and farmers in the North of Ireland from 2014 to 2020 is another example of the enormity of the EU's assistance to the North.<br/><br/>The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner with more than &euro;1.2 billion of goods and services, directly supporting 400,000 jobs on both islands and even more among suppliers and surrounding communities, traded between us every week.  The Good Friday Agreement has given all an equal identity whether one wishes to belong to the Unionist tradition or the Irish one.  The safeguards in the EU Charter of Human Rights are enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement.  We are greatly concerned about the effect of a hard Border on the impression of Irish identity in the North and particularly in the Border areas.  Currently, it is very difficult to find the actual Border, with free travel and free movement of goods and services.  People can just freely go where they want, whenever they want but that could be taken away.</p><p>It is also very important that no border exists for those who see themselves as living in Ireland.  When we consider that 56% of voters in the North voted to remain in the European Union, the North&rsquo;s population is being dragged out of the EU against our will and the opinion of 441,000 people who voted to remain is not being respected.  We are being totally disenfranchised.</p><p> It could be argued that many will view Brexit as a re-partition of Ireland, with hard physical infrastructure.  There is at least one generation of people who do not remember the Troubles and at least two generations who do not remember a physical Border.  The potential exists for creating a divided Ireland, which will give way to alienation among Border communities and the growth of resentment and frustration as they perceive that their Irishness has been greatly diminished or taken away.  The committee will no doubt need to examine the effects we have outlined, as well as the many EU safeguards built into legalisation and the removal of the safeguards enshrined in the EU charter of human rights within the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>  We ask the committee to examine in detail the framework within which Frontex operates and the current arrangements on the European Union's eastern border.  It should also consider sending a fact-finding delegation to visit that border.  Will the committee undertake to find out how the Irish Government will get involved in the Brexit negotiations to ensure Ireland is allowed to trade and operate as it does currently?  Does it believe the Irish Government has sufficient resources and infrastructure in Europe to deal with Brexit?  Does it know if the Government has talked to its European colleagues to inform them of our unique position and gain support for it?</p><p> We need European prime ministers, governments and Commissioners to hear a very clear and strong message on the necessity for the North to stay within the European Union.  Does the committee know if the Irish Government has dawn up a framework in order that this can occur.  The Government is pivotal in articulating the rights and needs of Border communities and the North's population?</p><p> However, possibly the biggest question for this committee is what will be the effects of restricting the movement of people, damaging an entire community economically and disenfranchising it politically?  People will feel resentment and alienation as their hard won rights and safeguards are stripped away.  This will create an incentive to smuggle and enter criminality when we already have, on the fringes, groups which are ready and willing to use people&rsquo;s emotions and difficult economic conditions to create division and seek a return to our past.  </p></speech>

I invite Mr. Mickey Brady, MP, to commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mickey Brady" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#L00300"><p>I thank Mr. Fearon, Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Kelly for their presentation.  As someone who represents a Border constituency, Brexit is a major issue.  One of the issues discussed is the common travel area.  As I have stated at previous meetings, this appears to be a red herring because it will not directly impact on people who live in Border areas, for example, someone who lives in Newry and travels to Dundalk to work.  The impact will be on business, commerce and agriculture.</p> <p>  In my constituency of Newry-Armagh, approximately &pound;200 million was invested in rural development between 2007 and 2014.  A brand new, state-of-the-art centre was built in Cullaville with local council and European money.  For every &pound;100 received by small farmers in the constituency, approximately &pound;87 is European money.  I note in this regard that Mr. Kelly comes from a farming background.  Is there a belief among farmers that the British Government will replace this money?  If Brexit will have any financial benefits for Britain, they will be felt in the south-east of England.  Newry-Armagh and Fermanagh-South Tyrone will certainly not benefit.  This is a real danger.  People in my constituency, especially farmers, are asking who will replace European Union money.  Farmers are having a difficult enough time as matters stand.</p> <p>  My constituency has very strong community infrastructure.</p><p>That is directly under threat because a lot of the money comes from European Union funding, etc., with the Peace I, II and III and INTERREG.  What happens all of that?  Have the witnesses any particular thoughts or comments on that?  We could go on all day about the adverse effects of Brexit. There may be some positive results but they are not obvious or evident at this point in time.  If one listened on Sunday to Prime Minister Theresa May in her first interview about this, the British have no plan A, B or C.  They are totally at sea as to how Brexit may or may not be implemented, even in terms of a timescale.  It seems to be very much up in the air.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sheridan" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#M00200"><p>The farming community where I come from, and in the region, would have no belief in it at all.  Before the referendum was held we were told that those moneys would maybe even be enhanced over and above what we already get in direct payments and through rural development.  That has not happened and now, after the referendum, the rhetoric is that the guarantee by the British Government will be until 2020.  We know that the EU is paying until 2019 so, in other words, that guarantee lasts for only one year and even that guarantee is suspect about the rural development end of it.</p> <p>  What is worse is that it is already happening in the North currently and we are seeing the erosion of EU moneys to farmers.  I speak in particular about the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme which has had a business case for the last 40 years through what we remember as the old hill cow and sheep subsidies.  That changed into the less favoured areas compensatory allowance, LFACA and then to the ANC scheme which gave some &pound;25 million per year.  Last year the disadvantaged area scheme was taken out of that and it ended up with an area of around 380,000 hectares, claimed by some 15,000 claimants for &pound;20 million.  This year in spring, around March, will see the end of ANC and in 2018 a payment of 40% of that will be paid.  That is it.  That scheme will be over.</p> <p>  The environmental schemes, which have not been paid, are all off now.  At one time 50% of the land area in the North was under the environmental scheme with up to &pound;48 million in funds going in to it.  In recent years that would surely have averaged around &pound;30 million or &pound;35 million.  That is not available now.  There is new scheme to be announced in February but for part of it - for the larger and wider groupings who will apply - even though one can apply in February, the contracts will not be signed until January 2018 and then a full year will need to pass before a farmer can even apply for payment.  We are going to be at least into mid-2019 before any environmental payments come in.  Those environmental payments were specifically in Natura 2000 sites - designated areas such as areas of special scientific interest, ASSIs and special areas of conservation, SACs.  That rural development money was there as compensation for what a farmer had to do to stand his or her land up to environmental farming standards, and now it is not there.  Those standards are EU designations and some of them are local government or Westminster Government designations.</p> <p>  Some &pound;50 million is currently being taken out from the disadvantaged areas of the North.  I can provide details on the figures involved.  Let alone Westminster, it is also happening in Stormont at the present time.  Many of these areas are on the hinterlands of Border areas in more remote and extensive farming areas.  It is terrible and it is not only happening in this community.  At the Oxford farming conference, Andrea Leadsom, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said she was going to have a bonfire of red-tape.  The farmers attending in the audience were asked if they believed it.  Almost nobody put up their hands, or 99%.  No-one believed it.  We all know that the EU legislation is going to be cut and pasted.  Clearly no-one believes it here either.</p></speech>

I think we all agree with the case Border Communities against Brexit has outlined.  It is very clear that the North wants to stay in the European Union and for many of us that would be our choice.  If, however, we are dragged out of it, what is the thrust of the delegation's argument?  Does it feel we should re-run the referendum or should we be resisting the Brexit process?  I see this being dragged out for a long time.  Does the group feel we should fight or how much value does it see in fighting to minimise the withdrawal process?</p></speech>

For people who live further south or north, it is not an overly big deal but for those who live in the Border corridor, and I am sure there are many here today who do, there are huge implications.  Linked to that is the massive change there has been in those areas since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a different place and we want that to continue.  I am not so sure that people, and the decision makers in Europe, are as aware of that as they should be and especially after the events of recent days, it will be largely down to the Irish Government to make this point in Europe.  I know it is a member of the 27 but it is very important that it get across the views of the people who live there and what it will mean to them and the fact that what is happening in Stormont at the moment is not going to help any of our people get these points across.  I do not think they will be strongly made in Westminster.  It is up to the Irish Government and the members of this committee to bring that to the decision makers in the Government and say this is what can happen.</p> <p>  At the Kilmainham event I explained to someone how bad this can get.  Commissioner Hogan last week presented what is probably the default position, that the roads are closed again.  I think back to a Saturday morning 35 years ago when they started to blow up the road alongside our house.  That went on all day until there were 22 craters in it.  That road was closed for over 30 years or more.  In many cases our hinterland is defined by the parish.  Of the parish I come from, Dromintee in South Armagh, 80% is in the North and 20% is in the South.  I can well remember people coming to mass in the local chapel having to park their cars on the other side and walk or climb across the barriers to walk 500 yards to mass and cross again.  Are we going back to that?  Nobody has convinced us that we are not.  The more I hear about a hard Border, especially now that Commissioner Hogan has said it, I wonder if that is the legacy we will leave our grandchildren.  We have to stop this.  I listened to Vince Cable yesterday talking about an all-Ireland economy.  We have to push this argument because the alternative is unthinkable.</p></speech>

I am as enthusiastic as Mr. Fearon about opposing Brexit and undoing as best we can the damage it will do to Border communities, but the dilemma is that we must have a practical proposal they can work on.  In the fluidity and vagueness that exists, unless there is a clear cut proposal, we cannot challenge or question it.</p><p>The British situation at the moment is bedlam and confusion.  While everybody is saying they do not want a hard Border, the common-sense consensus is that free movement of people cannot be controlled without some sort of controls, and controls mean some sort of hardness in the Border.  The same applies to customs, the Single Market and so on.  If Mr. Fearon or I were sitting in Commissioner Hogan's office, what suggestions would Mr. Fearon like us to put forward?  I do not come here as a Member of the D&aacute;il.  I come here from the North.  What suggestions does he think we should put forward to alleviate-----</p></speech>

That is the point from which we all must start.  The reason we are highlighting the point of how difficult any other solution would be is to make people realise that this is the only solution.  It is the starting point at which we all must arrive.  As I said, I listened to Vince Cable on the radio yesterday morning, and he was more or less saying verbatim some of what we have been saying here and giving the reasoning behind it.  We must get to the point at which people agree that this is the only solution.  Any other attempt to create a hard Border, with all the consequences we have outlined, would be disastrous.  Getting the European Union decision-makers to sit up and understand this is the first step.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for what Dr. McDonnell has outlined is, first, that because of the Troubles of the past, Border people are inclined to keep their heads down and mind their own business.

There is no doubt but that there is mental turmoil along the Border because a huge number of families are joined at the hip.  Whereas one area of the North may have been rather a cold place, there was a warmer reception in the hinterland along the Border where they lived and in the South, and many marriages and many farms are spread across both sides of the Border.  There is a voice there not being heard yet.  If Article 50 is ever triggered - its triggering in March is a rush job to bounce people into it - we will not lose that big voice in Westminster.  To look at the Westminster seats yesterday when James Brokenshire was announcing what was happening in Stormont, not very many people were there to listen.  They did not seem very-----</p></speech>

There is a responsibility through the committee.  Theresa May speaks as if she will be sitting around a table with 27 other member states when Article 50 is triggered.  Well, I am sorry, but my understanding of it is she will be either miles away or sitting in another room and whoever is chosen to be a spokesperson will come to and fro to her.  There is a huge weight on the Irish Government's shoulders and on the committee's shoulders.  Dr. McDonnell mentioned caution.  We are called remoaners.  To an extent, that is intimidation.  Surely to God, 56% of us are entitled to say what we feel.  It is a blank sheet.  It has not happened before.  Why can agriculture and other business not remain under the European domain?  I am just speaking for agriculture.  Everybody else can speak for themselves to an extent, but I do not see why there cannot be an island of Ireland economically and some political understanding on the rest.  That is not necessarily looking for a united Ireland but, by heavens, it is looking for common sense and trade within Europe as it is at the moment.  The consequences of reestablishing a hard Border and dividing Ireland once again will make a wasteland of the North, create a vacuum and suck in all sorts of bad issues we never want to see again.</p><p>We have had enough.</p></speech>

I assure him that I am listening to what he and his colleagues are saying.  The same issues are raised with me every day by people in my constituency and elsewhere.  Several members of this committee, including myself, attended the protest organised by Border Communities Against Brexit in early October.  Will the delegates comment on the proposal put forward recently through the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs that the key decision makers, who ultimately will decide the shape of Brexit, should be invited to the region to see at first hand the disastrous impact any type of Brexit, hard or soft, will have on the all-Ireland economy?  The Taoiseach gave a clear indication earlier this year that he would have the next meeting of the all-island civic dialogue forum in Newry, which would give people an opportunity to have further input.  We await the announcement in this regard with bated breath.  Will the witnesses comment on that proposal?  It is only when one gets down and dirty with this business that one can comprehend the impact on the all-island economy if things do not stay the same.</p><p>I have often observed at these meetings that for many years we, North and South, have turned our backs to each other.  It is interesting that Mr. Boyle is from almost a neighbouring parish to mine but we do not know each other.  I am old enough to remember the Border the delegates have described.  I have said on numerous occasions in this committee and in the D&aacute;il that many people seem to have forgotten that a hard Border existed for many years after our membership of the EU.  The cross-Border concession roads are still there and the witnesses may remember the blue and white signposts that indicated one was approaching an unapproved crossing.  There are 38 such crossings in Louth and nobody would wish to return to the situation we had before.  I am particularly taken by the references in the witnesses' submission to Frontex, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, and the point that there should be strong oversight of how any Border crossings are implemented.  Apparently, all the modern technology will make things run smoothly in a post-Brexit situation.  I am not confident that will be the case.</p><p>The big decisions on all of this will be made by the EU.  Do the witnesses agree that Britain, if it is intent on leaving the Union, should commit to providing the same level of funding for all the existing programmes and <i>pro rata</i>increases based on the cost of living?  That will be necessary to ensure the programmes can continue in the long term and the economy can continue to operate on an all-Ireland basis.</p></speech>

As Mr. Brady said, all the adverse consequences of Brexit have been well rehearsed.  Border Communities Against Brexit has a particular concern, namely, the impact on communities on both sides of the Border, from Derry around to Dundalk.  We have already experienced the negative effects of having a hard Border, a situation that persisted until what seems relatively recently in my lifetime.  We know all of the negative effects on our region of Britain's departure from the EU.  We know there many are connections along the Border corridor, on either side, including inter-family connections and inter-business connections.  All of those connections will be negatively affected by Brexit and by a hard Border.  The reason we are bringing our concerns to this committee is because it is charged with dealing with issues to do with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>It was set up to bring communities together and encourage them to work together.  The imposition of a hard border would be a direct contradiction because it would divide communities, families and social groups, north and south of the Border.  It would be divisive.  As to its effects, in the statement Mr. Fearon referred to the committee travelling on a fact-finding mission to eastern Europe.  Deputy Declan Breathnach spoke about visiting Border areas to obtain information.  A fact-finding mission was undertaken to the Estonian border and other eastern European borders to see how they affected business, trade and local communities and assess the negative social effects which could easily be transferred if there was to be a hard border here.  Currently, the Border is seamless and invisible.  A visit to Border areas at this time would be less effective than a visit by committee members to eastern Europea to see the effects felt there and projecting what would happen if there was to be a hard Border here.</p></speech>

I want to raise a few questions, one of which they partially answered concerning the situation in eastern Europe.  We have to face up to the possibility that there may be a hard Brexit.  We should not put our heads in the sand and say it will not happen, despite all of the efforts we intend to make.  Do the delegates see the rationale behind having a border such as the one they describe in their presentation - in Slovakia - as opposed to having every crossing open, given the economic effects, including smuggling, etc?  When I first read their presentation, I thought they were advocating having a Frontex-type border.  It was not until they developed the point that I understood what they had in mind.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the provision of EU funding for the agriculture sector.  I chair a British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly committee on the economic effects of Brexit.  When we were in Stormont last year, we met representatives of the farming organisations, among other groups.  I have to say that on that day there was no clarity or understanding of where the &euro;187 million required - the figure I have in my head - for single farm payments would come from post-Brexit and there was no concern among the representatives present that they would not receive it.  I am, however, hearing a completely different message from the delegates, one which resonates with me more in terms of what I believe will happen.  They might clarify the reason we are receiving one message from one representative group involved in the discussions and another from them.</p></speech>

What we are looking at in that regard on some eastern European borders is exactly what we do not want to see here.  To go back to Dr. McDonnell's point, the bottom line for our committee and anybody opposed to the imposition of a hard border is that the Border should no longer run along the 300 mile stretch from Derry to Dundalk.  People on all sides of the community have to face up to the fact that it would be impossible to reimpose such an arrangement.  It would have to be imposed at the ports and airports of Ireland.  The Border would have to be shifted in that way.  I know that would have political connotations and would frighten people in the Unionist community, but they would be interrupted in their day-to-day lives as badly as Nationalists.</p><p>It is not a green and orange issue up there.  That Border cannot be reimposed as a land border here in Ireland.  It will certainly have to be at the ports and the airports.  As I say, if we gave the impression that the type of border we want is what Frontex has imposed in other areas of Europe, certainly not, it is the opposite to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sheridan" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#R00200"><p>I reiterate what Mr. Fearon said here.  It would be more to highlight the futility of trying to have a hard border and advocating to those who say that one can have a border, that it can work electronically and that there are other border crossings through eastern Europe and its neighbours that work, that they do not and that it is not working, and that is more of a geographical split between two countries.  The Border in Ireland, as Mr. Bernard Boyle stated, is an invisible split in virtually every case.  We would be on the other end of it highlighting how ridiculous a hard border would be.  However, we are not unaware of the realities.  We ourselves feel that a hard border is coming and coming fast.</p> <p>  We were asked about agriculture.  It was remiss of me when I was speaking to the committee not to say that in agriculture, we would get 3% through the Barnett formula.  Over and above the Barnett formula, agriculture in the North of Ireland gets 10% because it was an intensive and hardworking sector.  Between 2000 to 2002, they created a large pool of funding which left a high payment to each farmer.  In fact, if we were to go by the Barnett formula, we would lose 7% of the funding coming in already.  That money coming in involves 1 million ha in the North getting &euro;329 per hectare.  Approximately &euro;330 million is what comes into the North.</p></speech>

It may have been contraried - in a meeting the committee had - between what comes in as direct payment under Pillar 1 and what comes in other payments under Pillar 2 with rural development payments.  That could be contraried there and I dare say that is what happened.</p> <p>  The committee must understand that the Ulster Farmers Union, with the greatest of respect to it, is not the only farming community lobby organisation in the North.  There is also the National Beef Association, the National Sheep Association, the severely disadvantaged areas, SDA, group and the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers Association, NIAPA.  There is a voice not being heard.  I said this in Monaghan as well and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, picked up on it and stated exactly what Senator Landy stated that such was not the voice that they were hearing.</p> <p>  In fairness to the UFU, I must say it makes its decisions through its executive and it has 14 or 16 committees which feed into it.  Whereas it is certainly seen to work in so far as it can across all religious persuasions and walks of life, it would be perhaps perceived to be pro-Unionist.  There is a caution - this caution in the North - that one is in one's lobby group, one does not want to fall out with the government of the day and one exercises extreme care.</p> <p>  Most significantly, to answer the question, the Ulster Farmers Union is a part of the NFU.  There is an NFU in England, Scotland and Wales and the UFU in Northern Ireland - four sister groups.  The NFU adopted a position against Brexit.  The UFU sat on the fence.  It did not lead and did not take a position one way or another.  It held one conference to which the previous president of the NFU, Sir Peter Kendall, was asked.</p><p>Sir Peter Kendall missed his flight to the North that night for the conference.  Owen Paterson did not miss his flight, however, and I dare say they were booked on the same flight.  Owen Paterson was completely in favour of Brexit and he was a former Minister of State for Northern Ireland.  He was also an agricultural spokesman for the Tory Party in Europe.  He stood up and guaranteed at least the same funding for agriculture as previous for the North and said it would perhaps be even more.  He said they would get rid of the rules and red tape.  He commented three or four times on the three-crop rule.  If one is in Europe and one is going through large fields, one can see some fields to the horizon and the tractors in them look like toys, so it is not too hard having a three-crop regulation there.  It does not work on small family farms in Ireland, however.  That is what the Ulster Farmers Union did for Brexit, so perhaps that goes some way to explain why a voice is not being heard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#S00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Fearon, Mr. Boyle and Mr. Sheridan.  During one of the first D&aacute;il debates we had after the UK referendum decision, I strongly advocated to the Taoiseach that we needed to hear the voice of civic society.  It is important that the debate would not be dominated solely by people in politics or public administration.  I welcome, therefore, the initiative taken by the Border Communities Against Brexit, BCAB, group.  I was one of those who participated in the day of action at Aghalane Bridge on the Cavan-Fermanagh border.  I represent Cavan-Monaghan in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I attended that rally along with elected Fianna F&aacute;il party colleagues from the area, including Senator Diarmuid Wilson, Councillor John Paul Feeley and Councillor Se&aacute;n Smith.  I have to say, however, that I was disappointed with the small turnout.  The public at large must be convinced of the import of this debate and the serious challenges facing the entire island.  The BCAB group's work in that regard is very important, as is our own.</p> <p>  Mr. Fearon mentioned that he has met the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Dunlop.  This implies that he is not meeting the Secretary of State, but I hope I am wrong in that.  It would be deplorable if he were not meeting the Secretary of State, given that the representative group covers a large geographical area.  I learned from his introduction that he represents different sectors in society also.  I gather from Mr. Sheridan that he is not a member of the Ulster Farmers Union.  I welcome his comments which are particularly important.  Mr. Sheridan said that the Border was invisible, while Mr. Fearon said it was difficult to find.  Thank God it is.  I grew up on the Border - Mr. Sheridan knows where I am from - with permanent vehicle checkpoints and all that type of thing.  As under-age GAA players, we were stopped from going to play matches in Fermanagh or wherever.  My own area runs all along the Cavan-Fermanagh part of the Border.  A stranger visiting the area would know they were in a different county only when they saw the GAA county colours in summertime during the championship.</p> <p>  It is important to put on record the fact that our island has been transformed since the Good Friday Agreement was signed originally and then endorsed by all the people on this island.  There has been major progress.  As an opposition Deputy, I would argue that, unfortunately, we have not maximised the potential of the agreement.  In fairness to successive administrations South and North, we have underestimated the huge progress in developing business and commerce on a cross-Border basis.  If restrictions on the movement of people, goods and services arise from Brexit, we will then see impediments in the way of further progress required on this island, as well as the jobs we need in Border communities.</p><p>With regard to agricultural payments, people are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think the Brits will make good the shortfall in the single farm payment or the rural development plans because they will not.  One can be certain of that.  As a person with experience at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council over a number of years, I know that successive Irish Governments always supported the Northern Ireland Ministers for Agriculture in what they were seeking in support of their farmers.  Successive British Ministers for agriculture, whether from the Labour or Tory tradition, were always against the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is the unfortunate reality.  The shortfall that will arise when Britain leaves the EU, which Northern farmers will lose, will not be made up by the British Government.  It is very good for the National Farmers Union in Britain with its hundreds and hundreds of acres per member.  It is a different community of farmers entirely from that in the small agricultural holdings in Fermanagh, Cavan, Armagh, Tyrone or Donegal.  That is the reality.  Our farmers need those compensatory payments.  Unfortunately, our farming organisations, North or South, never emphasise enough that the payments that come from Europe are compensatory payments because of the restrictions on production on farmers.  That message has never been got across adequately to the taxpayers at large with regard to the good food that is produced.  </p><p> We have multinational Irish companies today that started as small creameries or beef slaughtering plants which now have a huge presence on all of our island.  Lakeland Dairies, which started off in my native county of Cavan, was predominantly a Cavan-Monaghan north midlands enterprise and is a huge player now in Northern Ireland because it merged with another dairy business.  Similarly, the former Town of Monaghan Co-op is now LacPatrick.  Those dairy processors have sites both sides of the Border.  Raw material travels south and north to be processed, finalised and made into a food product.  I fear the difficulties that will arise as a result of different regulatory standards that may be in place with regard to the free movement of raw materials and finished product because whether there is a soft or hard Border, if there are impediments to trade there are costs.  Those costs will go back to the primary producer because our processors will be less competitive in trying to sell their final product.  I fear all of those particular aspects of Brexit.  It is alright for Mr. Paterson to talk about the change in the red tape and all of that but not all of the red tape is incorrect because our farmers work to very high standards.  That is why today I am speaking for our own State.  We can sell food and drink products to 161 countries throughout the world because those markets and those people with purchasing power for multiples know that our farmers and processors work to very high, demanding and exacting standards.  That is why we have a great footprint throughout the world, whether for products from Northern Ireland or Southern Ireland.  That is not to say that some of the bureaucracy could not be gotten rid of.  Many of the requirements and provisions that are in place are for the good of the consumer and the producer as well.  </p><p> I wish the witnesses well in their work.  As a representative of the two southern Ulster counties, I have to say there is huge work ahead of all of us to ensure that people on the ground know the huge challenges and obstacles that may be ahead of us as a result of Brexit. </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  I read their submission before they came and had an idea they were going to open up an entire can of worms.  They have thrown the elephant into the middle of the room.  Their presentation is about the relationship with the Twenty-six Counties in the South and the relationship with the UK.  That is really what it is about.  The Good Friday Agreement is a tripartite agreement.  There are three sides to that agreement - the UK, Ireland and Europe.  I agree with the witnesses' belief that there is only one solution here, which is an economic entity that is the island of Ireland.</p><p>I am not so sure I would go along with the notion of border controls at airports and things like that, which would be a very political issue.  As a civic society group, the Border Communities Against Brexit has really put it up to the entire European Community and to the UK today.  The group has now tested our relationship with the 26 because they have to understand the uniqueness of this island.  They have to understand what they are putting at risk.</p><p> The last two paragraphs of the group's presentation are stark and scary.  I also remember what it was like to arrive at the Border and the long delays.  I also saw the roads that were blasted to hell in order to stop people crossing them.  We cannot go back to that.  The day after the Brexit referendum was passed, I wrote an article about the re-imposition of a border and people told me I was mad.  However, 26 other partners are included with us.  Based on meetings I have attended in Bratislava and Brussels, I would say that a fair portion of them are not too sympathetic to the UK and its problems.  A lot of lip service is being paid to the unique problem of Ireland.  I am not so sure that anybody really understands what this will do this island and I am really concerned about that.</p><p> We have already discussed the money going to farmers in the North of Ireland.  I am interested in the movements of agricultural product across the Border.  I know it is 1 million gallons of milk a day.  I do not know how many tonnes of beef, lamb and bacon cross over and back, and the economic impact of that.  I know people move across the Border to work in all sorts of occupations.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, spoke about raw materials and finished product.  It is so ingrained that it is hard to find out.  On medevac, we now have two helicopter units in the North of Ireland.  Where will that sit in the new situation?  There is also the movement of students coming back and forth across the Border.</p><p> The bottom line is that the witnesses have told us today that our two economies are so interlinked and so constantly dependent on one another, there can be no divide.  There can be no border, soft, hard or anything else.  I feel afraid that they are talking about an "Irexit" where Ireland will have no choice, because of how closely interlinked the two economies are, but to follow the Brits.  That would really worry me.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  I thank them for their presentation.</p></speech>

I have met the representatives of five businesses in south-west Fermanagh: Tracey Concrete; Encirc, formerly Quinn Glass; Corry's, a large hardware distributor; McVitty's, a large haulage group; and Balcas, an Enniskillen timber company.  Apart from cattle and sheep that cross for processing, farmers travel from North to South and back all the time.  Farmers travel from the North, through the South, back into the North and back into the South.  A farmer living in Armagh who wants to visit a mart in the west will travel through Monaghan, into south-west Fermanagh, cross over at Blacklion and go down to Manorhamilton or Dowra.  It is ridiculous stuff, but that is what happens, which is good and indicates a thriving economy.</p> <p>  I am a member of the UFU.</p></speech>

I am also a member of every other farming organisation that I mentioned, including a new Southern organisation, the INHFA, because I have a passion for hill farming and less favoured areas.</p><p>The committee members referred to people and produce.  If they send us the questions, we will answer them all.  Succinctly, some 350,000 sheep a year, that is, almost 1,000 sheep a day, are moved out of the North and into the South for processing.  The tariff on sheepmeat is 50% so, if there was a hard Border and we had to sell the North's sheep into Europe, we would be at 50% of a disadvantage on price.  On beef, the tariff is 65%.  Even if we could afford that tariff, and even if we could get our livestock into southern Ireland, does anyone think for one minute that French farmers would like to see product coming out of the UK, as the North would be labelled?  There is not a snowball's hope in hell of that.  This is the situation we are in.  We will answer those questions, no problem, but a hell of a lot of beef travels both North and South.</p><p> It was interesting, and insulting for the communities, that when the food processing and food manufacturing industries are so strong on this island, not a word was heard from them before the referendum.  What caution is that?  Why was that?  Why were they not speaking up?  It is unbelievable.  The committee is quite right.  The whole cost will come down to the primary producer, the farmer, and he cannot afford it.  There is no flesh there to stick it out.</p><p> In 2008 the geopark in County Fermanagh became the first international UNESCO-recognised geopark in the world.  It created &pound;17 million each year from 2012 to 2015, inclusive, or approximately &euro;20 million per year.  It is a cross-Border geopark that depends on European funding.  Who is going to fund that geopark now?  It is a fantastic flagship for Fermanagh and compares with any national park in the South, and it is only one of a number of things there.</p><p> I was asked about farming and I will give the figures succinctly.  At present, North and South, an average farm is 40 hectares in area with 20 suckler cows and 100 sheep.  Based on those figures, because of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the genetics scheme, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme and a sheep grazing headage subsidy scheme, a farmer in the South is at present &euro;20,000 better off than his counterpart in the North, leaving out the single farm payment.  This is due to those payments being made through a good rural development fund.  Britain always looked for this but it had the lowest rural development fund in all of Europe because it did not want to pay it.  The committee members are quite right that the taxpayer does not realise why we are being paid for what we produce.  Unfortunately, national and local governments are inclined to gold-plate the rules that come from Europe, but Europe is blamed for creating them in the first place.</p></speech>

It is up to groups like our own to make people aware of just how bad this can get.  I have spoken to many people at home who, for example, think they cannot close the roads again.  Yes, they can and, yes, they probably will.  I agree it is very important that people realise exactly how bad this can get.</p> <p>  Second, we have asked the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire, for a meeting and, unfortunately, he has handed us on to his substitute, Lord Dunlop.  We would like the Secretary of State to hear the very direct concerns of the people who live along the Border and to bring those to Westminster.</p></speech>

In the 1950s and 1960s, a certain amount of smuggling was carried out along the Border.  Such activity involved housewives with sugar and butter and things like that.  I do not condone smuggling and what happened at that time was relatively harmless.  We see the way smuggling has developed and evolved over the years to where it is now highly organised.  It does nothing for the economy of the Border areas.  It benefits a number of organisations or families and the money does not trickle down to the rest of the economy so it does not help at all.  There is anecdotal evidence to the effect that the people to whom I refer voted for Brexit because it was in their interests to do so.  What is in their interests is not in ours.  That was another adverse effect of the vote.</p></speech>

It has been very enlightening to listen to the witnesses.  It is extremely important that the clarity of their thoughts and the facts they are giving us are in the public domain.  They will certainly influence my thinking.  The message I am getting and what I really understand is how important this matter is and how adversely it will impact on their lives and ours.  The difficulty is finding the political solution to the problem.  The latter is our job; not that of the witnesses.  There must be stability in the North and there has to be an Administration that is seeking to reach a consensus and that meet the witnesses face to face and listen to their views.  It does not make sense to be going into this dark night, which Brexit is, if there is not an Administration in the North and if there is not consensus.  We are members of different bodies and we are parties to the Good Friday Agreement.  Some of us are members of the North-South Interparliamentary Association and some of us are members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I return to Dr. McDonnell's point.  Where is the plan?  We have not really come up with a good enough answer to that yet.  Part of the answer lies in an economic agreement between the North and South on which we can build on through people who are not in this Chamber and who have never attended here, but who attend meetings of other bodies.  Unless we reach that stage, we will not succeed in having the least impactful Brexit.  We are facing the alternative.</p> <p>  We must be able to reach out to the other people in our communities, particularly in the North, who do not participate in this debate.  If their voice is not heard here, our voice will not be heard where their voices are strong.  Their voice is the strongest.  It is not a matter for us or the witnesses.  They are the guarantors of the current British Government.  Their votes are hugely impactful on its policy, so we need them more than we ever needed them to step forward with the same argument as the witnesses are making.  I found it very useful and informative and I would like to be involved, if possible, in any future meetings or events that the witnesses intend to hold along the Border.  I would be very happy to attend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#W00400"><p>One of the statements made was to the effect that there is no reassurance in hearing the British and Irish Governments say they do not wish to see the introduction of a hard Border.  One of my concerns has been that ever since the Brexit outcome, the British Government and, to some extent, the Irish Government have fallen into the trap, as far as we are concerned, of talking about the management of Brexit as only being about offering assurances that there will not be a return to a hard Border and pledging there will be consultation and engagement with the Executive in the North and that as long as those two messages are given, there is nothing else to worry about, whereas I believe Brexit poses much more fundamental threats than those Mr. Fearon touched on.</p><p>It is particularly damaging and threatening to the standing of the Good Friday Agreement in the longer term, including to many of its cross-Border operations and a lot of the facilities for better co-operation and co-ordination across the Border, all of which will be lost.  Those benefits are not just confined to the Border areas.  Some of them stretch wider than that, but many of them are felt particularly and are appreciated in the Border areas and that would be lost.</p><p> Mr. Fearon made the point that some of these points are not made in Westminster.  Many of them are made in Westminster but they are not well taken there because they are coming from just a few of us.  There seems to be an attitude on the part of the Brexiteers that no matter what serious uncertainty is raised, smug certitude is the answer, which leads to all these platitudes about there being no hard Border or anything else.  Mr. McDonnell, MP, is struggling with this issue as a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.  I am stuck on the Exiting the European Union Committee, which dealing with Brexit itself.  We have a phalanx of the Brexiteers there.  There will be a report from that committee at the weekend in which it will indicate that it will hear evidence in Derry on 23 February.  That is the plan currently.  Maybe political events will mean that calendar will have to change.</p><p> It is important that the sort of points made to this committee would be conveyed and reflected to that broader select committee as well.  I would suggest to Mr. Fearon that he change how he is putting some of the points across because of the habit that they have of turning the question around and throwing it away from themselves.  If any presentation he made to that committee was as heavily focused on Frontex and those other fears Mr. Fearon has mentioned, they would say that neither he nor they want that, that they would not cause such things to occur after Brexit, but rather that the EU would, and that those concerns should be addressed to it.  They have their ways of washing their hands of these matters.  We saw that whole syndrome immediately after the referendum - a big boy did it and then he ran away.  They tried to clear themselves after doing the damage, which they did not realise they were going to do, but now of course the smugness has come in.</p><p> I also hope that in any articulation at that level, including in Mr. Fearon's meetings with Lord Dunlop, that he can emphasise, just as he has done here in the exchange, the Good Friday Agreement itself, both the benefits and how they are under threat of erosion in the future.  These people will just try to offer assurances that the Border question is not about them, and then one will find the meeting broadly at an end.  I agree with colleagues that in terms of dealing with the Government, one needs more than just dealing with Lord Dunlop.  Remember that he is also Minister for Scotland and is, therefore, programmed to say that he cannot do anything special in one part of the United Kingdom and that if he does anything too special in Northern Ireland then it creates a precedent for Scotland.  He is absolutely neurotic in avoiding any such thing.  It is a matter of putting the message across when one gets to those particular key audiences.</p><p> I really appreciate the strength of what Mr. Fearon has said on a number of points today, particularly his blunt point that a lot of the people who are giving assurances about there being no return to a hard Border are not in a position to guarantee that.  They get away with the platitude, however, and that is part of the problem and part of the frustration that we have.  He is also absolutely correct in thinking that there is not a crock of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow, which other people seem to think is there, as far as foreign payments and such matters are concerned.  It is hugely important that in his conversations with Westminster, when they take place, and with the UK Government, that while he puts his points strongly in regard to the Frontex issues and his particular concerns about the hard Border, that he does not confine it to those areas alone, because the threat here is not just what style of Border controls may be introduced.</p><p>The threat here is not just what profile of border controls there might be.  The threat is ending up with incipient border-ism.  Once one part of the island is in the EU, operating to EU standards and directives, and another part is operating under different ones, then somebody makes it their job to enforce and exaggerate those differences, resulting in creeping tit-for-tat border-ism even when people claim to respect the Good Friday Agreement fully.</p><p> After all, we had a bit of border-ism introduced in recent years with the haulage levy.  We were told that was not breaching anything but was just something that had to be done.  It was not being imposed to force the Border, but it was not possible to make a difference in Northern Ireland just because of our Border situation or because of the Good Friday Agreement.  Saying that we see no difference in Northern Ireland leads to that kind of border-ism.  The Minister who introduced that borderist measure is now the UK immigration Minister and is giving us the same assurances that he will not do anything to interfere with the Border or whatever, but he actually brought the Border back in haulage terms in a way that it had not existed for a number of years.  It shows how much this can happen incrementally and almost accidentally, but nobody can arrest it when it starts.</p></speech>

The main thing is the respect there needs to be for the 56% who voted to remain.</p> <p>  I have concerns about border controls.  It cannot be an inland Border on those 320 miles.  It must be at ports and airports because we would be asking the Irish Government to police and patrol on behalf of the British Government and it would also be restricting those European citizens within the European Union area.  As Mr. Durkan pointed out, that would be picked upon and someone would see it as a good idea for the Irish Government to look after the ports and borders.  We need to tease that out.</p> <p>  Do we have any understanding of why Unionist farmers might have voted to leave despite all the advice the British Government would not follow the gravy train they had previously?  Is there any indication of a change of attitude among them on that aspect?  I have not found it in talking to farmers.  They still seem to be very confident that the British Government will pay out the same amount of money, which nobody else believes.</p> <p>  We need to look for solutions.  I know it is political and that is not the witnesses' field.  There seems to be reluctance to look at the solution.  For all of Ireland to remain within the European Union requires an all-Ireland solution.  Politics has to come into it regardless of how much we try to avoid it.  It is unlikely that either Britain or the European Union would allow the North to remain in some sort of isolation, and Britain has already indicated it will not.  We need to look at what the realistic possibilities are.  People are concerned about the sensitivities of the Brits.  However, they are not concerned about the sensitivities of our situation.  The Irish Government has a responsibility to look after all its citizens.  We, in the North, are part of its citizenry and also need to be looked after within that.  As long as all of Ireland wants to remain within the European Union, that also needs to be respected.</p></speech>

I hope some of what we have been talking about has been informative to people who may not have thought about these points previously.</p><p>I take the point made by Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, emphasising that if we push the hard Border issue, it will allow the British Government to say it is not it that is doing it but the EU.  However, our group is specifically a Border communities group, and the big issue for us is the reinforcement of the hard Border.  It is difficult not to say it as it is.  I think, having listened to many of the comments today, we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  This committee has an open door which enables us to vent our feelings and those of people who live along the Border.  We would ask that the Irish Government take every opportunity in its deliberations with EU to show it exactly what a hard Border would mean to communities.  I think that is a very good point, and the sooner that is done the better.  We will certainly be available to meet any delegation visiting the Border area and to discuss what this change will mean.  I thank the committee and, as I said, we are open to contact from anybody who wants to contact us in the future, if we can be of any help in the making of these points.</p></speech>

Europe has to be conscious of the word "Irexit".  We do not have to be subservient to Westminster or Whitehall, nor do we necessarily have to be subservient to those running the EU.  They must understand we are in a difficult place.  There is an onus on them to act responsibly, as there is on politicians in this country.  I know many Unionists who wanted to remain.  This goes back to the caution and dominance, again, of Irish politics in the North.  Everything gets politicised.  Brexit is becoming politicised, and that is very unfortunate, and damning for local communities, especially Border communities.  Every one of us is living in communities along the Border.  I have to make a passionate plea that Brexit is not politicised.  There has to be some responsibility.  We have watched the city of Aleppo disappear in months.  People on the ground are passionate and do not want to be walked over.  They want their voices heard, and papering over the cracks does nothing for local communities.  </p> <p>  I suppose everything becomes orange and green, so if people believe they are born under a certain flag, then that is how they should vote, be it on Brexit or something else.  They will shoot themselves in the foot because of blind faith, which is terrible.  We have got to rise above that.  Numerous people have said to me that they have never seen the two communities so polarised, and this after 20 years of peace.  There is a responsibility on the leaders from every political party on this Ireland to act responsibly and to listen to the people on the ground, otherwise we are on a slow road to hell.</p></speech>

The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance is a national movement for children with more than 100 member organisations.  It is our goal to promote the rights of children in our laws, policies and services.  For us, Brexit poses profound implications for the future of the European Union and for peace and stability on the island of Ireland.  In particular, Brexit raises serious issues for, and poses threats to, children and young people.</p> <p>  We have been working closely on the implications of Brexit with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, including the Children&rsquo;s Law Centre.  We have also been working on this issue with our colleagues on the National Advisory Council for Children and Young People, comprising the National Youth Council of Ireland, the ISPCC, Barnardos, Early Childhood Ireland and Scouting Ireland.  As members of the joint committee will know, the last is an all-island organisation.</p> <p>  The EU's structured dialogue, a group of young people that is consulted on EU matters, has also been working on these issues.  It is deeply concerned about the implications of Brexit for the future of Ireland, including its children and young people.</p> <p>  We want to focus on five key areas, the first of which concerns the status of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Good Friday Agreement.  The committee will be aware that membership of the EU permeates the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a pre-existing condition for peace on the island of Ireland.  One of the important building blocks for peace on the island of Ireland, and particularly in Northern Ireland, is the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  It was passed in 1948 following the Second World War and is the main human rights treaty for the Council of Europe.  It is fundamental to the institutional and policing changes that have occurred in Northern Ireland.  It is one of the core threads of the agreement.</p> <p>  One of the reasons that human rights abuses by the state occurred in Northern Ireland was because there was no instrument to hold the state accountable for things like internment, inhuman and degrading treatment, and the non-prosecution of non-state actors for human rights abuses.  The ECHR and the fact the British Government agreed to adopt the Human Rights Act was an assurance for all of us on the island of Ireland that we would never go back and that this would never recur.</p> <p>  Another important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement is the requirement to have equivalent human rights protections North and South.  That has led to a lot of positive developments for both parts of the island.  We now have an Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in the Republic, as well as a Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland, and an equality body also.  The Irish Government gave further effect to the ECHR through the European Convention on Human Rights Act in 2003.  Ireland was one of the last countries in the Council of Europe to do so.  The positive benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, including human rights and equality guarantees, can be seen.</p> <p>  It is important for politicians North and South to ensure the ECHR can in no way become a casualty of Brexit.  While she was British Home Secretary, Theresa May called for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>It is of grave concern to us, particularly when one looks at the Good Friday Agreement, that this is a possibility.  The negotiators, the Government, and politicians in Northern Ireland must come to the forefront in stating that this is a non-negotiable item.  The European Convention on Human Rights cannot become a casualty.  The other issues we wanted to raise were in the area of child poverty.  I want to bring my colleague, Ms Saoirse Brady, in to cover that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.399" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#CC00200"><p>Child poverty is a priority area for the Children's Rights Alliance.  We have done a lot of work on it.  We believe that child poverty rates, both North and South, could be seriously impacted by Brexit.  We know that with Brexit, Northern Ireland will not receive additional social inclusion moneys from the European Union, nor will it receive further peace funding.  We know that the Brexit result has already caused some economic uncertainty, and we would be greatly concerned about any further impact of austerity on children on both sides of the Border.</p> <p>  In the last recession, children, both North and South, bore the brunt of it and of austerity measures.  We know that a quarter of children in the North live in poverty, while almost 12% live in poverty in the South, even though in the South we have some of the highest social welfare payment rates in the OECD.  We believe there is not enough investment in prevention, in early intervention and in free, accessible and equitable public services in the South.  That is one of the reasons for continued high poverty rates for children.  The EU recommendation, Investing in Children, outlines a roadmap for lifting children out of poverty.  The Government is currently putting in place a whole-of-Government approach to tackling child poverty.  They have a child poverty target to lift 97,000 children out of consistent poverty.  </p> <p>  What will happen to that if the economy suffers?  While the Good Friday Agreement does not specifically mention poverty anywhere in its text, it reaffirms both Governments' commitments to upholding economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights.  However, one of the most important socio-economic rights is the right to an adequate standard of living.  That addresses important issues like food poverty, housing and material deprivation.  We believe that any British-Irish agreement resulting from Brexit must include a focus on tackling child poverty both North and South and that this is a key human rights issues and should set out clear indicators and actions for reducing child poverty on both sides of the Border.</p> <p>  I am also going to talk about citizenship and cross-Border legal rights and entitlements of children before passing back to my colleague, Ms Ward.  The Good Friday Agreement means that people born in the North have the right to identify as Irish, British, or both.  This right to dual citizenship will not be impacted by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.  That is built into the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Clearly, this means that our citizens in the North cannot be robbed of their Irish citizenship, nor their EU citizenship by extension.  It is critical that the negotiations between the Irish, British and EU Governments recognise the special status of the North in this regard, and the fact that the Good Friday Agreement protects this important right.</p> <p>  The common travel area and EU free movement rights have ensured that Irish children living in the UK and British children living in Ireland have generally been able to access services on an equal footing.  We would be concerned that a hard Brexit will impact on the rights and entitlements of hundreds of thousands of children in both jurisdictions.  We are also concerned about the implications for specific groups of children, for example, children who travel North and South to avail of medical services, and Traveller children who move with their families between the two jurisdictions.  What implications will Brexit have for them?  The answer, of course, is to preserve the common travel area, and to ensure the rights of children and young people are protected in both the North and South.  A British-Irish agreement should include a specific obligation to preserve the common travel area and protect the rights of Irish and British citizens in both countries.</p></speech>

Those present are well aware that the EU has developed many different legal mechanisms and instruments governing aspects of children's lives.  In the area of child protection, one of the most important instruments is the EU directive on child sex abuse and exploitation.  That provides obligations, measures and protocols, whereby countries have to work together to deal with crimes that might be committed against the child where there might be some transnational element.</p><p>If someone views images of child abuse somewhere in England and, when the police investigate, it turns out that the material was generated in the Republic of Ireland, there are mechanisms and protocols in place because of EU law to allow the Irish Government to get that information and to use it to investigate, prosecute and potentially take a child into care.  These are some of the real-life scenarios that are covered by EU law at the moment.</p><p> Another key area is where, for example, an unaccompanied refugee child arrives in Dublin and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, discovers the child has family members somewhere in the United Kingdom.  EU law governs the transfer of that child to that jurisdiction if it is in his or her best interest to go to that location with that family member.  Another key area is that of child abduction.  Let us say two parents in the Republic of Ireland are in dispute and one of them travels to the UK with a child without permission.  An instrument called Brussels II is relied upon by the courts to bring that child back to the country.</p><p> The committee can understand there are many different ways in which our child protection systems interact and that it is necessary they interact.  That is the general drive of EU law and policy in this area at the moment.  Many of these key concerns involve a transnational element.  We believe painstaking work needs to go into identifying each and every scenario where a child or a family might be exposed because EU law is dealing with this matter.  There should be no loopholes for predators to travel from one country to another to abuse a child and there should be no loopholes impacting on the investigation and prosecution of these important types of crime.  Child trafficking is a real and present issue that we are all dealing with throughout the EU.  We cannot have any gaps in the law.</p><p> The most pragmatic recommendation in this area is for us to seek a soft Brexit where the UK remains in all the key legal agreements such as the common child protection system and the child care system.  This is in the best interests of children and young people.  I recommend this knowing that Theresa May in the media only this week has confirmed that is not going to happen, but that is what would be best for children and young people, namely, for the UK to remain in a common child protection and child care system.  In the event that this does not happen, we need to make sure those areas identified are included in a bilateral British-Irish agreement to ensure there are no loopholes.  We recommend that the State considers asking Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who is our special rapporteur on child protection, to investigate this.  As it happens, he is an expert on EU law and on Brussels.  We think this could be very important in regard to informing the development of the negotiations.</p><p> We believe all five jurisdictions - Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England - need to work more closely together on the implications of Brexit for children and young people.  At the very least, we must be consulting children and young people in all jurisdictions and making sure their voice is heard by the negotiators and governments in all jurisdictions, as well as by the EU, which also has to hear what children and young people have to say in this area.</p><p> On that point, the committee will be aware the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is holding her own consultation with young people on 30 January.  This needs to be followed up with leadership by politicians.  We need them to fight for children and young people in the negotiations, which will be incredibly important because they cannot become a casualty of the negotiations.  We also need leadership from our independent human rights institutions.  In the Republic, that will be the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Ombudsman for Children and in the North, that will be the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Commissioner for Children and Young People.  We need the independent institutions throughout the UK to stand together to fight the withdrawal or repeal of the Human Rights Act and to defend the Good Friday Agreement.  We in the Children's Rights Alliance need to work more closely with our colleagues in all five jurisdictions and throughout the EU to make sure we deliver the best possible deal for children and young people as a result of Brexit.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about the lack of preparation for what we are all going through.  Many issues are out of our hands.  We would all like a soft Brexit.  I do not think anybody would disagree with what Ms Brady said about the common travel area.  Northern Ireland being a special case and the Good Friday Agreement are the biggest cards to play.</p><p> I have a few questions.  Who is listening to what the Children's Rights Alliance is saying that can make a difference in the context of what it is saying and that can make what it is saying happen?  Ms Ward talked about working with people in Scotland, England and Wales.  The Children's Rights Alliance must talk to people in Europe.  What alliances or groups is it talking to in Europe?  They are the people who will be at the table when it comes to negotiations on a soft Brexit or hard Brexit.</p><p> My next question concerns what Ms Ward said about Theresa May's recent announcement.  As a result of what Ms May stated, I think we will be relying more on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Is the Children's Rights Alliance considering, from a legal point of view, where this might make up for the shortfalls we could see come down the line in the context of the work it is doing?</p></speech>

Like everyone else, we are trying to get to grips with what the implications of Brexit are.  We have met with our colleagues on the National Advisory Council for Children and Young People.  This body was established by the Government to advise it on the implementation of our national children's strategy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  We are the leaders in the children and youth charities and we are coming together to identify what the issues are and to communicate to Government and different bodies with an interest in this area what they need to achieve.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has been very active.  She has been in contact with all of us asking for advice.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to his credit, gave us a platform at the all-Ireland dialogue to raise these issues.  We are one of the only human rights groups that had that position.  We think that our politicians care about what happens to children but the reality is that some of the things they will have to seek will be difficult.</p> <p>  Regarding the European Convention on Human Rights, the stated position of the Prime Minister is to get out of the Human Rights Act.  How will that be managed?  As I said, it is a thread of the Good Friday agreement.  It is non-negotiable.  I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that the Good Friday agreement is one of the best playing cards in this regard.</p> <p>  One organisation with which we link is Eurochild, which is a European membership-based organisation.  We need to go to our counterparts in other countries and meet them at different fora to explain what we need to achieve for children and young people and what will make a difference.  Of course, we will need to take account of what they need from us because children and young people from their jurisdictions are living throughout the United Kingdom, so they will want to see some guarantees for those children as well.  More broadly, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights has a major role to play.  An Irishman, Michael O'Flaherty, leads that agency.  We should rely on the agency to educate us on the implications, particularly in the very minute eye of law.  Much work must be done by many lawyers to work out what the gaps are.  That is incredibly important as well.</p> <p>  Does Ms Brady wish to add anything else?</p></speech>

It does not have effect in domestic law.  We are starting to see more and more parts of the convention incorporated into domestic legislation - for example, the best interest principle, the right of the child to be heard, which is a key provision, and non-discrimination rights for children.  However, we would like to see this in more domestic legislation on both sides of the Border.  The Scottish Government was very keen to try to incorporate some of the principles of the convention into domestic law, but that did not happen.  It has incorporated certain elements of it, but if we are going to look to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we must consider ways to promote it and ensure it is legally enforceable here as well.  We report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as well as other UN committees.  The Children's Rights Alliance lead on that process here in the South.  We have a lot of contact with our colleagues in the North - for example, the Children's Law Centre.</p><p>We can feed into that committee.  We know that it makes recommendations.  We need politicians and policy makers to take on board those recommendations and to come up with ways to progress them, including by way of legislation and also through implementation of the national policy framework, Better Outcomes, Better Futures.  The Children's Rights Alliance is represented on the national advisory council for children and young people and as such it has a key role to play in this area.  There is also a role for the UN convention but we need to strengthen our stance on it.  </p></speech>

We are calling on negotiators - politicians - to push for measures to address child poverty and to ensure that this issue is central in the negotiations.  We understand that this will be difficult because the UK Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, and her predecessor, David Cameron, have tried to dismantle child poverty policies in the United Kingdom but we believe it is absolutely essential to the protection of children and people throughout the island of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is great to see a civil society group take such an interest in this issue.  I am not too sure whether Brexit is a hard or a soft exit will make much of a difference to what is actually going to happen.  I was a little concerned about the reference in the submission to there being an over-emphasis on working with the UK, or with the English in particular, but the witnesses have allayed some of my fears in that regard.  For me, the real work has to be done with our 26 partner countries.  We must first convince them of the problems that we face as a result of Brexit.  Whatever happens afterwards with the UK is another matter entirely.  I note that the Children's Rights Alliance is calling for a bilateral agreement.  The European Union has said that there will be no bilateral agreement, which is a matter of huge concern to me.</p> <p>  As I said, I welcome that the Children's Rights Alliance has chosen to meet with us today.  Has it taken steps to meet sister organisations in the European Union, and MEPs from the North and South of Ireland in particular, to lobby members of the European Commission?  It will be important that sister organisations in our 26 partner countries lobby their governments on behalf of the group, although whether they will be willing to do so is another matter.  I would be interested in hearing a response to those few questions.</p></speech>

We tried to work out what the implications will be on an all-island basis.  We have been linking with colleagues in the five nations, particularly Wales and England.  I understand that academics are to come together to commission research in this area and to investigate it.  We also propose to ask our European based body, Eurochild, to bring all of the relevant groups together in the context of Brexit and its implications because many of them do not know what Brexit means.  We ran a consultation of the Children's Rights Alliance in late October.  Many members said that while they are concerned about Brexit, they do not understand what it means.  They need someone to educate them on what areas of law and policy will be affected.  This will trigger them to respond.</p> <p>  A lot of work needs to be done on educating people about Brexit because what it actually means is not clear.  I recently spoke at an event in Belfast at which I explained what Brexit means.  Colleagues from Wales who attended that event were astounded at what I had to say because none of this dialogue is happening in Wales.  Our politicians are too afraid to talk about what it means because they know it is unpopular to be against Brexit.  One of the real problems in the United Kingdom is that politicians who lost the referendum are finding it difficult to stand up for children and young people.  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to know what we need for children and young people and that we then need to convince our counterparts throughout the European Union in terms of that need and get them to lobby and advocate on our behalf.  We also need to know what they need for children and young people, although we can foresee that will most likely be free movement rights for children and young people travelling to the United Kingdom.</p><p>They will all be concerned about child protection and the lack of an integrated child protection system.  It is something on which we can work together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mickey Brady" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#GG00200"><p>I should declare an interest immediately because Saoirse Brady is my daughter.</p> <p>  I thank the delegates for the presentation.  As individuals and a party, we are interested in all 32 counties, not just the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties.  Child poverty is a big issue in the North and the South.  In my constituency of Newry and Armagh a report was produced seven years ago by a child poverty action group which showed that 39% of children in the constituency were living below what was considered to be the poverty level.  It is, therefore, a huge issue.  </p> <p>  The target of 97,000 was mentioned.  It is interesting that when Mr. Tony Blair became British Prime Minister, both he and Mr. Gordon Brown set the target that child poverty would be eradicated in Britain by 2010.  That did not happen.  It was then decided that it should be eradicated by 2020.  That is, however, highly unlikely to happen, given who is now in charge.  In fact, it will probably never happen if they continue in power.</p> <p>  There is another point at a purely practical level for somebody like me, whose background is in giving advice on welfare rights.  I constantly deal with cases involving tax credits and have raised this matter previously.  There are many cross-Border workers who live in towns like Newry and work in places such as Dundalk, Dublin and Drogheda.  The point in having tax credits, including child tax credits, is to supplement low incomes.  In the North - certainly in my constituency - we live in a low wage economy.  Most of the profits made in shopping centres and so forth go back to Britain; very little stays in the local economy, aside from what is paid to those on the minimum wage which is now the living wage.  The living wage has affected children.  When the British Government announced the introduction of the living wage of &pound;7.80, housing benefit for those on low incomes was reduced because their income had gone up slightly; therefore, this nonsense about improving people's standard of living must be addressed also.  One of my issues with tax credits, including child tax credits, is that such cases have become extremely complex because there are two jurisdictions involved.  I have been contacted by people with from two to five children who have not received benefits for six to 12 weeks and sometimes longer.  This has a direct impact on their children.  If Brexit takes place, of whatever type, these cases will surely become even more complex.</p> <p>  The other issue is that the European Convention on Human Rights is a central plank of the Good Friday Agreement.  Our purpose here is to oversee implementation of the Agreement.  If we see issues, they must be addressed.  Obviously, there are ongoing cases in the Six Counties, including that of the hooded men which is being referred back to the European Court.  There has been some misinformation or a misunderstanding of the roles of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.  One of them may still apply, even if the British pull out, while the other will not.  It is important that people know that there will still be somewhere they will be able to go.</p> <p>  It is very important that we address child poverty issues.  Regardless of what administration is in place in the North and the South, benefit issues are administrative issues that can be addressed very quickly.  I have been dealing with such issues for a long time.  The tax credits system is a total shambles.  The first thing the British did was close an office in Belfast.  As a result, people in the North must deal with offices in Preston, Glasgow, Liverpool, Blackpool or Cornwall.  One is going around the houses all the time.  That is something about which the delegates could inquire because it is purely an administrative issue which could be dealt with.  It is adding to the level of child poverty and diminishing children's quality of life.</p></speech>

We see them impacting, in particular, on Traveller children and children in families where one parent works on the Northern side of the Border and the other works in the South.  Recently, there was the announcement of an affordable child care scheme in the South.  What will happen with it?</p><p>That is going to be quite complex in the context of how those conditions are developed as well.  What will happen, for example, to someone who lives in Fermanagh, works in Monaghan and wants to drop a child off to a child care facility near his or her workplace because it is more convenient?  There are many questions in that context and we have raised them.</p><p> We have been doing a great deal of work in this area.  We co-convene a child poverty subgroup with the Department of Social Protection in the Republic under the auspices of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy framework.  We meet with that Department and other Departments and take the opportunity to raise some of these issues.  It is something about which we are concerned.  Welfare criteria, whether those applied by the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Communities in the North, are complex and people require better information and better support in order to understand them.  People accessing the right social security is a fundamental human rights issue.</p><p> We have not yet achieved a living wage.  Great research has been carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and this shows the different costs for parents of children of different ages.  That needs to be taken into account.  What we have seen with regard to social security benefits for lone parents and their children, in particular, is that they have been particularly badly impacted upon by the recession and the changes to social welfare eligibility criteria.  That has impacted on child poverty rates and we would be particularly interested in raising that as an issue.  I imagine that the same is true in the North as well.</p></speech>

The judicial oversight body for EU law is the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  Cases that could be taken to that court relate to the implementation of EU law.  The European Court of Human Rights was founded following the agreement of the European Convention on Human Rights.  That court relates to the Council of Europe and the aforementioned convention.  The Council of Europe is a pan-European organisation that includes all countries in Europe including EU member states.  All European countries are members of the Council of Europe, including Russia, for example.  In the context of Brexit, I can guarantee that the UK will not seek a deal whereby the European Court of Justice would have an oversight role so the European Court of Human Rights will become far more important.  It will be the only supranational judicial body to which people will have recourse in the event of their human rights being abused in some way by the State.  It will be more important in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>

Back in the early 1980s when I started in the advice sector, child benefit in the South was less than in the North.  People who lived in the North and worked in the South had to claim their child benefit where they worked, as is the case with sick benefit and so forth.  Through the law centre we took a case and, by means of European Union legislation, we were able to equalise those benefits.  That has changed now because child benefit in the South - fortunately and for good reason - is now higher than in the North.  European Union legislation has been effective in improving the standard of living for families and children in the past.  That case was specifically related to children.</p></speech>

There are other supranational courts but they are very particular courts like the International Criminal Court that would deal, for example, with war crimes.  In terms of the general civil rights of individuals, the European Court of Human Rights is the most important body for us in Europe.</p></speech>

How great is Ms Ward's expectation that a bilateral agreement between the Republic of Ireland and the North could be worked out on some of these issues?</p></speech>

There is a view that we cannot do this, that the only agreement that can be reached will be between the European Union and the UK and that we must wait and see what happens.</p><p>If that is the only show in town, we will have to adapt our strategy and work with whatever agreement is put in place.  However, it is clear that there are many different areas in which children and young people are impacted by transnational issues.  We have to find some form of legal instrument to deal with those issues because we cannot leave those children exposed.</p></speech>

At this early stage, is there any evidence of a direct threat to current arrangements?  While I am aware that these arrangements may be destabilised by Brexit, is there any suggestion that the arrangement between Belfast and Dublin on congenital paediatric surgery and congenital heart defects would be threatened by it?</p></speech>

Even if Article 50 is triggered, this law will be in place for the two-year period.  However, two years is a very tight deadline to get this right.  We should, therefore, have a clear sense now of what will be the issues for children and young people in order that we can plot out and strategise about how to resolve those issues in the negotiations that may happen between different jurisdictions and the European Union.</p></speech>

These are part of the UK's legal system and it would take 40 years to unwind them.  The UK will try to unwind some of them.  Issues arise with regard to child abduction and so forth. One of the key child protection issues the witnesses raised is the EU arrest warrant, which applies to both jurisdictions.  Following Brexit, the EU arrest warrant will no longer apply to Northern Ireland, which means such cases would have to be addressed under an extradition agreement between Ireland the United Kingdom.  Given that we do not have such an agreement with the UK, legislation on this matter may have to be introduced, depending on the final agreement reached on Brexit.</p> <p>  On the final recommendation and the special rapporteur, does the Children's Rights Alliance want the committee to seek to have a special rapporteur investigate the implications of Brexit?</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator on the European arrest warrant.  The UK has nothing to gain by not being part of the European arrest warrant agreement because these warrants make it easier to move suspects to another EU country than was the case under our pre-existing extradition law because the former eliminated one of the principles of extradition law, namely, that one could not remove someone from a jurisdiction where the offence that is the subject of the extradition request from another country is not a crime.  For example, it was not possible to remove a person from the UK to Ireland to be charged with a crime if that offence was not a crime in the UK.  The European arrest warrant removed this provision.  There has been some media criticism of the European arrest warrant on the grounds that it makes it easier to remove a person to another country.</p> <p>  This is one area where there is an exposure because we do not want people who are suspected of crimes committed against children to be able to hide behind the fact that there is no law to hold them accountable for what they have done.  This is one of many areas where the United Kingdom is extremely exposed because it will not have a system to remove suspects from its jurisdiction to jurisdictions in the European Union and member states will not have a mechanism to have suspects transferred from the UK to be tried.</p></speech>

First, I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentation at the all-Ireland dialogue and particularly the document they presented to the committee today.  It is a great template for us around the four issues that have been highlighted.  It will be useful as information for the committee, and other committees, in how we have to promote what the Children's Rights Alliance is about.  I have two specific and very simple questions.  Looking at the alliance and the grouping, I counted some 115 organisations.  We know that much of their funding streams would have been from the EU, or they would have been partially funded by it.  Could the witnesses comment on the impact on these organisations with regard to the stream of social inclusion money?  My second query is about other funding streams.  I know money is not what it is all about but, at the end of the day, it makes the world go around.  The committee has had a presentation from the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  It indicated clearly, and letters I have received from various departments in the UK indicate, that the EU will fund programmes up to 2020.  The SEUPB commented here that it was exploring non-EU funding streams to countries outside the EU that were being funded by the EU.  Has the Children's Rights Alliance explored any of those options or does it see any merit in looking at what other templates might be available in order to ensure that social inclusion moneys continue for the good work being done by these organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#KK00300"><p>It is an area where I wonder if we could argue the special case for Northern Ireland and if it could be part of that special case.  The EU moneys have been very important to empowering and enabling organisations working North and South to continue working together to bring down the barriers and to deal with the fear and prejudice.  It will be incredibly important, if we have a British-Irish agreement, that this is part of it.  We did not have time today to go into the implications for children and young people living in the Border counties.  There are some 50,000 children living in the Border counties and their lives play out over the Border.  What will Brexit mean for them and the organisations, civil society groups and youth organisations that work together to support them?</p> <p>  There is some possibility and scope to look at funding arrangements.  The Good Friday Agreement and the special case of Northern Ireland are probably our best cards in that regard.  It has already caused some concern.  When we were involved in some EU grants with Northern Ireland partners, there was concern after the Brexit referendum result and questions over what it would mean, for example, if we get the funding, would the funding agreement go ahead?  There is also concern in the sector that some of the groups may move south to avail of EU funding and the impact this may have on the community and voluntary sector and on the public.  It is not a concern I share, but this is some of the dialogue and discussion that is ongoing in our sector currently and it is something that we need to explore.  It is of particular concern to the all-island organisations such as Scouting Ireland, the members of which work together all the time for children and young people.  I believe it will impact on those organisations.</p></speech>

We have a common law system.  I have been involved in EU projects where we would deliberately have a partner from the South, a partner in London and then one from another EU member state.  That may be a civil law jurisdiction because we have a lot of commonalities and we understand the way the law works in the same way.  We would also have many similar systems.  Pragmatically, it will be problematic for some of our member organisations who seek joint EU funding for very important upcoming projects.</p></speech>

As far as I know, Law Centre NI took a case on cross-Border childminding.  I could send on the reference to that if I have it.  That issue will continue to arise.  Habitual residence has come into play for welfare payments on both sides of the Border.  Having tests on where people live versus where they work always poses a problem and that will not be eliminated if we have any kind of Brexit.</p></speech>

If we do not secure something like that for people from Belfast who work in Dublin, they will not be able to avail of child benefit as they can at the moment because the United Kingdom is a third country.  All of these things need to be untangled.  We have tried to come up with some global solutions to capture all of those situations.  The common travel area seems to be a useful tool to make sure all children and families can be protected.</p></speech>

It contains excellent material and raises very important issues in respect of the rights of the most vulnerable group in society.  I and some of my colleagues on this committee have raised the issue of funding cross-Border projects with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and with the Northern Ireland Finance Minister, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir.  At that time there was concern about the British commitment to fund projects up to 2020.  Subsequently, the British Chancellor gave a commitment that the funding is secure and the Secretary of State, Mr. Brokenshire, assured us at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in November that the funding is safe and ring-fenced.  My colleague, Deputy Breathnach, and I attended a meeting of the North-South Interparliamentary Association at Stormont and afterward we met M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir who was strongly of the view that the funding is secure.  Deputy Breathnach and I then raised the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  Given the doubts about the availability of funding in the next few years, I told him that some community groups would not put a great effort into preparing applications when funding might not be available.  We all know that a lot of preparatory work is involved for voluntary and statutory organisations before drawing down EU funding.  Before Christmas, the Minister told me to let him know if any groups had concerns about the security of the funding they expected, or hoped, to draw down after the processing of applications and said he would try to assist as much as possible.  If there are projects it would be useful to bring them to our attention and we could raise them directly with the Minister.  I commend the Children's Rights Alliance on its work.  The issues the witnesses raised are of great importance to all of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.436" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017011200002#LL00500"><p>I welcome several of the issues the witnesses have touched on, not least that it has made a point of going to the fundamental question of the durability of the European Convention on Human Rights, via the Human Rights Act 1998, as far as the North is concerned.</p><p>That issue is being underplayed in the debate on this island around Brexit because people do not realise that the agenda of many of those who are pushing Brexit at UK level does not stop there but seeks also to achieve the disposal of the Human Rights Act.  Such a development potentially has implications for the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement.  The great repeal Bill that is being discussed in Westminster is basically a great download and save Bill, which notionally will take all existing EU law and put it in UK law.  The problem, of course, is that all those laws can thereafter be deleted at will.  If, at the same time this is happening, we have a debate that moves towards the abolition of the Human Rights Act, we are facing a situation whereby people will insist that the UK Parliament should receive those competencies transferred from Europe, even though many of them, under our devolution settlement and under the Good Friday Agreement, are properly devolved.  There is a risk that efforts will be made to keep those competencies in some type of holding pattern in Westminster so that when devolution does take place, after the Human Rights Act has been removed, the rights benchmarks attaching to these things have already been interfered with.  If those key, rights-sensitive areas of devolution are only properly devolved after the rights have already been diminished, they cannot be topped up again in the North without cross-community support.  If they devolve straight away on transfer from Europe, however, they cannot be diluted except where there is cross-community support to do so.</p><p> This is probably taking us into a more political space than we might want to be, but it is a key issue.  It is not a wee, pedantic point of preciousness about where or when devolution begins.  Rights can be lost within that gap.  In fact, we could well be faced with a very serious mind-the-gap situation in respect of children's rights and all rights.  This is not the paper point some people might seek to make it as to where devolution transfers and what rights standards apply at that time.  The issue is that once we find ourselves outside the sort of social policy Wi-Fi that comes from being in a commons rights understanding, that is when we are set to lose.  Many years ago, when I was Deputy First Minister and we were drawing up the legislation to establish the Commissioner for Children and Young People in the North, the then British Secretary of State intervened because some of the proposed powers of the commissioner would apply to children in detention, which came under the Northern Ireland Office.  The Secretary of State told us we could not have the term "best interests of the child" in the legislation.  There followed a whole rigmarole as to whether we should be referring to welfare, rights or best interests.  We were eventually successful in including all three but the point is that when one is outside that ambit of being able to say "This is the standard we are in and we want to stay with this benchmark", then, at a policy level, the people who are advocating the highest standard of rights will be in a weaker position.  That is where context is important in considering these matters.</p><p> In regard to some of the cross-Border issues, a lot of the good work that was done in Border areas, such as in the area of family and child services, including for Traveller families, was taken forward under the auspices of Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, which was EU funded.  I am not sure the two Administrations would have sorted out many of the issues that were sorted out or improved were it not for that type of funding from Europe.  Now all that funding is potentially lost for the future and that is where we face the real loss.  We must challenge the complacency on these issues, the idea that what we have now will always be there and everything will just carry on steadily.  That sort of progress does not roll along on the wheels of inevitability.  It needs systems, structures and a context, and it needs funding.</p><p> Reference was made to the situation of cross-Border workers and benefits for children and so on.</p><p>When tax credits were first introduced as a progressive measure by a Labour Government across the water, under the rules, child allowance that was paid in the South counted as part of the means test in the United Kingdom and the North.  That was only changed when I got the Paymaster General to reverse it and give money back to people.  That came about because nobody had properly thought about it.  We are in a situation now where, post-Brexit, the EU-derived rule that child benefit or allowance is paid according to where the person works will go.  That issue arose when David Cameron got his Brussels deal.  When I asked both him and George Osborne in the House of Commons if child benefit would not have to be paid to EU workers and what that meant in respect of cross-Border workers in Northern Ireland, they did not know.  They had not thought about it and said nobody had raised it until I asked the question.  There are aspects of that which could work out well for some families and children, depending on the way that rule falls, but it must be taken in hand to ensure we do not end up with many inadvertent outcomes that cause problems nobody intended to cause .  However, it will be very difficult for anybody to properly solve this matter in a coherent, rights-based way.</p></speech>

I welcome what Mr. Durkan said.  It is hugely encouraging because the joint committee has a fundamental role to ensure that the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, is not down played in the context of Brexit.  We are surprised that more attention has not been brought to it because it is so fundamental.  It is a key aspect of the Good Friday Agreement.  If we pull that thread, what other thread do we pull?</p> <p>  I used to work for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and my colleagues, who would have campaigned around the Good Friday Agreement, would say that those human rights aspects, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights, were very important to give people faith that the peace process was durable and would work - "durable" was the word they used.  People could lose faith in the peace process if we deviate in any way from the ECHR.</p> <p>  Another issue of concern is that we could have political instability with Brexit.  We do not know the implications of it.  That instability could happen in Northern Ireland, and it is precisely at that-----</p></speech>

Those are the pressure points at which states make mistakes and interfere with people's rights.

There is a role here for the national human rights institutions.  For example, the Scottish Human Rights Commission has raised the issue of repealing the Human Rights Act and what that means in terms of the Scotland Act.  I assume there is a similar provision setting up the commission in the North.  The members of this committee, looking at the Good Friday Agreement, should be talking to the national human rights institutions such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Northern Ireland Human rights Commission.  It could be a good step for the committee members to meet with both those bodies to see what they can do in strengthening their hand to keep the ECHR.</p></speech>

We are Ireland's organisation for people parenting alone, sharing parenting or separating.  We have been in existence since 1972, when we were established as Cherish, and we provide a range of parenting and family supports in Dublin and throughout Ireland to one-parent families.  We also do policy work and have a membership system.  We do a lot of practice-to-policy work.  What we are saying is based on evidence from parents and families with whom we work.  Children are really at the heart of what we do, and the question how to support parents to be the best possible parents they can in difficult circumstances for their children is the prism through which we see everything.</p> <p>  The families with which we work and which we represent come from all kinds of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds.  There is no stereotype or particular type of person who may find himself or herself in the position of parenting alone.  People arrive in the position from a very wide range of circumstances, but a very typical lone parent is a female in her 30s with one child.  She is probably sharing parenting with the father, although there is no specific research to support this.  She is probably in low-paid part-time employment, which is part of the difficulties we will consider today, and living in poverty.</p> <p>  Longitudinal research in Ireland and other countries has shown that children do just as well in one-parent families as in two-parent families and that the real issues are poverty and the difficulties in accessing the right services and education.  If one controls for these factors, children do just as well in both family types, so many of the negative stereotypes to which parents can be subjected are unfounded and unfair.</p> <p>  One in four families with children in Ireland today is a one-parent family, and one in five children lives in a one-parent family.  This is, therefore, a common type of family; it is no longer an aberration.  We know from looking across Europe and from studies there that we can expect families to continue to diversify.  We see more people separating and divorcing, albeit at very low rates in comparison to our neighbours.  They are still growing and diversifying.  We see more people in step-parent families and blended families.  Part of what we want to highlight is that our services, policies and laws need to be able to cope with such diversity and not just see things in a very rigid and more traditional way which focuses on the "male-breadwinner, married, mammy-daddy" family.</p><p>Families are much more interesting, diverse and challenging in those ways as well.  The context of our submission is the reform and cuts introduced in budget 2012, which impacted hugely on lone parents, as was well rehearsed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in wider society.  These reforms and cuts were unprecedented.  I believe the intent of this reform never came to pass but led instead to many parents having to leave work or being faced with higher levels of poverty.  The statistics show that as a result of these cuts and reforms, there are more children living in poverty.  For example, there was an immediate 40% reduction in the payments to lone parents who were in work and in receipt of the family income supplement, FIS.  At that time, as there were not many jobs available, there was no cross-departmental planning in this area and child care and after-school care were not considered.  We believed from the outset that this reform would fail and believe it has failed although studies, research and impact assessments in this regard have yet to be done, from which we will learn more in due course.</p><p> Lone parents want to work.  Many are working but many are challenged because of the lack of access to suitable child care, education and training and in-work assistance, as well as family-friendly employment.  Some of the points we propose to speak to today will hit on issues such as how to make work pay, child poverty, in-work supports and improving access to education for lone parents.  I am sure it is well known that poverty rates are always highest among lone parents.  According to the most recent data, those living in lone-parent households continue to experience the highest rates of deprivation, with almost 60% of individuals from such households experiencing one or more forms of deprivation.  This compares with 29% of the general population who experience deprivation.  As such, an individual living in a one-parent family is twice as likely to live in deprivation.  Children living in one-parent family households are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as other children and 23% of children in a one-parent family experience deprivation.  This is not a situation any of us would like to see continue.  We welcome the commitment in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - the national children and young people's strategy - to lift 97,000 children out of poverty.  However, since publication of that strategy the target has been raised because more children have moved into poverty.  We believe that the focus of these measures must be on children living in one-parent families because they are consistently the poorest, twice as likely to live in poverty and the most socially excluded in Ireland.  We note the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, have publicly committed to reaching the target on child poverty and we welcome those commitments.  </p><p> I am a member of the advisory council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  A subgroup of that council has worked in partnership with the Department of Social Protection specifically on child poverty and trying to develop targets and measures to implement a plan on the reduction of child poverty.  That group was co-convened by the Children's Rights Alliance and the Department of Social Protection and it has been a useful constructive process, although we have a long way to go.  We now have an NGO report with a set of recommendations for all Departments.  This is not just an issue for the Department of Social Protection because, as we know, poverty is interconnected across the Departments.  We have set out what we believe the Government should be doing.  The Department of Social Protection is collating inputs from other Departments and it will produce its own report on what the Government should be doing.  We believe that targeted income supports remain the most effective measure to reduce child poverty in specific families.  Rather than increasing universal payments, we need to target income supports.  </p><p> On child maintenance, in one-parent families there is frequently another parent who may or may not be taking financial or other types of responsibility for his or her child or children.  This is an extremely complex area.  The way in which maintenance interacts with social welfare payments can cause hardship for children and parents.  We have had discussions on this issue with officials from the District Court and the Department of Social Protection and we are hopeful that we will be able to improve some of the processes in place in that regard.</p><p>However, if one looks at the big picture, other countries take responsibility to ensure that children are not poor.  They guarantee payments to families and try to recoup them from the other parent rather than relying on individual parents to do the right thing or to be able to do the right thing, which does not always work in the real world.  We believe there should be a more transparent, innovative and consistent approach to how maintenance is dealt with for social welfare customers to prevent their children living in poverty.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Valerie Maher.</p></speech>

I will start with education because rather than taking a work first approach we must examine an education first approach in the context of low educational attainment among lone parent households.  We welcome the commissioning of an examination of some of the barriers lone parents face is accessing higher education.  It is being conducted by Dr. Delma Byrne and her colleagues at Maynooth University.  We have contributed to that and I understand they have been given an extended amount of time to include the voice of lone parents.  It is imperative that we talk to all of the people involved and particularly the people who are impacted most.  Research has shown that better educated parents have better educated children and that those children have better social and emotional outcomes and better health.  For families headed by a lone parent, the education level of the mother is more important for children's well-being than the type of family structure in which they live.  Educating lone parents is essential.  This offers a clear rationale for supporting lone parents to access education, thus improving their children's outcomes.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, what we hear from the lone parents we work with is that it is not so much that they do not wish to access education, but that there are a number of barriers in place that prevent them from doing so.  We hope that whatever findings arise from the report from Maynooth University will be taken on board and that appropriate policy responses will be put in place, regardless of the investment that might be required to do that.  The recommendations we have included in our submission to the committee are recommendations we have put forward many times over the last couple of years in our pre-budget submissions, so they are not new.  With regard to specialist bridging programmes, One Family has developed the New Futures programme.  It acknowledges that many lone parents are distant from the labour market and need specific supports to get them back into education or employment.  Our programmes look at some of the barriers lone parents might have internally relating to motivation and self confidence, help them with some of the practical barriers there are in place and offer them specific supports to get back into education.</p> <p>  We believe jobseeker's transition payment should be extended to parents who are engaging education, regardless of the age of their youngest child.  Currently, if lone parents whose children are over 14 years of age wish to engage in education they must transfer to back-to-education allowance, but there is an issue with that regarding access to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance grant.  The link between housing tenure and people's access to supports to enter education must be broken.  It is unfair that somebody living in social housing can stay on their jobseeker transition one-parent family payment and avail of the SUSI maintenance grant, which is an essential support for child care, travel to university and the various costs associated with education.  In the absence of having that additional income from SUSI it is practically impossible for lone parents to access education and improve their future outcomes.</p> <p>  With regard to in-work supports, labour market reforms must acknowledge the importance of balancing parenting and work.  Lone parents have sole parenting responsibility and that must be taken into account when we are trying to activate lone parents into the labour market.  Some of the specific challenges lone parents face include the lack of affordable child care and precarious work, such as zero-hour contracts.  Policies are required which promote access to employment, support the work of parenting and offer more flexible work contracts to allow parenting to take place in conjunction with work.</p> <p>  Transitioning from welfare to work is not a simple transition for many people.  It is a complex issue that involves input and understanding from all Government Departments, not just the Department of Social Protection.  It is necessary that parents understand this complex system and that they are not just being pushed through into work without a full understanding of why that is happening.  As a result of the one-parent family payment reforms, lone parents with children over 14 years of age must now transfer to jobseeker's allowance.  With that comes the conditionality of being available for and seeking full-time work.</p><p>This particular cohort has been disproportionately impacted because for a start, if one's child is 14 or 15, he or she spends four to five months of the year outside of school so the idea that such families no longer need child care is not true.  In many cases, this cohort would have been in receipt of social welfare payments for a long time.  We hope that officials in the Department have an understanding of that and that front-line staff are given appropriate training to support these people into work and that conditions are not being applied without recognising some of the challenges they face.  We know that lone parents at work have been negatively impacted by the reforms and many have not gained financially.  This can disincentivise employment, which goes against the point of the reforms.</p><p> It goes without saying that affordable and accessible child care is essential for lone parents to work.  Lone parents who participate in the workforce or who are engaged in education and training require care of their children.  They do not have somebody else in the household to assist them with that and must have affordable and accessible child care to be able to access education or work.  There has been a public consultation on the new single affordable child care scheme which it is proposed to commence in September.  We have some specific concerns on that scheme and our full submission to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is available on our website, the link to which is contained in our written submission to this committee.  We are particularly concerned about the schemes currently available which have capped weekly fees, with parents paying between &euro;15 and &euro;25 per week.  Under the new proposal, such schemes will be scrapped.  Quite a high number of lone parents access those schemes currently and we are concerned that child care fees will increase for those lone parents.  Our recommendation is that the Department of Social Protection should liaise closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in order that there is an understanding of how the two interact and nobody is sanctioned or made to enter education or employment as a result of the conditionality of his or her payment in the absence of affordable and accessible child care.  </p><p> We believe that lone parents in receipt of the jobseeker's transitional payment should be seen as a distinct group with a specific set of needs.  Indeed, that has been acknowledged by the Department by virtue of the fact that the payment has been set up.  There is an opportunity to expand the availability of the payment to lone parents whose children are over 14 and who want to access education.  This would take away some of the barriers faced by that cohort.  We welcome the increase in the income disregards and the small increase in basic social welfare payments announced in the budget.  However, there needs to be a broader understanding and awareness of people who are in receipt of overlapping provisions or additional supports from the Department and the impact of these increases.  For example, a lone parent who is working part time and in receipt of rent supplement will not benefit financially from the increases because the social welfare increases are accompanied by a proportionate decrease in the rent supplement.  A lot of these things can be confusing for lone parents and the system can be complex in that regard.  </p><p> I have already mentioned our recommendation regarding lone parents whose children are over 14 and who want to access education.  We also recommend that lone parents in employment whose children are aged between seven and 14 be allowed to receive the jobseeker's transitional payment and the family income supplement together.  We further recommend that the qualifying hours for family income supplement be reduced to 15 per week.  In the context of the reforms, a number of lone parents have found it very difficult to increase their hours of work and have not been able to access the family income supplement as a result.  </p><p> We believe that lone parents who are in receipt of social welfare supports should be allowed to participate in community employment, CE, schemes but should be offered an additional payment of &euro;50 per week as opposed to the standard &euro;22.50 payment.  This is just an acknowledgement of the costs of going to work, travel expenses and so forth and we believe it would incentivise more lone parents to use CE schemes as a bridge to entering full-time or part-time employment.  </p><p> We welcome the opportunity to continue to work constructively with policy makers and relevant Departments, particularly the Department of Social Protection with which we have a very good relationship.  We want to ensure that children in one-parent families become less likely to grow up in poverty and that Ireland becomes a fairer place for all families.  </p><p> Finally, I wish to advise the committee that we intend to launch a report on the national survey we conducted on shared parenting.</p><p>It will be launched in the Mansion House on 13 January and we would welcome members to the launch.  Some of the issues arising from the survey pertain to social protection.  They include issues related to maintenance and difficulties being experienced by people who are sharing parenting in accessing payments from the Department of Social Protection.  We would welcome the attendance of members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to discuss the issues facing lone parents.  It is interesting that the joint committee is examining these issues with One Family, whose view is broadly focused on lone parents, and Focus Ireland, which has a view on homelessness.  As neither organisation has much expertise in the area of the other, the joint committee may learn a great deal from examining the issue from two perspectives, and that is welcome.</p> <p>  Focus Ireland is one of the leading housing and homelessness organisations.  We are appearing before the joint committee because we have been designated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive as the homeless action team for families in the city.  We are directly providing case management and support to the majority of the 1,000 homeless families in Dublin and other supports to the remainder of this group.  With funding from Tusla, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities, we are also providing children's supports to families which need them.  We also do specialised work on young people, particularly those leaving care, and on Housing First, which is very topical.</p> <p>  Much of what we say is drawn from the experiences of the family housing action team and front-line staff working with families.  This is augmented by the work we do in research and policy, an area in which Ms Connolly works.  We are trying to bring both areas together, which involves a large amount of analysis, figures and so forth.  Before addressing these matters, it is important to remind everyone that behind every number is a family, parent or parents struggling to survive in the circumstances in which they find themselves.  These families are trying to raise their children and they worry about their children's future.  This is a humanitarian problem and while we must use our brains and statistics when trying to address it, we must never lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with an issue that is fundamentally wrong and should not be allowed in society.  I know everyone shares that view.</p> <p>  In our submission, we have provided information on what we know about homelessness.  Of the 1,200 families experiencing homelessness, the overwhelming majority are in Dublin.  While the number of homeless families outside Dublin has increased recently, the increase in the number of homeless families in Dublin has slowed down.  This has been driven by a number of factors which we can discuss if members wish to explore them.</p> <p>  I understand, however, that the focus of the joint committee is to explore how homelessness is impacting on lone parents.  The official figures and our experience shows that 65% of families in emergency accommodation are lone parent families.  However, as we heard, lone parent families account for approximately one quarter of families in the general population.  It is clear, therefore, that the problem of family homelessness is falling disproportionately on lone parents.  Why is this the case and what is causing this?  In our submission, we outline a little of what we know in general about family homelessness, which is important.  We know that most families living in emergency accommodation had their last secure home in the private rented sector.  As yet, we have seen virtually no families who were previously owner-occupiers, although we all live in fear of this happening.</p> <p>  As I have stated previously at meetings of Oireachtas committees, it must be acknowledged that this is not a phenomenon but demonstrates that the policies being implemented by successive Governments to prevent owner-occupiers entering homelessness have been successful and, therefore, should be continued.  A similar concern should be extended to other groups because it is not an accident that families who were owner-occupiers have not ended up in homeless services, although some may yet do so.</p><p>There is a broad range of things driving those who had lived in the private rented sector out.  These include rising rent levels and an inability to meet rising rents, either because rent supplement was not increased for a long period of time or because wages were too low, and the fact that working parents are being seen in emergency accommodation now illustrates this.  A part of the picture that has really been growing over the last while, and we have raised this elsewhere and people will be familiar with it, is the increasing phenomenon of landlords selling up or using their accommodation for their own family.</p><p> There is also an identifiable group that is very much harder to put a proportion on.  This is new family formations where people, usually a very young parent or parents with very young children, have been living in their family home and have attempted to set up an independent home but have failed to do so because of rental issues and so on.  We are not going to put a percentage on this group because there has not been enough work done on it, but it is definitely there.  There are solutions to it, which are different from the ones to the general housing situation, but which have not been adequately applied.</p><p> We are inevitably, and correctly, focused on the current temporary problem of economic homelessness.  The old problem, the endemic problem, of homeless caused by social causes, mental health issues, domestic violence in the case of families, in particular, addiction issues and all those other causes, is still there.  One of the serious things we need to guard against in the current crisis is that we do not turn our eye away from those continuing social problems because we are so concerned with this issue.  If we do not address them, when we come to the end of the economic problem whenever that might be, and the sooner the better, we will find ourselves with a substantial number of individuals and families who have been homeless for very long periods of time and who have not had their underlying social issues addressed, because we have been looking elsewhere.  As a civilised and wealth society we have to be capable of doing several things at once.</p><p> The points I made so far are true of all families.  Why then are we finding such a high proportion of lone parent families being affected?  The first and most obvious thing, and it has already been referred to by One Family, is that all the evidence shows that there is a higher risk of deprivation and poverty among lone parent families.  Inevitably when all the factors which are driving homelessness are related to deprivation and poverty, they are going to fall more heavily on those families.  We should not be surprised that is the case.  Other factors which would appear indiscriminate such as landlords selling up, and where that is to do with the nature of the landlord rather than the nature of the tenant, seem to fall equally on lone parents and one-parent families.  Before an individual family enters homeless services there is a period of time where it tries to deal with the crisis that has arisen.  It is very easy to understand why, when faced with an eviction notice lasting a number of months, a two-parent family might find it easier to find alternative accommodation than a one-parent family.  Even as a result of evictions, the flow into homelessness which is being seen is primarily impacting on lone parent families. </p><p> I have also mentioned new family formations.  I will talk a bit more about domestic violence as a cause.  We find in our data and in the front-line experiences of our staff that domestic violence is an immediate cause of homelessness for a significant number of families.  Inevitably those families are going to emerge as one-parent families in emergency accommodation, but we are only seeing part of the picture.  The primary response to that issue is through the Tusla-funded domestic violence services.  It is not anybody's fault, but it should be noted that the way that the data are collected is a problem.  The data Tusla-funded domestic violence services collect, and in these cases the families are just as homeless as the ones in the hotels, are not aggregated and we do not get an overall picture.  As a result, we might have an underestimation of the extent to which domestic violence and family breakdown are causes of homelessness.  That needs to be watched quite closely because it is an important issue.  It is not unrelated to the economic issues.</p><p>There is an evident rise in family tensions and domestic violence during periods of economic tension.  This in absolutely no way justifies it; it is simply an observation.  They are not unrelated but we are not getting the full picture when we look just at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's statistics in that regard.  The experience of emergency accommodation is tough for every family but it is additionally tough for lone parents.  The sorts of issues of which people are particularly aware and which are very high on the agenda are access to education and parents needing to bring their children long distances to schools across the city.  Obviously that is going to be more difficult if there is only one parent.  Access to food also presents a difficulty, for example, where some emergency accommodation facilities have perfectly reasonable rules that children cannot be in the kitchen or left on their own in their room.  Those two perfectly reasonable rules end up putting the lone parent into an impossible position.  These are just examples.  If the committee wants further examples Ms O'Reilly can provide more detail of the sorts of issues on the ground.</p><p> In this context, while there is a lot to complain about and much more needs to be done, it is really important to recognise what is being done.  We specifically reference the actions such as action 1.5 in Rebuilding Ireland and the work of the Departments of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and Children and Youth Affairs with which we worked closely in supporting last years' pilot scheme for travel to school costs and the innovative scheme that makes sure all families in emergency accommodation can have the same access to early childhood education that other families have.  To allow that same access, one needs to have specific rules because of the difficulties faced.  It needs to be said that Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are involved in that and they work closely with us to try to understand what those changes need to be and in putting them in place.  That is a very positive thing.</p><p> We outlined some of the research we are doing in the area and I will sum up the sort of things that need to be done.  This is a policy committee and obviously the members need to understand the problems but it also wants to change things for the better.  Most of the things that need to be done for one-parent families who are homeless are the same things that need to be done with family homelessness - for everybody - and with lone-parent families in general.  There is a limited amount of stuff that is specific to this group.  It is being hit from both sides and it must be tackled at the roots.  For prevention, we emphasise the reform of the private rental sector in order that it is a stable and secure place for people to live, the introduction of family mediation services to be piloted and explored and proposals to explore whether some of those newly formed families could actually go back to live where they were previously for a time, rather than living in emergency accommodation.  There is also a need for more effective advice and information.  During the year we ran - with the Department of Social Protection and using a Focus Ireland letterhead - a pilot programme where it sent out a letter to everybody on rent supplement in the Dublin 15 area.  We are currently writing up the impact of that.  It is very positive and proves that we can reach people who are not using the existing services.  This is not a criticism of those services; it is just that people are not aware of them.  It also proved that one can do something if one can get in early enough to turn that around.  It targeted the vulnerable groups in that we knew where they were living in the private rented sector.  Supporting people out of homelessness is around the two issues of building social housing much faster in communities where people want to live and prioritising the allocation of that to longer-term homeless families.  One can build and take people from the top of the waiting list while leaving families in the homeless accommodation until their lives are completely blighted or one can see these families as the priority in delivering housing.  At the moment we are not doing that and we can go into that in more detail.  Ireland is not prioritising homeless families for social housing in the way we should be doing, and the previous Government did.  Rent supplement rates and HAP rates remain crucial.  We also believe there should be additional policing of the rules that were brought in regarding landlords, discrimination and what actually happens when a person is evicted.  These are areas that should be explored more.</p><p>We know that one-parent families are more likely to be in homeless accommodation, but we do not know if they are more likely to stay there.  In this crisis we need to concentrate more on how long families find themselves stuck in that situation and making sure certain groups or families will not be forgotten because so many new families are finding themselves homeless.  The evidence suggests one-parent families are not more likely to remain in such accommodation because we are supporting a larger proportion of them, but we need much closer data to see where the problems are arising.  Several families have told us the changes to the one-parent family payment and the seven year shift to the new transitional payment triggered their homelessness.  We are not saying that is true but people believe it is.  If I were in the Department of Social Protection, I would be spending a relatively small amount of money to find out if there is a glitch which is causing this problem in order to rectify it.  We think that should be done.  </p><p> In general, a great deal of money is spent on programmes for homeless persons and those living in poverty but very little is spent to find out which of them work.  We should be directing a relatively small amount at finding out which policies are successful and which are failing in order that we can be more successful and do not leave it to organisations such as Focus Ireland and One Family to carry out that research.</p></speech>

Several groups have already come to present their perspectives on lone parent families and the impact of the changes introduced in 2015.</p> <p>  Both submissions were excellent and contained very useful information.  One Family refers to a universal payment to assist the poorest children and increasing the qualified child payment.  My party has costed that measure and wanted to see a &euro;5 increase, from &euro;29.80 to &euro;34.80, which would have cost &euro;98.6 million in 2017.  We have yet to obtain further costings, but the proposal would be worth considering.</p> <p>  We see the impact of the cuts in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  My party has also focused on that targeted payment.  In its presentation the Society of St. Vincent de Paul outlined graphically how the demand on its services had risen substantially when the cuts were implemented.  The Department gave us the cost of restoring the rate at just over &euro;14 million.  That would represent an increase of &euro;50.  We want to increase the allowance over a couple of budgets.  I concur with the recommendations made. </p> <p>  The payment of child maintenance has created huge difficulties.  We heard a presentation by Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK, in which it outlined the difficulties the current set-up was causing for lone parents.</p><p>If the payment is not paid over it impacts on the family.  Other countries have been mentioned.  Has thought been given to what happens in other countries?  In the UK and the North of Ireland they have the Child Maintenance Service, where the issue is completely taken away from the parent.  That service chases down the other parent, if the address of the second parent is not known.  It also works out maintenance rates, which are re-evaluated on an annual basis.  There are some good models, and I am wondering if any specific models have been looked at.  I am interested in any views on that.</p><p> In regard to Focus Ireland, the information supplied was very useful and I thank Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Allen for coming in.  A figure which jumped out at me was that 65% of homeless people are lone parent families.  That certainly set off alarm bells in my head.  I had not heard that figure before.  It is very frightening.  I would be interested to hear any views on that.  There has been a lot of talk recently about rents and rent certainty, and changes have been made.  I am interested in hearing any views on the changes that have been brought in.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, have been looking for real rent certainty and index linking any increases to rent.  Unfortunately, that was not agreed to but I would be interested in hearing any views on that and any recommendations the witnesses have.  I know that is outside the scope of this committee, but I am interested in hearing more on that.</p></speech>

As my colleague said, they were very enlightening, with a lot of food for thought.  One of the things which jumped out at me and which was mentioned by Ms Maher and Mr. Allen was the complexity of the system in terms of lone parents knowing what services and what benefits and supports are available.  There is no streamlined system, and what a person is entitled to in the event that he or she requires access to services is not advertised enough.  That is something the committee could think about, and perhaps consider ways to streamline the benefit process.</p> <p>  Another issue I am interested in from a legal point of view is in regard to maintenance, and Ms Kiernan mentioned that some governments provide universal maintenance and then recoup that money from the parents, usually the father.  I understand that Finland has a system like that which works well, and it is quite aggressive in pursuing payments.  It helps women in ensuring that they have a decent maintenance provision.</p> <p>  Some of us come from constituencies in Dublin and know the problems lone parents face in terms of access to low paid employment.  It particularly affects my constituency, Dublin South Central, which includes Dublin 12.  Demographically we have one of the highest percentages of lone parents in the country, and I meet a lot of women who are in part-time employment, in jobs which pay just above the minimum wage, and they are not able to get access to education which would allow them to get highly skilled jobs to move themselves to the next bracket.  As a committee, it should be a priority to get people from the minimum wage bracket into the proper living wage bracket.</p><p>It is a debate we need to have at this committee, as well as focusing on the effects of housing and education.  As Ms Maher said, educational supports are one of the most important issues for lone parents, and that links into child care provision.  It is a difficult topic but I am pleased to have the delegates' input.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Brady that the new rent-certainty measures must be affecting the delegates' clients directly.  I have already had calls from constituents whose landlords increased their rent immediately following the implementation of those measures.  It seems a lot of letters were sent out just before Christmas by various landlords.  Have the witnesses been fielding similar calls from lone parents?</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Allen that we must place a greater emphasis on what does and does not work.  Sometimes there is a hesitancy around doing that level of research because people are frightened they will get clipped around the ears if the report does not come out exactly as they might want.  Mr. Allen referred to the last Government's focus on prioritising social housing.  I saw an unintentional consequence of that in the inner city whereby it created a pull to homelessness, with people becoming homeless sooner than needed to be the case.  There is a need for careful balancing in any provision and ongoing reviews to ensure there are no such intended consequences to a particular initiative.</p> <p>  In a report on the back to education scheme, the ESRI has found that people who go into employment rather than education come out of poverty sooner.  I am interested in the witnesses' insight on this in respect of their client base.  During the Christmas break, I worked out that I interacted with 700 to 800 lone parents last year.  We see a wide spectrum in terms of people's circumstances, how the various interventions and working and whether any unintentional consequences are arising.  The single most beneficial programme I have seen is the early education intervention, which offers supports to preschool children.  I seen many case of intergenerational lone parenting, with three generations having the same outcome, even where there has been access to the back to education initiative.  In one case, a person obtained good qualifications but never went on to practise as an accountant.  There are a lot of interventions in operation but we continue to see the same outcome within family groups.</p> <p>  What is Mr. Allen's view on the need to build automatic reviews into policy decisions?  One of the positive things the Department of Social Protection did in respect of the Gender Recognition Act was to include a provision that a review of the legislation be conducted after a year.  Sometimes it takes much longer to see how a particular provision is working.  I have always considered the back to education scheme to be a very long-term initiative which might not show benefits for families for ten to 15 years.  As I said, however, the ESRI report indicates that the most positive impact on a family arises where the head of household goes into work.</p><p>This has, by far, a more positive impact than that person going back to education.  I would have thought the opposite.  I would have expected lone parents to be on a relatively low level of income and that there would not be a positive outcome for them.  </p><p> I very much like the idea of building in an automatic review.  However, expecting and accepting that we may not get the answers we like is, as Roosevelt used to say, a case of trying something, hoping it works and doing the research and, if it does not work, moving on and trying something else.  We are always too frightened to make mistakes and that stops us from trying new ideas.</p><p> I thank the witnesses.  I had the opportunity to work with many of them previously.  One of the most challenging things we have to try to target is to break down intergenerational poverty through children.  From my small amount of research I have carried out, I know that early intervention at preschool level has, by some distance, the most positive impact.</p></speech>

Most parents would rather have a relative or childminder look after their children.  Child care providers are very low down the list for the people to whom I refer.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has started to examine the possibility of having on-site child care facilities in primary schools, where children would already feel safe and secure in the environment.  Most parents already have good support networks with each other in that environment.  A number of schools across Dublin - I do not know about rural areas - already provide such services.  My children's school started a pilot scheme this year.  It is a very small school and the service is a lot cheaper than the fees charged by child care providers.  The underlying factor is that there is already a network of support in place for pupils and parents in the school.</p> <p>  I fully recognise that there were cuts in 2012.  The circumstances were very difficult and difficult cuts had to happen across the board in recent years.  Thankfully, while the increases are small, we are starting to rebuild.  The Department of Education and Skills added &euro;160 million to its budget this year to directly target the disadvantaged sectors of society and individuals who find it very difficult to get back into education.  Lone parents come under that umbrella and a total of &euro;8.5 million for maintenance grants is being provided this year and next year for parents to get back into education.  I do not know how we can get the message out so that people know that such schemes are available.</p> <p>  I welcome the increase in funding for school meals.  I know this funding needs to be increased further and the Minister wants to do that this year.  We are building on the funding each year.  Deputy Brady mentioned a costing carried out by Sinn F&eacute;in which indicated that an extra &euro;5 in payments would total &euro;98.6 million.  What would we cut in order to get &euro;98.6 million into the sector?  Our homeless budget for this year is &euro;98 million, up from &euro;70 million last year.  We can calculate figures all we want but in order to come up with additional moneys in a particular area, we often have to make cuts elsewhere.</p> <p>  I want to touch on couple of points mentioned by Mr. Allen.  He referred to the reform of the rental sector.  I do not want to go into too much detail on the housing sector but I do want to touch on what he mentioned.  The planning legislation that was passed before Christmas will commence shortly.  It will introduce rental pressurised zones.  I know Mr. Allen is very aware of what is contained in the legislation, but the underlying issue is supply.  The commencement orders for planning applications and planning permissions are well up on last year.  We are starting to see a lot more cranes on the horizon.  Houses are starting to come back on the market, but all of us in this room know that one cannot build a house overnight.  Whether people want to call them developers, builders or other names, one has to give them certainty and encourage them back into the market.</p><p>The help to buy scheme will do that.  I always say it is like a jigsaw, and that there are many pieces that have to come together in order for something to work.  Often that takes time and it is like building a house.  It takes six to nine months to build a house.  We are starting to see that work come to fruition now.  Supply is the underlying issue here with people who find that they are homeless.</p><p> In the private rental sector, we will give them more certainty now that their rent cannot increase above market value or above 4% per annum.  Reform is starting to happen in the rental sector.  I want the witnesses to clarify what they mean in regard to individuals who find that they have become homeless not now going to the top of the social housing list.  Does this mean that they do not get a council house?  The whole purpose of emergency accommodation is that that support and those services are available to those families who need it, including the centre that just opened recently.  It is a transition centre for 32 families.  We all recognise that children cannot do their homework on a bed, and that one family is too many to find themselves homeless.  That particular centre has homework rooms, dining rooms, cr&egrave;che facilities, and it is supposed to assist in transition.  It is a way to get them into sustainable long-term accommodation, whether that is in the private rental sector, or a council house.  Do the witnesses mean that they only want them to get a council house?  I want clarification.  To me, a family wants security of tenure, certainty, and a home.  Whatever that home is, they want to feel safe and have certainty for their family in that home.  I agree with Senator Humphreys on that one.</p><p> We are accelerating the building of social housing, which comes back to supply as well.  That planning Bill will help the private sector as well, and to get Part V accommodation back on the market.  We are tripling the target for Housing First.  There is an increase from the Department of Health for the services provided by Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon Community and so on.  Choice-based letting has been piloted and rolled out in other county council areas and we are strengthening the Residential Tenancies Board, not only for landlords, but also for tenants.  We are strengthening tenants' rights and seeking to give them the information that they need.  There is a lot of reform happening in the private rental sector.</p><p> We are not anywhere near where we need to be and I fully recognise that, but as I said, it is a case of many pieces of a jigsaw that have to come together.  That takes time.  We need more than a year to do that.  They are just a couple points.  I might come back in.</p></speech>

I do not want to reiterate the points made but Focus Ireland made a very specific point, which the committee was really taken with, and Deputy Brady referred to it.  At the outset, we were told that 25% of families are one parent families, whereas 65% of homeless families are one parent families.  That is rather disproportionate to the general population.  A specific piece of work needs to be done to identify what the causes are.  There is more than one cause and I acknowledge that.  If we are to try to address a specific problem, we probably need to know as much as possible, because there is a cohort of people who need to be helped.</p> <p>  We all have anecdotal evidence of the constituents we meet.  I met a lone parent family which had become homeless.  However, 18 months ago, it was not a lone parent family.  There was a relationship break-up and there was transitional accommodation.  Their situation eventually fell apart for a whole range of reasons.  The relationship break-up may have been as a result of economic stresses and pressures.  These situations are very complex.  One may see a lone parent family today, but a short time ago that may not have been the case.  Why is there that disproportionate 65% figure?  We really need to understand that in more detail if we are to try to prevent such situations.</p> <p>  The prevention of people becoming homeless is one of the things that Mr. Allen and other people working with the homeless have always emphasised, and I fully support that.  This is a specific cohort of people who are much more vulnerable, much more at risk, and are becoming homeless.  We need to know more about that.  </p> <p>  I thank One Family for its presentation, which was quite specific and detailed.  It rightly referred back to the changes made in 2012, which saw the Department of Social Protection begin to progressively introduce measures to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce.  That is the policy position, whether or not one agrees with it, and what flows from that is important.</p><p>Representatives of the Department of Social Protection appeared before the committee some time later in 2016 because there had been an immediate impact, but there was also the question of whether we were striving to achieve the longer term objective.  The representatives made the point that it would take several years to quantify the impact of the reforms.  However, the early indications were that by the end of 2015 more than 3,000 lone parents had become new entrants to the family income supplement scheme.  That was an indication that those included in that group had increased the level of their employment participation.</p><p> There are two elements I want to address.  On the research carried out and analysis made of the longer term benefits, the delegates have rightly acknowledged what happened in year one and so forth, but are we on the road towards achieving the longer term objective announced by the Department?  What is the delegates' view of its interim figure of 3,000 at the end of 2015?  Is it a meaningful figure?  </p><p> Deputy John Brady indicated that he might have further questions, but I will let the delegates address those questions first.  We will start with One Family.</p></speech>

I will take some of the questions, while the others will be taken by Ms Maher who is more expert on education and employment issues.  </p> <p>  I will start with the Chairman's question on the longer term impacts of the cuts and reforms.  As we acknowledged, the policy intention was to support lone parents in moving into employment and thereby out of poverty and dependence on social welfare payments.  At the time, the various supports needed were not available because of the lack of jobs and a departmental plan or owing to the fact that others who should have been taking action were not doing so.</p> <p>  We are aware that more people are in receipt of family income supplement.  We welcome this.  What we do not know - the review of the reforms taking place this year may tell us - are the longer term impacts.  Generally, we hear from people when they are having problems.  We sometimes know when things are working out for the better, but we do not always know the full position.</p> <p>  Many supports are needed.  The child care provision is only starting and it will be a few years before we will be able to see if it is working for families.  We also know that many families found it very difficult to recover in the short term after their payments had been cut.  We are now hearing more about people who are considering entering part-time or full-time employment because it appears there are more jobs available.  That is helping to lift some people, but they are also finding it difficult to balance the costs, particularly if they are in the private rented sector, in which we know the position is extraordinarily difficult.  There are always these difficulties and one difficulty is often followed by another.  The reality for a parent is that while one policy may help, something else means that work does not pay.  We are looking to have an overall view of the customer, the parent, to make work pay for him or her in all arenas.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the point made about parental separation and the link with homelessness.  It has been documented in the figures, although it is broader than parental separation; it is family separation.  The trauma when parents separate is massive and inevitably leads to increased levels of poverty, decreased levels of employment and emotional difficulties.  We obtained a good deal of information in the recent national survey we conducted of shared parenting.  One parent commented that she would like to see a national agency to deal with the consequences of separation.  Someone who is separating has nowhere to go to learn how he or she can support himself or herself and his or her family financially, emotionally and physically throughout the long, arduous process of separation which is much longer in Ireland than in other countries.</p><p>It takes four years before one can think about getting a divorce.  It is a difficult process and people fall through the cracks all the time, so I would welcome research to examine why there are more one-parent families in homeless accommodation.  Let us look at the impact of separation on that as well.</p><p> As I mentioned in the presentation, we have been having discussions with officials from the Department of Social Protection on maintenance and my understanding is that they are looking at that.  The country I was thinking of that takes more responsibility concerning that is Sweden.  Senator Ardagh also mentioned Finland.  It is basically done to prevent child poverty.  I have not looked at this recently, but previously the UK's Child Support Agency was not very successful in doing this, and it cost a lot of money.  Therefore, I think there is work to be done - whether by us, the Department or somebody else - to look at good models in other countries to see what works well to prevent child poverty and what is affordable for the State to do in Ireland because it is a big and incredibly complex issue.</p><p> Our main concern about child care is that it needs to include out-of-school care.  A person on their own may need support for someone to mind their child before school as well as after school.  People often do shift work, so how can that happen if they are parenting on their own?  How can they be supported?  While we welcome the new single affordable child care programme, we also have concerns about it.</p><p> Schools are an obvious facility that could be used, but at the moment there does not seem to be any lever.  In fact, I am aware of after-school facilities in a number of schools which are closing because the boards of management have decided to do that.  Anything the Department of Education and Skills or anyone else can do to ensure the provision of high-quality, child-centred, out-of-school care is welcome.  It is needed to help lone parents to participate in society.</p><p> I will ask Ms Maher to comment on the education and employment question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Valerie Maher" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#R00200"><p>Senator Ardagh said there was a high proportion of lone parents in her constituency of Dublin 12.  They found that when working in minimum wage jobs, it was difficult for them to access education to allow them to increase their earning potential.  It backs up our point that, particularly for someone on the minimum wage who might be accessing the family income supplement, they cannot currently access other educational supports such as the back-to-education allowance because it is not one of the qualifying payments for that scheme.  Therefore, some people in minimum wage jobs are stuck there and cannot improve their earning potential because they cannot access education.</p> <p>  Senator Humphreys referred specifically to the ESRI report on outcomes of the back-to-education allowance.  The report said that work is better at reducing poverty than for people who try to access employment after a back-to-education scheme.  Since that report was written, housing costs have increased significantly.  I wonder, therefore, if being in work still reduces poverty when the majority of one's wages go on housing and child care?  An update on that report might be beneficial because there has been such a significant increase in housing costs.</p> <p>  The ability for work to reduce poverty is dependent on earnings.  It would depend on how much a person is able to earn and whether work pays in that context, as well as the stability of that work and whether a person is in precarious employment.</p> <p>  Not all lone parents in education are in receipt of the back-to-education allowance.  In particular, if they are not in receipt of rent supplement it means they can stay on their jobseeker's transition or one-parent family payment and still be in full-time education.  The report does not show the full picture.  That is because there may be lone parents who have access to education and who have progressed into employment whom that report will not have captured.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Senator Humphreys' point, which is a fair one, that just because a report says something we do not like, it does not mean we should not take it on board and allow that to inform our policy stances and, indeed, policy responses from Government.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned targeted versus universal payments.</p><p>I took from what the Deputy said that he supports us in that regard.  It is certainly helpful for us to see some of the costings for it.  The rationale for it is that, in the context of limited resources, we would like to see what resources are being targeted at the poorest children.  That is why we say the qualified child increase should be targeted at the poorest families, even if it is only a short term, interim measure in the context of the recession and specifically the financial impact that reforms have had on lone parent families.  Can we target the limited resources available to the Government at these families to alleviate some of the negative impacts they have suffered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#S00200"><p>I will answer some of the questions and then I will ask Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly to talk a bit about how it looks on the front line.  On the point made by the Chairman, it is a really important way of looking at the issue.  Some families are one parent families from the very beginning and others arrive at it as a result of some form of crisis such as a death or relationship breakdown.  It is our understanding of homelessness that these sort of crises increase the risk of other things going wrong.  In the current housing situation where housing is very hard to find, it is not surprising that families getting into these crises find themselves getting into housing problems as well and that pushes us back.  What more can we do to prevent homelessness at that point?  There is a clear risk for many households in which there would not have been a risk before who necessarily do not go to agencies to avoid homelessness.  Focus Ireland is doing a lot of work on this.  Many of the people who are currently facing homelessness would not go down to the coffee shop to look for advice because they associate it with a different type of homelessness and something that is nothing to do with them.  They do not do anything until it is too late.  These are really important issues that need to be explored.</p> <p>  The central sets of questions that were asked about rent certainty, the private rental sector and social housing are very much related to each other.  From where we are sitting, they are the two solutions to the problem.  In homeless organisations and organisations for people who are vulnerable in the housing market, there has always been a view that there should be more certainty about rents.  That really ramped up about three or four years ago when we began to see individuals and families on rent supplement unable to pay their rent.  The Department of Social Protection at the time took the view that increasing rent supplement would further push up rents.  We do not think the evidence was there for that but the Department did and that was its policy.  The obvious answer to the Department's concern was that we cannot just leave people out there to hang and become homeless.  If that was the problem, it needed to introduce some form of rent control.  We have been arguing that now for several years.  It is very welcome that there is now a form of rent certainty.  It is a step in the right direction but it is an unusual version of it.</p> <p>  To some extent, the truth will be in the telling.  One can make certain observations about it, even from what we already know.  It uses this idea of the pressurised areas, which is present in Scottish legislation.  It has never actually been enacted in Scottish legislation and we do not know how it works.  There is obviously a need to do those things quickly because, as the Deputy and Senator have said, rent is increased when people know what is coming down the track.  That is the problem with that model.  The other important thing to say is that 4% is a fairly substantial increase compared to any other time in our history.  That should automatically be triggering the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to do something about rent supplement and HAP thresholds and to say they must do that.  If the Department of Social Protection keeps the same position either by saying it will only increase rent supplement every three years or through some undefined policy, it will be disastrous.  That should now be part of the picture.  </p> <p>  The point of the private rental sector strategy is that all these different bits of the jigsaw need to be done together.  What came out of the process is that the Minister put the various bits of the jigsaw in various different committees again.  I find it very hard to see how the review group on taxation of the private rented sector can link with issues about security in the private rented sector because the whole point is the trade-off between them.  The whole point is it is meant to be a strategy in which there is a trade-off between that bit and the next bit.</p><p>Putting them all into different committees, which is what the Minister essentially did, is problematic.  Something was lost in that which should not have been lost.  The most important document on the private rented sector in the past ten years or perhaps longer was the NESC document.  It has been forgotten and has not been mentioned in the strategy.  If it is lost, we are lost because it is not possible to get a solution to housing without an effective private rented sector in a modern economy.</p><p> We also cannot get a solution to housing and homelessness without an effective social housing sector.  I accept what Senator Humphreys said about what many councillors anecdotally said about the introduction of the policy with 50% of social housing allocations in Dublin going to homeless and other vulnerable groups and 25% in other cities.  There was a lot of talk of that.  The data do not support that.  The number of families becoming homeless over the period of time that policy existed increased.  When that policy was in place, there was no point at which it suddenly began to increase faster.  When the policy was removed, it did not start to decline.</p><p> I do not dismiss anecdotal information, which needs to be borne in mind as part of the picture.  However, if we end up believing that policy created homelessness, it is necessary to believe that Dublin families are uniquely inclined to respond to such incentives.  There was no increase in family homelessness in Limerick even though it got a substantial increase.  There was no increase in family homelessness in Cork until it was removed.  A lot of work is being done on this, in particular an important study in New York, which found it had a slight pull factor of bringing families into homelessness when they had this allocation, but it was a much more effective push-out factor and it was worth taking the small pull in without the out.</p><p> The Housing Agency did draw up a report.  Taking on board what the Chairman said about being careful in what I say about outside organisations - I have the utmost respect for the Housing Agency and its research function - this report is not up to standard.  The only thing it mentions about this issue, about which the Senator is rightly concerned, is to state there is emerging evidence.  The evidence never emerged and the emerging evidence was hearsay.  The concern that the Senator and councillors had about that are legitimate and should have been addressed in a serious piece of work before the policy was changed, rather than being based on things that had been heard.</p><p> We have stated that 0.1% of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government budget should be spent on research - of course, it is not doing it.  We take the opportunity today to extend that suggestion to the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> I would like to come back and sum up, but first I ask Ms O'Reilly to speak about these experiences on the front line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#T00200"><p>Regarding the rent certainty measures, working on the front line I see a broad range of experiences from families coming in from the private rental sector.  We welcome many of the measures introduced, which were very positive, but they were too late.  By the time the amendments came in in 2015, rents were almost at the 2007 peak.  By the time the increases came in in June 2016, they had surpassed the peaks we had in the boom.  Unfortunately, they were just a little bit too late for those who had already entered homelessness.  That resulted in huge mistrust among people in the homeless sector and huge anxiety about re-entering the private rental sector.  There are no guarantees for tenants in private rented housing even with all the changes and that is because it is in a market.</p> <p>  I often meet families who ask me if they will be back in a hotel room in two or three years' time.  I tell them about the changes and make sure they know about the legislation that was introduced and what protections are available to them.  They often point out that they did everything right the previous time.  They point out that the landlord could evict them if he wants to sell the house.  I cannot lie to them.  I point out that is a possibility, but if it happens they should contact the council or Focus Ireland to get help with that.  Ultimately there are no guarantees.  We will probably not see the outcome of the two-year freeze on the rent until this time next year.  It has been said that many landlords front-loaded when that was about to come in.</p> <p>  The rental measures do not address discrimination in the market.</p><p>That is something I would see from working at the front line with families, particularly one-parent families, namely, they are generally more discriminated against.  Again, that is anecdotal and I do not know if there is anything out there to show it is the case.  It is already hard to go to a viewing for a homeless person, for someone on a social welfare payment or for someone on a lower income, and there are certainly many families who are in some type of employment.  However, those arriving as a one-parent family know they are at the end of the list and that the landlords will look at others before looking at them.  Unfortunately, the measures do not address the discrimination that exists in the market.</p><p> Many of the people we work with are not aware of these changes, what they really mean for them on the ground or what they can do about them.   There is an imbalance of power in a landlord-tenant relationship, no matter what one's income or background, and that imbalance is not just among people on low incomes or of lower education.  Therefore, to assert their rights and to know what they can do about it can be very difficult.  Threshold is available and is one of he mainstays in providing that type of service.  The RTB is at the next level but many people will not go that far because they are just keen to find something and move on.  Maybe they will go back to family or friends in the hope that they will get back into the rental market but, because the rental market has become very tight, unfortunately, that often does not pan out and they find themselves in homelessness.  While the changes were very welcome and positive, perhaps they are a little too late.  As Mr. Allen said, they were perhaps not done in a timely fashion along with many of the other measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#U00200"><p>To sum up, while this can be a very depressing subject, rightly so, it is important to remember that the number of homeless families is not static.  Focus Ireland and other organisations are supporting families out of homelessness every day, and we supported more families out of homelessness last month than we had done in any previous month, and that has been building up over time.  Since the allocations of the social housing directive were removed, the shift has been very much away from social housing, the proportion of social housing exits has fallen and the number in the private rented sector has increased.  Our view is that we would be now seeing a real decline in family homelessness if we had both of those tools available to us.</p> <p>  In the last month, Focus Ireland supported some 45 families out of homelessness into secure housing.  Half of those went to social housing, whether from approved housing bodies or local authorities, and the other half went to the private rented sector with the support of homeless HAP.  One of the unremarked things about the rent certainty provision, and it is one of the positive elements in most respects, is that most proposals on rent certainty suggested that when a place becomes empty and a new tenant comes in, the landlords can just go back to the market price.  They cannot do that under the current provision and that will help to keep overall rents in control, which is positive.  However, it removes one of the things Ms O'Reilly was referring to, namely, under the old system, for families and households who were not seen as good tenants by landlords, we were buying them back into the market due to the fact homeless HAP can put a premium on them.  It should not have to do that but it is exactly the same as we do in the labour market, where, if somebody is long-term unemployed, we give employers a subsidy to take them.  In this way, we pay rents slightly above the going rate to get somebody out of homeless accommodation and back into rented accommodation.  That is now closed off to us because of this measure.  There may be other ways we will get around that but it is an unintended consequence of closing that off.  If we could close that out, we might begin to see a significant decline in exits.  That is a fear and something we need to address rather than an alarmist statement.</p> <p>  Deputy Bailey made a point about housing supply.  All I would add is that when we do not have enough supply, there is a distributional issue as to who gets to carry the burden of this problem.  At the moment we are quite clearly putting it on poor families, lone-parent families and the vulnerable - they are carrying the burden.  I would warn that, given the new housing units and the approach in Rebuilding Ireland, as we have said before, there is a real fear that what is being done means a new parallel homeless service for families is being built up for the medium and long term.  We do not think it is a good idea to build in special provisions for such families because it is transitional accommodation.</p><p>The Irish State abolished transitional accommodation for homeless families ten years ago by consensus.  If we are moving back to thinking that people must make some sort of transition from homelessness back into a home, that is a serious step backwards.  Everybody who has made a mistake on family homelessness has essentially put into systems which warehouse homeless families for long periods of time until we get the market right.  Those families suffer, their children suffer and society suffers.  That is one interpretation of the plan in Rebuilding Ireland.  We have raised this with the Minister and the Department.  There were not further discussions.  There needs to be a specific sub-strategy on homeless families, including lone parent families, to elaborate the complexity of that issue.  This is not directly the area of concern and is more about social protection, but it is really important we say that.  Otherwise, in the future the Department of Social Protection and this committee will be dealing with the social legacies of our failure to deal with these problems at this point.</p></speech>

I hear constantly that it is not worth while for a couple to stay together and that a lone parent is financially better off.  Are there financial gains in going from partnership lone parenthood?  I am dealing with this.  This would be said to me every week.  I am asking this of One Family.  Ms Kiernan and Ms Maher probably have much more experience in this area than I have.  What is the answer?  It is a little like the old story when we were dealing with immigrants where it was claimed they left the pram at the bus stop and got another pram.  That could always be broken down by saying it was absolutely wrong and giving the facts.  How does one deal with a comment, which might be getting ingrained in a couple's minds, to the effect that they would be financially better off whereas they would not be?  What is the response to that?</p> <p>  On the unintended consequences, I agree strongly with Mr. Allen that we need that level of research because that is the only way we can identify the unintended consequences.  I was not aware of the narrow aspect to which Mr. Allen referred but it would indicate that my experience is correct because that is how it works in communities.  It is a very small level.  I see homeless people allocated accommodation in flat complexes.  Everybody who got accommodation during the emergency was nearly homeless, but it then became folklore that the only way a person could get a flat was if he or she left his or her mother or if he or she went homeless.</p> <p>  My experience with the private rental sector is that we have been able to deal with the increases in rent, especially if a person has been on rent allowance because he or she has been able to go back and try to get it dealt with one to one.  Where we have had little success is in cases where the accommodation has been sold.  That has been the real driver of homelessness.  My hobby horse is Airbnb, especially within the Dublin area.  I looked through my e-mails before the meeting started and came across an e-mail from a landlord who has just bought an apartment asking me about the regulations relating to Airbnb.  I answered him quickly asking whether the apartment had been let originally and he responded that it had been let before he purchased it.  While I accept this is a Dublin region issue, the majority of the homelessness problem is in Dublin and one of the key drivers in losing supply within the Dublin area is Airbnb.  It is a choice if we are trying to deal with the supply issue.  Do we supply the tourist market that has a negative financial impact or do we supply housing for the homeless?  I say we supply housing for the homeless and deal with the lack of hotel bedrooms in a different manner.</p> <p>  I would like to hear a little more on the Dublin 15 experiment.  Communicating information is vital to starting to deal with problems and I would ask the witnesses to expand a little on the Dublin 15 experiment.</p></speech>

In One Family we are extremely clear that there are significant costs, as I mentioned, when a family or parent separates.  One is considering two dwellings, two family homes, ideally, where children can spend time with each parent, although this is generally not available.  One is considering the costs and the legal and emotional supports required to go through a separation.  There may be some very specific circumstances in which both parents are reliant on social welfare and perhaps have other places where they can live so that they are not looking for rent supplement or social housing and each qualifies for a full social welfare payment.  I suggest that these cases are in the minority and that where people are reliant on accommodation being supplemented by the State, it will be extraordinarily difficult.  We would be more than happy to chat on our helpline to the people to whom Senator Humphreys refers and help them think through the reality of what they propose.  I would find it disappointing to think that any parent would be that cynical because that is not our experience.  People experience huge levels of trauma when they separate.  They do not do so lightly.  In fact, they frequently need to live together for long periods because they cannot afford to separate, which puts huge pressure on their families and children.</p></speech>

It was based on research we conducted last year into family homelessness.  We found that a slightly higher proportion of a cohort of 636 children we were considering had previously been residing in Dublin 15.  Based on our knowledge of prevention campaigns in other jurisdictions, we know targeted prevention campaigns are the most effective, so we decided to run a very targeted, short-run prevention campaign in Dublin 15.</p> <p>  There were two main aspects to it.  One aspect was large-scale postering in bus shelters, train stations and the Blanchardstown shopping centre.  The other aspect, and the one that was most effective, was sending out very specifically worded letters to families in receipt of rent supplement in the area.  We were lucky that the local Department of Social Protection worked with us on this.  We sent about 2,500 letters, and nearly 200 people contacted us.  We had a specific freefone line and ran one-to-one clinics in the area.  The campaign lasted about five weeks.  About 180 people contacted us.</p> <p>  It was very successful targeting in that of the people who contacted us, I think seven did not need assistance, so we got people who did need help and were at risk of homelessness.  We also got people whom we could help.  There were issues with which we could assist them, whether it was through our own advice and advocacy work or through moving them on to Threshold or other organisations.  We also found that 98% of them said the letter was the reason they contacted us, as opposed to the postering campaign.  Implicitly, people could have seen the poster campaign and it could have triggered something, but the letter was the more successful aspect.  We managed to move about 10% of the people who contacted us and who were at risk of homelessness into more stable accommodation as a result.  Some of them did move into emergency accommodation by virtue of the fact that they had received valid notices of termination and we just got to them too late.  It is worth considering how early one can prompt people to get in contact, but it was a very successful campaign overall, and the vast majority of people were very satisfied with the service and would refer others to it, so we are really happy with it.</p></speech>

It was not a huge sum.  Therefore, the cheapest thing we did was the most effective.  They were Focus Ireland-branded letters.  It was not Department of Social Protection letters that were sent out.  Decisions were made in that regard.  Staff costs accounted for the rest.</p></speech>

We are writing up a report on the campaign, and I think the Department is very interested in the outcome of it.  Our argument is that this shows this sort of targeted writing in this way is effective.  The Department's fear previously was always that if people got letters from the Department of Social Protection, they would frighten them and those people would put them in the bin.  However, the model of the Department sending out the letter, which avoids any information protection issues, but with the letter having a letterhead reading "Focus Ireland", seemed to be able to get through to people one would otherwise not have got through to.</p><p>Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is one of our sponsors, provided the funding for it. </p><p> Senator Humphrey's also spoke about Airbnb.  I agree it is a real threat.  While hotels, B&amp;Bs and others who provide accommodation are necessarily regulated, this sector is being allowed to develop unregulated, which, I imagine, is causing problems.  The Minister has said that he is going to act on the matter.  The sooner he does so, the better because with each private rented accommodation we lose, the problem increases.  The Senator also spoke about evictions.  We see eviction as a significant cause of homelessness.  We do not have hard evidence for this but the sense from our front-line services is that, primarily, landlords are selling up because of pressure from their lenders, be they vulture funds or banks.  In other words, some evictions occur because of house repossession by banks and others-----</p></speech>

We have argued - this applies in Northern Ireland and in other jurisdictions - that in the case of a property bought as a buy-to-let property, in respect of many of which tax relief was in the past obtained from the State, the players are not only the lender and the landlord, but the State, the public interest and the tenant and that as such it is entirely legitimate to provide that just because a property is being sold that it is not a reason to terminate an existing tenant.  The tenancy should continue in the same way as it does in commercial property.  Currently, we provide families with less protection than we do businesses.  The aforementioned proposal was put, by way of amendment, to the Bill but the then Government parties voted it down, the reason for which I do not know.  There might be good as to why they did so but they were not explained to us.  It is very hard to find proposals that will make a difference in this area.  There are probably only three or four such proposals, one of which I have just outlined.  If there are good reasons, which we are unaware of, why this cannot be done we ask that people be, at least, made aware of it.</p></speech>

As they will appreciate, the committee is nearing conclusion of its piece of work on lone parents.  The Department officials, as the opening witnesses, set out the issue for committee members.  The committee then heard submissions from a number of other witnesses.  Before we commence work on the drafting of our report, members would like to put some questions to the officials based on what those witnesses had to say.</p> <p>  I will first put my questions to the officials, following which I will then allow questions from members.  I understand the Department is to undertake a review of the lone-parent issue.  Perhaps the officials would set out what format that review will take, the timeframe for the review and whether it will be a quantitative review or if qualitative measures are also being reviewed.  As the committee would like to support rather than duplicate the work of the Department, perhaps the officials would provide some insight into its work in that regard.</p></speech>

I am Simonetta Ryan, assistant secretary at the Department of Social Protection, and I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Niall Egan, principal officer of working age and child income policy, Mr. Erika Klein, assistant principal officer of working age and child income policy, and Ms Fiona Ward, divisional manager of the Dublin south division.  In the course of my statement I will touch on the review that commenced last October, which is when we first appeared before the committee.  I will also update the committee on a number of other things that have happened in the interim.</p><p> My opening statement today is an update for the committee on progress made with some of the issues raised previously and the changes that have occurred affecting lone parents since our last appearance.  At that time we discussed the significant reforms to the one-parent family payment which have been under way since budget 2011 and have seen the age of the youngest child for receipt of the payment gradually reduce to seven years of age.  The committee has met several times since our appearance last October and has spoken to a variety of representative bodies in the intervening period.  I stated at our last appearance that it will take several years before the full impact of the reforms can be assessed.  That has been borne out by a number of comments since and also comments I heard today.  This is due to the fact that lone parents, on foot of the reforms, will take up education, training or employment support programmes which will take time for them to complete.</p><p> The Department has begun engaging, on a proactive and supported basis, with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years or older.  To date, more than 9,000 lone parents of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment have been selected for activation.  This is double the number of lone parents who were selected for activation by October 2016.  It is the first time the Department has actively engaged with lone parents on this scale with a view to improving their circumstances through access to education, training and employment supports.  This is a very significant step forward, which it is hoped is acknowledged by everybody, in addressing the poverty rates for these families.  More than 6,000 of those 9,000 lone parents are in the activation phase, which means that they have already been selected for activation and have been case managed, are scheduled for an engagement or are awaiting an appointment time.  The remaining 3,000 individuals have been fully case managed, which means they have met a case officer, have agreed a personal plan and are progressing with this plan, which includes moving into education and training on foot of their engagement.</p><p> Since our last appearance, the Department has continued to meet lone parent representative groups in a number of different fora.  One of the issues raised with us related to training supports for lone parents.  Some of the lone parent representative groups raised a concern with the Department about lone parents participating in education and training board, ETB, or vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, courses who were in receipt of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  Once these individuals commenced on these courses, they were transferred to a training allowance administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  The potential difficulty highlighted to us was that the rules for payment of the VTOS or ETB allowance were related to attendance at the course.  This could have resulted in a reduced payment for a lone parent where he or she could not always attend perhaps due to the ill health of their child or other unexpected circumstances.  The Department reviewed this situation internally and with the Department of Education and Skills.  On 16 November 2016, an instruction was issued to all Intreo offices to continue payment of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to lone parents undertaking such courses rather than moving them to a training allowance.</p><p> At our last appearance, my colleague, Fiona Ward, provided the committee with an update on the engagements with lone parents in her division, which includes Tallaght, including some of the customised training that had been organised.  These engagements have continued, with some very positive results.  For example, the Department&rsquo;s case officers liaised with Tallaght ETB which then developed a programme, called Pre-Employment (Return to Work), specifically tailored to lone parents on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  The course ran from October to December 2016 with 16 participants, two of whom secured employment and many of whom now wish to progress to other courses and employment.  This course will run again from February this year.  Invitations also issued to lone parents for events targeted to their needs such as a jobs week "Transitioning Back to the Workforce" information morning.  Ms Ward will be happy to provide the committee with more detail on this item today.</p><p> As the committee is aware, the Department of Education and Skills is taking the lead on a programme for Government commitment to carry out independent research on the barriers to third level education for lone parents.  The Department of Education and Skills selected researchers from NUI Maynooth to carry out this work.  Our Department has been consulted along with officials from that Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs by the researchers from NUI Maynooth.  A draft report was received and considered in late September 2016.  The Department of Education and Skills accepted at that stage that the timeframe was extremely tight for delivery of the report and that, with more time, the output would be more worthwhile.  A second draft was circulated by the Department of Education and Skills late last week and we will be reviewing that as soon as feasible.</p><p>I assure the committee that while the report was not completed within the planned timeframe, it was sufficiently progressed during 2016 to help inform relevant budget 2017 discussions.</p><p> Budget 2017 continues to build on the improvements that were implemented for lone parents in budgets 2015 and 2016 and will result in further increases in overall income for lone parents.  The measures that benefit lone parents include a &euro;5 increase in the one-parent family payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and the back to education allowance with effect from March 2017.  The budget also includes a new &euro;500 per annum cost-of-education allowance for parents, including lone parents, in receipt of the back to education allowance.  The income disregard for parents receiving the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment was increased by &euro;20 per week from &euro;90 to &euro;110 with effect from 5 January 2017, while a Christmas bonus of 85% was paid in early December.  Furthermore, the national minimum wage has increased to &euro;9.25 an hour and this may benefit some lone parents working outside the home.</p><p> The increase in the one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment income disregards that took effect from 5 January will benefit approximately 17,500 lone parents.  On foot of the measures for lone parents contained in budget 2017, a lone parent on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in his or her overall income of almost &euro;15 per week or &euro;780 per annum, from approximately &euro;332 in 2016 to &euro;347 in 2017.  This is as a result of the increase in the national minimum wage, the increase in the income disregard for this payment and the rate increase of &euro;5 per week.  Since 2015, this lone parent will have seen an increase of almost &euro;43 per week or over &euro;2,200 per annum between take home pay and State support.  A lone parent on the one-parent family payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in his or her overall income of almost &euro;16 per week or over &euro;830 per annum, from approximately &euro;338 in 2016 to &euro;354 in 2017.  This is as a result of the increase in the national minimum wage, the increase in the income disregard for this payment and the rate increase of &euro;5 per week.</p><p> A social impact assessment using the ESRI's simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model on a non-indexed basis of the social welfare budget package finds that people who are in the lower-income quintile gain the most from budget 2017 measures.  This includes lone parents.  The ESRI recognises explicitly that this was as a result of the inclusion of the weekly rate increase for working-age rates of payment.  In the case of lone parents, the Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of the impact of budget 2017 shows an increase of 1.2% for working lone parents and 4.5% for those who are not working.  This represents a cumulative increase across budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 of 4% for working lone parents and 6.9% for lone parents who are not working, which is substantially above the cumulative gain for average households of 3.3%.  This shows definite progress with the commitment to reducing poverty for lone parents and their families.</p><p> The single affordable child care scheme being provided by the Government will also significantly improve the provision and cost of child care for lone parents and is a step-change in State support for child care in Ireland.  This will assist lone parents in low-income employment.  The Department is contributing to the work underway in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this new scheme.</p><p> Separate to the specific measures introduced in the budget, the committee will be aware that as part of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, the Minister for Social Protection agreed to undertake a number of different reports across a range of areas.  The Minister agreed that the Department would commission an independent report on the one-parent family payment reforms and this commitment was included in the Act.  The report is to examine the financial and social effects of the amendments to the scheme made since 1 January 2012, taking into account the poverty rates and welfare dependency of those impacted by the reforms.  The Minister committed to producing the report as quickly as possible and no later than August 2017, as it will be required to feed into the budget 2018 discussions.</p><p> The Department has since prioritised this work within the one-parent family payment policy unit.  A request for tender, RFT, is being issued with the relevant procurement rules, procedures and timeframes that apply.  The Department has been in discussions with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to determine if the request for tender can be issued within one of its existing frameworks.  If this is possible, it would be the most efficient and effective way of procuring the required review.  The OGP advised that the best approach is to issue an outline of the RFT to potential providers engaged under their framework seeking expressions of interest.  The Department supplied the necessary outline to the Office of Government Procurement on 19 December 2016 and the request for expressions of interest issued from the OGP on 20 December 2016, with a closing date of 11 January 2017.</p><p> The Department will consult the Office of Government Procurement in the coming days on the results of this process and the next steps.  Any procurement process is time consuming and must adhere to the relevant procurement rules with regard to the process, timelines and evaluation of proposals.  The timeframe for this report is, therefore, ambitious.  However, the Department is making every effort to progress this as quickly as possible while adhering to the rules. </p><p> Mr. Egan may wish to comment on the structure of the review or the initial question put to me. </p></speech>

While it is only a few months since they last appeared, we have moved on a great deal in the meantime.  I have a specific request.  I presume when the tendering process has successfully concluded that a document will be produced specifying the work of the tender, in other words, the procedure to be followed and so forth.  If that is the case, I presume this document will made public.  Can it be made it available to the joint committee at that stage?</p></speech>

The committee would like to see this to help us conclude our work.  We would like to see the parallels but we are not looking for the outcome.  I fully accept that the Department is precluded from providing details until the tender process is complete.</p></speech>

I will briefly address the report because it is the outcome of an amendment I tabled to the Bill, one which, thankfully, the Minister supported.  This work to identify the precise impact is critical and badly needed.  Arising from visits to our clinics and so on, members have anecdotal evidence of the impact the changes have had on individuals and families.</p><p>This will put all of those issues to the fore.</p><p> I welcome the fact that it is now in process.  Yesterday was the closing date.  I also welcome the fact that eight parties have come forward and expressed an interest in it.  I am interested in the next stage because the Minister gave a commitment that this would be published in time to feed in to the budgetary discussions for next years' budget.  I believe a date in August has been mentioned.  It is critical that this date is adhered to.  I do not want this to be just another report gathering dust on a shelf.  It needs to be a report with actions coming out from it and specifically feeding in to the budget.  While the crux of the report is the focus on the issues stemming from the changes going back to 2012, I would be interested to find out more.  This morning the committee had a very good contribution from Focus Ireland which gave us all the facts and figures with regard to lone parents.  The figures show that 65% of homeless families are one-parent families.  This area needs to be looked at in relation to this report.  I believe the changes that have been made to the single parent payment have had a direct impact on homelessness for lone parents also.  This critical part of the report needs to be looked at and fed back to the committee.</p><p> The witnesses say that over the coming days the Department will be speaking to the Office of Government Procurement.  Is that by the end of this week or next week? It is crucial that this does roll out as fast as possible to hit the deadline of August in order to inform the budget discussion.  It is an ambitious deadline and this was alluded to in the Department representative's contribution today.  Perhaps the committee could hear a little bit more about this.  I also want to touch on the matter of the long awaited report on the barriers to third level education for lone parents.  It is long overdue.  The Department acknowledges that it received the first draft in September last year.  It has now gone out for a second drafting I believe.  Will the witnesses indicate when we can expect to see that report?  It is long overdue and badly needed.  When will we get to see that badly needed report?</p></speech>

I got into politics in 1999 in local government.  I went through what was supposed to have been the prosperous noughties where everybody was seeing the benefit of the Celtic tiger.  It made no difference, however, to many people in Dublin's inner city because they never got employment.  I remember carrying out a survey where we saw 54% unemployment when nationally the unemployment figures were down to 4% and 5%.  There was a cohort that never saw the Celtic tiger.  Now, as we are coming out of recession we are seeing very progressive numbers around unemployment.  We need - I see it happening in the Department - that targeted approach to make sure people get in to employment and are not left sitting on the shelf.  Money and benefits might be thrown at them but they are left unemployed and not sharing in the recovery.</p> <p>  This is critical.  It is why the Intreo offices and other measures happening within the Department of Social Protection are key to ensure the targeting.  In many cases people are resistant because they have been unemployed for so long and they fear engagement in this regard.  It may be a lone parent or somebody who is coming out of an inter-generational home that has not seen employment.  Their parents had not worked and sometimes their grandparents had not worked.  This happened in the Dublin Docklands area when people lost their traditional dockside work due to containerisation.</p><p>There is multigenerational unemployment.  There needs to be a target and a review to make sure we have the outcomes we want to achieve.  That is where research is vital.</p></speech>

The programme for Government committed to publishing the report before the budget was announced.  The departmental officials reiterated a line from the Minister for Education and Skills, that there was a draft and that it would have influenced the budgetary process.  They are now saying there is a second draft.  We are well past September when it was probably expected the report would be published.  With the extended time, are there substantial changes between the two drafts or what led to the significant increase in time?</p></speech>

Will the officials tell us briefly what interaction has taken place across Departments on lone parents?  The report is needed ASAP.  The officials said it had helped to inform the relevant discussions on budget 2017.  Is there anything they can pinpoint in the budget where the measures were taken into account?  They mentioned that 9,000 lone parents had been selected for activation.  What are the schemes involved?  Are the majority being steered towards JobPath?</p></speech>

I emphasise that the issue of homelessness is not within my area.  It is a much bigger issue.  Senator Kevin Humphreys mentioned the targeted approach which we will pick up in our comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-12a.520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Ward" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017011200002#DD00500"><p>Our engagement with jobseeker transition clients is focused on steering them towards education and training opportunities.  They do not have to look for employment until their youngest child is 14 years old.  We have been engaging with them to see if they need additional skills to assist them in finding secure sustainable employment.</p> <p>  The Department has an agreement with the education and training boards, with which we work very closely not only for jobseeker transition customers but for all customers in developing targeted training programmes.  In Tallaght, for example, there were 723 jobseeker transition clients who moved from the one-parent family payment.  Our office was the biggest in the country at the time.  We have engaged with all such clients, of whom 573 have been brought to information sessions during which people involved in the education and training boards, jobs clubs and community employment schemes, as well as our own case officer, made presentations on the supports and services available to them.  The education and training boards offer several part-time evening programmes to which our clients are referred and which they have taken up.</p><p>Community employment schemes are suitable for many of our jobseeker transition clients because their youngest child is in school and they can do the required 19.5 hours.  Jobs clubs give clients the interview and career guidance skills they need to secure employment.</p><p> In Tallaght, we worked with the education and training board to develop a pre-employment return to work programme targeted at our clients in both the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas.  Senator Humphreys referred to the challenges of dealing with people who are not used to engaging with us in this way.  We were able to run that programme for the Tallaght office but not for the Clondalkin office as we did not get enough interest at the time, but we hope to run it in February.  We ran the Tallaght programme in term time, starting in September and beginning each day at 9.30 a.m., after the school day started.  Of the 16 people who started the programme, 14 completed it, two of whom have since secured employment.  Some of the participants have applied for night training courses with the ETB while others are seeking part-time training options.  The feedback from the programme was very positive, with participants saying it gave them great confidence.  They now have a CV and are more knowledgeable and confident about applying for jobs.  It was a taster programme and participants found the IT module, career planning aspect and work experience component particularly useful.  The members of that first group have set up a network to remain in touch and encourage each other in their training and job-seeking efforts.  It was a very positive outcome from our perspective and we hope to run the programme again in January.  We expect to get the numbers from the Clondalkin office to run it there as well.</p><p> There are financial supports available for lone parents who take up employment, including family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  As I said, jobseeker transition clients do not have to look for work and are not, therefore, referred to JobPath.  Our focus is not so much on securing work for our clients.  The emphasis is on providing education and training opportunities in order that when they can take up full-time employment, they are as near as possible to workforce-ready.</p><p> Senator Humphreys referred to the situation of families who become homeless.  Within our three divisions in Dublin, we have an agreement in place that if a lone parent or any family member who is in receipt of a payment from one of our offices becomes homeless, he or she will remain within the remit of that office.  In other words, people will continue to draw their payment from the same office even though they may be placed in a hotel in a different location.  Doing it this away allows clients to continue to access the activation process and avoid disruption to their payment.  If they need assistance in taking their children to school, for example, our community welfare service can make payments by way of the supplementary welfare allowance under the emergency needs programme.</p></speech>

We do not yet have a confirmed figure in that regard.</p> <p>  One of the issues that was highlighted in the first version of the Maynooth report was the cost of education allowance.  The budget announcement of a &euro;500 per annum increase in that allowance is one aspect of the work that is being done to assist people back to education.  When representatives of the Department of Education and Skills met the Maynooth university people to discuss the first version of the report, there was agreement that there needed to be more in-depth analysis, including around the profiling of lone parents.  There was a great deal of work to be done in the education space.</p><p>Quite a lot of additional work has been done by Maynooth, and that is why it has taken the extra time.  While I have the report, I have to be honest and say I have not had time to go through it because we are focusing on getting the request for tender, RFT, moving ahead on the study and any other material the committee needs for today's meeting.  There is a lot going on in my area.  I know that getting that report finished is a priority of the Department of Education and Skills and I do not see it taking much longer.  I imagine it will then have to go to Government, the Ministers and so on but it is very well advanced at this stage.</p><p> Deputy Brady asked if our own report would cover the issue of homelessness.  Realistically, it will not be able to cover the issue of homelessness because that is such a big issue it almost needs a separate piece of research.  Our report will also have to be done in a challenging timeframe and the issues it will cover are fairly broad, so I do not see it covering that issue.</p></speech>

The two Departments we work most closely with would be, first, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Several years ago it implemented an after-school child care scheme.  In terms of the learning from that, as we were also members of the interdepartmental group on child care we were able to feed in strongly during that group the need for lone parents and child care provision, which is fed directly into the design of the single affordable child care scheme the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is in the process of designing. As Ms Ryan referred to in her opening statement, we are also involved in that process.</p> <p>  The other big Department we are involved with, and which was mentioned earlier, is the Department of Education and Skills.  In terms of the study that has been referred to, but also our interactions, again referenced in the opening statement, with the further education sector, we continue paying allowances to jobseeker's transition so we have dealt with the issue that emerged on foot of one of the issues raised by some of the lone parent groups.  That is because of the relationship we have with the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred, anecdotally, to the increase in the number of FIS recipients.  There has been an increase in the number of FIS recipients on foot of the lone parent reforms.  It ties in with Senator Humphreys's point about sharing the recovery.  We have noticed it across all our schemes.  We are all aware of the reduction in unemployment levels, which are at 7.2%.  That is very welcome but, anecdotally, we have the QNHS data.  We have also seen a very significant increase in employment for lone parents in the year following the lone parent reforms.  For lone parents it is about a 3.6% increase in employment, which is about four times the increase compared to all parents.  We believe that is significant but for lone parents whose youngest child is aged between six and 11, which is  pertinent, the increase was 7.5%.  That is something we want to explore in the context of the review because that is wider than just social welfare recipients.  We acknowledge that, but it is of importance.</p> <p>  Some of the measures we have introduced over the last three budgets have facilitated an increase in lone parents in work.  Over &euro;100 million has been allocated specifically for the benefit of lone parents on foot of measures we have introduced over the last three budgets.  That is everything from the rate increase, the increase in disregards, the Christmas bonus, the fuel allowance, the increase in FIS, and the cost of education allowance which has been referred to already.</p></speech>

That was cut in 2013.  It is really only reinstating or reintroducing that and increasing it by &euro;200.  I think it was &euro;300 at that stage.  On listening to the witnesses, that may have been one key recommendation from that report, which we have not seen but which the officials have seen.  It has gone back to a second draft.  This report, when we eventually get it, may well be out of date if some of the key measures - that clearly was one of the key measures - are to reintroduce a cut that was made in 2013.  The fear is that when we get this substantial long-awaited report that was committed to in the programme for Government, it will be out of date.  I reiterate how important it is to get that as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Is there a mechanism in the Department's IT database to harvest that information in order that we can see a trend of one generation after the other?</p></speech>

We genuinely struggle with householding issues and that specific issue is difficult for us to identify.  Colleagues in the activation policy side are looking at it in the context of the commitment in the programme for Government to provide an action plan for jobless households.
