Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Their opening statements or any other documentation they have may be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The topic for discussion is the entitlement of self-employed persons to social protection payments.  The Select Sub-Committee on Social Protection discussed the matter briefly in July last in the context of its discussion on the 2013 Estimates.  Since then, the Department has published a report on the matter.  Today's discussion is part of an ongoing look at this issue in terms of our having discussed this issue last year with a group from Dundalk representative of self-employed people.  We also discussed it at that stage with the Department.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Mary Kennedy and Ms Aideen Mooney from the Department of Social Protection to the meeting and invite Ms Kennedy to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Kennedy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013112000003#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it to discuss the social insurance entitlements of the self-employed.  Members will have received copies of my presentation.  My name is Mary Kennedy.  I am principal officer with responsibility for PRSI policy in the Department of Social Protection.  I am accompanied by Ms Aideen Mooney, assistant principal for PRSI policy.</p><p>  Social insurance contributions broadly fall into two categories.  Employers and employees over 16 years pay PRSI towards establishing entitlement of employees to a broad range of short and long-term social insurance benefits.  A lower rate of PRSI is paid by the self-employed into the Social Insurance Fund, which provides them with access to long-term social insurance benefits.  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as contributory State pension and contributory widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension.  Maternity benefit is also available to self-employed contributors.  Ordinary employees who have access to short-term and long-term social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% on their behalf, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full rate PRSI class A.  For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI reverts to 8.5% from 1 January 2014.  The lower rate of employer PRSI was halved from 8.5% to 4.25% for the period July 2011 to 31 December 2013 as part of the jobs initiative announced in May 2011.</p><p>  Class S contributions do not count towards the social insurance contributions required for eligibility under a number of schemes, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  This has led to a perception that the self-employed are not eligible for any social welfare support while unemployed.  However, self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on a low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, the means assessment will take account of the level of earnings in the past 12 months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a claimant of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance who is not self-employed, the means of a husband, wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years.  The Department undertook two specific pieces of work in relation to the entitlement of self-employed persons.  To explore the possibility of extending social insurance cover for the self-employed, the Department, as part of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2010, asked the consultants engaged to carry out the review to project the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund and the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions for self-employed workers and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payments for self-employed workers.</p><p>  In addition, the advisory group on tax and social welfare, which was established <font color="#2F2F2F">in June 2011 with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience, was asked to examine a number of specific issues.  Specifically, in its terms of reference, the group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed people in order to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In this context, the group was required to consider any proposals for change to existing arrangements in a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context.</font></p><p>  The third actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The review covers a 55 year period from 2011 to 2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 actuarial reviews of the fund.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund and the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate contributory State pension, which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core contributory State pension were provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core contributory State pension plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  As stated, on 6 September 2013, the Minister published the third report of the </font><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font>  Its findings include<font color="#2F2F2F"> that 85% of 20,000 self-employed people who claimed the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  This is in contrast to the perception that the self-employed do not receive social welfare support while unemployed.  The group, therefore, found that the current system of means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  Another finding was that extending social insurance for the self-employed is warranted in cases related to long-term sickness or injuries.  To this end, it recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The group also recommended that the extension of long-term sickness benefits should be on a compulsory basis </font>and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.</p><p>  In the course of the group&rsquo;s deliberations, it identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees.  The actuarial review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate contributory State pension, currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  This finding was noted by the advisory group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the advisory group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 actuarial review relating to the level of contributions levied on class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.  The Minister has indicated that she and the Government will reflect carefully on the findings of the advisory group and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></speech>

I have been involved for quite a while in the campaign for benefits for the self-employed, many of whom are struggling.  I am speaking in this regard not of people who own large companies but about small contractors such as plumbers, carpenters and mechanics and so on who are getting only minimal amounts of work.  It is hoped the situation will change in due course.  We are where we are and need to deal with the situation.</p><p>  Reference was made to class S contributions, under which the bereavement grant is no longer available owing to budgetary changes.  Ms Kennedy, when speaking about class S contributions, did not mention the orphan's benefits.  I presume it is still available under class S.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013112000004#F00200"><p>I am very disappointed that there are no members present from the main Opposition parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is a major issue given that there are 300,000 to 400,000 self-employed in the country and they have been neglected for far too long by previous governments.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, has done a considerable amount for the self-employed, including lowering the threshold so that they can get social protection.</p><p>  I recall canvassing a house where a gentleman had been self-employed and his business, which was based at the side of his house, had ceased trading.  I went into his office and saw all the files for the income tax, VAT and PRSI he had paid into the system.  When he needed help from the system, there was no help there for him.  Thankfully the Minister has now changed the requirements to allow such a person get a letter from the accountant stating the business has ceased trading in order to be assessed for social welfare.  We have advanced in leaps and bounds.  When I was elected to the House two years ago I recall asking about social protection for the self-employed.  A civil servant told me it would be impossible because it would require a stamp of 30%.  We have come a long way from 30%; we are down at 15% and 5.5% for sickness and disability benefits.</p><p>  I welcome that 80% of the formerly self-employed people, who applied, qualified for social protection.  This is proof of the Government's commitment to supporting our business community through good times and bad times.</p><p>  The first step is implementing a new class stamp of 5.5% for the self-employed.  I discussed this with the Minister during a Topical Issue debate this week.  We do not need to apply the full 1.5% straightaway because we understand the existing climate.  We can introduce it in stages by starting at 0.25% and building it up over the years, as the economy gets better.  I ask Ms Kennedy and Ms Mooney to give me their opinion on that.  We need to remember that we are looking after self-employed people at the moment so the PAYE worker is footing the bill.  We need to put in place a system that is fair to everybody, including the PAYE worker who is helping the self-employed person now.  That self-employed person is not paying on his stamp for the entitlements he is getting so we need to be fair to everybody.</p><p>  We are the last country in industrialised Europe not to have social protection for the self-employed.  I have studied various countries.  In the United Kingdom calculation of social protection for self-employed is through their profits.  For the first &euro;7,000 profit in a business, the person can get an exemption form and not pay anything.  For profits between &euro;7,000 and &euro;11,000, they pay &euro;3.30.  For profits from &euro;11,000 to 45,000, they pay 9% on a stamp which entitles them to most payments.  However, they are means tested on long-term payments.  I believe we should go with the 5.5% for the sickness and disability pay and then means test it with the UK model in mind for long-term payments.</p><p>  Coming from a self-employed background I have always advised businesspeople that if they are making a profit in their business they are paying income tax.  If they are not making a profit and are breaking even, they are paying tax on their drawings.  Would they not be better clipping a little bit of this over to a stamp to give them security to pay their family bills etc.?  ISME came rushing out like a greyhound out of the traps and claimed it was an extra tax on the self-employed.  ISME should back off.  I ask it and other groups if we should leave the system as it is when it does not work.  I have visited the houses of self-employed people to find they are suicidal because they have no payments.  I recently appeared on a LM-FM radio phone-in programme.  One woman was working and her husband got sick.  They had a mortgage and three children.  Just because she was bringing home approximately &euro;400, her husband, as a self-employed person, was entitled to &euro;1.50 a week.  I call on ISME to give this some thought and to be fair.</p><p>  The IFA and other organisations have supported what we are saying but they want it to be voluntary.  Unfortunately, a voluntary system will not work and it needs to be mandatory.  I know this is being discussed at Cabinet and it will eventually happen.  I want to see it happen sooner rather than later.  I point out to all these organisations that we do not need to slap them with 1.5%; we can gradually introduce it.  However, it will be the first time self-employed people in this country will ever have been recognised through social protection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Kennedy" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013112000004#F00300"><p>In fairness, the self-employed are covered for the longer-term benefits under the Class S contribution.  We have to acknowledge that there is cover at the moment.  They do not have access to short-term benefits and that was what we were examining.  It has become a significant issue in recent times with the downturn in the economy.</p><p>  The actuarial review analysed providing two additional schemes for the self-employed and the advisory group on tax and social welfare also produced a report.  All that work was done in recognition of the difficulties we have in providing additional supports for the self-employed.  As the Minister has said, we now need to take the findings of those two reports and examine where we can go in providing that additional cover.  The advisory group on tax and social welfare report indicated that jobseeker's allowance covers the particular short-term need and therefore did not see the need to extend the cover for the self-employed to jobseeker's benefit.  However, the report also had findings on the illness side and in particular on invalidity pension.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013112000005#G00200"><p>Can I cut across Ms Kennedy?  In the old days before the Government came to power if a person was self-employed, he had to get figures from the previous year.  For example, for 2013, a person would have to get figures for the 2011 and 2012 accounts.  In many cases, as the Senator said, when a person goes out of business, he has no money.  Basically, he is left out in the wilderness because he cannot pay the accountant to do up the figures and he cannot pay income tax because he has gone out of business.  A person used to be in no man's land.  Since the Minister has come in, she has dropped the threshold levels.  It has changed.  People are entitled to social protection now but before that was not the case.  It was like a minefield to try to get this through.  A person had to ensure all the payments were made.  Then he had to go to the accountant to get the books done up but the accountant could leave the person with a bill for several thousand euro which the person simply did not have.  He was in a catch-22 situation.  It has changed.</p><p>  We need a new system.  I understand what Ms Kennedy is saying about the self-employed situation.  There is no perfect glove that will fit social protection and self-employed situations but we need a system in place.</p></speech>

People will get another chance because we have a smaller group today.  Please finish, Ms Kennedy, and then I will go back to the other Deputies.</p></speech>

A self-employed person has the ability to have her business continue.  I realise Senator Moloney was referring to the plumber or the carpenter but because the self-employed are a different group, there is no one-size-fits-all for them since there are so many people encompassed by the global title or name.  Therefore, many different things need to be taken into consideration.  That is why the group came down with the invalidity pension and particular schemes that were necessary.  A self-employed person, unlike an employee, might have the ability to survive for a period either by having others working for her or by recovering what she might have lost while she was out sick and so on.  That is why the recommendations were made for longer-term cover.</p><p>  Senator Moloney asked the question - it was raised at the committee last year as well - about the figure of 15% or 16% for the self-employed versus the figure of 14.75% for employees.  The most recent actuarial review was in 2010.  There were other reviews in 2000 and 2005 but the most recent review was at the end of 2010.</p></speech>

The point is the figure of 14.75% is very good value as well.  Let us consider the fact that the Social Insurance Fund is in deficit.  One could argue that, over time, the figure of 14.75% is attractive.  The review did not examine the employee rate in particular but rather what it would cost to provide additional benefits to the self-employed.  That is where those figures came from.</p></speech>

I am simply saying that the question the actuarial review group considered was specifically in respect of what the cost would be to provide cover to the self-employed.  Essentially, that is where those figures have come from.  What the actuarial review group examined was specifically in respect of providing additional cover for the self-employed.</p><p>  Deputy Butler referred to another matter.  The point is the advisory group report went to Government.  The Minister has said it will feed into the deliberative process and the question of how we might develop a new scheme of invalidity pension for the self-employed.  Deputy Butler raised the issue of how that might be done and whether we should increase the contribution from the current figure of 4%.  The figure of 1.5 percentage points was a reference to the actuarial review.  What the actuarial review stated, however, was that to provide the current State pension to the self-employed, the rate should be 15% rather than 4%, which is what they currently pay.  We asked the actuarial review group to examine the cost of providing jobseeker's benefit in addition to the State pension and, additionally, the cost if we were to provide invalidity pension as well.  The figures came to 15% for the State pension, 16% plus for the jobseeker's benefit and 17.3% to provide State pension contributory plus jobseeker's benefit plus invalidity pension.  The figure of 1.5 percentage points should not be taken in isolation from the actuarial review group conclusions.</p><p>  Deputy Butler made a point about making an increase to provide additional benefits to the self-employed.  Deputy Butler suggested if that was going to be done, it should be done on a phased basis.  That is something we will be considering as part of any examination of the advisory group suggestions in respect of invalidity pension.  The group recommended that jobseeker's benefit was not warranted but that consideration should be given to providing invalidity pension for the self-employed.  The next question is what that should cost and what any such scheme would look like.</p><p>  The self-employed are not the same as employees.  A person must prove incapacity for work and the question is how that would apply.  Invalidity pension relates to longer-term incapacity.  It means being permanently incapable.  If we go down that road, the next challenge is how to work at developing a scheme that would meet the different situations of a self-employed person compared with an employee.  If an employee is out sick or permanently incapacitated, she has no capacity to earn an income.  Since there are so many different types of self-employed people, the question is how to develop such a scheme.</p></speech>

Did the Department carry out a costing in terms of what the employees ought to pay as a percentage of their income for what they actually get?  I realise Ms Kennedy was coming from a slightly different perspective.</p></speech>

That produced some stark figures relating to the level of contribution that would be required if we want the Social Insurance Fund to break even.  We have the figures in the actuarial review and I can certainly come back to the committee with them.  I simply do not have them in my head at present.  It was a general review of the Social Insurance Fund.  The main purpose of the actuarial review was to review the Social Insurance Fund having regard to the people who will be coming up to pension age and so on and how well it is funded to meet the requirements over the period from 2010 until 2066.</p><p>  One of the things we asked the review group to do specifically, because of the issue of the self-employed, was to consider the cost required to provide two specific types of benefit, namely, jobseeker's benefit and invalidity pension, for self-employed people.  The first thing the group examined was the level of contribution required to fund the State pension.  Self-employed people currently pay 4%.  The figure the consultants calculated for the appropriate contribution for a self-employed person was 15%.  Using that as the level of contribution required for the State pension, the incremental additional cost for jobseeker's benefit was 16.5%.</p></speech>

As there is a shortfall at present, which is projected to increase over time until 2066, the review considered what changes one would need to make to address that.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the Social Insurance Fund is funded on a tripartite basis, that is, by employers, employees and the self-employed and then there is a residual financier, which effectively is the State.  I am not stating today there will be an increase in the 14.75% rate as obviously, that is not my decision.</p></speech>

The reason this debate has been held today and in recent years is because of demand from people who previously were self-employed but who find themselves out of work because of the recession.  It has been suggested that they are getting nothing and that nothing is available for the self-employed.  Ms Kennedy has indicated clearly there is, namely, the jobseeker's allowance means tested payment.  However, it is strange for the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, to respond to a demand for something on the part of the formerly self-employed by stating that cannot happen and I find it particularly frustrating.</p></speech>

Throughout Ireland but particularly in the midlands, self-employed people are suffering because before their businesses went into liquidation or folded up etc, they were on the breadline themselves.  They actually were working to pay their staff.  While that was the position, this does not appear to have been realised by officials within the Department.  These people were prepared to take risks and to invest in their communities.  There was a great furore about all the grants and so on that were available through the enterprise boards etc. and those people gave up good jobs and went into business on their own, having probably bought expensive equipment, machinery and so on.  However, following the downturn in the economy, the whole thing collapsed.  In her presentation, Ms Kennedy stated:<blockquote><br />However, self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  [That is okay.]  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases.</blockquote>The major problem I have encountered  is those people have assets but cannot sell them.  Although those assets are at scrap value, when officials from the Department of Social Protection value those assets, those involved are perceived as being wealthy people.  In fact, however, they cannot sell the assets because no one wants to establish a business in the same line.  The alternative is to bring them elsewhere and sell them at a huge loss, after which they will have debts with the bank and so on.</p><p>  This matter should be considered seriously.  I know people who have assets in their yards that are taken into consideration and thereby are debarring them from a social welfare jobseeker's allowance.  This matter must be addressed and ways must be explored in which to help those people.  I do not believe it to be beyond the bounds of the Department to devise a system that is fair.  All people seek is such a system because as Deputy Butler noted, I know people who committed suicide when their small businesses folded.  I have attended funerals of people and this is not what members want.  These people are desperate, are to be found throughout the country and a system must be devised that is fair to them.  It is possible to have assets and to be starving at the same time because one cannot sell the assets of a business that has folded in the present climate and nor can people use their assets for productive purposes.  The human element in this regard must be considered and soon.</p></speech>

However, because I appeared before the joint committee last year when a lot of these issues came up, I spoke to a number of divisional managers who deal with the various local offices and so on.  In fairness to the Department, various circulars have been issued to all the staff who deal with this kind of work.  I obviously do not disagree with anything Deputy Bannon is saying because he has more experience on the ground but my information, from speaking to those divisional managers, is that staff are dealing with matters in a commonsensical and sensitive manner when carrying out means assessments and so on.  I do not know precisely what is the rule in respect of the assets to which Deputy Bannon refers but I certainly can bring back that concern to my colleagues.</p><p>  However, there are probably have been improvements over the years, members probably also are experiencing this themselves, in the manner in which the Department deals with such cases.  While people who were self-employed were earning good incomes, over the years and in particular since the downturn, the message to all staff in the field who do such assessments obviously is to have regard to the downturn.  As Senator Moloney observed, one cannot project a future income on the basis of a previous income that no longer is realisable.  This message is out there and people are applying the more correct approach, which is that just because someone had a particular income last year, it does not mean in any way he or she will have a similar income this year.  In fact, such people could have no income at all.</p><p>  These points all have been accepted and my understanding is that a much more straightforward approach is being taken to means testing.  I believe the figures probably bear this out, if one considers the numbers in receipt of jobseeker's allowance who formerly were self-employed.  This appears to suggest the treatment people are receiving as part of the means assessment process must have had regard to the various issues raised by members today and that people are qualifying for jobseeker's allowance who perhaps might not have qualified in the past because a different means assessment arrangement was in place.</p><p>  If issues remain outstanding, the best thing to do is to bring them to the attention of the Department.  Obviously, if there are cases in which things are not being done as they should be, they can be addressed.  However, I reiterate that I spoke to a number of colleagues working in the regional areas who have responsibility for the staff who carry out the means assessments. Particular issues were raised by members last year about being told to deregister with Revenue, for example, to surrender public service vehicle, PSV, licences and that kind of thing.  It has been confirmed to me that this is not the case and in fact, one would never do this because so doing would prevent that person from having an ability to earn moneys.  This of course is completely counter-productive to the business we are in because we are only there as an income support.  Obviously, if someone has an ability to earn an income, we should be encouraging that and not taking away the means of so doing.  This is very much the message out there and people are being dealt with in a very sensitive fashion, having regard to the changed circumstances.</p></speech>

However, I spoke to them in a general way and took up the points that were raised by members the last time we spoke to the joint committee.  I wish to confirm that the kind of issues that were raised the last time around should not continue to be a concern because the clear instruction is one does not ask someone to deregister or to give back a PSV licence and so on, because that would prevent them from being in a position to earn an income, which is not what we want to do at all.</p></speech>

For many, the employment does not cease.  For example, a plumber or carpenter may get a call for a day's work to fix a leak or whatever is wrong with a house.  That person may get a few hours work or a day's work now and again.  In that case, their employment would not have ceased.  Perhaps we could have a scheme similar to farm assist where people could work for a few hours and draw unemployment payment for the hours they are not working.  While we say jobseeker's allowance is available, I note that only 20,000 have availed of it.  We look at the 85% but that is 85% of what?  We are not talking about 85% of the self-employed in Ireland but 85% of those who applied, which is about 20,000.  There are a couple of hundred thousand of self-employed persons in the country.</p><p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I am aware of a case of a man who has leukaemia and cannot work.  His wife works and her income exceeds the amount he would receive on jobseeker's allowance.  They are struggling because they have a mortgage and bills to pay.  Sometimes benefit is far more beneficial to the person than an allowance as it is not means tested and would get him over the hump while they are in difficulty.  A short-term payment can help one at a time of a short-term problem, but I am not saying that leukaemia is a short-term problem.  If a person is ill for a few weeks or a few months, it gets them over a hump.  Jobseeker's allowance is not the answer for all the self-employed, especially if one has a working spouse as that income will be taken into account and that person will left without anything.</p></speech>

The report considered that issue in detail and gave the reasons it went for the compulsory option.  The report states: "Allowing people a facility to opt in or opt out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks."  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and if cover is needed, one gets it.  The report also stated that it could also result in negation of the social solidarity contributory principles which underline the social insurance system.  That is the point.  Even way back, when consideration was being given to the idea of introducing social insurance for the self-employed, the report quotes from the D&aacute;il debate at the time that every pension scheme is based on a mixture of good risks and bad risks.  This is particularly the case with social insurance schemes under which cover is so broadly based.  If we were to go with the opt-in or opt-out option, those most likely to want the payment would probably opt in while those who can cover their own costs would not opt in.  In that case, how would the cover be provided?  Social insurance is compulsory.  Everybody pays into it and in the event of illness or unemployment, a person can make a claim.  If we were to have an opt-in or opt-out option, it would undermine the whole social solidarity principle on which the whole social insurance system is based.</p></speech>

There is critical mass across income distribution.  Some people pay very high amounts of social insurance while others pay very little.  An employee earning less than &euro;356 does not make any social insurance contribution.  This is why it is important the entire system is compulsory.  The social insurance fund receives significant income from which the expenditure that arises can be defrayed.</p><p>  With regard to Senator Moloney's contribution, I made a point about employment ceasing, and the point is also valid with regard to low income as a result of a downturn in business.  A person's work may have dried up and he or she may get an odd bit of work here and there.  If such people prove to the local office they have an entitlement to or are in need of income support, the fact they have obtained a bit of work will not affect their entitlement.</p></speech>

Many involved in small businesses would not have a hope of paying it.  We could examine this system and examine how the Department runs its system.</p><p>  Ms Kennedy made a presentation and spoke about increasing the rate of jobseeker's benefit by 15% to 16% in addition to core pension, and she also mentioned 17.3% for the entire package.  We know this, but the recommendation of the report is to increase the class S stamp from 4% to 5.5%.  It is not about the big figures because self-employed people cannot cope with them at present and we know this; it is about the report's findings and recommendations.  It recommends sick pay, disability pay and a contributory pension for 5.5%.  We want various groups, including ISME, to come on board.  The Minister told me last week we do not want to introduce it all in one go, but that it could be introduced in stages of 0.25% over a period of time as the economy improves.  We have got bogged down in the system of the Department of Social Protection with regard to self-employed people and nothing is happening.  I do not want us to leave this meeting thinking about astronomical figures.  We want to push the recommendations of the report to the Government to be included in the next budget and get something done for the self-employed.</p><p>  There is much confusion with regard to the stamps of self-employed people.  I paid an S class stamp for 24 years when I was self-employed.  I did not know what it entitled me to because no information is distributed.  I would like to see Revenue or the Department of Social Protection tell people what they are paying into and their entitlements.  When I lost my business I was a local councillor and I was living on &euro;302 a week to feed a family of four and try to pay my mortgage.  I sought family income supplement because I thought I was entitled to it because I was working as a local authority member and paying a stamp through my wages.  I could have been told in Longford on day one I was not entitled to it.  There was not a piece of cheese to put in the mousetrap to feed the mouse in the house never mind feed the children and pay the mortgage.  This continued for 24 weeks, and two weeks before Christmas a letter arrived to tell us we were entitled to nothing.  One can imagine the Christmas we had.</p><p>  I can see where Deputy Bannon is coming from with regard to suicide and self-employed people because I saw many dark days in my household.  This is why I am so passionate.  People hear me go on about the self-employed and fighting this corner with the Minister.  Every time I see the Minister she runs to the far side of the room from me.  I am so passionate because I do not want to see what happened to me happen to another self-employed person ever again.  As long as I am in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I will push this as far as I possibly can.</p></speech>

Has the Department examined what happens in other countries?  Insurance companies in this country look after their clients in such a way they are covered for Revenue audits which can cost up to &euro;10,000.  Perhaps the insurance for a business which employs people should include a built-in safeguard in the eventuality of collapse.  This should be explored.</p></speech>

What cost would there be in allowing these people put up a credited stamp?  I cannot understand why they cannot do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Kennedy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013112000009#L00100"><p>I will respond to Senator Moloney's questions first.  It is true that there is no facility to award credits to a self-employed person.  A self-employed person gets 52 contributions for his or her year and there are no weeks that one can claw back or that kind of thing.  However, an employed person only gets contributions for the weeks they work.  They get a credit to maintain his or her record for any weeks that he or she might have been sick or not in employment.  It is not exactly a case of comparing like with like.  If a self-employed person earns more than &euro;5,000 during the course of the year and makes a payment in respect of that, he or she will receive 52 contributions for that year.  That is one of the reasons credits were not available to the self-employed.  We are aware that it is a gap in the system.  It is something that the advisory group report stated we must examine, and we will be looking at it.  I cannot say at this point what the conclusion will be after a full examination on foot of the advisory group's report.   Obviously, we are aware of the matter because it has become more of an issue in recent years due to people being out of employment.  </p><p>  Credits maintain a person's social insurance record and one has the option of becoming a voluntary contributor.  I appreciate that costs money but the option to become a voluntary contributor is available to anybody who ceases to be in insurable employment or insurable self-employment and, in that way, to maintain one's social insurance record.  This area was highlighted in the report as a shortcoming regarding the self-employed and it is something that we must review.  We are examining the matter on an ongoing basis.  The self-employed have specific issues.  Again, no more than the other benefits the report found they did not require, it is something we must examine because different situations apply to the self-employed compared with employees.</p></speech>

It said the self-employed should be paying 15% for the long-term benefits they receive and it suggested a rate of 16% to provide for jobseeker's benefit.

The advisory group report mentioned systems in other countries for the self-employed.  In anything that we do, we always have regard to what applies in other countries when examining any change in any scheme.  Obviously, if a country has already done something or is providing a benefit, we examine how such mechanisms work in other countries and then see how the scheme might apply for us.</p></speech>

Let us look at the value that the self-employed person gives.  He or she employs people, pays income tax and PRSI and once a person's name is over the door, he or she is hit with bills for everything.  It should be the opposite.  It should be the value that the self-employed bring to the economy.  At the end of the day, if we do not put in infrastructure and provide a safety net, why would a person bother being self-employed?  If we want the economy to move forward, we need a system in place as the country comes out recession.  If a person takes a gamble and sets up a business, employs people and pays taxes to the State, then the State should provide help if things go wrong.  We need a proper social protection system for the future.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Koos Richelle, director general, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion at the European Commission.  We are grateful that he has travelled from Brussels to appear before us.  He is accompanied by Mr. Jonathan Claridge whom we all know from the European Commission Representation in Ireland.  </p><p>  There is a growing debate at European level on whether social indicators should play a larger role in how we consider EMU.  The Commission has recently issued a communication on the social dimension of EMU which outlines how social indicators could be part of the formal economic surveillance associated with EMU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Koos Richelle" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013112000003#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and honourable members for their invitation.  It is a pleasure and an honour to be here.  It is an honour for reasons I do not have to explain.  It is a pleasure because this is the only parliament that has invited people from Brussels to come and explain the social elements of EMU.  I thank it for this.  As part of the ongoing work to complete EMU, the European Commission on 2 October adopted a proposal to strengthen the social dimension of EMU.  This communication can be understood only in connection with the blueprint the Commission published on the way forward for EMU.</p><p>  The work started under the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  Ireland has made a much appreciated input into this matter.  The discussions at the time were critically important for the proposals on the table.  The social dimension of EMU relates to the ability of economic governance mechanisms and related instruments to identify, take into account and address problematic developments related to employment and social policies in monetary union in good time.  The proposals set out concrete ways to develop the social dimension of monetary union as an integral part of economic governance.</p><p>  We see three major strands of action.  First, there are reinforced surveillance of employment and social developments and strengthened policy co-ordination within existing economic policy co-ordination instruments.  Second, there are enhanced solidarity action and support for labour mobility.  Third, there is a strengthening of social dialogue.  When we started to develop our thoughts, there was a big discussion on whether we should build this into macroeconomic governance or make it a separate line.  This discussion was quickly ended with the conclusion that if we did not build it into macroeconomic governance, we would lack the strong legal foundation created for macroeconomic governance.  Such a thing does not apply for social governance at a European level.  We would also have a difficulty in bringing this into the yearly process of discussion.</p><p>  We developed the idea of developing a limited number of additional auxiliary employment and social indicators in the main part of macroeconomic governance, that is, the alert mechanism report we produce every year.  It was published on 13 November this year, with the annual growth strategy and the joint employment report.  The in-depth country reviews assessing the existence of macroeconomic imbalances should also consider a wide range of social indicators to clarify interlinkages between mounting macroeconomic imbalances and social developments and arrive at better calibrated policy orientations.</p><p>  The Commission has put forward an autonomous scoreboard of key employment and social indicators allowing for early identification of major negative developments in the employment and social performance of a member state, as well as a significant divergence between countries.  The proposed indicators on this scoreboard are: unemployment levels; NEETs, people not in employment, education or training, and youth unemployment rates; the real gross disposable income of households; the at-risk-of-poverty rate of the working age population; and inequalities.  The Commission believes these indicators should allow for timely identification of major employment and social problems, especially those with cross-border effects.  The cross-border effects make the link with the European semester.</p><p>  The issues are not just expressions of a warm heart, a good feeling and sympathy.  They can also be put into clear economic reasoning.  High levels of unemployment and inequality translate into lower domestic demand and spillover effects for imports.  They result in a loss of human capital and skills, which undermines future productivity.  They may lead to political instability and insecurity and a country is confronted with higher rates on the financial markets.  The Commission has incorporated the employment and social scoreboard into the draft joint employment report that is linked with the annual growth strategy.  This will help to better target the discussions in the course of the European semester where we have facts and figures to deepen our analysis of a country and form the basis for country-specific recommendations that will be issued in May in view of the European Parliament elections in early June next year.</p><p>  Having a scoreboard is one issue.  Identifying countries or sectors for actions and priorities is a second.  The scoreboard must be understood because it includes only facts and figures.  To understand the scoreboard, we use the work of the employment committee and the social protection committee, two committees serving the Employment, Social Policy and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council at which these issues are dealt with on a political level.  Policy guidance based on best performance and multilateral surveillance can help to focus the efforts of governments and stakeholders and there is a world to gain.  Europe is not really a learning society.  Despite the existence of many mechanisms and institutions, committees and meetings at which people can learn from each other, there is not a habit of being interested in best practices and trying to copy them to save time and money.</p><p>  Some things have changed since the crisis.  A concrete example is the youth guarantee on which we had some conferences specifically geared to presenting best practice on benchmarking and mutual learning.  Public employment services are very much involved in this idea of comparing their performances.  We have the open method of co-ordination in place in the social and employment fields that could be used on a structural basis.  Apart from enhanced surveillance, there is a second strand of action that concerns enhanced solidarity which is to be set in motion through reinforced EU financing instruments, especially the European Structural Funds, the European Social Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the fund for European aid for the most deprived and the youth employment initiative.  These are the main providers of money.</p><p>  Proposals to support labour mobility and effective transnational matching between labour supply and demand are being stepped up.  We have many unemployed persons in Europe, but we also have more than 2 million vacancies, many of which are unfilled for longer than six months.  Skills are not always available where the jobs are.</p></speech>

We are delighted that you have taken the time out of our your schedule to join us today.  We think it is a very important initiative by the Commission to proceed with the identification and inclusion of the social indicators.  The committee intends to provide the Commission with a political dialogue statement after we have heard from you.  We will also be having other meetings with members of Irish non-governmental organisations, such as the Irish National Association of the Unemployed, the European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland, the National Women's Council and our youth groups to talk about how they see these indicators potentially working.  After those meetings, we will be providing the Commission with a paper.</p><p>  I note what you said about sanctions and that there will be thresholds and triggers, but that nothing will trigger any consequences.  I think that is unfortunate.  There are lessons for the Commission from the Stability and Growth Pact, which had many criteria and benchmarks that were then ignored by various countries across the Union.  That was one of the reasons the six pack and the two pack were brought in.  It would be good if we saw some sort of assistance in help countries that failed to meet certain thresholds.</p><p>  You have taken time to arrive at the indicators that are contained in the paper but how set in stone are they at this stage?  How possible is it to expand them, especially in the area of social exclusion?  There is reference to equal pay rates but what are your thoughts about widening the indicators?  We could look at the participation on women on State boards, pay gaps, the impact of the recession on the disability sector and whether they are suffering more than more than most, on other sectors such as the LGBT sector.  What about our ethnic communities and the Roma community?  Are we looking at any indicators on exclusion by those groups due to the economic crisis?  Is there a way that we can feed in some kind of indicators to reflect their experience of the crisis?  Perhaps you can comment on that, but first I will ask committee members to contribute at this stage.  I call on Deputy Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013112000004#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Richelle for coming here today.  It is very interesting that we are the first committee to host his group.  Focusing on the social or societal element of monetary union is a back to basics issue.  We would all have assumed that any actions in European that ultimately benefit society are being taken.  If we compare the ECB with the Federal Reserve, the latter has a much stronger remit in areas such as unemployment figures.  That is one of the great weaknesses of the ECB, as "The Fed" has to trigger certain actions when unemployment reaches a certain level in the United States.</p><p>  We are having a debate in Ireland about labour mobility, which I think is very much misunderstood at the moment.  Mr. Richelle spoke about a loss of skills and Ireland is a particularly strong example of where the European Union is losing skills to countries like Canada, the US and Australia.  About ten years ago, we were a strong net recipient of skills from other parts of the world, but now we are exporting some of our exceptionally well skilled young people.  We hope that in a few short years, we will be bringing people back to our country.  When people feel they have to leave Ireland, the message is being sold badly in Europe when the suggestion is made that jobs may be available in another jurisdiction.  Governments are being accused of exporting people, almost wilfully saying, "leave the country".  If someone was to move from Cork to Dublin or Clare to Cork or whatever, that is not seen in the same way.</p></speech>

With regard to the reform of the regulation covering EU funds, specifically the EU cohesion policy which delivers investment in times of economic crisis, in recent weeks there has been much deliberation and compromises struck on the macroeconomic conditionality clause.  The committee on regional development discussed it a number of weeks ago.  The clause on macroeconomic conditionality could trigger the suspension of funds in the event of a macroeconomic imbalance or an excessive budget procedure.  Some of the negotiators during one of the processes changed its name to measure linking effectiveness of European structural and investment funds to signed economic governance.  The European Parliament has won some leeway on it and is now able to scrutinise the measures much more, such as with regard to ceilings on aid suspensions.  The suspension of funds is supposed to be adjusted in line with social and economic circumstances in the member state concerned.  How will this happen?  How will it be monitored?  The co-rapporteurs for the common provisions regulation stated they fought for compromise to make it impossible for this mechanism to ever be applied in practice.  Is this true?</p><p>  The youth guarantee was mentioned and I do not want to go into it in too much detail.  With regard to the implementation plan to be submitted by the end of next month how will it be monitored by the Commission?  How will it be monitored in terms of social indicators and what it is doing to address unemployment and getting young people into employment, education and training?  The payment appropriations for the youth employment initiative have been front-loaded for 2014 and 2015.  I read this means all the money allocated for the youth employment initiative will be spent in these two years.  If we have not sufficiently addressed the youth unemployment crisis by the end of 2015 what support will be there afterwards?</p></speech>

To answer the Chairman's question, it is very appealing to introduce many indicators but this makes the matter very complex.  A deliberate choice has been made to limit the indicators and those we define as most important.  These are only indicators on a scoreboard and to better understand the issue the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee uses existing analysis mechanisms.  These are the social protection and employment performance monitors.  These give much more detail on what is wrong.  The indicators as such only give the total picture.  The performance monitors operated by the two committees show what will happen which makes it possible to make detailed country specific recommendations further down the road.</p><p>  If there is not enough participation in the labour market one might see, through later analysis, it is specifically a lack of female participation, which is why specific recommendations are made to many countries to promote female labour participation, which may involve increasing child care facilities.  Further down the road we get more specific but the more indicators put on the scoreboard the less clear it is when one must act on the main issues to start a policy change.  This is the reason for the limitation of indicators and I must confess it was a struggle to include them all.</p><p>  Unemployment inequalities have been acceptable in the main macroeconomic thinking but there has been a big discussion about gross domestic disposable household income and poverty.  A difficulty is that poverty statistics are issued after a delay of two years, and it is very difficult to interpret the exact level of poverty in a household because one must take into account all social benefits and allowances, and most countries with an elaborated system of social allowances have difficulty in seeing the received by a family.  Basing a system on primary income from labour does not give a good idea of what is really happening in a family.    This set of indicators is just a proposal and must be accepted by the Council.  The political debate is on.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy asked about labour mobility and loss of skills.  I use the term "loss of skills" to indicate those who are long-term unemployed may lose their attractiveness for the labour market and may not update their skills.  The element the Deputy raised is certainly relevant.  Some countries recruit science, technology, engineering, mathematics and mechanics workers from third countries.  This means the labour mobility does not function properly in the Internal Market because people with the same skills in other member states may not be hired for jobs and the vacancies are filled by people from third countries.  We are focused on labour mobility to ensure the labour potential available in Europe has the maximum chance of being exploited.</p></speech>

It has worked out in Germany for the likes of women who are seeking to work 15 hours per week or students, but there are also people outside these categories who have had to survive in these jobs and sometimes cannot get out of a mini-job.  Sometimes the hours would be longer than for a part-time equivalent, which causes some problems.</p><p>  We have addressed the issues of in-work poverty in all countries, including those which have a surplus.  Germany has been identified in the framework of the alert mechanism report as a country that will have an in-depth review, as the trade surplus represents an imbalance for the future.  It is not to emphasise Germany's role towards the rest of Europe but rather an imbalance for the country.  If there is a surplus, it is not being used for other purposes.  One can discuss the likes of minimum wage levels in this respect.</p><p>  Senator Kathryn Reilly has asked about issues still under negotiation, but we hope they will be concluded this week.  They include the common provision regulation, in particular, and the application of macroeconomic conditionality.  In setting up Structural Funds for the years 2014 to 2020 the Commission has made the proposal that these funds should be used in line with recommendations made by the European Council which establishes recommendations in order to ensure these European funds serve the better functioning of monetary union as a whole.  Member states have tried very hard to loosen the conditionality link a little and part of our proposals was macroeconomic conditionality if a country was in a position where there was an imbalance.  In a gradation of steps, there would be a limitation on the freedom of use of Structural Funds.  One of the issues concerning macroeconomic conditionality is that a state not have a serious imbalance.  Everybody seems to run to the ultimate scenario of the Commission taking over responsibility for the spending of Structural Funds in such a country, but that position would only be reached after years of negotiations and nobody wants to go in that direction.  The idea is for us to be more preventive in our work on the issue.  There has been a discussion about terms and it seems there will be an exchange of one term  - "persistent equilibrium"  - for another that has not yet been agreed that might do the trick, leading to a certain definition of macroeconomic conditionalities.</p><p>  The monitoring of the youth guarantee will be done as closely as possible to the source and we are in discussions with member states in order that they put in place their own monitoring mechanisms on the basis of a generally accepted model.  These negotiations are ongoing.  There will be quite a challenge and there will be a limitation in the next two years for two reasons.  The front-loading is to help as quickly as possible and there is also the idea that we are working for growth and the only way to have structural new jobs is to promote growth.  The youth guarantee can help young people to get work experience or further training, but it will not create jobs.</p><p>  It would be dramatic after two years if the growth rate did not pick up, as then we might return to the fact that young people would have profited from a youth guarantee for a number of months, that they would have received training or temporary work experience, before falling back to the army of the unemployed.  That outcome cannot be excluded if there is not enough growth.</p></speech>

To what extent has he identified the most commonly recognised factors that create inequality throughout the European Union?  To what extent does the Commission recognise these factors?  To what extent has there been an indication given of the means by which they can be addressed?</p><p>  Growth has been mentioned quite a few times.  It is inextricably linked with social issues.  What is the most prominent emerging feature that the Commission has encouraged in order to allow growth to take place, having regard to the fact that we all must stay within certain expenditure limits at this time?</p><p>  Mr. Richelle has rightly mentioned solidarity and cohesion on a number of occasions.  How do they manifest themselves throughout the member states of the European Union, inside and outside the eurozone?  To what degree has the Commission identified areas in which there is not the optimum level of solidarity and cohesion?  Have performances of individual member states been rated in terms of how they have addressed unemployment, inequality and economic performance, having regard to past experiences and the causes of our difficulties? </p><p>  My last point is on the youth guarantee, critics of which will say it is insignificant, but I disagree.  It has the potential to make a major impact on the level of youth unemployment across Europe.  To what extent does the Commission monitor issues in each member state?  I want the delegation to refer in particular to the member states which have, like Ireland, been in a rescue programme.  Ireland will be in such a programme for another couple of weeks.  I want the delegation to  recognise that it has a particularly difficult job to do.  </p><p>  I get irritated, as I am sure the Chairman does, when I hear reference being made on a regular basis to the preferential corporation profits tax regime in this country.  In some quarters in the European Union there seems to be a belief Ireland has achieved a particular advantage in a way no other country has done.  That is not true.  To what extent does the Commission recognise this?  It is very important that the Commission and each Commissioner recognise the importance of this matter.  Ireland has tried to work its way out of a very difficult situation and the people have made a major contribution to achieving this objective.  Across the board taxes have been raised, incomes have been reduced, the public sector has shrank and all this has been done at great cost to ourselves.  This, in turn, has created unemployment and a degree of inequality.  I would like to think the commentary will recognise this effort at all times.  Commentary in one part of the Union is viewed in a different light in another.  For example, we do not all have the same access to the facilities and services available at the centre of some organisations.  As Ireland is not joined by land, it incurs an extra cost for transport.  It shares a language with its nextdoor neighbour, which is helpful, particularly from the point of view of direct foreign investment.  This should not be undermined by something that appears to create a level playing field but which instead creates greater inequality. </p><p>  I wish to make a final observation on creating equality in Ireland, particularly in terms of housing in the region in which I reside.  In the east of the country, when a person is unable to obtain a home, he or she will, as a consequence, be unable to find employment without losing benefits.  Mr. Richelle has referred to the matter and is right.  The Chairman will be glad to know that I will not continue on that matter.  However, I look forward to having an opportunity to debate these issues with anybody anywhere and until such time as the European Union and individual member states recognise that these issues will have a major impact on our economic and social performance.</p></speech>

For many years I have been a member of the committee and had an interest in European affairs.  For as long as I can remember we have talked about jobs and growth.  They have been priorities for many Presidencies and are usually contained, either in the super text or subtext, in the priorities outlined at the beginning of each Presidency.  Notwithstanding the various strategies developed and the various programmes and initiatives put in place, the financial crisis still bedevils us.  Sometimes we tend to talk about jobs and growth in isolation, but I do not suggest this was always the case.  We tend to believe jobs and growth are disconnected from the economic model, the single currency and the overall economic and political agenda.  We look at the issue from a high level and develop macro strategies, but I am not sure such a view has the desired effect of spurring growth leading to job creation.  In the first instance, one must protect and retain what one has because advances take place and some technologies become outdated.  Therefore, the first thing one must do is replace such systems as they become redundant and the next obvious step is to find new advances.  To that end, a practical approach has not been taken to entrepreneurship.  We have various framework programmes that seek to provide assistance for entrepreneurs, but I am not sure there is enough of a connection with entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises.  The director general will know better than I do that the bulk of people employed across Europe work in small to medium enterprises.  I do not think we give enough support to the micro sector.</p><p>  Let us look at the regulatory burden placed on some entrepreneurs when starting out.  Many of them want to plan their path to success, but if they have to prepare a business case or develop a plan, they will not start at all.  Fortunately, some entrepreneurs fail to see the barriers and often avoid and ignore regulations for a while.  It is unfortunate that entrepreneurs must do so.  We must create a culture that allows a business to develop its roots and then subject it to the rigours of the regulatory regime, the costs involved and various demands made of them.  If we are serious about encouraging job creation and growth, we must start at the beginning with the micro sector by assisting it to overcome those hurdles which are necessarily in place for larger enterprises or when a business is up and running.</p></speech>

I will try to limit myself to the technical and explanatory issues rather than the politics.  </p><p>  On equality, in this framework of macroeconomic governance in the European semester we have introduced inequality to the scoreboard by comparing the lowest quintile with the other quintiles.  From this, we see that inequality has grown throughout Europe, in all countries, during the crisis.  There is no exception to this.  Inequality is not only discussed within the European semester.  In a lot of areas served by the Commission we issue communications, statistics and draw attention to the issue.  We have referred to the numbers of women on boards of companies, for example, and also to the position of the Roma community, the biggest minority group in the world.  There is huge potential within that community in the context of the labour market, but there is inquality all over the place.  We try to address various inequalities in a specific way.  Within this European semester, as I said, we do it mainly through the GINI co-efficients and comparing the lowest quintile with the upper quintiles.</p><p>  We communicate in different ways, which also means that we have different means to address the issue.  There are various means available to pursue a number of policy targets.  In the social field the main means is the European Social Fund, ESF, which is, essentially, the European employment fund.  We call it a social fund, but it serves to keep people in employment or guide them to it.  For the first time, each country has been advised to use at least 20% of its ESF allocation for social integration activities.  The funds are to be used to address people who are further away from the labour market and need specific attention.  We now have a European instrument for aid for the most deprived, which is the successor to food aid.  We can also give material and immaterial assistance to people who are on the margins of society.  There are specific means devoted to these areas.  Slowly, we are moving beyond the employment field into the realm of the social issues underlying unemployment.  These are examples of how we address inequality.  Each and every member state has an important role to play.  We have asked those member states which have large Roma populations to develop a Roma integration strategy which should outline how they intend to address the question of integration, including spending some of their own resources. </p><p>  We do not have a short list of critical factors for growth.  The handbook for growth is not available.  General economic knowledge, good public administration, a good banking system, transparency and other factors all play a role.  There is no list of critical factors other than what comes out of economic science.  There is no handbook in this respect.</p></speech>

Surely it should be possible to identify a lack of growth or at least those areas most affected by the lack of growth and the contributory factors.</p></speech>

I do not want to engage in a game of ping pong about who is responsible, but the way we have built Europe means that there is little power at European level to promote growth and a lot depends on the position of individual member states.  That is why we issued the Europe 2020 strategy document and asked member states to have that discussion about positioning themselves within the framework of globalisation and demographic change.  Each country must define its factors for success in that regard.  At a European level, there is too much divergence between the member states to allow for the drawing up of one solid list of growth factors.  Through this European semester and macroeconomic governance, we have identified the minimum budgetary disequilibrium, for instance, which would be a cause for concern.  Imbalances of an unsustainable nature are also being addressed in debt reviews.  We try to get country-specific information and then to come up with recommendations to remedy the situation.</p><p>  We do not rate the performance of individual countries, but there is a big appreciation for what Ireland has done.  That has been expressed publicly and repeatedly.  The fact that a country in difficulty has, by its own decisions, albeit with some help from the European Union, come out of a programme is commendable.  Now we go back to the normal channels, but the Commission will continue to examine what is going on here and try in the framework of the European semester and on the basis of a thorough analysis to hold up a mirror to Ireland, as it does to all other member states, and ask if its policies are appropriate.  The fact that the country has come out of a programme is a sign of real progress.  We expect the financial markets to trust in Ireland again in order that it can take its own decisions on the course to be followed.</p><p>  I agree that housing is a problematic issue.  To a certain extent, the European Regional Development Fund could be of assistance in this area, depending on the specifics of a housing programme.  We are trying in this new programming period not to disburse the funds separately.  Instead of countries applying for funds from either the agricultural development fund, the maritime development fund, the Social Fund, the Cohesion fund or the Regional Development Fund, we are encouraging member states to come up with proposals for integrated territorial development, including infrastructure.  That could include, under certain conditions, housing.  Much depends on the willingness of each member state to do this.  Each fund is normally registered and administered by a separate ministry and if they want to play the game with their own directorate general in the European Commission, this integrated territorial development will not happen automatically.  It starts with an integrated approach in the member states which will receive an integrated answer from us.  We are discussing these issues with each member state.</p><p>  On the question of job creation, there is no easy answer.  One thing is clear, however - governments do not create jobs.  Job creation is a matter for the private sector and what governments are supposed to do is to create a conducive environment.  There is a lot involved, including the quality of public administration.  In fact, during the crisis we have looked more closely at the quality of public administration in member states and sometimes we have been appalled by the lack of<i> savoir faire </i>or knowledge about how to do things, the lack of speed in decision making, the lack of co-ordination in coming to conclusions on interrelated issues and so forth.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Mark Redmond, chief executive of the Irish Tax Institute, who is accompanied by Ms Cora O'Brien, Mr. Billy Irwin and Ms Sandra Clarke.  Mr. Redmond and Ms O'Brien will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that mobile telephones must be switched off as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment in the committee room.</p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Since we agreed to accept the witnesses' request to appear before the committee, correspondence has issued from the Department of Finance stating that there will be an amendment to the change and file regime in 2014.  However, following the consultation process, the Minister has decided that he will not introduce a Committee Stage amendment this year and that the new filing system will not come into place in 2014.  He has indicated that the change will take place in 2015.  I wanted to let Mr. Redmond know that if he had not been informed of it already.  I invite Mr. Redmond to make his opening remarks, followed by Ms O'Brien.</p></speech>

We really appreciate the engagement of members of this committee and their colleagues in the Oireachtas in the consultation process over the past months which has led to today's welcome announcement.  This announcement will be very good news for small businesses throughout the country.  I also thank the hundreds of members of Irish Tax Institute who engaged with members of the committee and other Members of the Oireachtas on this issue.  I am joined by Ms Sandra Clarke, Irish Tax Institute council member and a tax practitioner with BCC accountants in Ashbourne; Mr. Billy Irwin, a member of the institute and a tax practitioner with OBI in Limerick; and Ms Cora O'Brien who is director of policy with the institute.</p><p>  The pay and file system ensures that 600,000 income tax returns are filed correctly and on time every year.  The compliance rate is 98% and the money due is paid on time.  The pay and file system has been described as a public private partnership that works.  It delivers for the State year in, year out because of the collective effort of the three groups, namely, the self-assessed taxpayers, Revenue and the tax adviser community.</p><p>  We understand why change was proposed.  The Government wants as much certainty as is reasonably possible in regard to tax outturns when presenting future budgets in mid-October.  However, because of their understanding of the pressures facing the self-employed and small businesses and their knowledge of the pay and file system, our members explained why there should be no change to that system.</p></speech>

The process begins for us in January of each year when we send out a questionnaire to our clients asking them to complete the return with the information we need to ensure the accuracy and completeness of returns.  This process takes a few months as the level of questioning is quite detailed and a good deal of information must be gathered to accompany the questionnaire in order to complete the return.</p><p>  In addition to that, the taxpayers and we, the advisers, need to get information from third party intermediaries to complete the returns.  This information is only made available to us very late in the day.  To give an example, if somebody has a United Kingdom property and a UK tax return to complete, we need the information from their tax return for 5 April, prior to the filing date, and they have until January after the October deadline to file that return.</p><p>  To give members an idea of how complex tax legislation has become in recent years, in 2003 the tax return form had 347 possible boxes to be completed.  In 2012, that figure has reached a staggering 635, which shows the enormous changes that have taken place in tax legislation in the past decade.</p><p>  If estimates are used in returns, that will lead to a good deal of going back and forth with Revenue to correct those returns.  It will also lead to inaccurate returns and in some cases, if those returns are not corrected, it will fall back on the small businessperson.  That could lead to them being selected for audit.  Members will see on their screen an example of a car dealer, called "Michael", based in the midlands.  If he has an average pay and file bill of &euro;40,000, does his best to get all the information to his adviser but despite best efforts it does not happen and the return is wrong, is selected for audit three years later and an underpayment of &euro;8,000 is discovered, there could be an additional cost to "Michael" of a penalty of approximately &euro;1,600 and interest at 8% per annum, coming to &euro;1,920, giving a total additional cost of &euro;3,520, which is a good deal of additional pressure on the small business payer.  Mr. Irwin will explain the cash collection side and the payment of tax.</p></speech>

I work in a pay and file system that works very well because of the input of three groups, namely, the taxpayer, the Revenue and the tax adviser.</p><p>  I will concentrate on the pay side of pay and file.  The collection is outstanding.  It is an extremely effective mechanism that has worked and been developed over the years among all the stakeholders.</p><p>  The collection of tax fits into a natural cycle.  Good advice has always been that if one has money to collect, collect it when the money is available.  To illustrate that, I will fit the cycle of farming to the collection of the taxes, and it can be applied to many small businesses.  In farming, income is typically low in the earlier part of the year.  There is a good deal of expenditure and a lot of work carried out.  Contractor, veterinary and other expenses are incurred in the early part of the year but the flow of income starts to run from late April, May and June through to the autumn.  The expenditure is incurred in the early part of the year but the contractors, the veterinarians and the small businesses that supply them are paid over the course of that income flow during the summer.</p><p>  The suggestion to bring pay and file into June and that people will be asked to pay taxes on money they have not got is a high risk strategy that endangers breaking a system that is working very well.  People are attuned to the cash flow cycle in October.  They manage their businesses with that in mind but, most importantly, they have earned the money to pay their bills and their taxes, and they are doing it to a very high degree of compliance.</p></speech>

Ninety per cent of our members said that small businesses would suffer major cash flow problems, and two thirds said that business activity would be reduced, in some cases even to the point of closure.  It would be extremely difficult for businesses to pay 90% of their full year's tax liability earlier than the current October or November dates.</p><p>  As well as the cash flow problems my colleague has spoken about, there would also have been a great deal of risk in introducing these changes for a number of parties - taxpayers, advisers and Revenue, but also the Exchequer.  We have talked about the financial consequences for taxpayers of getting the return wrong - interest, penalties, the risk of an audit.  Tax advisers would have lost accuracy in the preparation of returns in a shorter timeframe, and Revenue would have had to deal with many more amendments to returns as taxpayers try to rectify errors after the event.  For the Exchequer, there would have been more and not less uncertainty from the proposed move.</p></speech>

This institute and business organisations have demonstrated that change would have been bad for business.  It would have had a negative impact on the self-employed.  It would have damaged a pay and file process that delivers but, fundamentally, it could have hindered the economic recover that is under way.</p></speech>

I propose that we take ten minute slots.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  To get the business under way, Mr. Redmond has been involved in the consultation process with the Department of Finance on the issue and the concern is that what is a system change could result in a credit flow problem.  We all have to adjust to system changes but the net consequence of this change can be a credit flow problem.  From Mr. Redmond's engagement with the Department of Finance, what does he understand to be its rationale for moving this forward?</p></speech>

That is the only driver that has been articulated.  When we look at that, and this has been a surprising feature of the consultation process for many participants, the amount of tax we are talking about is less than 4% of the total tax yield in any given year and because of investment in both personnel and technology, we have got much better at projecting tax outturns than might have been the case previously.  If one were being pessimistic, one might have an under or over-estimate of between 3% and 5% but that is 3% and 5% of 4%, so to speak.  That is what is at stake.</p></speech>

Ms O'Brien spoke about certainty.  We all try to get certainty but how has the modelling improved?  Ms Clarke stated that the forms have become more elaborate.  How has that modelling given greater certainty?  I think the point Mr. Redmond is trying to make, putting aside the credit issues, is that it does not matter whether the filing took place in June or October because the modelling is so good the predictability can be got anyway.  Mr. Redmond might explain to us how the modelling is done.</p></speech>

First, there has been an investment in greater economic know-how and statistical analysis both in the Department of Finance and Revenue.  Second, and more important, is the public private partnership aspect.  Business and taxpayers are providing a great deal more information now to Revenue, primarily electronically, which allows for far greater analysis, projections and certainty in terms of what the future may hold.</p></speech>

With businesses starting up and collapsing, that is probably as close as one will get to 100% compliance.  What compliance difficulties are envisaged in moving to a date in June?</p></speech>

Ms Clarke and Mr. Irwin have outlined the coalface reality.  A fundamental issue is the amount of pressure that businesses are under.  I have a graph showing that around 5,000 tax advisers manage around 600,000 personal tax returns.  That number is increasing but the process is pretty tight.  If the process were accelerated earlier in the year there is a risk that full and accurate information would not be available and, therefore, the quality of information would be impaired.</p></speech>

One can apply the same theory to the tourism industry in terms of cashflow.  For example, asking guesthouses to estimate and pay their tax liability in June, when their season has just begun, would, I believe, be penal in the extreme.  I shall outline one of the difficulties that might arise which could pose a danger to the system and lead to a breakdown.  We are all interested in ensuring the system works, because it is in everybody's interest, including the taxpayer's.  If the filing date had been last June, rather than October, then people would have filed their returns and paid their taxes for 2013.  They would have been required to estimate the tax liability because they are in the middle of the year, but they do not have the benefit of the big investments that have been made in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with regard to estimating.  Last June they would have made very modest estimates, and tax returns as a result would have been considerably lower, as things have proved.  Then we would run into the issues of penalties and charges that arise due to underpayment because things improved later in the year.  That is a difficult position for taxpayers.</p></speech>

Now that the proposal has gone to 2015, are the concerns different because the date has been pushed back?</p></speech>

Let us remember that there are a wide variety of taxpayers and that some information will have to come from other agents.  A partnership must give information to a number of tax advisers, and the same applies to foreign and investment income.  All of that information must come from third party intermediaries, and this takes time to collect.  Aside from that, in a small accountancy practice, the period between January and June - the earlier part of the year - is taken up with filing P35s or employee returns.  A larger client will typically be a corporate entity so it must make bigger investment decisions and wants its audit done quickly.  If the period runs into April or May then other work will need to be done.  In March we start writing to the taxpayer to seek information; some practices write earlier.  Accounts must also be prepared for persons in a trade.</p></speech>

On behalf of the  Fianna F&aacute;il Party I welcome today's announcement by the Minister that there will be no change for 2014 at least.  I regard the announcement as a stay of execution.  The Minister has again reaffirmed in his statement his intention to bring forward the pay and file deadline.  There should be no loss of momentum in the efforts made by him and the members of the institute.  In recent weeks the Government took notice and agreed not to implement any change next year.  Credit for that is largely due to the institute, the professional accountancy bodies and representatives of small businesses.  All of those groups made the effort to contact individual Members of the Oireachtas.  That led to the making of a Government decision in record time, because the consultation period ended only 12 days ago.</p><p>  I would like a final decision to be made on the matter, because an element of uncertainty remains.  For example, uncertainty will remain for the next year about the arrangements for 2015.  We should not allow the matter to drift well into 2014 without knowing the position for the following calendar year.  I regard the matter as important.  </p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il made a submission on the issue in which we recommended no change in the pay and file arrangements and substantiated the reasons.  It is my view that the current system operates on the basis of goodwill.  In many respects, members of the institute and the professional accountants who provide taxation services carry out the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the nature of the self-assessment system and it is one of the very successful features of the Irish tax system.  Any change must be carefully thought through.</p><p>  I have a few questions.  What percentage of returns are done online?</p></speech>

Let me give a practical example of what would happen if we split pay and file dates.  If I advised a client in the month of June that he or she had a tax balance of &euro;3,000 and would have to pay a preliminary tax for the current year of &euro;30,000, that would mean a total payment of &euro;33,000.  It would be much easier for him or her to make the payment in October because he or she will have the cashflow to do so.  I do not know of any client who would write a cheque for &euro;33,000 - admittedly, it would be by direct payment - who would not want it all explained again a number of months later.  In addition, he or she would have addressed his tax for the year.  Splitting dates would mean a regurgitation of almost the entire process.  The client will be committed to the payment but will still want it properly explained.  If any of us were told now that something would happen in the future, we would live with the information.</p></speech>

The funnel is simply too narrow to operate pay and file for personal tax returns at the same time.  Plus, there is the cashflow cost for small businesses.</p></speech>

Mr. Irwin outlined the requirements that must be filed.  People must pay preliminary tax for the current year and, to avoid surcharges and penalties, that must be at least 90% of the final liability for the current year or 100% of last year's liability or 105% of the year preceding that.  People must also tidy up issues relating to the previous year.  The farming community, for example, has no idea in June how to estimate liability for the year.  Much depends on factors that are outside their control, such as weather and harvesting.

There could be a variation from forecasts of 15%, amounting to &euro;150 million.  This is 0.4% of total tax revenue and, in the context of a budget, it is around the margin of error.  It is not significant enough to warrant the enormous destruction and risks outlined in the submission during the formal process and again today.  The most important point to take away from today is that the Department of Finance statement is a victory but only a temporary stay of execution.  We have no absolute certainty about the arrangements for next year.  For the members of the Irish Tax Institute and other professionals providing taxation advice and services and for the businesses, they need certainty over a longer period of time.  The witnesses should go back to the Minister with that point of view and maintain the pressure to get a final decision.</p><p>  The decision to bring the budget forward to mid-October was a Government decision even if it flowed from the two-pack.  The legal requirement was that a draft budget be given to the European Commission by mid-October.  The Irish Government decided to bring the whole thing forward and have the publication of the budget in mid-October.  It is incumbent to work with the stakeholders to deal with this issue and the risks on the Government part in sticking with the current regime, which works well, is minimal.  It is not worth making any changes because we are risking the whole functioning of the system.</p></speech>

At the time, we moved from a year-end of April to a year-end at December but we maintained the ten-month filing date.  We talked earlier about splitting the pay and file date.  When we moved to the calendar year, the decision was taken that everything should happen on the one date.  We had one preliminary tax date, one filing date and another date for the balance of the tax.  This amounts to three different dates and they were brought into one date in October, which has worked well.  Everyone understands it.</p></speech>

The Revenue online system, ROS, is what makes the system work.  It was a major investment but it works.  I am long enough in the business to remember assessment and appeal.

The irony is lost on no one that, in order to provide more certainty for Government, we expect 600,000 people to do this in the middle of the year and to get it right.  What was the response of the Department when the witnesses talked about cash flow?  Where does the Department expect people to find the money to pay the full year's tax in the middle of June?  I am curious about the Department's response with regard to a case where someone makes an error in June and how it can justify the volume of penalties described by Ms Sandra Clarke when we expect people, based on the new pay and file returns, to guesstimate.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, we consulted not only the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners but also this committee and other Members of the Oireachtas.  While I am fully cognisant of Deputy McGrath's observations, the consultation process has, in our opinion, in terms of the announcement made today, worked.  It was a learning process for us all.</p><p>  As stated by the Chairman and Deputy McGrath, it remains for all stakeholders to address the 3% to 4% of total tax yield issue.  The other point made is critical.  We have made public before this committee that the tax system is weighted against the business person in a fundamentally inequitable way.  As was seen from the example on screen which Ms Clarke took us through, business people are being hammered in terms of heavy interest and penalties.  If they overpay their tax it is nigh on possible for them to get any interest on that overpayment, which is a fundamental problem for small business in terms of the manner in which the tax system operates.</p></speech>

What responses, if any, were obtained from the departmental officials who engaged in the consultation process?  Was their response that this is not their problem?  Fundamentally, people are expected to pay their tax returns at the end of June but they do not have that cashflow now.  A shorter tax year might work if a person only had to pay what was reaped in until the end of June.  Given that we were going to expect people to pay tax returns up to 31 December in respect of money which they have not yet taken in, from where did Revenue expect them to get that money?</p></speech>

In fairness, he has spoken today.  He said he listened to the people who engaged in the consultation process and made his announcement on that basis.

Their presentation, in terms not only of content but style, was excellent and engaging.  While I cannot speak for everybody present, there is a great deal of support in this committee and the Oireachtas in relation to the demand.  I commend the witnesses on their lobbying campaign and the information they presented which provides us with the tools with which to make arguments to the Minister.  I welcome the announcement by Government today that this proposal is off the table for next year.  It is to be hoped - I do not wish to use the word "U-turn" because it then becomes a political game - it is a way of moving away from this issue altogether.  I believe that if the Minister has taken it off the table, he obviously has listened to the concerns and in doing so will find it impossible to put it back on the table next year.  It is to be hoped today's announcement is a face-saving exercise and that if it is off the table for a year, by the time we come to it next year, it will be off the table permanently.</p><p>  Many of the issues have been addressed but I would like to put a couple of questions to the witnesses.  The Small Firms Association has commented on this matter and has stated that for every week the payment date is brought forward, there will be a funding cost of at least &euro;1 million and that bringing in earlier tax payment dates will destroy jobs and damage prospects for recovery in the domestic sector.  The fact that statement is included in today's presentation would indicate the institute concurs with it.  Perhaps Mr. Redmond would elaborate on that cost of &euro;1 million per week if the Government were to bring tax payment dates forward.</p></speech>

That is the basis on which the Small Firms Association has estimated the aggregate cost to small business of the implications of bringing forward the payment date.</p></speech>

The last thing we want to do is damage the economic recovery under way in this country.</p></speech>

The documentation provided includes live feedback from chartered tax advisers.  As stated by the Small Firms Association, if the payment date were brought forward, it could result in job losses.  The accountancy sector could also suffer as a result of job losses.  I refer in this regard to the feedback from the practice in Cork in particular which states that tax advisers would have to cram a year's worth of work into six months, which means it would be unsustainable for a firm to retain accountants for the other six months.  How real is that?</p></speech>

While those employees would be needed to work some overtime in the initial six months, there would little or no work during the other months.  Staff holidays are normally taken in the months of July and August because it is difficult to engage with clients over the summer months, in particular small family-run businesses in respect of which it is impossible to get information during those two months because, perhaps, one spouse may be looking after children while on school holidays.  In the months of September, October and into mid-November, we deal in the main with tax compliance.  If all of that is moved back to the first six months of the year, there will be no work for employees from June to Christmas.  The introduction of this measure would definitely lead to staff being let go.</p></speech>

While the issue for this year has been resolved and we will continue to pursue it in the year ahead, I would be concerned if it is the case that one third of people are sticking their heads in the sand.  I know from other feedback that many only engage in the last few days in October, which puts pressure on the industry.  If it is going to cost &euro;1 million per week for every week the date is brought forward, we will need to dig a very big hole for these people to stick their heads in.  Does the feedback indicate this is systemic across advisers?</p></speech>

I think it is a question of &euro;30 million from a total of &euro;37 billion.  That is what we are talking about.</p></speech>

Every Deputy will agree that there is a need to repeat what one is saying.  Perhaps some members of this committee repeat themselves a bit too often.</p></speech>

I appreciate their presentation.  Perhaps I will sound like a broken record if I focus on the issues of compliance and cash flow.  As Mr. Redmond said, we are talking about &euro;30 million in money terms.  During the institute's consultation process, what was identified as the reason this is anticipated to be brought forward?  As a first-time Deputy, I do not think anyone said at a parliamentary party meeting that the taxation and pay and file dates should be brought forward in order to comply with the two-pack.  If this was not created at political level, I imagine it was done by the Department.  Has the Department explained to the institute why it wants to do this?</p></speech>

As the Chairman has allowed me to do so, I will reiterate that we are talking about a tiny percentage of the tax yield figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1048" speakername="Arthur Spring" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013112000008#G00700"><p>Historically, forecasting is not something we have got right in this country.  Over the last three years, however, the Department of Finance's projection of the likely tax take has been very accurate by comparison with how it ended up.  Over the past four or five years, there was one major year when the projection was inaccurate.  In 2008, the projected return was something like &euro;3 billion but it ended up being approximately &euro;1 billion-----</p></speech>

It is hard to conceive that between 2007 and 2009, this country lost one third - 33% - of its tax yield.  To be honest, nobody saw that coming.  We are in a very different place right now.  If one examines the income tax figures for the past three years, one will find that the projections have been right.  The accuracy of the projections has ranged from 0.8% to 2.3%.  That improvement has resulted from the stabilising of the economic position, thankfully, as the recovery has got under way.  It has also resulted from greater investment in information technology and human resources on the forecasting side.</p></speech>

I am a former banker.  I own a small business.  If my accountant asked me to project sales levels in my business, I would have to point out they are largely determined by the tourism season and by weather forecasting.  Anybody who has read <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i> will recall Henchard saying that only &quot;a fool&quot; would bet on what the weather will be.  I would not like to have any hand, act or part in the idea of interest and penalties kicking in after the suggested date.  As a nation, we want to be compliant.  That is why I am happy for the date to stay where it is.  This proposal might be appropriate for the purposes of projection, but I am not convinced about the benefits of the amount of money we are talking about.  To look at it objectively from a financial perspective, the Department's coffers might take in another &euro;30 million, as well as the associated interest and penalties, but that is a small amount of money in the context of the hardship it would cause.  It does not stack up, in my opinion.  We will work with the institute and the Department on this matter again next year.  When Ms Feehily comes before us again, we will press upon her the idea that businesses need to keep the date where it is at the moment.  I thank the representatives again for the good presentation they have made.  If there is anything we can do to help this organisation, I am sure we will try to do so along the way.</p></speech>

If one wanted a template for how to consult Members of the Oireachtas, we have certainly seen a good example today.  They have made their case in a constructive and factual manner, rather than being emotional about it.  Their presentation has certainly helped me to get to grips with this issue quickly.  I congratulate those who prepared it.  From an early stage, my attitude to this issue has been "if it is not broken, don't fix it".  If the forecasts are right and the money is coming in, why start tampering with the system?  It is pointed out in the documentation that has been supplied to us that the previous date change, from 31 January to 31 October, was implemented over a three-year period.  The filing date moved back a month each year.  If there is an overwhelming argument for moving the date back once more, would it be appropriate to use that mechanism or template again?  I am not saying it would be ideal for the institute's members if the date were moved back by a month each year, but if the date has to be moved, perhaps it would be more manageable if it were done in this manner.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cora O'Brien" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013112000008#G01200"><p>We probably ended up with a better and simpler system at the end of the process of moving to doing this on a calendar-year basis.  We preserved our filing period.  It was the right thing to do.  It is hard to see how this change, which would inflict pain on small businesses, would result in a better system for them.  We have explained how there would be a risk of inaccuracies.  We do not want anybody else in the system to go through that pain.  The previous change was a little different in that respect.</p></speech>

If a calendar-year approach is adopted this year but is changed next year, it could affect their whole psyche.  The current system suits them because it works.  That is why the change to the calendar-year basis worked as well as it did.</p></speech>

The amount of milk a cow produces is related to the weather, just as the success of the tourism industry is.  I accept it would be very difficult for those involved in those industries to estimate in June what their income will be and pay on that basis.  This is probably an example of the type of reform I want to see in this House.  We should have an opportunity to discuss the implications of the draft budget and possibly make amendments to it before it is implemented.  We should be striving to make reforms that lead to that kind of process.  The budget that is published should be seen as a draft.  We should have time to discuss and debate it with the experts in advance of the implementation date.  This is a fine example of how that can be done in a positive manner.</p><p>  I would like the witnesses to help me get my head around one of the examples they used.  Would the person in the example not have an opportunity to tidy up their tax affairs?  When one makes a payment, one is required to look back early the following year to ascertain whether it was accurate and possibly make another payment on that basis.  I am always worried about these things.</p></speech>

If one is dealing with a set of figures and an estimate has to be made, the estimate is made and there would be an intention to return to the issue and have it fixed.  However, one does not know what is happening in Michael Maguire's day-to-day business and the position moves on the following year.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in the real world, Michael Maguire will have moved on and will be worried about the following year.  He may not have the wherewithal or time to re-examine the issue.  In such circumstances, one must ask why he should be pressed to provide information at an early date and subsequently correct it.  Why not allow him time to compile the correct information and submit it on time?</p></speech>

Tax systems should make it as convenient and easy as possible for the taxpayer to meet his or her obligations.  Taxpayers should not be given a false or an early deadline and asked to correct their tax return after the event.  They should be given enough time to get it right first time.</p></speech>

At this time of year, I meet many people, particularly in Galway, who are feeling stressed as a result of their experience with the pay and file process.

As our profession is a broad church, I cannot state with certainty that my next point is true of all our members.  A large number of our members are doing this work for nothing, out of a sense of good will and loyalty to small business owners who have been under severe pressure for the past five years.  I am not seeking sympathy but stating a fact.  Our members are helping clients who are in severe economic difficulty to meet their compliance obligations, deal with Revenue audits and banks and manage serious cash liquidity problems.  To answer the Senator's question as to whether they understand the psychology involved, they certainly do because they are living it every day with the owners of small businesses.  While this imposes a strain on the system, it is one that is being borne and we get on with life.</p></speech>

I note there has been an increase in the number of tax audits on subcontractors or one-man shows, particularly those who are contracted to multinational companies.  This creates stress.  I did not know that one-man shows must establish companies to deal with multinational companies.  In two cases that have been brought to my attention, the individual had to bring another family member into the operation to form a company.  One of the individuals I have encountered has multiple sclerosis.  The tax audit has increased stress levels and had a knock-on effect on his health.  How do tax advisers work with such clients and Revenue?  What can be done to improve the position for such people?  This is highly stressful for them.</p></speech>

The Senator has also made a point about certainty.  Taxpayers deserve certainty about how their businesses operate from a tax perspective.  Uncertainty is unhelpful to the system.</p><p>  There are a number of checks and balances in the system to protect the taxpayer, although our view is that they are not sufficient.  There is, for example, a charter of taxpayers' rights and obligations in place.  One element of the charter is a presumption of honesty to which all taxpayers are entitled.</p></speech>

We have had a great deal of feedback both from contractors and our members who deal with them.  We have made representations to Revenue in which we stress that while we fully appreciate that Revenue has an obligation and a requirement in a self-assessment system to audit and carry out checks, people also need to know what are the ground rules.  These rules must be applied consistently across all sectors to avoid surprises and ensure everybody is treated in the same way.  If there is an issue to be dealt with and behaviour of any description needs to be changed, let us deal with it, move on and make the rules clear in order that everybody will know what they are doing.</p><p>  The Senator is correct that the profile of those involved in the contractor sector shows that they tend to be young and have young families and many of them have debt.  There has been a great deal of stress around the project to which the Senator refers.  As recently as last week, we made a comprehensive submission of 17 pages featuring much comment and feedback from people on the ground who are living with the project at the moment.</p></speech>

In all of the cases I have come across taxes were filed in previous years.

The issue of the contractors is tricky because of the people involved, who are young and do not have any money.  There is a practical problem with getting a payment plan in place for them.  In general, our members have found that Revenue has been flexible on payment plans in other situations and where they have looked for instalment arrangements, these arrangements have been forthcoming.  The terms vary depending on the plans involved, but there is flexibility in the system allowing people pay by instalment if necessary.  That is a feature of the contractors' project.</p></speech>

As there are also employees associated with these, the number involved is greater.  This is not an issue of compliancy, but there is probably a risk to compliancy rather than enhanced compliancy.  Another issue that has popped up is a concern with regard to liquidity and credit flow for the future.  Different comments have been made with regard to the budget in October, but some industries have given the measures in it a massive welcome.  The retail area has certainly welcomed them.</p><p>  The Irish Tax Institute deals with tax for some retail businesses and I am sure the tax returns reflect that the retail sector has had two good quarters and will probably have its best quarter in years this quarter because of sentiment and the measures now put in place.  I was talking to a newspaper owner at an event yesterday evening and he told me advertising is coming in for the Christmas market now, but in the past the industry would not have even seen that in December.  There are two sides to every coin and for Irish Tax Institute members scheduling of tax returns is creating problems in some areas.  </p><p>  What I recommend now is for the clerk to the committee to prepare a draft report.  We are extraordinarily busy, but now that we have the year end timeline the urgency has been lifted from the situation.  The clerk will prepare a draft report along the points I have outlined for the committee and bring it to it before Christmas.  The committee's recommendation will be to lay that report before the House so that we can have some discussion on it in the new year, because we do not want to let the issue fall off the agenda.  The report will also be sent to the Minister for Finance and the Department, to Revenue and to the Economic Management Council.  Therefore, it will not just be an issue that was just dealt with today.  We will try to keep the issue active in the future also.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Redmond, Ms Clarke, Mr. Irwin and Ms O'Brien for coming before the committee. </p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Peter Power, the executive director of UNICEF Ireland.  He is familiar to all of us, having been a Member of the House for so many years.  I think he was elected to the House in 2002, like myself.  He is the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He has just returned from the Philippines this morning.  It took about four or five flights to get from Tacloban, where he was based, to Cebu to Manila and finally back to Dublin via Abu Dhabi so I thank him for coming before the committee.  I know he is probably in another time zone.</p><p>  This meeting has been arranged for some time but it is very timely.  We have all seen the images on our television screens, particularly the aftermath of one of the worst typhoons in living memory that has devastated many regions of the Philippines, left more than 4,000 people dead and displaced more than four million people.  It is quite clear from the television footage that millions of people will need humanitarian assistance.  Of course, children are always the victims of these tragedies and that is where UNICEF comes in.  It has done a great job so far in highlighting the cause of children, particularly in the aftermath of such tragedies where many children are left orphaned or where many parents are looking for their lost children as a result of the devastation.  Mr. Power travelled to the Philippines a number of days ago and has come back this morning.  We are delighted to have him here.</p><p>  We will also be discussing the ongoing situation in Syria.  Obviously, that is something that has gone off the television screens at the moment but that is what happens with the media.  It moves from one incident to another but people are still suffering and very much so in Syria where more than 100,000 people have been killed.  Mr. Power will talk about Syria as well.  Obviously, the unfolding situation in the Philippines is very much the topic of the moment.  I call Mr. Power to make his presentation to the committee.  He will also answer questions from members.  I welcome Mr. Power and his representative from UNICEF Ireland, Ms Nikita White.</p></speech>

With the permission of the Chairman and members, I would like to begin with the Philippines typhoon disaster because it is so timely and urgent.</p></speech>

In 2012, the last reported full year of our activities in this regard, UNICEF provided help in 286 emergencies in 79 countries, covering everything from clean water and sanitation to schooling, nutrition, vaccinations and counselling for those traumatised by conflict and disaster.  UNICEF's core commitments for children in humanitarian action constitute UNICEF's central policy on how to uphold the rights of children affected by humanitarian crises.  No one is affected more by these crises than children.  Statistically, children and women are 14 times more likely to die during one of these disasters than men.</p><p>  To conclude on a more positive note, tomorrow morning a group of students from the Newpark school in Blackrock will connect with another group of students in the Za'atari refugee camp, Jordan.  I am sure that committee members have visited the camp.  Tomorrow's event will mark the launch of UNICEF's nationwide youth consultation on the post-2015 millennium development goals, MDG, agenda.  My colleague to my left, Ms Nikita White, has co-ordinated the It's About Us! campaign.  Tomorrow afternoon, the T&aacute;naiste will formally launch our new set of interactive CSPE resources, which are designed to inform, inspire and enable young people to discuss the world that they want to see after 2015.  These classroom discussions will connect with the national and regional consultations on what will replace the MDGs in the post-2015 agenda.  The committee has an interest in and input into Ireland's position in the post-2015 discussions.  UNICEF is investing in the innovation and creativity of young people in Ireland to create their vision for the future and to build a world fit for all children.</p><p>  During a visit to Jordan in October, UNICEF met students from Za&rsquo;atari, notably a young girl called Hanan, aged 16 years.  She told us that she would embody the future of her country and that she wanted to rebuild Syria and participate.  We must listen to the voices of these children so that they can contribute to peace, tolerance and reconciliation.  It is only through this investment in children's future that we can secure a Syria at peace.  Only through this investment in children's futures can we protect and rebuild the lives of the children in the Philippines, many of whom have lost their loved ones, their homes and their hope for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013112000004#C00400"><p>I thank Mr. Power for that graphic account of his visit to the Philippines and for updating us on the current situation in Syria.  Some committee members visited the Za'atari refugee camp last June to see it at first hand.  The camp has grown from 15,000 people to 120,000 people.  Jordan is now closing its borders to some refugees, putting more pressure on the camps and the situation in Syria.  We will keep the issue at the top of our agenda.  I commend the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its funding for Syria and the &euro;3 million that it has donated via NGOs to help the Philippine crisis.</p><p>  Mr. Power referred to the $30 million shortfall in UNICEF's work in the Philippines.  How should that shortfall be funded?  Are donor countries giving more or less money than they should in terms of their respective GDPs?  Ireland's &euro;3 million is a great contribution, given our size.  China has only contributed &euro;1 million or &euro;1.5 million.  After Mr. Power replies, I will hand over to Deputy Smith.</p></speech>

Some 50% of the &euro;45 million to which I referred - some $60 million - is part-funded.  According to our initial assessments, this will only get us through the next six months.  We are discussing millions of people.  The amount of money will inevitably increase, possibly into the hundreds of millions of euro, such will be the nature of this prolonged operation.</p></speech>

Like the Chairman, I, too, welcome the great clarity brought by Mr. Power to this humanitarian disaster.  I was struck by much of what he had to say in his presentation in terms of the number of people affected and displaced and, in particular, the following sentence: "I saw the magnitude on families and children which will forever change their lives and haunt me for a lifetime", which sums up this desperate humanitarian disaster.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to welcome the Irish Government's response to date through Irish Aid and to compliment UNICEF and other Irish NGOs and their sister organisations on how quickly they responded after this disaster struck.  I know from my constituency that collections at churches and collection centres last week were very good.  The Filipino community in each county made it their business to link up with and support these efforts.  Yesterday, when listening to an interview with a representative of the World Food Programme, I noted that 600,000 people had not yet been reached in terms of food.  Mr. Power stated that millions are still hungry, which is much more alarming.  I hope I am accurate in saying the figure of 600,000 was mentioned by a representative of the World Food Programme.  It would not give great confidence if that is the base on which such a major organisation is working.</p><p>  In terms of general commentary, there has been no mention of the major earthquake in the Philippines a month ago, by which 350,000 people were affected.  The disaster prone nature of the country adds to the desperate situation there.  A number of Members tabled questions on this issue to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs during Question Time yesterday.  The T&aacute;naiste stated at the time that preparation was under way for the airlift of essential shelter and water sanitation items in the coming days.  I am sure we as a committee would not have a problem in supporting Mr. Power's request for additional support.</p><p>  One of the questions I put to the T&aacute;naiste was whether the UN and its organisations have the capacity to deal with this type of crisis.  During a meeting of this committee last week, Deputy Bernard Durkan asked if we ever learned from previous disasters in terms of response.  I did not know until I got the T&aacute;naiste's reply yesterday that there were so many UN organisations.  There appears to be an organisation under every subheading.  I imagine the response in the initial days is never as co-ordinated as it could be.  Based on media reports, there has been an improvement in terms of reaching people in different regions. Does the UN have the capacity to deal effectively with this type of disaster?</p><p>  We were told last week by officials from the Department that the EU was providing &euro;25 million.  Am I correct that some of this funding will be only provided in the future?  There does not appear to be an urgency in terms of getting aid to the area as rapidly as possible.  I hope I am wrong.  We need to stress at every forum available to us the urgency with which this issue needs to be addressed.  Another issue is that in one of the regions most severely affected, 90% of the people were dependent on fishing for their income and that all their equipment and boats had been smashed and broken.  This means there is a huge community without a means of deriving a livelihood.  Is that particular issue being addressed too?  I know immediate problems are being addressed but what is being done to assist people in returning to normal living into the future?</p><p>  I compliment UNICEF and all the NGOs on the excellent work being done.  Mr. Power's presentation is a powerful message in regard to this huge humanitarian disaster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Power" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013112000005#D00400"><p>I thank Deputy Smith for his contribution.  I will to address the many points he made.  First, the Deputy is correct that there is a large Filipino community in Ireland who are, in my view, highly respected people.  The Filipino people are a lovely people.  UNICEF has a long-standing connection with them.  In many cases, they provide health care services.  I know that many Filipino health care workers, in particular home help providers, provide a fantastic and human service.  We need to show solidarity with them in their time of crisis.</p><p>  The Deputy asked the reason the figures as mentioned by the World Food Programme representative versus the figures I have quoted differ, in respect of which I would like to make two points.  First, the disaster area is huge and is only really visible from the air.  The immediate pictures may have concentrated on the city of Tacloban because it was the only city one could access by aeroplane.  The sheer expanse of the destruction when viewed from a helicopter has to be seen to be believed.  There is no other way of putting it.  I mentioned the other day that it is as if a 20 mile wide steamroller went through the country.  That is the scale of the disaster.  I make that point because there are so many areas that have not yet been reached and will only be reached via helicopters.  The US military has a presence off the coast now and its helicopters are getting food aid and water to the more outlying areas.  The point I am making is that it is difficult to be accurate in terms of the numbers affected but certainly many people do not have food.  A man who was driving me around Tacloban the other day told me he had looted for food to feed his family.  This man was a good man and not a criminal.  He told me that was what people were resorting to because all their belongings had been destroyed in this huge disaster.  It is difficult to be accurate in terms of reporting facts and figures.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked if the UN has the capacity to respond to this disaster.  Only time will tell.  The office of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and his special adviser on humanitarian affairs gave a final report this morning on the Haiti earthquake, in respect of which the statistics are quite interesting.  At the peak of that particular disaster, 2.3 million had been affected and more than 105,000 houses had been destroyed.  In the Philippines 4 million children are affected and 243,000 houses have been wiped out.  That is the scale of this particular disaster.  It is enormous.  I know that Valerie Amos, the head of the Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, recently presented to this committee.  She was in the Philippines last week.  It will be her responsibility and that of her office to co-ordinate all the individual agencies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013112000006#E00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Power.  I suppose the scale and magnitude of the issues in Syria and the Philippines are difficult to take in.  Mr. Power has been graphic in his description of what is happening.  We have seen it on the television but I am unsure whether we get any sense of how it is affecting people thousands of miles away.  At the centre of the problem is the actions of man, whether it is the crazy weather or otherwise.  Other countries could be affected similarly.  Unfortunately, in the case of the Philippines, there was the earthquake to which Mr. Power referred and now this.</p><p>  I notice that the blame game has started within the Philippines.  There were tensions with regard to the Marcos regime, and now the Aquino Government is blaming local government and so on.  It is a question of the structures that are in place.  Mr. Power referred to the scale of the problem.  How do we deal with it if the President is blaming local government but local government has been destroyed?  There are structures in place, including the police and the army.  Are they still operating?  How do they tie in with the rescue effort?  Are they all over the place as well?</p><p>  Mr. Power referred to gender-based violence.  Amid all the devastation, people are being raped.  I cannot understand how people can do this.  UNICEF concentrates on children.  What can be done for the children?  There is a major sex industry in the Philippines.  What can UNICEF do in this regard?  Mr. Power referred to the children that had been displaced, and mentioned the need for power structures to enable contact and so on.  What can UNICEF do to try to get those families back in touch with each other?  Is it the case that these children are now orphans?  We have seen graphic pictures on the television screens of children burying bodies.  Where are the adults?  What is happening?  That is why I have asked about the structures that exist, including the army, the police and local government structures.  What is happening in this regard?</p><p>  Mr. Power referred to the administration of polio vaccine.  I imagine there are still structures on the government side.  Is it the case that they do not have immunisation facilities?  Mr. Power made reference in particular to those under two years of age being in danger.  What can be done?</p><p>  I thank Mr. Power for the work he, his organisation and the other aid groups are doing.  We need to start with small steps and start tackling it.  They scale of the devastation is beyond anyone.</p></speech>

One need only read the national daily newspapers, which we are keeping in touch with, over the past week to realise the position.  Clearly, the assignment of blame has started.  Much of it has to do with the fact that local government has been effectively wiped out.  The houses of the people who worked in local government are gone.  Their first and foremost concern has been to look after their immediate families, determine whether they are lost or injured and how to care for their children.  If there were a flood in a constituency one would expect that the local authority would row in and start mobilising, but that was not an option in this area.  The fact that the municipal offices were also wiped out did not help either.</p><p>  UNICEF works through government systems.  We are there at the invitation of the Government, and part of the reason we are effective is that we are able to operate at scale with government systems.  Building up the capacity to deal with this emergency via the government, local and municipal systems is important.  The point is well made.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe is absolutely right about unburied bodies.  It is a big issue.  We walked past corpses and the smell is something I will not forget for a long time.  There is tension in the air over that because people, even in death, should have dignity.  Many do not, and that is causing some tension.  There is a question over whether there should have been a mass burial - something like that took place last Friday or Saturday - while some claim there should be individual graves, and this is causing some tension.</p><p>  Anyway, it comes back to the fact that it is difficult to explain just how much damage has been done.  Everywhere one goes one sees rubble.  There are no buildings any more, only rubble.  It is an unbelievable mess.</p></speech>

They simply have to get out.  There is really nothing left there.  I do not claim to be an expert in the area but possibly the only way to deal with this is a mass evacuation of the entire population followed by an attempt to begin some form of reconstruction, with all that would entail, because the city does not exist any more.  It is gone.</p></speech>

I watched the television report on the news one night recently featuring Mr. Power and his colleague, Barry Andrews.  It was obvious not only how shocking the situation was but how shocked people such as Mr. Power, who has seen disasters before, were by the scale of what has happened.  It was shocking to see young children semi-naked and shivering with the cold with nothing.</p><p>  There was a good deal of criticism about the slow response.  I am glad Mr. Power remarked that Ireland was not one of the countries guilty of that.  We were on the ground within days doing assessment work.  We had the rapid response corps there.  Irish aid arrived in the Philippines before we began to hear complaints of delays.</p></speech>

The most telling image in his presentation was when he made the point that had this disaster occurred in Dublin, the entire city would be uninhabitable.  This brings home the extent of the disaster and when one sees what has happened in the Philippines, it certainly puts into perspective the woes of this country.  I noted Mr. Power's observation that this was the biggest humanitarian crisis ever and yet we have gone from Hurricane Katrina to Haiti and on to the disasters in Pakistan, India and Japan  It is almost as though there is a continuum of disasters and each one that happens takes the emphasis off the previous one, which still is left in dire straits.  Haiti is not resolved by any means  but each of them is contributing to this trend.  There is no doubt there were issues with the Government in the Philippines and its initial reaction in trying to play down exactly what happened.  This certainly did not help.  When one looks at the bigger picture, however, the issues about climate change, population and infrastructure in those countries as well as about the kind of housing in which people were living, they all were recipes for disaster, and when that disaster comes, it is the most vulnerable who are very much affected by it.  These aspects must be taken into account when it comes to reconstruction.  As a society and globally, we must take seriously climate change and population issues as otherwise we simply are creating more disasters for the future.</p><p>  It is difficult to get one's head around the number of organisations that are present in the Philippines.  I read only today the British Royal Navy is looking after one part, the American Navy is looking after another and there are Israeli doctors and relief teams in a third region.  Surely there is a need for a lead organisation when something like this happens.  I do not know whether this should be UNICEF or whoever but surely there can be some agreement that when such disasters occur, there will be a co-ordinating point that will lead on all of this.</p><p>  My final point pertains to Syria, because this is another example in that Syria now has been pushed down the list a little further because of what is happening.  A lot of money was pledged to Syria but a lot remains owing.  What is happening in this regard?</p></speech>

The fact is that men take advantage of situations like this to cause abuse.  It comes down to basic physical things.  In these makeshift camps and shelters - the sports aerodrome there now is to hundreds of families - it is dark at night, there is free movement of people and men always take advantage of those situations.  UNICEF is very mindful of this and we are responsible for that aspect of this crisis.  Our top expert in the area is a lady called Pernille Ironside, who I met over there and only yesterday, she had a meeting with Government agencies to ascertain how we would deal with this.  We will do so in two ways, the first of which is to ensure unaccompanied minors are reunited with their families.  We have just received the latest figures from Tacloban and Ormuc, which confirmed that to date, just three children have been identified and reunited with their families but that there are five unaccompanied children.  These are children who probably have lost both their parents and possibly siblings as well.  We hear terribly tragic stories, perhaps because of families living in clusters, of entire families and first cousins being wiped out in their entirety.  The second initiative UNICEF is undertaking under the leadership of Pernille Ironside is to set up child-friendly spaces and already one area in the city of Tacloban has been identified as being the ideal child-friendly space.  The reason this is so important - members of this joint committee who visited Za'atari refugee camp would have experienced this - is that children are at their happiest when they are with other children and when they are playing.  The absolute need to get children together to play in happy environments is paramount when one is dealing with misery all around, and one of our top priorities is to create these child-friendly spaces.  I hope that deals with Deputy Mitchell's question.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked questions on climate change, on the issue of co-ordination and on the issue of Syria, which I mentioned.  On climate change, I must admit it frightened me that nature could cause destruction on this scale.  It is frightening what nature can do and we have been told repeatedly by the scientists that climate change involves more severe and more frequent weather events of this nature.  Perhaps we have seen the first of many.  As for the co-ordination the Deputy mentioned, it is a significant problem in all these natural disasters.  The natural human desire to help sometimes means that people get in the way of one another and the need for co-ordination has long been recognised.  That was the reason I mentioned the office for the co-ordination for humanitarian affairs, led by Valerie Amos.  While her job is to do that, organisations must be mindful not to engage in duplication and, as I mentioned, that was a huge problem in Banda Aceh.  One must learn from the lessons of the past but it is just humanitarian care at present, that is, food, water, medical supplies, child protection and clearing.  This is before one talks about reconstruction, which is way down the road.  On Syria, coping with the Syrian crisis still is an underfunded programme.  In June of this year, the one millionth child left Syria to the surrounding countries and dealing with this is costing hundreds of millions of euro and dollars every year.  They are underfunded programmes and that is the reason organisations such as UNICEF reach out to people around the world who are concerned about the welfare of children.</p></speech>

As some of my questions have been answered, I will cross them off as that would involve repetition.</p><p>  There was a delay in responding to the typhoon.  What was the weather forecast and the expectation beforehand?  A typhoon was expected, although perhaps not at the level at which it developed.  Had adequate planning taken place prior to the event?  What was the timespan for planning given that we know how difficult weather forecasting can be?  We have a week long weather forecast here which is reasonably accurate.  What is the position there?  Some criticisms were reported in the press regarding how Irish aid especially to NGOs was routed to the Philippines.  We have been assured that the international aid agencies with which they linked were reputable - I have no doubt they are - but when one sees that level of criticism at how the aid is used, it perhaps damages the response of people if there is a question mark.  A comment on that issue might allay some fears around that area.</p><p>  I was in Za'atari refugee camp.  What are the implications for the closing of the Jordanian borders?  Did the international community respond to the difficulties experienced by Jordan in that regard?  We saw at first hand the difficulties being experienced by the sheer numbers of refugees, some of whom were highly professional people.  Many were beginning to seep into Jordanian society and, obviously, some in Jordan saw them as a threat to employment at certain levels given that they had high levels of expertise.  The Jordanians were hoping there would be a better response to the position of the refugees.  The complexity of that camp was quite informative in that it was a society in itself.  The UN leader, whose name I cannot recall, said he was going to develop a city.  He said the camp was a city and that it must be treated as a city by putting in the facilities and the structures of a city and allowing democratic political involvement of the refugees in what was happening.  As it is some time since we were there, I would be interested to hear how it is developing. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013112000008#G00400"><p>I thank Mr. Peter Power for appearing before the committee and being so informative.  It is refreshing to get up-to-date information from people on the ground who have an understanding of the situation and are able to convey that to the rest of us.  What I cannot understand in regard to this particular disaster is that with modern technology now so adequately sophisticated, it is possible to predict a tsunami and all kinds of disasters well in advance, at least 48 hours in advance, although, as my colleague said, 48 hours may not be enough.  Similarly, in the aftermath, I cannot understand how it is not possible to co-ordinate the formation of a grid which is done in agricultural circles on an ongoing basis here and allocate responsibility to particular areas and sectors and have a co-ordinating body.  That can be done within two or three hours.  The satellite communications system is in place.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Power's remarks about the engineers Ireland was able to send out who set up the communications so NGOs could set up the communications network themselves. That is important.  However, a sequence of events needs to take place shortly.  Everybody condemned the looting which American marines came in to quell.  That was a great idea but if people had something to eat, there would be no need for looting in the first place.  That is not in any way to denigrate the efforts of the marines in that situation.  </p><p>  The major issue is what we talked about last week.  When we saw the big heavy helicopters coming, those that could shift large amounts of material in the shortest possible time, we recognised that is how one deals with a task of that nature.  There are two requirements, first, a code must be assigned to the scale and magnitude of the disaster straightaway through communications and, second, how to co-ordinate the efforts.  Forty eight hours is a long time for small children if they are trapped.  I compliment those agencies who were there from the beginning and got in as quickly as possible.  However, I would be critical of the international co-ordination effort in that it did not really respond in the way it should have responded to a disaster of that magnitude.  </p><p>  Returning to the issue of Syria, currently there is a global drain on resources.  In places such as Syria where there is an internal conflict there has to be a recognition at some stage that civilians will suffer heavily unless there is a recognised method whereby they can be an intervention on their behalf.  We have to lay down clear guidelines as to what should happen in the event of no provision being made for them.  Attempts were made to do this in Bosnia but they failed and we know that they failed in Srebrenica also.  The safe havens failed simply because the international community did not live up to its commitments and expectations and, as a result, many died.  That will live on in our memories and it will live on, particularly in the memories of those who are directly affected, to the eternal shame of the international community.  To what extent, with particular reference to children, can UNICEF Ireland and the international agencies co-ordinate a recognition of the need to put in place a shield to help the refugees who immediately follow in the wake of a military conflict such as that in Syria and in a number of other locations?       </p></speech>

Deputy Neville and Deputy Durkan raised the broadly similar issues of the delay and the co-ordination.  If the Deputies do not mind, I will deal with both issues together.  We had about four days, approximately 72 hours, advance warning from the weather forecasters that this would be a very big storm.  Due to the developing weather system it was not possible to pre-position aid into the area of the disaster.  That was not an option.  I can only speak for UNICEF.  The storms hit at 4.30 a.m. on Friday.  On Thursday evening our global depot in Copenhagen had already mobilised our material for shipping and we knew it would be a big storm.  We had already got our material out of the warehouse on aircraft and that was in there by Sunday, about 48 hours after the disaster.  I mention that as I think it was a pretty good response.  By their nature, each crisis, whether a tsunami, earthquake, or super typhoon of this nature, is very different.</p></speech>

He is correct that when the helicopters arrived from the <i>USS Washington</i>, the effort kicked in in a major way because they were able to get aid to outlying areas.  The reason everybody talks about Tacloban is that the CNNs, the Skys and the RTEs of this world were able to get there and tell the story.  However, there is a multiple of other areas, including Tanauan, which I mentioned, and the Visayas area, which have been levelled but there are no cameras there.  The helicopters are there dealing with this.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about capacity.  The local capacity was not very strong in any event to deal with a disaster of this nature.  We had 70 people in the Philippines beforehand and not all were in this area but we got them in fairly quickly.  No response will ever be as quick as it should be when children do not have water, which they did not have for a long period of time.  The global community is doing its very best in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  It is only my opinion but it is hard to see how aid could have got in and have been distributed more quickly than was done.  The fact is a phenomenal natural event happened and it takes time to get aid in and to distribute it.</p></speech>

Aeroplanes could not land because the runways were blocked and because of the inclement weather conditions after the typhoon.  There were high winds and helicopters could not fly.  She said that was part of the problem in regard to the distribution of aid and getting to the areas that needed help.</p></speech>

Jordan was very welcoming to refugees and took in well over 1 million.  It has really played its part.  A huge proportion of its population is from Syria.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that some of the people who are now refugees living in tents and other accommodation are people of very high capacity.  We met an engineer who left Syria for Lebanon on the northern border.  He said he had a big house with a garden and a life but said: "Now look at what I am reduced to."  I met a girl in the Za'atari refugee camp who was crying and said that two weeks ago, she was at university.  She said she had a life and was studying for a degree but now she was living in a tent.  That is what these issues mean for real people.</p><p>  The Deputy's point about the organisation of the camp into a civil society - a city - was well made and somebody with a rather dark sense of humour put up a big sign at the start of the main road in the Za'atari refugee camp which said "Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es".  The contrast between that and the real Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es was very stark.  I do not mean to be flippant when I say that but it shows that life for these people has to go on and they have to make a new life in very difficult circumstances.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Jordan decided to organise things by way of structured camps whereas Lebanon decided to do it by much more informal smaller camps.  The Za'atari refugee camp, with all of its challenges and difficulties, is functioning reasonably well as a refugee camp, in so far as refugee camps are good places to live.</p></speech>

I was at a meeting with a Palestinian representative which delayed me getting here, so I apologise to him.  Like others said, we followed his report on television.  It was very effective in that it really brought home the scale of the devastation.  Fair dues to Mr. Power and RTE for covering that.  Powerful images are helpful in order to get the support.</p><p>  I also commend Mr. Power on the work he is doing, in particular for children.  Even in this country, many organisations have children as their main focus of attention and support but, when push comes to shove, many of them prove to be quite deficient in that area.  I will refrain from naming them but I commend Mr. Power and his organisation on the work they are doing.</p><p>  I refer to distributing aid across such an area, in particular that archipelago which is a most difficult area.  Are there many areas which have not as yet had support from the aid programme?  In some of the programmes I watched, people were coming to the end, from the point of view of hunger, when some of the aid arrived.  Perhaps Mr. Power might like to comment a little on that.  What does he think can be done, because obviously there will be rebuilding there which, I reckon, will take a considerable number of years?</p><p>  I mention the prospect for children in that kind of environment.  I was really alarmed that Mr. Power reckoned that more than 40% of the children there have been displaced, which is a very significant issue.</p><p>  I move on to the funding issue.  Mr. Power made the point that UNICEF has increased its funding target to $61.5 million, that it only has half of that and there is a still a funding gap of approximately $30 million.  It comes back to a conversation we had last week with officials from the Department, who told us what they were doing.  At that stage, if I remember correctly, approximately, &euro;1.2 million was being given.  I thought that was very insignificant in the context of what the requirement was.  If one takes our Department of Health, the overall cost it estimated was $300 million.  I would say that is wasted in the Department of Health every two to three months.</p><p>  The UN only contributed $25 million.  It seemed people were not stepping up as urgently as I thought they would but Mr. Power is in a much better position to judge that than I am.  I think in his reply to Deputy Neville he said he felt the international community has responded reasonably expeditiously.  Will he elaborate on that?</p><p>  Does Mr. Power have any estimate of the overall aid programme required to restore the life of those people to one to which we would aspire as a basic standard of existence?  Is the $300 million an under-estimate? </p><p>  I was one of the members of the committee who visited the Za'atari refugee camp in June.</p></speech>

I have not sat through a more moving and distressing presentation since I became a member of this committee.  I commend them on the work they have done.  I saw the RTE programme the other night which has done a good deal to heighten awareness among people of the appalling situation.</p><p>  The witnesses spoke about the close association people have with the Philippines.  Many Filipino nurses work here but there has also been a great tradition of Irish missionaries going to the Philippines.  We all know many priests in our dioceses who served in the Philippines over the years and who spoke about how much they enjoyed working with the wonderful people in that country.</p><p>  It is difficult to comprehend the size of this problem.  If we were sitting here, and Deputy O'Sullivan referred to it, and outside this House every building in Dublin was levelled, what response would we be considering?  I would not be very critical of the immediate response.  In the circumstances the response by the various agencies was good, and in recent days it has improved significantly, but I am very concerned about what will happen a few weeks from now, given the volumes of people who must be cared for.  </p><p>  The witnesses spoke about the infrastructure and providing basic food and water but in terms of the issue of housing and shelter for that number of people, what type of housing was there and what consideration is being given to what might be put in place on a more long-term basis?</p><p>  It upsets me to think that women and children would be violated as a result of this tragedy.  It deflates one's confidence in humanity to think that men would take advantage of the situation to violate vulnerable people.  That issue must be addressed.  I welcome what the witnesses said about measures being put in place to protect children, and particularly orphans.</p><p>  The witnesses spoke about national solidarity with the people of the Philippines.  Have they anything in mind in that regard?  Should we not be talking about international solidarity with the people of the Philippines because while the people of Ireland are generous and will continue to support what is happening, it is obvious that other countries, and probably those much wealthier than ours, are not stepping up to the plate and responding to the extent that the Irish people have done.  I welcome the many initiatives announced over the weekend, including the Tr&oacute;caire collection in every church.  I assume that raised a significant amount but I would be concerned this issue will go off the boil very quickly if something else happens in another part of the world.</p><p>  We are fortunate in that means of communicating with people have improved greatly in recent times.  The use of social media should significantly help our efforts to get the word out and also help with fund-raising measures.  The witnesses might indicate whether their organisation is using social media to highlight the problems.</p><p>  The situation in Syria remains serious in that aid is not getting to starving people.  I support strongly Deputy Durkan's comments because we are witnessing in Syria the most serious case of human rights abuses in the world.  I ask members of the committee to read an article in <i>foreignpolicy.com</i> by Colm Lynch, published in recent days, from which I will quote one or two sentences.  He states:<blockquote>During the past year, the United Nations' chief relief agency has routinely withheld from the public vital details of the Bashar al-Assad regime's systematic campaign to block humanitarian assistance to Syrian civilians.  This silence has infuriated human rights advocates, who believe that greater public exposure of Assad's actions would increase political pressure on the Syrian government to allow the international community to help hundreds of thousands of ordinary Syrians who are trapped in the line of fire.</blockquote>Are the witnesses satisfied that the international community, the European Union and our Government are doing enough to help this situation, which is of major significance and is ensuring that large numbers of children and starving people are not getting aid because of the actions of the regime in preventing aid getting to those people?</p><p>  My colleague, Senator Clune, apologised that she had to leave to go to the Seanad but she asked me to ask the witnesses about the position on refugees from Syria.  Do they believe the response from Europe is adequate?  We have read a good deal about poor treatment of refugees in Greece and other parts of Europe.  Is that perceived as a European response?  Should we be doing more to accommodate refugees from Syria in Ireland and in other parts of Europe?</p></speech>

I will take Senator Walsh's questions first.  I thank the Senator for his kind comments about UNICEF; they are much appreciated by us.  The Senator asked if relief is getting into the outlying areas.  I believe that is happening now but it is late.  Whether that should be criticised I cannot say because of all the challenges we discussed and which I will not repeat.  However, the size of the area being destroyed beggars belief.  It is vast and it must cater for 11 million people, three times the population of Ireland, over an archipelago of islands in a remote area.</p></speech>

It is an issue to which we will return in the coming weeks.  I agree that we must learn from what happened in Haiti.  I remember Mr. Power visiting that country when he was Minister of State.  As I also recall, large amounts of money were pledged in the aftermath of that disaster, but some donors failed subsequently to cough up what was promised.  I agree that once the images of the tragedy in the Philippines disappear from the television screens, the story will also disappear.  There is a huge rebuilding effort to be undertaken and we wish Mr. Power and his colleagues at UNICEF well in their work, as we do all the other NGOs.</p></speech>

I put this issue on the agenda because we will be dealing with the report on the visit in private session later.  Many of the members are interested in getting an update on what is happening on immigration reform in the US at present.  An all-party delegation of four members of the committee travelled to the US last October.  The members were Deputy Nash, Senator Daly, Deputy Crowe and myself.</p><p>  We went there at what we believed to be a very appropriate time to lobby members of the US Congress on immigration reform.  The US Senate passed a Bill earlier in the summer by 68 votes to 22, so the issue was on the agenda for Congress when it returned in September.  Unfortunately, due to events in Syria, it was postponed to later in the year.  However, we were there at a very good time.  The climate was ripe.  We met ten or 15 very good congressmen from the Republicans as well as the Democrats.  The focus of the visit was on the Republicans to get them to push for immigration reform.  As we all know, however, a week is a long time in politics and since then the focus has moved to the Democrats because of Obamacare.  The Republicans are in no hurry to take Obamacare off the agenda, which means, unfortunately, immigration reform has gone off the agenda.</p><p>  We thought at the time there was a window of opportunity from Thanksgiving to Christmas to push for immigration reform.  We did not expect to get full citizenship on the agenda so a number of the Bills we brought before Congress were mainly to do with legalisation.  The Democrats would be pushing for citizenship because they believe the Latino vote will be on their side for the presidential elections while, of course, the Republicans do not want that to happen.  We thought there would be a compromise, that a bipartisan approach would be taken and that a Bill on legalisation, perhaps, could be put before Congress before Christmas.  It appears unlikely that will happen before Christmas, but it certainly has not gone off the agenda.  I believe we should push to keep immigration reform on the agenda for the committee for the coming months, particularly in our work programme for 2014.</p><p>  I commend the embassy in the US, Anne Anderson, Ralph Victory and the other personnel in the embassy for the work they are doing.  While we were doing our bit there for three or four days, the embassy is pushing this agenda all the time and will be meeting key congressmen and their staff over the coming months.</p><p>  I believe our visit was very successful.  The up-to-date information we have from Washington is that it is highly unlikely anything will happen on immigration reform before Christmas.  While there is a window of opportunity in the new year, there will be other issues to be discussed in Congress as well.  Aside from Obamacare, there are budget issues.  Congressman Paul Ryan is the chairman of that committee.  The budget issue has been postponed but it will be on the agenda early in the new year.  In addition, the elections in November take precedence and a number of primaries will take place in March, April and May, so there will be a small window of opportunity to push for immigration reform.  On 17 March the Taoiseach will visit Washington and that issue will again be at the top of the agenda.</p><p>  The visit was worthwhile.  As one congressman told me, ours is the only country that lobbied congressmen on immigration reform, despite that the undocumented Irish only account for 50,000 of the 11 million undocumented people in the US.  There are not as many people crossing the border from Mexico at present.  The Mexican economy is beginning to grow again so there is not the same pressure there.  All eyes will be on the Republicans again to see if they can push this agenda.  Perhaps people such as Congressman Guti&eacute;rrez of Illinois and Congressman Paul Ryan, whom we believe to be working together, can take a bipartisan approach to this, bring some type of legislation to Congress in the new year and put immigration reform back on the agenda.</p><p>  That is the current position.  The climate changes very quickly in Congress.  At the time we thought there was a window of opportunity, but now the issue is Obamacare and the Republicans are in no hurry to put immigration reform back on the agenda.  Deputy Crowe travelled with us on that visit.  Does he wish to comment on it?  We will deal with the report in private session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013112000012#L00500"><p>Like others, we were unsure of the timing of the visit.  It had been postponed because of the situation in Syria and our visit occurred immediately after the Republicans were forced to agree to a temporary budget.  Many of the Republicans in Congress appeared to be quite raw about that decision and how it was rolled out.</p><p>  Other members of the delegation can speak for themselves but I was quite optimistic returning from the visit.  We went over not knowing the potential but we returned with the feeling that it was still there to be won.  It is wide open with regard to the lobby and I am quite optimistic we can push this across the line.  I have been involved on this when there were great expectations that it would happen at the time, but it did not.  If people are listening to this at home, they are probably wondering if they will be told again there is potential, only to have their hopes dashed.  It makes sense, so logic is on our side.</p><p>  President Obama said there is the time to do it.  I do not know if his speech when we were there helped the situation.  I expressed my view to some of the Democrats and his officials that if he would stay out of it, it might help the situation.  Across the board, however, the people we met want a deal to happen.  I was struck when one Republican congressman said to me: "If something is on the table, I can argue for or against it, but there is nothing there.  It is a vacuum.  I cannot go back to my constituency and argue one way or the other."  People genuinely want it to happen.  We have many friends there.</p><p>  It was definitely a worthwhile trip.  It involved many meetings but one could see we were having an impact.  I concur with the Chairman about the work of the embassy.</p></speech>

We all want to see the matter progressed because not one week goes by without us receiving representations from families who wish to have the immigration status of a family member regularised.  It is a difficult position to be in for many of those affected because they are not in a position to return home for family occasions, be they celebratory or bereavements.</p><p>  The electoral cycle in the United States passes quickly and is a point of concern in resolving this issue.  Several months ago when we discussed this matter with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, we were all agreed that when election mode kicked in in the United States, the level of collaboration to put through immigration reform legislation would decline.  There is a two-year cycle for the House of Representatives and some Senators.  Whatever has to be done must be done as quickly as possible.  Every day lost makes it more difficult.  What other lobbying can be engaged in to keep this matter on the agenda?  I have always had confidence in our diplomatic staff and their capacity to network and talk to the real decision-makers and people of influence.</p></speech>

It is concerning that the political cycle is so short in the United States as one is always heading into an election of some description.  Earlier I heard the Irish wee the only grouping for the undocumented lobbying on the issue.  It would be a help if other groupings were lobbying because this could bring more pressure on the politicians.  It is incumbent on all Members to make contact with their relevant US counterparts on this issue and push for immigration reform legislation.  Many families have loved ones who are not in a position to return home for family occasions, be they weddings or funerals.  As Deputy Brendan Smith said, there is nothing on the table for people to either argue for or against.</p></speech>

We have to keep trying, but there have been many false dawns on this issue.  Can anything be done to separate the Irish from the rest?  I recall that the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, raised this matter with George W. Bush when they met him in the White House.  Mr. Bush was positive about looking after the number of Irish involved because they came to only 50,000 in number.  That was until his adviser told him at the meeting about the 6 million Mexicans in Texas, which changed the dynamics.  Is there an opportunity to go for a bilateral arrangement with the United States similar t the one reached between the United States and Australia?  We need more than just the single strand of trying to get all 11 million illegal immigrants across the line.</p></speech>

We did not push this because it would have been part of the pre-conference.  We were told that if a bipartisan approach was taken on the issue, six Bills would be put to the Senate, with one of which most of the undocumented Irish would be happy.  If this legislation was referred to the Senate, it would be dealed with in a pre-conference with Senate and Congress leaders.  John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, has said, however, that unless he has a majority, he will not put anything through.  That is the obstacle we are up against.  It must be remembered that for Tea Party Republicans, immigration reform are red letter words in their states.  If they were to mention anything about immigration reform, their chances of being re-elected would be zero.  As one Congressman told me, if our Lord our God came looking for a visa, he would refuse Him.</p></speech>

I am not so sure we need to isolate the Irish from the other undocumented.  We can claim a certain priority because of the commitment of the Irish to the United States for many years.  I know the point that has been made about the Mexicans.  Several years ago I met a US Congressman who wanted to put a wire fence between Mexico and the United States.</p><p>  We need to be mindful that persons who are stateless in another land are always open to exploitation.  It can also happen in this country.  A case must be made internationally for the recognition of their entitlements, including access to their human rights.</p> <p>I agree entirely with Deputy Smith in that area.  We need to be doing it on a continual basis, and not apologising for it either.  There should be no apology for this.  There are countless persons in my constituency who can never come home, who can never leave there.  The fact that they are trapped there is a clear indication.  If they show themselves at all, they are gone forever and that leaves them open to exploitation.</p><p> I would not be at all apologetic.  We made considerable sacrifices as a nation to the United States over the years.  There was a significant commitment.  I can remember when I was a child seeing guys coming home from the Korean War.  I was talking to a guy the other night who was in Dien Bien Phu in French Indochina.  We had something of a commitment.  There are those who talk about Ireland as a neutral nation with no international commitments, etc.  We paid our price, however, and we deserve to be treated as such as well.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is even within our remit but we should be making our views known, either to the Department or to the embassy staff.</p><p>  I would regard that as not a good indicator of President Obama's interest.  We have received tremendous support from Administrations in the United States in recent times but the Obama Administration has not given any indication of any real interest in Ireland.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 20 - Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Vote 24 - Justice and Equality.  I propose that the committee consider both Supplementary Estimates together.</p><p>  The Supplementary Estimates for Vote 20 - Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Vote 24 - Justice and Equality were referred to the committee by the D&aacute;il on 19 November 2013 with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 21 November 2013.  The role of the committee under Standing Orders is to consider the Supplementary Estimates and report, by way of a message to the D&aacute;il, that we have done so.  I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and his officials from the Department for attending and assisting our consideration of these Supplementary Estimates.  I also thank them for the briefing material circulated in advance to members of the committee.</p><p>  I propose that the following arrangements apply to the debate.  The Minister will address the committee and after that each of the Opposition spokespersons will have the opportunity to respond.  We can then have an open discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders, discussions should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimates.  I ask members to stick to the matters on the agenda and not to wander off to other issues.</p></speech>

Therefore, while there is a requirement for additional funding for the Garda Vote of &euro;50.994 million and a provision of almost &euro;5 million needs to be made within the Justice and Equality Vote to fund initial payments to the women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries, a significant proportion of the additional requirement can be funded by savings in other areas within the Vote group.  Thus, of the additional &euro;51 million required for the Garda Vote and &euro;5 million for the Magdalen related payments in the justice Vote, almost &euro;24 million is available from elsewhere within the Vote group, leaving the total external funding required by the justice group at just over &euro;32 million. </p><p>  The offsetting savings to reduce the external funding requirements are primarily in the Justice and Equality Vote, at least &euro;17 million, prisons at &euro;5 million, and a combined surrender balance of more than &euro;1.5 million in the Courts Service and Property Registration Authority Votes.  This leaves the net Supplementary Estimate requirement for the justice Vote group at &euro;32 million, some 1.4% of the total justice Vote group gross allocation, not &euro;51 million, a fact conveniently overlooked when the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson took to the airwaves earlier this week.</p><p>  The Deputy also failed to mention that a Supplementary Estimate requirement is neither unusual nor unexpected in a financial allocation that is as broad and diverse as the justice Vote group, nor is it unusual that savings in one Vote within the group are reallocated to offset costs in another.  I will give some examples of how this has occurred on previous occasions.  In 2007, when Deputy Niall Collins's party was in Government, the Supplementary Estimate requirement for the justice Vote group was &euro;67 million, of which &euro;25 million was needed for the Garda Vote.  This was partly offset by a &euro;12 million underspend elsewhere in the Vote group leaving a requirement for external funding of &euro;55 million.  In 2009, &euro;30 million was needed to supplement the Garda Vote and this was partly offset by a &euro;15 million underspend in other Votes.  In 2010, &euro;40 million was moved within the Garda Vote to meet an additional requirement in payroll costs.</p><p>  Is Deputy Collins suggesting that in 2013 something unusual is occurring or that we should not pay members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  It seemed to me, as I listened to the Deputy, that he was disappointed we have maintained Garda numbers at in excess of 13,000 and that the Garda has been extraordinarily successful during the course of the year in the duties members of the force have undertaken.</p><p>  It has been interesting to note some of the media coverage in relation to this year's justice Vote group requirement for a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Vote.  On the one hand, there has been a suggestion that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under-resourced and garda&iacute; have been rendered incapable of doing their job properly.  On the other hand, some of the same media commentators and writers have rightly given extensive coverage of hugely successful Garda operations and seizures which have resulted in a myriad of headlines and some praise for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will outline some examples.</p><p>  Earlier this month, 89 people were arrested in a 24 hour period under Operation Wireless.  It followed more than 400 planned searches throughout the country in relation to robbery, burglary, theft, handling stolen property, possession of drugs and firearms offences.</p><p>  There was a co-ordinated drive against those involved in burglaries under Operation Fiacla to which I have referred frequently during the last 12 months.  The latest Central Statistics Office figures show that burglary offences decreased by 8.9%, continuing the trend observed since the introduction of the operation.  That means there has been an annual reduction of 8.9%.  As Deputies will know, Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders.  As of 31 October, 6,972 persons have been arrested, something I hope members of the committee welcome, and 3,971 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  Operation Nitrogen continues to be very successful in identifying and dismantling cannabis cultivation sites across all areas of the country.  Seizures of cannabis plants valued at in excess of &euro;16 million were recorded for the first three quarters of 2013.  Deputies will be familiar with the frequent reports of the Garda successfully identifying grow houses in various parts of the country.  A very significant seizure of plants worth an estimated &euro;2 million was made on 21 October at cannabis cultivation sites in counties Kerry, Roscommon and Cavan.</p><p>  Operation Stilts is an ongoing overt Garda operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug related crimes in Dublin city centre locations.  It has been continuing and has proved successful.</p><p>  Just this week, on 18 November, a major production facility was detected in Waterford which had the capacity to launder approximately 10 million litres of fuel per annum with a potential loss to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;5 million per annum.  A number of large tanks and ancillary equipment were seized and the laundering plant was dismantled.  Investigations into the fuel laundry operation are continuing.</p><p>  The members of the committee and the public can rest assured that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to rise to the many challenges facing the organisation daily.  Operational decisions taken by the Garda Commissioner and those working with him have resulted in the targeting of criminal gangs and those involved in subversive activities, with the result that many have been convicted and sentenced before our courts and are in jail.  The most recently published CSO crime statistics detailed a reduction in criminal offences in 12 of the 14 crime groups, with an overall 8% reduction in the incidence of crime in the 12 months to mid-2013.  These statistics underline the positive impact the Garda is having on crime and the success of the Commissioner's strategy to maximise the use of resources, something of great importance, with intelligent and targeted deployment which is clearly working.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Collins, in his enthusiasm to make some political point on the national airwaves, he appears to have conveniently forgotten that the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government&rsquo;s National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, published on 24 November 2010, contained expenditure ceilings for the justice sector which would have made it impossible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other areas of the justice sector to operate effectively.  In fact, it is a racing certainty that had the Fianna F&aacute;il figures been applied, we would in all probability have faced a situation where Garda numbers might have dropped to 11,500 rather than the 13,000 overall figure that the current Government has set as its objective target strength for the force.</p><p>  It is, once again, grossly hypocritical of Fianna F&aacute;il to be criticising the Government over Garda numbers, calling for increases and shouting the odds over seeking a Supplementary Estimate to make available the funding necessary to maintain Garda services, when their own plan would have almost certainly have ensured Garda numbers would have had to drop to unacceptably low levels, or alternatively a massive supplementary budget would have been required to bridge the gap.  Fortunately, I have managed to ensure the current expenditure ceilings are much healthier for the group, by more than &euro;400 million for the three years 2012 to 2014, inclusive, when compared with the previous government&rsquo;s provision.  In 2013, for example, the current expenditure ceiling proposed under the previous Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan was &euro;2.009 billion.  The actual current expenditure allocation per the Revised Estimates Volume was &euro;2.163 billion, an increase of &euro;154 million.  In real terms, the likelihood is that had the previous Government&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling remained in place, the committee would have been discussing a Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;154 million plus &euro;32 million, which amounts to &euro;186 million across the Vote group, rather than the amount of just over &euro;32 million required in the current year.  That is a sum substantially less than that sought on some occasions in the past by my predecessors who were Fianna F&aacute;il appointed Ministers for the justice area.</p><p>  Leaving aside the figures for a moment and returning to the contention from some quarters that a budgetary shortfall in some way inhibited members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their work, I would like to say the following.  </p></speech>

I reject the misrepresentations of me by the Minister.  He has misrepresented some of my comments.  For the benefit of other members of the committee and to refresh the Minister's memory, it was widely reported by reputable sources earlier this year that the Garda payroll budget would fall short.  I questioned the Minister in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions on that matter.  He replied in the negative and said that there would not be an issue.  I was doing my job in raising a concern which had been expressed publicly.  I also sought some information under the Freedom of Information Act and was denied that information by the deciding officer in the Department.  The reason given for that denial was that it was the subject of ongoing negotiations.  However, we are where we are now and I do not need to replay the game all over again with the Minister.  Suffice to say that of course all public servants should be paid and it is wrong of the Minister, if not beneath him, to come in here and allege that I do not want to see people getting paid.  Perhaps when he is responding, the Minister might tell us at what point during the year it was flagged to him that the payroll budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would fall short.</p><p>  The Minister referred to recruitment in his statement.  There is a lot of interest in the forthcoming Garda recruitment campaign, and the advertisements will be published some time before Christmas.  How many recruits will be taken on in the initial recruitment drive?  A number of queries have been raised with me about the status of the Garda Reserve force.  Will existing members of that force be treated differently in the application process by virtue of the fact that they are members of the Garda Reserve force? Will they have a competitive edge?  </p><p>  Finally, regarding free legal aid, I ask the Minister to give us an overview of the workings of the legal aid system.  I know we will be examining this more closely at a future date in the context of proposed legislation.  There is concern about the fact that there are a community of people who are repeat clients of the free legal aid scheme, particularly the criminal free legal aid scheme.  What is the position regarding the seeking of a contribution from such people towards the cost of the provision of free legal aid services?  Many of these people complete a statement of means, and I am interested in the collection by the State of client contributions towards the provision of free legal aid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013112000005#D00700"><p>I am going to respond in reverse order and deal with the legal aid question first.  The Deputy is right that there are some individuals who repetitively apply for free criminal legal aid because they are repetitive offenders.  The Deputy will be aware that there are decisions of our Supreme Court and of the European courts which delineate that an individual who is charged with a criminal offence who cannot pay for representation is entitled to legal aid.  The reality is that if people genuinely lack the means to provide their own defence, it does not matter if they are repeat offenders.  If they were not provided with free criminal legal aid then ultimately any conviction obtained against them or sentence imposed would be struck down by the High Court or the Supreme Court as being invalid, based on their not having had their constitutional rights protected.  Indeed, this State would be subject to criticism by the European Court of Human Rights if we did that.</p><p>  Having said all that, I must say that work is going on my Department in examining the system.  The Deputy is aware that we ultimately hope to bring forward legislation to provide for a different mechanism for making applications for criminal legal aid and to involve the Legal Aid Board in that.  Publication of that legislation is still some way off because of the priority that has been attached to finalising the Legal Services Bill, enacting the Children and Family Relationships Bill and introducing the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, as well as dealing with the legislation to establish a new court of appeal.  We will be dealing with all of this in the coming weeks.</p><p>  My officials are looking at legal aid at the moment and particularly the rules relating to criminal legal aid.  They are also examining the application forms, which have been in use for some considerable time, with a view to determining whether we can modernise them, using the regulatory process under existing legislation, to ensure that those who may well be able to afford to pay for their own defence in criminal proceedings do not pull the wool over the eyes of our courts.  I can say no more about that issue at present but I agree it is a matter of concern.  We have managed to effect some savings in the criminal legal aid bill.  The figure in the Estimates for criminal legal aid for 2013 was &euro;47 million.  We have estimated that it will come in at around &euro;50 million.  The scheme is demand-led and we cannot predict with certainty what the final cost will be each year.</p></speech>

The prudent decision to include a figure for this year in the context of the current examination of the Magdalen laundries issue is also a positive step.  As the Minister said in his opening remarks, letters have been issued or are about to be issued.  I think that is the right thing to do, even if most of the payments will be made in 2014.  I do not know whether the Minister wishes to say anything else on that.</p><p>  It is not unusual to have Supplementary Estimates.  The first time we dealt with a Supplementary Estimate while I was a member of this committee, following the change of Government, we were asked to approve a huge figure.  The Minister said at the time that he did not like introducing Supplementary Estimates because it was not a desirable way to do business.  They will always be needed, particularly in the case of the justice Votes, under which there are a number of demand-led services.  It is not an exact science.  While Supplementary Estimates might not be desirable, I think it is inevitable that this committee will always have to consider them.</p><p>  There are positive elements to Supplementary Estimates as well.  A number of savings have been made.  We saved a considerable amount of money in respect of once-off events relating to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union - for example, in Garda operations.  I appreciate that some of this money was allocated to the policing of the G8 summit.  The opportunity existed to do so.  The Minister spoke about transferring some money from the capital budget for the provision of additional vehicles.  I have always called for this on behalf of my party.  I will not criticise an initiative such as that.  We have always said we wanted to see an adequate level of resourcing for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given that we have called for additional resources, it would be hypocritical of us to come in here and criticise the Minister for introducing a Supplementary Estimate which does exactly that.  This is probably not the ideal way to deal with these matters, however.  It would be better if we could deal with them at budget time.  As I have said, it is probable that this committee will always face such a scenario in the context of this Vote.</p><p>  I welcome the recruitment campaign that is about to be undertaken.</p></speech>

I am pleased to note that substantial moneys were saved on the security side during the Presidency.  I pay tribute to the fantastic work done by the Garda in this regard.  Ministers from 27 member states attended meetings, with more in the case of certain meetings where Ministers from other states had observer status.  There were no difficulties of any description and security issues were dealt with seamlessly and successfully.  The Garda managed to do this at substantially less cost than during the previous Irish Presidency in 2004.</p><p>  A great deal of planning was involved in this process.  This included ensuring that meetings took place substantially in the same venues and only a discrete number of hotels were used, all of which had been security vetted in advance.  Focusing and centring meetings on the Dublin Castle complex effected substantial cost savings compared to previous Presidencies when meetings tended to take place in whatever happened to be the constituency of the individual Minister who was presiding over them.  We moved away entirely from that approach because it created enormous additional security costs and was of no benefit to anybody, although it had a perceived benefit for the relevant Ministers who used to believe they would get a slap on the back in their local newspaper for bringing a large number of European Union Ministers and officials into the constituency.  This approach saved substantial sums.  Having made an allocation that was substantially lower than that provided for security in 2004, the outcome was even better than anticipated.  The Garda did a very good job.  It also did a very important job on the G8 summit.  I pay tribute to the Garda and PSNI for working together to ensure the necessary security for what was a major and important event on this island.  </p><p>  On capital budgets and prisons, it is worth pointing out that there are enormous changes taking place in the prison system.  By the end of this year, there will not be a single prisoner in a cell in Mountjoy Prison which does not have in-cell sanitation.  Work will continue into next year on a section of the prison that is to be vacated by prisoners.</p><p>  On Cork Prison, invitations to tender issued to a number of pre-qualified bidders on 16 July.  It was originally hoped these would be returned by 25 September but it was necessary, for a number or reasons, to extend the tender date to 14 October.  The bids have been received and are under evaluation.  Construction will commence in 2014.  As such, we have made considerable advances in the process of having a new prison built in Cork.  </p><p>  A new wing is being added to Limerick Prison and major changes are under way.  With all of this happening and some of the construction that has been taking place in the prisons, we were able to identify approximately &euro;5 million which would not be spent by the end of the year.  I engaged with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and it was agreed that this sum could be used for the purchase of additional Garda cars before the end of the year.  This was a cost-effective way of dealing with the issue and I was anxious to ensure we purchased additional cars.  We wanted to identify the financial source for doing so without having to seek an additional sum of money.  I am advised that the cars have been substantially purchased at this stage, although it takes a little while for them to be put into operation because of what happens once they are purchased.  The process has gone very well.</p><p>  Between the &euro;5 million sum to which I referred and the additional &euro;4 million available for next year, the Garda will have a substantially modernised fleet in a number of areas.  This is a continuing issue.  I do not want Deputy Collins to think I am shooting at him but part of the problem with the Garda fleet is that a significant number of cars are becoming obsolete at the same time, in mileage terms, on account of the low funding that was made available for Garda cars between 2009 and 2011.  Adequate funding was provided prior to 2009 and it is understandable that funding reduced in circumstances of financial difficulty.  It is, however, a practical reality, one which means that a number of cars are being taken out of service within a short period.  The injection of &euro;9 million was required for this reason and I hope this will work out. </p><p>  On the drugs issue, it is of great importance that we maintain pressure on those who are engaged in the drugs trade.  Cannabis, which a Member of this House wants to legalise, is often a gateway to people dealing in and using other drugs such as heroin.  The Garda has maintained a substantial focus on this area.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien is correct that, as an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, it is ultimately for him to make specific decisions.  The last thing anyone needs is a Minister for Justice and Equality who interferes in day-to-day policing.  I leave such matters to the experts.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of things have been taking place in this regard.  Drugs valued in excess of &euro;50 million have already been seized this year.  If I put it this way, they have been financially assessed and there is some other stuff on which we do not yet have a financial identity.</p><p>  I will provide a little more information on Operation Nitrogen to which I referred.  The operation continues to be very successful in identifying cannabis cultivation across the country.  Believe it or not, the Garda advises that 55,000 cannabis plants with an approximate street value of &euro;44 million were seized in 2012.   </p></speech>

I have some questions with regard to his submission because there is a major problem with the justice system in regard to crime that is not being dealt with.</p><p>  In regard to the Supplementary Estimates and the effective management of resources, does the Minister accept it is the duty of the Opposition to challenge and ask questions on the Estimates?  The buck stops with the Minister and in the current economic climate we must make those challenges part of our brief.  I came in here to participate a debate on the Estimates, not to have a ping pong row with the Minister or to listen to him have a go at people like Deputy Collins in regard to a previous government.</p><p>  I was shocked to hear the Minister speak about crime and make no mention of gangland crime, murders, bodies in rivers or widespread intimidation across the city.

The Minister stated in his submission that as of 31 October, some 6,972 persons have been arrested and 3,971 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.  Why is this figure so high?  The Minister said we should welcome this.  I am shocked so many people have been arrested and charged.  That is a very high figure and should be a cause of concern, not welcomed.</p><p>  In regard to Operation Stilts, the Minister spoke about the ongoing Garda operation in the city centre to reduce antisocial behaviour and drug related crime, but he gave us no figures on that.  Therefore, we do not know what is going on in this regard.  However, I know from talking to people from Dublin and the city centre and from talking to members of the Minister's party that they are concerned about what is going on there.  I would like to see more of the facts on this issue.</p><p>  In regard to the crime statistics, the Minister said there was an overall reduction of 8% in the instances of crime in the 12 months to mid-2013.  Many of us, who live in the real world, have come across an undercurrent that is not being addressed by senior management in the Garda in this regard, namely, the amount of unreported crime in some communities.  I hinted at this earlier before the Chair reminded me to stick to the issue.  There is widespread intimidation in some communities and much crime is not being reported.  The Garda is not aware of this, but it is an issue that is raised regularly with back bench Deputies.  How does the Minister intend to address this issue?</p><p>  On page 5 of his submission, the Minister referred to the cost of providing the Go Safe road safety camera service and said the key objective was to reduce deaths.  On the related issue of penalty points, many people have come to me with their concerns about this system and about whether it is being implemented fairly or whether some people are being let off penalty points while others are prosecuted.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned clearing the backlog in regard to citizenship applications.  What is the current figure for citizenship applications?</p></speech>

The statistics are based on the accurate work and information available to that office and I learn of them when other people do.  The information contained in the last annualised figures published shows a reduction of 8% in crime across the board.</p><p>  I never minimise crime.  The sad reality is that no matter how good the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, no matter how good are the laws we enact, no matter how carefully the courts hear cases and no matter how many people are sentenced to imprisonment, we will always have bad people.  There are always bad people who carry out crime with no thought for the victims whose lives they affect.  I will deal in facts, not in alarmist commentary.  The facts are there has been a reduction in crime and the figures published by the CSO show this.  The reduction has occurred across a broad range of areas.</p><p>  The Deputy asked why so many people have been arrested under Operation Fiacla and why there has been a reduction in burglaries of 8.9%.  The answer to that is this is happening because the Garda is engaged in targeted, smart policing.  It is identifying individuals and gangs who are engaged in burglaries.  Individuals who may live in one part of the country use our motorway system to travel to other parts of the country to carry out a series of burglaries in an area and then seek to disappear.  Through significant connected thinking and a focused and targeted engagement the Garda is identifying people who so engage and is arresting them and bringing them before the courts and succeeding in prosecuting them.  This is taking people repetitively engaged in criminal conduct out of society.  This targeted policing is working.</p><p>  I congratulate the Garda Commissioner and those working with him on these targeted operations.  These operations are reducing the level of burglaries.  Any burglary in any house is to be deplored.  Individuals can be deeply affected when their privacy and the security of their home is invaded.</p></speech>

Those who operate the vans are being successful in that regard.  There has been an increase in the number of fatalities among cyclists and motorcyclists.  This is a problem.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I met representatives of the Road Safety Authority and the Garda in order to consider initiatives which might be taken in this matter.  However, we are paying a supplement in the sense that the GoSafe vans do not bring in income that would be accrued by way of garda&iacute; issuing tickets.  People are now driving in a safer way because they know of the existence of the vans and are, therefore, reducing their speed.  Obviously, there is a need to provide the funding required to meet the obligations that arise.</p></speech>

The expenditure incurred on the G8 was &euro;3.8 million.  We have an obligation to ensure proper security is provided.  Some of the delegations to the G8 were staying on our side of the Border in the Republic.  There was no question of us looking for a financial contribution from Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom Government or the PSNI towards that.  It would not have been appropriate.  There is constant co-operation on security issues between ourselves and the PSNI.  We have a mutual interest in maintaining proper policing on the island of Ireland.  It would have been out of place.</p><p>  In terms of the issue the Deputy raised, I made it very clear when I was asked the question that in no circumstances would I condone any attack on any former Taoiseach, Minister or a current Member of either House, be they on the Government side or on the Opposition side.  The Deputy seems to be unaware of the fact that the former Taoiseach does have security at his home.  As far as I know that is the case.  I am open to correction if I am wrong but as far as I know the former Taoiseach has security provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at his home.  The security advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that he should have such security.  I totally respect that.  I take no issue with it and never commented on it.  The security advice I, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste get is that we should have security on our homes.  There was a burglary event in my home.  I do not make a complaint about it.  People across the country are affected by burglaries.  As the Deputy should be aware, I deal on a daily basis with serious issues related to gangland crime, subversive activity and those who are trying to reignite the war in Northern Ireland.  I take advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on that, as I do on the former Taoiseach.</p><p>  The issue that arose and on which I commented was an event reported in the newspapers relating to the former Taoiseach.  There was a report in a newspaper &ndash; I cannot remember which one &ndash; that the attack was as a consequence of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, not having a Garda driver and that if he had been provided with one the event would not have happened.  I remarked that when the Government came into office it made the decision that former taoisigh would not have Garda drivers.  No Minister in the current Government, other than the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I as Minister for Justice and Equality has a Garda driver.  The security advice is that we should have.  I said that if the former Taoiseach required to be driven that is something he could afford to pay for himself, if for some security reason he believed he needed a driver.  That was the issue I was addressing.</p><p>  The electorate made a decision about issues affecting the previous Government.  I would not wish to see any former member of that Government or previous Governments the object of physical assault by anybody.  We live in a democracy and it is not appropriate that anyone would be treated that way.  In case the Deputy has any doubt about it, I am very happy to so address the matter.  They are the two issues he raised.</p><p>  I did not reply to an issue that, in fairness, was raised by Deputy Finian McGrath.  Of course I absolutely and totally accept that it is the job of the Opposition to ask questions on Estimates.  It would be unfortunate if we had a Parliament where such questions were not raised.  It is necessary to do so in a manner that is accurate and truthful and to suggest that there was something extraordinarily unusual in a Minister for Justice and Equality dealing with a Supplementary Estimate of this nature was not an accurate presentation of the facts.  As I pointed out in my presentation, because of the nature of the justice area &ndash; Deputy O&rsquo;Brien referred to the broad areas it covers &ndash; there will always be some areas where some of the allocated spend is not incurred.  No one is suggesting one should spend money unnecessarily.  There will be other areas where because of events, additional expenditure is required.  In 2007 there was a Supplementary Estimate and in the following years there were financial readjustments with Supplementary Estimates from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The suggestion that we were doing something exceptionally unusual today is not accurate.  Of course it is right that people ask questions.  I thank Deputies for their courtesy in doing so.  We have dealt with some areas that are important.  It is right that we engage in this procedure.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions myself.  Although I am not a member of the Opposition I am entitled to ask questions about the Estimates.  One question relates to the &euro;1 million extra for station services, mainly heating and electricity costs and others.  Is there a policy in the Department of Justice and Equality with respect to energy conservation?  Is there any one person or group of people with such a responsibility?  Has the installation of combined heat and power plants in prisons been considered?  I am told it would generate &ndash; pardon the pun &ndash; huge savings.</p><p>  A total of &euro;155,000 relates to the Garda Reserve.  What was the purpose of the funding, as no detail is given?</p></speech>

We continue to recruit the Garda Reserve and they receive what is really an honorarium.  They get &euro;1,200 per annum for participating in the Garda Reserve.  There were a number of recruits during the course of the year.  I attended two graduation ceremonies.</p><p>  I am aware you have a particular interest in heating, Chairman, on which we have had previous discussions in the committee, in particular in regard to Cork Prison.  The issue is being examined as to its feasibility.  In the context of using fuel efficiently, it is correct that there is not someone in my Department who is specifically seconded to deal with the issue but the various agencies have an obligation to use resources wisely.  I would expect there is focus on the issue and I am happy to follow it up.  There is a degree of wisdom in ensuring that within, for example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Prison Service and other agencies an individual should have responsibility to ensure that we have the best and most resource-efficient approach to heating, lighting and other matters of that nature.</p></speech>

I am pleased to report to members of the committee on the Irish Defence Forces' participation in United Nations missions in 2012.  The report for 2012 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 October 2013.  The following motion was placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<blockquote><br />That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2012, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 14th October, 2013, in accordance with Section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(4)( <i>j </i>) and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees, which, not later than 21st November, 2013, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.</blockquote>  In commending the motion, I will shortly outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the UN over the past couple of years.</p><p>  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations. In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continually in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, a service that has comprised more than 62,000 individual tours of duty.</p><p>  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting our international obligations as a member of both the United Nations and the European Union.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations.  This has included supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system.  Notwithstanding our current economic difficulties, Ireland continues to willingly play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world, providing professional peacekeepers to a range of missions throughout the world.</p><p>  During 2012, the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN-authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on 11 different missions throughout the world, in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  Ireland's only new deployment in 2012 was to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, UNSMIS, when six members of the Permanent Defence Force were deployed in May as unarmed military observers to Syria.  However, these personnel were withdrawn from Syria in August 2012 when the mission's mandate came to an end.</p><p>  Our main mission in the year under review was the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment.  Since mid-2011, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force, comprising some 435 personnel, has been deployed to the UNIFIL mission.  The deployment to UNIFIL is Ireland's largest deployment overseas since the withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the MINURCAT mission in Chad in May 2010.</p><p>  Last year saw the establishment of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion in UNIFIL when a contingent of 170 personnel of the Finnish armed forces began serving alongside Irish soldiers with effect from 1 June 2012.  Both Ireland and Finland previously served together in the Lebanon mission in 2006-2007 and more recently in the UN operation in Chad.  In addition to the Irish contribution of some 332 personnel to the joint Irish-Finnish battalion, a further 16 personnel were deployed to the force headquarters in Naquora and eight personnel at the UNIFIL Sector West headquarters in Shama.  Reflecting the high regard in which Irish peacekeepers are held, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan took up the appointment of deputy force commander of UNIFIL in April 2012, a post which he continues to hold.</p><p>  In accordance with agreements entered into with our Finnish counterparts, Ireland has held the role of command of the joint Irish-Finnish battalion from the outset.  Ireland will hand the lead over to Finland on 26 November 2013 and Ireland's contribution to the Finnish-Irish battalion will reduce to approximately 180 personnel.  Members of the 42nd infantry group are currently deploying into the mission with the new joint Finnish-Irish battalion.  I wish each and every member of the group a safe and successful mission.  They will replace members of the 108th infantry battalion who have completed their tour of duty.  I thank the personnel returning home from Lebanon for the contribution they have made to the peace and security of the region.</p><p>  Partnership with other like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  In the absence of partners, such as Finland, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be significantly curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability, build experience and further deepen the excellent bilateral relationship between both countries.  The United Nations has stated that UNIFIL plays a vital role in stabilising southern Lebanon, and in particular the area adjacent to Israel, where Irish troops are deployed.</p><p>  Ireland is currently contributing approximately 560 Defence Forces personnel to 14 separate missions throughout the world.  The most recent deployment overseas was in response to a United Nations request and resulted in the deployment of the 43rd infantry group to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights in Syria.  This deployment was successfully completed on 28 September 2013.  The 43rd infantry group is tasked primarily to serve as the force mobile reserve within the UNDOF area of responsibility.  A total of 118 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with UNDOF, including four personnel who were deployed to UNDOF earlier this year for service at the mission headquarters.</p><p>  UNDOF is assisted by the military observers from Observer Group Golan of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO, which group currently includes seven Irish officers.  Also, at the request of the United Nations and following Government approval, four members of the Permanent Defence Force deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, in South Sudan in August 2013.  Their role is to provide a specialist training team on conventional munitions disposal, landmines and specialist search awareness to South Sudan police personnel.</p><p>  The current contribution of some 560 personnel to overseas missions is a very significant contribution in the context of the reduced resources available for defence.  It reflects the Government's continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</p><p>  It is important for Ireland to continue to build on our long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel to peace-support operations.  I assure the committee that, notwithstanding the economic challenges we are facing, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.  However, our contributions will be practical and sustainable within the resources available for defence.  Relative to our size and our available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.</p><p>  The Government accords great importance to the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace-support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our military personnel serving overseas when I visited the Irish battalion serving with UNIFIL in March of this year.  I look forward my return visit to our troops in Lebanon next week.</p><p>  A key facet of Ireland's approach to international peace-support operations is the engagement of Defence Forces personnel, at all levels, with the local communities they are called on to serve.  Irish troops serving overseas not only display their professional commitment in fulfilling the UN mandate but also support and encourage local communities through humanitarian and community projects.</p></speech>

Members of the select committee may be interested to know that next Monday I will travel to visit our troops in southern Lebanon.  I will also be visiting some other countries in the region, including Jordan.  At the moment, we anticipate going to Jordan to look at the impact of the refugee crisis as a result of the Syrian conflict.  The EU Justice and Home Affairs Council is assisting with funding from Europe to countries that are taking care of Syrian refugees.  It is expected that the position of the refugees will be discussed at the Council meeting to be held on 5 and 6 December.  I am hoping to get an update both in Lebanon and Jordan on the impact of the crisis.  An estimated 750,000 documented refugees from Syria are currently in the Lebanon.  The number could possibly be higher because some may not be documented.  Approximately 550,000 Syrian refugees are currently in Jordan.</p></speech>

The Commissioner is accompanied by Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, Deputy Commissioner; Mr. John O'Mahony, Assistant Commissioner; and Mr. Ken Ruane, head of legal affairs.  I also understand that Mr. Andrew McLindon, director of communications, and Mr. David Taylor, Garda press officer are attending in a observatory capacity.  The witnesses are all very welcome.</p><p>  The purpose of the meeting today is to discuss the special report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to the Minister for Justice and Equality issued pursuant to section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in respect of issues concerning informant handling and issues arising from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Annual Report for 2012.  I remind everyone to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when in silent mode.  Before commencing, I remind witnesses of the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite the Commissioner to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>

Before getting into specific detail, I think it might be useful to give a broad overview of some salient issues that I believe will help to give context to our discussions.  The first point worth noting is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for both policing and State security in Ireland.  This dual function model is given statutory legitimacy under section 7 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>  At the outset, I want to briefly explain what is meant by the term "intelligence", in the context of policing.   The working definition used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that criminal intelligence "is information gathered, evaluated, analysed and recorded with the objective of providing assistance in the prevention of crime, the investigation of crimes and the prosecution of individuals involved in the commission of such crimes".  The objective of the criminal intelligence system is to ensure that all information in possession of Garda members is exhaustively used to prevent and disrupt criminal activity and where possible, to bring criminals, including the planners and strategists, before the courts on criminal charges.  Information relating to terrorism and serious and organised crime is gathered largely by the use of covert policing techniques, including the use of informants, and this has resulted in significant successes in tackling illegal and criminal activity by subversives and organised crime. </p><p>  In 2006, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na introduced a comprehensive organisational policy surrounding the management and use of informants.  The system was developed by drawing on the recommendations of the Morris tribunal and by adopting established international best practice.  The internationally recognised term covert human intelligence source or its acronym CHIS was adopted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to describe the categories of persons who had previously been referred to as "informants".  The CHIS policy and procedures deal with all aspects relating to the recruitment, management and use of individuals who provide information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on an ongoing basis and expect that this relationship is treated confidentially.  In essence, it provides structure and methodology designed to cater for the interests and safety of all parties in this challenging policing discipline.  </p><p>  The expectation of confidentiality on the part of the person providing the information, coupled with the obvious risk to life in the event of compromise, emphasises the extreme sensitivity of the subject under discussion here today.  I am anxious to be forthright and frank in this committee meeting.  However, I must be mindful of ongoing investigations and our duty of care responsibilities to persons who provide information and I must also stress the continued importance of covert investigative techniques, including the use of CHIS for the proper investigation of crime, especially serious and organised crime.   I am sure everybody will appreciate that these techniques by their very nature require confidentiality and while it is accepted that there is a need for independent oversight in covert policing, any public discussion or disclosure must be balanced by protection of life considerations and the need to protect the integrity of the tradecraft and methodologies used therein.  I am sure that nobody here would wish that criminals would gain an advantage by being provided with a road map by which they might avoid detection.</p></speech>

The content of that presentation was shocking.  I regret that it is some five months later that we are returning to what was, in essence, a scathing criticism of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the independent watchdog.  I do not know whether this is the fault of the committee or otherwise, but I would have expected an earlier opportunity to address the serious allegations which have been left hanging for five months.  Given the sensitivities outlined by the Commissioner and the fact that policing by consent in any civilised society is sacrosanct, I would have expected commentary or rebuttal on the Garda's part at an earlier date.  For a statutory body like the Garda, it is not good to have bad relations, and an atmosphere of disharmony causes me concern as a public representative.</p><p>  Have relations between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC improved?  I welcome the Commissioner's remark that he has every confidence in that independent body, but I was shocked this summer to see an editorial in a reputable Garda magazine more or less stating that the Garda had a complete absence of confidence in the independent watchdog.  What steps have been taken to improve relations?  What is the Commissioner's commentary on what was a fairly scathing criticism?</p><p>  I will not quote extensively, as we do not have time and the Chairman will not allow me, but GSOC commissioner, Ms Carmel Foley, stated:<blockquote>We remain concerned however that, as a result of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na delays in completing these investigations, at any given time there is a caseload of about 500 complaint files of a disciplinary nature awaiting completion ... we look forward to the completion of these negotiations.  We hope that the new protocols will be operated in a timely manner.</blockquote>GSOC commissioner Mr. Kieran FitzGerald stated:<blockquote>What we found led us to conclude that there were serious deficiencies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management procedures regarding informant handling practices.  We found poor record keeping and non-adherence to procedures.  We found deficiencies in the implementation and management of the old system.</blockquote>The commissioners welcomed the appointment of Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, as did the Garda, but continued by stating: &quot;Absence of formal procedures for the management and use of such informants creates significant risks, as it is not possible, in particular, to place parameters upon the extent to which such individuals may be authorised to participate in criminality.&quot;  I understand the Garda Commissioner's remarks about sensitivity and I do not wish to seek information that might hamper an investigation or place a person in danger.  Is the practice described as running informants &quot;off the books&quot; still in use?  While I welcome the Commissioner's commentary, it is shrouded in terms like &quot;once a relationship develops&quot;.  What is meant by this?  No one has a problem with Mr. Justice Smyth, the protocols, the regulations or the practice, but the procedures to which he is not privy are the ones causing concern.  Are they still in existence?</p><p>  I would like to hear a rebuttal of the presentation made to the committee.  As a public representative, I would like to hear that relations have improved substantially between GSOC and the Garda.  I would like to know that practices and protocols are being developed to ensure both agencies can work in close harmony, notwithstanding the sensitivities.  I hope that what we heard from GSOC in July will never be repeated to any Oireachtas committee.  It had the effect of undermining confidence in the Garda, something that would be unacceptable in any civilised society but particularly in our democracy, given the confidence and trust that has been placed in the Garda by the public since the foundation of the State.  I assume that all of the Morris report's recommendations are being fully implemented by the Garda.  If they require repetition to this committee, as may have been presented to other committees, they are still engaging in a service that the people of this Republic rightly deserve.</p></speech>

There was a lot of interference when Deputy Charles Flanagan spoke.  It may not have been from his telephone but from the same table.  We will get that done before we move on, as this is an important public session.  The television camera operators will be annoyed when they see interference during key moments.  Please, turn off those telephones.  I will check that I have done the same.</p></speech>

It is a fact that I regard this subject as being so serious and critical to the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that I choose not to make public comment.  This is not to say that I do not welcome the opportunity to appear before the Chairman and his committee to answer as fully as I can all the questions they require me to answer.  I am accountable to this committee, the Minister and the Government for my public office.  Where we have some issues with GSOC, I prefer to deal with them in private.  That said, I assure the Deputy that the level of co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ombudsman commission was and will continue to be an ongoing event.  The fact we might not see eye to eye on certain sensitive matters is something we must work through.</p><p>  For this reason, in most of the cases being discussed, particularly concerning sensitive intelligence and sensitivities in the intelligence world, very careful consideration had to be given to GSOC's requests.  I am referring to the need to disclose the identity of an informant.  This is a very serious matter for me.</p></speech>

It caused me some difficulty when I heard those comments.  I am not entirely clear what is being suggested here.  If we were aware, for instance, that people were being run off the books, as it was described, we would take action or the judge would ensure I took action.  He would not have to convince me; I would certainly take it.  I am not quite clear what is meant by saying that the judge can only act on what he sees.</p><p>  In my opening statement, I indicated to the committee that the judge has access to any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whom he wishes to see, in addition to any location, document or equipment.  All of that is available.  The reports to which I have been privy indicate we are doing our business in the appropriate manner.  We have put a lot of time, energy and effort into ensuring the bespoke system we now have, replicated with all the best international practice, is fit for purpose, fair and transparent.  That is obvious to someone who is ordained to look at the system from outside.  In addition to that, there are internal processes.  On an annual basis, the deputy commissioner examines and audits the system, including all the checks and balances we have within the code of practice.  That applies both in terms of the general application and the special arrangements we have in place for the handlers of these people, as well as the controllers and assessors.  All of those things are looked at carefully.  Every quarter, the chief superintendent in each Garda division where these agent handlers are operating will undertake a review and certify it.  Therefore, great effort is put into ensuring not alone that our processes are correct but also that the people in the system are subject to a fine assessment, in the first instance, to ensure they are fit for purpose and they do not engage in nefarious activity such as participating in crime, for example.</p></speech>

His statement is welcome, as is its tone.  He has acknowledged there were issues, but things are moving on and greater resources are being committed to deal with some of the issues about which he spoke.</p><p>  There was a lot of hyperbole surrounding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's report, which may not have been comfortable.  To be fair and for us to consider both the statement and the report, we must start looking at the context.  If we are to look, especially in a public forum, at the trust we have in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, context is very important.  The report acknowledged that great progress has been made in relations between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I detect from the commission that there are still issues, which were highlighted in the report, about information it deems to be relevant and what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deems to be relevant to an investigation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013112000007#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions, to which I will try respond.  If  I miss out on any of them, the Deputy can remind me of them later.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about trust, which is the ethos of what we do.  If we do not have the trust and confidence of the people for whom we provide a service we have nothing.  I concur with the Deputy's comments in that regard.  I was pleasantly surprised to note from the recently published survey that we are top of the tree in this regard, which is great.  </p><p>  On relevance, this issue has received a great deal of air time.  I have had this conversation with the Chairman of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  Relevance in terms of the people tasked and charged with the responsibility of investigating is absolutely and totally in its province.  The question, how would we feel if we were being questioned about relevance, was rightly asked.  I have no issue with that.   The conversation which I had with the Chairman centred around the high end of the business about which I spoke about earlier, namely, sensitive and delicate information and my need for clarity when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is imparting this knowledge, without interfering with the integrity of the GSOC's investigation, which, I understand, is paramount, as to the reason the information is relevant.  When discussing this issue an analogy was drawn between a person stealing a handbag from a lady on the street and running away with it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na going into a bank and asking the bank manager how much that person had in his or her account.  That information would not be relevant to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of trying to catch the person who snatched the handbag.  It is important when we are dealing with sensitivities such as the identity of informants and the product they deliver that we have some sense, while not wishing to interfere with the integrity of the investigation, of the reason that intelligence is necessary.  We are not asking the Ombudsman Commission to pour out its soul because obviously there are aspects it would want to protect in order to conduct its business efficiently and effectively.  We appreciate that.  That was the only I had around relevance.  </p><p>  I know that the ombudsman commission has indicated to this committee, which information is in the public domain, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been questioning the relevance of the material and information sought in relation to, if I might use the expression, "a lower threshold" of investigations by it.  I have no crib with the ombudsman commission.  It should get what it needs in terms of those types of investigations.  It is our duty to provide that.  I will do everything in my power to ensure that this happens.  As regards whether there will be tensions or issues around this, of course, there will.  That is the nature of the business.  In terms of policing, confrontation and issues arise.  As all members will be aware in policing we are dealing with criminals who are not the most reliable in the world but they are as entitled as anybody else to make complaints against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of how members of the force deal with them.  What is important is that we all operate in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation.  That is what I am trying to achieve, both in terms of the protocols we signed off on last September and all of the other arrangements I have put in place, including a dedicated office to ensure that management is monitoring these requests for information and the length of time investigations are taking.  </p><p>  Every six weeks the ombudsman commission furnishes the dedicated office with a list of the top 20 longest cases on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's books.  I can assure the committee that the chief superintendent and superintendent in this area are proactive in terms of chasing down colleagues who are involved in these investigations and whose responsibility it is to pass on this information.  They try very hard to ensure that the next list is not a repeat of the previous one.  In other words, that they are acting within the relevant timeframes.</p></speech>

There have been two, one in Cork and one in Limerick.  We have offered those facilities to our colleagues in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, but they have chosen to use those orders as is their right and we fully understand it and have co-operated fully.

That is what happened in that case.  However, when people are the subject of a criminal investigation, they are entitled to the laws of the land and are entitled to protections that are there.  All I can do and all my officers can do is try to inculcate in our people the need to co-operate with these people who have a difficult job to do.  As I said at the outset, there will always be tensions between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of the nature of the work we do and because of the allegations with which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is involved.</p></speech>

The Language Commissioner also appears before this committee and he has praised the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its changes with regard to the implementation of the Official Languages Act.  I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the positive way it has engaged with him.</p><p>  During the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission presentation here there was a palpable sense of frustration on the part of its representatives.  We are basing it on the evidence we heard from them and from the witnesses present now.  The two testimonies are poles apart.  Perhaps there has been significant bridge building in the interim.  It is important to go back to some of the evidence representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission gave to us.  They were very careful and judicious in the wording they chose here.  I will go into some depth on the issues raised.</p><p>  Mr. Simon O'Brien cited that requests from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for information necessary to advance investigations were not being completed within a timeframe of 30 days agreed in protocols under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and in one case it waited 542 days for a request to be completed.  I know the Commissioner has said that there are new protocols.  What are the new protocols?  Do the new protocols reflect the 30 days specified in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act?</p><p>  In talking about the difficulties between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, he also stated: <blockquote>We had hoped, however, that by the time of publishing our 2012 annual report this spring we could have put any comments on these issues in the past tense.  Alas, when that date approached, there were still problems.</blockquote>It indicated to us that even though the CHIS system has been in places since to 2006, the issues the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission witnesses related to us were current issues and there were still problems in the interim.  They relate to the keeping of data, files, etc.</p><p>  Ms Carmel Foley stated:<blockquote>We remain concerned however that, as a result of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na delays in completing these investigations, at any given time there is a caseload of about 500 complaint files of a disciplinary nature awaiting completion ...  We are very conscious that these delays place unnecessary strain on complainants and on the Garda members concerned</blockquote>That was current in July.</p><p>  Mr. Kieran FitzGerald in talking about the report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas stated:<blockquote>We submitted the report because our findings in an investigation conducted in the public interest led us to have serious concerns regarding the implementation and management of informant handling procedures, both historic and current.</blockquote>I am pointing out that they told us these issues are current and not all historical.  He told the committee, &quot;What we found led us to conclude that there were serious deficiencies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management procedures regarding informant handling practices&quot;.  It is important to say they are using the language &quot;what we found&quot;.<br />I understand that Mr. Simon O'Brien comes from a policing background and the work the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission does is on the principles of policing.  I cannot imagine they made any of these statements in a light fashion.  If they said that is what they found, there must have been something to back that up.  I am concerned that they found serious deficiencies and that they would have evidence that they obviously could not share with us because of the confidential nature of what they were investigating.</p></speech>

It relates to the significant amount of resources used in investigations by the ombudsman commission.  A total of 45,000 man-hours are being used at a time when the Commissioner and his garda&iacute; throughout the country are facing cutbacks.  Recently, I saw the figures relating to the dramatic downturn in the amount of overtime being paid to garda&iacute;.  This shows that the force is crippled for resources.  The Commissioner is doing his best with the resources he has, but I question the use of 45,000 man hours to conduct investigations on behalf of the ombudsman commission at a cost of &euro;1.3 million or &euro;9 million since 2007.  I appreciate what the Commissioner has stated, that is, that these matters must be investigated and dealt with properly, but what is the view of the Commissioner on the level of resources being taken from the force, as it were?  There are so many competing demands on the resources and hours of the Garda.  I figured it was okay to ask that question.</p></speech>

Thank you for your iteration.  I thank the Senator and the Deputy for their questions.  I appreciate what they have said to me in respect of the language issue.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga has been in contact and we are trying hard to address some of those issues.  The attrition rate in recent times has been considerable and we are doing our best to upskill people in terms of the Irish language.  It is a work in progress.</p><p>  The Senator referred to 30 days.  I would love to be able to report to the committee that everything is as smooth as silk but there will always be issues and tensions.  I have said it already and I do not like to repeat myself in view of the Chairman's remarks, but there will always be issues and problems.  Our job, having brought the office back to a central point of contact, means that we are able to take a closer and more hands-on approach at the level of chief superintendent and superintendent to monitor peers, colleagues and subordinates to ensure that we move the process on.  There are issues and problems but we are working through them.</p><p>  The new protocols that the committee referred to provide for a range of exchange.  Reference was made to the question of trust and confidence.  It is the situation that we do have trust and confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  However, what I was speaking about earlier was my personal obligation as the holder of the intelligence and the necessity to have the reassurances that I now have, contained in the new protocols, which I did not have previously.  We have had one or two problems in the past.  I am a firm believer in parking it, moving on and learning from the lessons of the past.  Let us hope that I do not have to be in a position to come back to the committee and try to explain again what is happening.</p><p>  The Chairman spoke about regretfully having to highlight issues that are still ongoing.  My job and the job of my officers is to work through all the protocol arrangements line by line.  It is precisely a protocol not a statutory instant; it is an arrangement that grew out of the primary legislation, a mechanism to provide for the type of co-operation that we are all striving to achieve.</p><p>  I have said it publicly and I am saying it to the committee this morning that my remit is to ensure that I protect the information and intelligence that I have within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that I act responsibly, that I am human rights compliant and that I am complying with the law and the duty of care.  Otherwise, we will have bodies lying all over the country.</p></speech>

I certainly would not wish to do anything to inhibit or stem the growth in that area.  It is the right of every citizen to complain about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are accountable - every single one of us - and that is the way it always will be.  Consequently, I have no complaint to make there.  It is the amount of time and energy that is expended in chasing up people, the availability of people, people not co-operating and trying to meet deadlines, that is, all the housekeeping issues that are associated with dragging out and delaying the process.  These are frustrations for my officers.  That is natural and it is understandable.</p></speech>

The language used was carefully chosen and when one sees carefully chosen language. one always knows it speaks volumes about what is not being said.  I am quite shocked today by the Commissioner's initial presentation.  I have been sitting here thinking of what word would be appropriate and that is the one I have come up with.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh noted, I believe there is a distance between these two statements.  One could not know that these two statements had anything to do with each other.  I am surprised that as Commissioner, having been obliged to read what was said here in July and given what he already would have known, that when making his opening statement to members he did not make reference in a much stronger way to the criticisms that were made in this document because they were very serious.  Delayed as it was, this was the Commissioner's opportunity.  Deputy Charles Flanagan raised that matter and I concur.  While it was delayed, these things happen and here we are.  If one did not know, were one to come in here as an outsider without being aware of the original document, one would be forgiven for thinking that while the Commissioner had stated it was not perfect, things were going okay.</p><p>  These two statements have nothing in common with each other and that is quite telling, as are the Commissioner's comments just now about having no choice by law but to deal with the ombudsman commission but yet, at the same time, he really would wish it were different.  He would like there not to be, I believe the words he used were "a constant stream of complaint".  In a modern age, where we are all striving for transparency, I would have thought the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this State would welcome the fact that people felt able to complain and that he was able to put aside-----</p></speech>

I would have thought the Commissioner would want people to be able to complain and would welcome that ability.  I am absolutely astounded by the idea that the Commissioner would even begin to consider that it was using time and energy which ought to be used for other things.  I would welcome the Commissioner's observations in this regard.</p><p>  I, of course, appreciate the reduction in resources and so on and can only begin to imagine the frustrations the Commissioner has as a manager in ultimately trying to manage those resources.  Nonetheless, he has made a very serious observation.  It was also telling that in his opening statement, the Commissioner told members about the investment the Garda has made in dealing with matters to do with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in terms of time and money.  I do not know how much the Garda has invested in training or, if one likes, on the other side, that is, on the good side of this.  Can the Commissioner provide figures to members in this regard?  How many staff are involved in the management of covert human intelligence sources, CHIS?  Surely the Commissioner would want it to be like this and not to be telling members it is costing so much money in the way he has.  I echo Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's impression that there still appears to be frustration in the Commissioner's office with the entire matter of the ombudsman and this is quite serious.</p><p>  The Commissioner should forgive me, as I may have missed it, but I am not entirely clear that members received an answer on the issue of the off-the-books informants.  The point made in the original report was there was no oversight that would allow this to be known.  Is there now oversight that would allow this to be known?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013112000011#L00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  The Senator said she was shocked by my presentation.  Some of the things she has spoken about are out of context in terms of the answers I have given.  The Senator said she was surprised I did not react more strongly to the criticisms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission report.  What I said very clearly is that I purposely did not commit my comments on the ombudsman commission's report to the public domain but that I certainly indicated, in very clear and very detailed terms, my reflections on it when I met the Minister and the chairman.  None of us was in any doubt as to my position on a number of aspects of that report.  I am not, nor will I ever be, in the business of criticising another State agency in public which, after all, is trying to do its job to the best of its ability.  I have indicated there were issues and difficulties and I articulated those points very clearly, both in a written submission to the Minister and in my oral presentation to him.  That is as much as I am prepared to say on that aspect.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned she was astounded by comments about my officers being engaged in the type of duty in which they are engaged when taking on investigations of this nature.  The Senator mentioned the record.  If she goes back over the record she will find I have said on a number of occasions at this fora that we are all engaged in a process of ensuring oversight and doing the right thing.  I am paraphrasing but I have made that point a number of times and that is why I and my colleagues present and every other person in my organisation should co-operate fully.  I spoke about the tensions that exist.  When I was talking about my officers engaging in this type of duty, I was talking about the question that was posed to me whether would I prefer to see them doing other things.  Yes, I would - other policing disciplines.  That is not the same, with the greatest of respect to the Senator, as saying I do not believe we should be carrying out these investigations.  We are mandated statutorily to do this work and we are doing it, but there are so many competing demands on my officers and so many other important issues to be dealt with that had I a preference, this burden would be lifted from my officers and dealt with by the GSOC people or an enlarged staff.  That is the point I was making.  I certainly was not indicating, nor would I want to create the impression - if I did, I apologise, but I do not believe I created the impression - that I was against dealing with transgressors in my organisation.  If one looks at my organisation and its track record through the years in dealing with people who have transgressed and broken the law, one will see we have a very strong record in this regard.  I have personally sent colleagues to jail, and so have the people sitting beside me.  Therefore, let nobody have any issue with the commitment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensuring we do the right thing always.  That is what we are here to do.</p><p>  The Senator spoke about the issue of CHIS and the staffing levels within the CHIS system.  It would not be appropriate for me to disclose the number of people we have engaged but we have substantial resources engaged in this process.  Similarly, it would not be appropriate of me to indicate the number of people we have supplying that type of intelligence to us.</p><p>  The Senator's last point was about oversight.  Again, she said I failed to answer.  She thought it was Deputy Flanagan who raised the issue of off-the-books and the oversight we have in place to deal with it.  The oversight we have in place speaks to how one deals with a person with whom one forms a relationship in terms of supplying information or somebody that one is tasking to provide information.  The policy and the guidelines are quite clear.  Within all of that one will have a public spirited citizen who, from time to time, and it happens, will come forward with pieces of information.  We are a community-based service.  We have many friends, thanks be to God, who are more than willing to help us and pass on information.  That is tightly controlled and that is the system.  That is our standard operating procedure.  If somebody, God forbid, is acting outside of that system, I would love to hear from somebody who can tell me how I would put in place an oversight to capture those people, if they are out there.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned the language in the reports and said that surely there must be evidence in terms of the use of language.  I have been very careful, both in my opening remarks and what I have been saying in response to these searching yet pertinent questions, and I have been very careful in the language I have used, and it is important that I am.  After all, we are all responsible people here.</p><p>  I have described the issues of the oversight in place.</p></speech>

I was not suggesting at all that he would have been criticising another State body.  I was thinking that the observations made by the Garda ombudsman were so serious, it did not appear they were echoed in Mr. Callinan's remarks.  With regard to oversight, the Garda ombudsman, when dealing with the off-the-book elements, stated: "The oversight systems in Ireland do not seem to take account of this."  My question related to the fact that the words, "in Ireland", suggest there is another part that could be introduced that has not yet been.</p></speech>

I should say first that our committee deals with all the ombudsmen and we are very proud that the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, has been elected as the European Ombudsman.  We have established a reputation in Ireland in this evolving area, as the ombudsmen would acknowledge.  The public service managers, including Secretaries General right down to people taking the telephone calls in the local council office or Garda station, face a challenge in cultural terms, so this issue is not unique to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Across the public sector a change in culture is needed to deal with the concerns of the public.  I appreciate the points about the evolving relationship.  Our challenge as a committee is to ensure the relationship gets stronger and better in order that accountability exists.</p><p>  With regard to the context of this meeting, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission carried out a special public interest investigation into "allegations of collusion by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with an individual in the movement and supply of controlled drugs, and the nature and extent of any relationship/s between members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that individual".  It is a serious matter.  As noted by Deputy Harrington, we are thankful that only a tiny minority of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have dishonoured the proud tradition of the force, which has a unique relationship with communities.  We are very proud of that special relationship, which compares well with what can be seen in other countries.  When an investigation like this occurs, it is in everybody's interest, including ours and the Garda Commisioner's, to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>  I can have some degree of sympathy with the point about sensitive information, assurances about where that goes and the protection of human rights.  Most people can understand this as a concern.  There were 63 requests for information made during this investigation of immense public importance but only 17 of them were processed within the 30 day period, with 20 running over six months and some going to years before a response was forthcoming.  Maybe the cases which took years could be in the category mentioned by the Garda Commissioner, but it is clearly unacceptable that two thirds of the requests went over the time limit in such an important investigation.  What are the thoughts of the witness on that?</p><p>  The Morris tribunal, which had connections to my home county of Donegal, revealed an appalling abuse of power by some garda&iacute;.  I am thankful it is long over and we have a very proud force up there again which is doing a great job.  At the time of the tribunal there were lessons to be learned from the recommendations, but what is worrying is that this report states the lessons of the Morris tribunal around the handling of informers and retention of contemporaneous notes, which would be critical for reflection, were not learned.</p><p>  What were the thoughts of the witness when he read the report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission?  I have no doubt he is as determined as all of us to get to the bottom of these allegations and either prove or disprove them.  What does he think of the "grave concerns"?</p><p>  I commend the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on coming together and agreeing a new memorandum of understanding, updating what is in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  Is the witness confident to indicate to the committee that from now on, the majority of requests from the commission will be responded to within 30 days?  If not, would he be agreeable to some type of adjudication, as suggested by my colleague, Deputy Harrington?  It could happen in agreement with the Minister that a High Court judge, for example, or somebody with that independent capacity, could adjudicate where co-operation is resisted in areas such as the handling of informers or issues concerning a threat to the human rights of individuals.  Any sensible citizen could understand the importance of such issues.</p></speech>

I accept that.  Nevertheless, I will be limited in what I say.  As I mentioned to the Senator, I have certainly articulated in very clear terms my thoughts on that particular report.  The idea of people running agents off the books, allowing them to participate in crime and related activities is a no-no as far as I am concerned.  There is no contest.</p><p>  With regard to the 63 requests, it is important we understand certain issues.</p> <p>In the first seven months of that particular investigation, which ran for four and a half years, 104 volumes of documents, averaging 200 pages per volume, was handed over.  That is in addition to well in excess of 1,000 other documents ranging from one page to 60 pages.  If one took a mean average of 30 pages and added the two together, one is dealing with well in excess of 50,000 pieces of documentation that was produced to that investigation.  In my view, that was a huge level of co-operation, although people will have their own view on the matter.  It required two superintendents and a full-time staff to service the requests within the cohort of 63, which translated into something like 237 requests when they were spread out.</p><p> Part of the difficulty - we brought this to the notice of the ombudsman's office - was if, for instance, in request one, when all the relevant material was gathered up and produced and there was a requirement to revisit it because there could be ten other subsets of inquiry, that one request remained open, which helped to elongate the process.  We did not think that was particularly fair but there one goes.  We have moved on.</p><p> The Senator asked me about lessons regarding contemporaneous notes and grave concerns that have been expressed.  I want to assure the committee, the Chairman and everybody who happens to be watching and listening that there is a very tight regime in place now in terms of the notes that are required to be kept when meeting informants.  That process exists and can be examined.  There is a clear audit trail.  That is in place. </p><p> Yes, I was surprised to hear the comment about the lessons of the past regarding the Morris tribunal.  None of us need to go into that dark period in our history but I was surprised to hear some of the comments because very clearly, since 2006, my organisation has put a lot of time and energy into getting a bespoke system that fits international practice and is accredited by experts in Europol and the CEPOL police college.  Our international partners, as I said earlier in response to a previous question, have commented about and are very comfortable with us in terms of the type of business that we do.  In terms of giving reassurance to the committee, I am very happy that the system we have in place speaks to international best practice.</p><p> On the issue of the 30 days and whether it would be helpful for a high level official to come in and examine the area, particularly in the area of non-compliance presumably, what has happened since we met the Minister was an agreement by all of us that he would appoint a high level official in his Department to sit down with a representative from my organisation and the ombudsman's office.  That senior officer is Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Mahoney who is in charge of the crime and security area.  He can speak to the very high level and sensitive stuff right down.  He is working with the other official and someone at appropriate level in the ombudsman's office to look at these issues and to try to identify where the blockages are in order to free them up before they fester and cause a problem.  That is in place now.  Have I covered all of the points raised by the Chairman?  </p></speech>

I have been asked to represent Faugheen, a small village in the Suir Valley.  Any settlement below 1,000 people is not considered a constraint to the Grid Link project, and the population of our village is less than 200.  As a result, the K2 pylon corridor drives straight through the heart of our village.  Faugheen is not just a village; it is at the centre of a rural community.  I do not have time to paint a full picture; suffice to say that I know that many committee members come from and represent communities just like ours, so they know what Grid Link will do to us.  Faugheen is a link in a chain from Cork to Waterford and up to Kildare, and we are all in this together.  We are not backward-looking and we are all for progress, but progress, by definition, must be forward thinking, and the legacy we leave must be one of which we can be proud.</p><p>  We have genuine concerns about the effects that Grid Link will have on community employment, agriculture, tourism, nature, the environment, heritage and culture.  Our anxieties about health and property devaluation are absolutely valid and based on truth and must not be disregarded by EirGrid, nor by the Government.  As for community gain, all we see at the moment is loss.  The true cost of these pylons must be brought to light, so we are asking this committee to plead with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to call a halt to the current process so that other options such as underground cabling can be re-examined using the latest information and in an open and transparent manner.  In its current form, Grid Link will bludgeon its way through the heart of all of our communities, because neither EirGrid, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources nor the Government can see a true picture of us on a map.</p></speech>

I am from Borris in County Carlow and I am speaking on behalf of the Save our Heartland group.  The map on page 6 of my written submission, which many committee members will have seen, is a map of primary constraints prepared by EirGrid in its route identification process.  We believe this map is fundamentally flawed in how it depicts landscape value in Ireland.  The red areas on this map are primary constraints to be avoided if possible in route identification, while the light-coloured areas are okay for pylons.</p><p>  There is no whole-island map of landscape value.  EirGrid has subjective and inconsistent information on landscape value from each local authority.  Carlow appears on the map as a totally unconstrained landscape.  There are no primary constraints in our Carlow development plan.  All four pylon routes pass through the small county of Carlow, and, most significantly, two of the pylon routes pass just beside the monastic settlement of St. Mullins and through the beautiful and historic designed landscape of Borris House.  On the next map, we can see areas of landscape constraints stopping at county boundaries, so because Kilkenny is an area of constraint and is to be avoided if possible by EirGrid, the landscape value stops at the River Barrow.  How can landscape value stop at a river?</p><p>  In 2002, Ireland ratified the European Landscape Convention.  This places obligations on the Irish Government to protect, manage and plan the landscapes of Ireland hand in hand with the communities that inhabit those landscapes.  We believe the Government has failed to comply with Article 6 of the European Landscape Convention in the case of County Carlow, as critical cultural and historical elements of importance to the people of Carlow and the nation have not been identified, assessed and protected.  Eleven and a half years after Ireland signed and ratified the European Landscape Convention, we still do not have a national landscape strategy.  We do not even have statutory guidelines for local authorities to help them map landscapes more consistently.</p><p>  We have three questions that we would like the committee to consider.  How can the Grid Link project have progressed to this stage with such a fundamental flaw in its mapping of landscape value?  Will the absence of a consistent all-island landscape map allow for proper planning and sustainable development in the strategic infrastructure process, executed in the common good?  Is the identification and protection of scenic landscapes, which Ireland is obliged to do under the European Landscape Convention, not also in the common good?  Thank you for your time.</p></speech>

I represent Comeraghs Against Pylons in County Waterford.  The terms of reference and the responsibility of this committee to the Oireachtas and to the Irish people are to report on this project in respect of the expenditure and the administration of the project and its compliance or non-compliance with European Union treaties and directives, to comment on the detailed cost estimates provided - or, more specifically, not provided - and to advise on the project's value for money to the State.</p><p>  A fundamental issue that drives the thinking on value for money is the need for the project.  What is driving the need for this project?  Does the committee know the real answer to this?  It is certainly not the continued, practised PR mantra from EirGrid of "Keep the lights on."  Has the committee seen a whole-life-cycle cost analysis to the value of &euro;500 million, as stated by EirGrid?  If not, why not?  How then can committee members possibly comment on issues relevant to the terms of reference of the committee?  If not, then the committee should insist on the immediate suspension of this project.  We have outlined in our written submission 18 factors that need to be addressed in the whole-life-cycle cost-benefit analysis, and we would welcome some discussion on that afterwards.  Putting the lines underground forms a major part of that discussion.</p><p>  Another major factor is the impact and cost to our health services.  The impact on mental health that this project is already having on Irish citizens and the taxpayer needs to be considered as a matter of urgency.  Why is the Government adding further mental health pressures on its citizens for no reason?  Once again, the Government allows the Irish citizen to pay the mental health price, while others in Europe get the benefit.  Ultimately, the cost to the Exchequer and EirGrid of delays, delays and more delays that arise will be immense.</p><p>  Committee members must realise that every euro spent by the Irish citizen objecting to this project is one euro less spent in our local shops, indigenous businesses or indeed saved in our banks to help the banks.  Every euro spent by EirGrid on PR companies pushing this unwanted project on top of people is one euro less spent on our struggling health service.</p></speech>

We thank the joint committee for the invitation to appear here today.</p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recently commented on the North&ndash;South interconnector as being a local row.  In our submission to the then Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Transport in 2012, we quoted from the poem &quot;Epic&quot; by Patrick Kavanagh. <blockquote>... Till Homer&rsquo;s ghost came whispering to my mind. <br />He said: I made the Iliad from such <br />A local row. Gods make their own importance.</blockquote>EirGrid has now unveiled the Grid West and Grid Link south projects, and rural communities have risen up <i>en masse</i> to oppose the overhead nature of these developments.  Despite this enormous community backlash and outcry for undergrounding, which we very much support, our position is that EirGrid intends to make a planning application early next year for a North-South overhead line.  We must deal with this situation by engaging fully in the statutory planning process.  Since the collapse of the oral hearing in June 2010, we continued working behind the scenes very much below the national radar.  We do not have a website or a Facebook page and we leave the twittering and tweeting to the birds.  We have moved far beyond the stage of holding protest rallies outside EirGrid offices.  We believe that 1,500 people held a protest march in the Comeragh mountains recently, and we congratulate them on that, but we have been there, done that and got the t-shirt. </p><p>  The whole country is now fully aware of the main issues with regard to pylons, but I will give a quick overview of how these issues relate to Monaghan.  The first issue is the visual impact.  Monaghan has a unique rolling drumlin landscape draped with small enclosed fields.  Patrick Kavanagh has described Monaghan's drumlins as his Alps.  Obviously, the visual impact of a pylon is far greater sitting on top of a drumlin than it is in a flat field.   The County Monaghan Development Plan 2013-2019 protects this unique drumlin landscape from development causing adverse visual impact.  We believe the overhead nature of the power line is totally in breach of this development plan. </p><p>  Property devaluation is another issue.  The power line will be totally out of scale in relation to the small fields and small farm holdings through which it is proposed to be sited.  This will result in a multiplier effect with regard to property devaluation compared to other parts of the country.  It will have enormous adverse effects on the farm families who may have to live and work in its shadow.  In regard to tourism, contrary to EirGrid's assertion that tourism is largely irrelevant in the context of Monaghan, significant capital investment has taken place over the course of the last rural development programme for 2007 to 2013, but now some tourism projects have been put on hold as a result of the proposed line.  There is now no direct or indirect benefit for the residents, farmers or businesses of County Monaghan as far as this project is concerned.  In the last application there was a substation in Kingscourt which EirGrid claimed was a fundamental part of the proposal that was absolutely vital to strengthen the grid in Monaghan and the north east.  This substation has now been omitted and does not form part of the proposed new application.</p><p>  There is particular concern regarding the close proximity of EirGrid pylons and conductors to dwellings.  EirGrid says it tries to achieve a distance of 50 metres from the centre line, if possible, but in any event they can go as close as 23 metres or 25 yards.  This distance of 25 yards was set in the 1934 Electricity Amendment Act, when lines were strung on wooden poles.  It is a ridiculously close distance in the context of today's massive steel pylons and 400 kV conductors.  This legislation urgently needs to be reviewed.</p><p>  There is nothing unique about the health issue with regard to Monaghan.  EirGrid states that it operates to the highest international standards, which it quotes as being the ICNIRP guidelines.  We would contend that these are not the highest international standards, but rather the lowest.  Our research shows that the highest international standards can be found in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Austria, Germany and Italy.  These standards advise levels of exposure to EMFs that are up to 250 times lower than the levels used by EirGrid and are based on the principle of prudent avoidance - if in doubt, leave it out.  We are also concerned by what we consider to be misleading information in EirGrid&rsquo;s brochure on EMFs.  In addition, there is an issue regarding the noise from electric lines and its effect on those who are autistic.  This already has a real impact for families in Monaghan, and although compelling and emotional evidence was given at the oral hearing in 2010, EirGrid has not addressed the issue in any of its documents, despite the fact that it says it has taken into account all evidence given at the oral hearing. </p><p>  With regard to the upcoming planning application, the Minister says three documents must be taken into account by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The first of these is the independent expert commission, IEC, report.  Despite our initial reservations regarding the terms of reference, this report adds much useful information to the debate and we have not criticised it in any shape or form.  However, EirGrid does not agree with large parts of this report.  It does not accept the costings, does not accept the validity of the technical conclusions and has publicly stated that the IEC was not properly briefed on the Irish transmission network and its report is incomplete.  We note with concern that the IEC has not, to our knowledge, been given an opportunity to respond to EirGrid&rsquo;s critique of its report.  The second document to be taken into account is the Oireachtas committee report of 2012.  No public comment on this has been made by EirGrid as far as we are aware.  The third document is the Government energy policy document.  This, obviously, is the most important of the three documents, yet even with regard to this document EirGrid selects the elements that suit it and conveniently ignores the rest. </p><p>  With regard to the debate on the comparative costs of an underground versus overhead line, the previous Oireachtas committee could make no decision on the comparative overall costs, as no cost-benefit analysis had been carried out.  We feel it is imperative that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out immediately by independent experts.   The east&ndash;west interconnector has just been named as the best engineering project of the year and we congratulate EirGrid on this project.  The cable is 264 km in length and while we think of it as being under the sea, approximately 70 km of underground cable has been laid in Ireland and Wales.  The whole scheme came in on time and within budget at a cost of &euro;600 million.  It uses the latest high-voltage direct current/voltage source converter, HVDC-VSC, technology in two convertor stations.  With regard to the direct cost of putting the North&ndash;South interconnector underground, EirGrid must now know exactly what that cost would be.  We suspect that the true cost of undergrounding the North&ndash;South interconnector is a lot less than three times the overhead cost.  Otherwise, EirGrid would not be slow to put these costs into the public domain.</p><p>  As EirGrid was clearly incapable of organising a consultation process in County Monaghan, Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee organised three consultation events in local community centres in the affected areas in order to facilitate EirGrid.  More than 600 people attended these events, but yet again the genuine concerns presented to EirGrid were dismissed and relegated to an appendix in its final report, which was swiftly published a few short weeks later.</p></speech>

We received a late invitation to attend this meeting on Monday afternoon.  We are grateful for that invitation and are happy to be here.  We hope the committee will see fit to reconvene on this matter, particularly in light of the serious issues relating to the projects that are being proposed.  We would be happy to come before it again at a later date.</p><p>  The timing of this meeting is significant, given that this is the final week for submissions to be lodged in what has been labelled by EirGrid as a "public consultation phase".  What occurred in reality is that the public consultation phase is deeply flawed in that groups throughout the country only learned about the project gradually and were obliged to go about raising awareness in their own communities because EirGrid did not do so.  The groups are trying to encourage people to lodge submissions before Tuesday next, 26 November.  In the context of a project with a budget of billions of euro and funded by the State, it has fallen to individual citizens to raise their concerns and to appear here and elsewhere in order to seek to have them addressed.  We are all working people who are raising families in our own right.  It is very unfortunate and should not be the case that it falls to us to have to justify the very real concerns of the people surrounding us who are potentially affected by the project.</p><p>  What are the concerns of the people?  Many of these are well documented and common among citizens throughout the country.  The potential health effects of the project are also well documented and have been receiving increasing coverage in the media of late.  I will return to the effects on the visual amenity and tourism shortly.  First, I must comment on the depreciation in the value of housing and land.  There are various estimates available in respect of the level of reduction in the value of land and properties located close to pylons and cables.  There is no doubt that depreciation occurs, but the only offer of compensation being proposed is that to the owners of land on which pylons will be erected.</p></speech>

The cost of above-ground pylons is far more than just the cost of physically locating them in the countryside.  The project should be costed in its entirety, including in terms of the cost to communities, the depreciation in the value of property and land and the impact on tourism.  If this is done, the cost of the alternatives to going above-ground will suddenly seem very viable indeed.</p><p>  Without minimising the import of these issues, of particular concern to the people of Wexford is the potential impact a project of this nature may have on tourism in the south east.  In recent years, great efforts have been made and many millions of euro have been invested in creating a tourism hub in the New Ross area.  The town is now a base from which people can explore the entire south east.  The proposed pylon routes cross every major route into and out of the town of New Ross and the visual impact cannot be underestimated.  The proposals suggest cutting through areas protected under the county development plan, several areas in which schools are located and certain highly populated localities.  At one point, the pylons will come within an estimated 500 m of the town of New Ross.</p><p>  Other areas of Wexford will of course be affected.  I can convey to members a resounding opposition to the proposed project on the part of the people of the county.  I understand the committee is to be addressed by Mr. John O'Connor, who was nominated for the position of chairman of EirGrid by the Government.  The members of the public with whom we have consulted are of the view that this is an incredibly poor decision, particularly when a project of this magnitude is in train and the intention of the company behind it is to bypass local authorities and apply directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission under the relevant legislation.  This appointment should be reconsidered, if not for reasons of actual bias then for those of perceived bias.  It has been suggested in the media that Mr. O'Connor's previous role in An Bord Plean&aacute;la was akin to that of a High Court judge.  I presume this is to suggest that he is beyond reproach.  The legal community has addressed a situation similar to this.  Were a High Court judge to resume practice at the Bar, the code of conduct would come into play.  Rule 5.21 of that code of conduct states: "A judge of the Irish Courts, following retirement or resignation, who returns to the Bar may not practice in a court of equal or lesser jurisdiction than-----"</p></speech>

The first six contributors will be Deputy Moynihan, then a member from the Government side, then Deputy Colreavy, then another member from the Government side, then Deputy Mattie McGrath and finally another member from the Government side.  When they have posed their questions, I will ask our guests to provide replies.  We will then group questions from the remainder of the members.  Following that, I will take contributions from Deputies and Senators who are not members of the committee.  This will ensure that everyone will have an opportunity to speak.  I ask members and other Deputies and Senators to confine themselves, as much as possible, to asking questions.  Each spokesperson will have two minutes.  I want to be reasonable but I also want to give everyone an opportunity to contribute.</p></speech>

People had to find it and ask questions if they so wished.  That clearly does not constitute effective consultation.</p></speech>

The publication and advertisement of the process were even narrower.  That has been brought to the attention of EirGrid but it has refused to acknowledge it.  The first two phases of consultation were not advertised in the Dungarvan area.  That was clearly a breach of the Aarhus Convention.  When that was brought to the attention of EirGrid, it blatantly ignored it.</p><p>  County Waterford is a very narrow county and it has two major power lines going through it.  This would be a third one, yet EirGrid did not see fit to put a public office in the county of Waterford.  It proposed to put a major 400 kV line through the heart of the county stretching the length and breadth of Waterford.  Why, for example, were there no national television advertisements?  Saorview was one of the major aspects of change in this nation last year and it was advertised widely on television.  There was not one television advertisement on Grid Link.  There were no publications on phases one and two, no television advertisements, no public office in the county of Waterford and no advice in response from EirGrid.  Last week, EirGrid went to Waterford County Council and asked if it could open up a public office in its premises.  How could that be right?</p></speech>

I say that with due respect.  The question put by Deputy Moynihan was whether we considered the consultation to be a true attempt to engage.  EirGrid&rsquo;s consultation is about ticking boxes that are necessary to present a planning application to the board under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  That is all it is about.</p><p>  I could speak for hours on end about EirGrid&rsquo;s consultation.  Suffice it to say that in 2007, a little article appeared in a local newspaper to say that there was consultation in a local town.  That was the first we ever heard about it, yet the North-South interconnector was agreed by regulators North and South in 2006.  At that time consultation should have started.  We were never afforded the opportunities being afforded in grid south about the overall area.  The planning application failed in 2010 and had to be withdrawn from the system, but we were never given the opportunity other groups are being given.  That has been a major issue for us in Monaghan.  I accept the point that other groups are not happy with the level of consultation.</p><p>  Last night on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, Mr. Slye said: &ldquo;I can commit to people that where they engage with us that we will get back to people and we will tell them how we have taken on board their feedback in a completely open and transparent way.&rdquo;  That is a direct quote from last night&rsquo;s programme.  In Monaghan, we organised three consultation days for EirGrid in the county when the re-evaluation report was published.  Huge numbers engaged.  Prior to that people had no interest in engaging with EirGrid because it was not believed or trusted.  Two weeks after the consultation, the final route solution report was made public.  All the issues the 600 plus people had raised were listed in an appendix at the back of the report.  That tells us that it was simply a tick-box exercise.  The final evaluation report was sitting on a shelf and ready to be published when the consultation period was over.  We had raised fundamental issues about health concerns such as autism and children with special needs and they were not addressed or acknowledged in the report and no effort was made to deal with them.</p></speech>

It is important they put their concerns on the public record, not only so that we as a committee can take them on board but also because it is hoped there will be opportunities in the near future for us to put their concerns to EirGrid and ask why it is not being fully transparent in its responses to the various communities.</p><p>  As policy-makers, we need to have a wider debate about energy security and how climate change will impact on the various sectors, whether they be agriculture, transport or the electricity infrastructure, and also energy demand.  We all have a responsibility to look at that area in-depth and to plan, even though many present will say there is already a plan with which they are not happy.  If we need to revisit that plan and look at it in a way by which it can gain public confidence, that is what we need to do.  The great dilemma for policy-makers is we are charged with the responsibility of providing a national infrastructure, whether it be roads, water or electricity, but if how it is delivered and developed impacts on communities, we have a serious problem and a serious conflict, and that is what we are hearing at this meeting.</p><p>  The two areas on which I will focus are engagement and consultation.  Those issues arise regularly across the board, as is how EirGrid is not being transparent in the information it provides to various groups and individuals.  It seems to be a box-ticking exercise.  What exactly do we need to ask EirGrid in respect of consultation?  Is it a full cost-benefit analysis, comparing the overhead option versus the underground and taking into account all the impacts?  Some have stated that.  Is that specifically what we need to see?  I have been critical of EirGrid because it is speaking in generalities, broad bland terms and is not being specific.</p><p>  For example, in Waterford, where I am from, it seems EirGrid is proposing the least cost technically acceptable solution to it, which is overhead and the most direct route, when there is an existing public corridor, the N25 which starts at Youghal bridge and goes all the way to Waterford city, and also the N9, from Waterford northwards to Kildare.  There is an existing corridor.  Has anybody seen a cost-benefit analysis of an underground cable along that corridor?  I would presume there are fewer constraints in that respect.  There are not land and access issues because there is already a public highway.  Has anybody seen a cost-benefit analysis of putting an underground cable along that corridor?  These are questions we will probably put to EirGrid.</p><p>  Is it technically possible to underground the full routes?  We are hearing it is not, that there are not examples where 400 kV lines have been put underground over that length of infrastructure.  We need to understand whether that is technically possible.  I certainly need to, and I am sure committee members and other Members do as well.  Those are two questions that need to be answered - specifics on engagement and consultation and also a specific cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>  Has any analysis been done on the existing 400 kV line between Moneypoint and Dublin?  I am not saying these groups should do the analysis but it would seem an obvious place to look.  I am not accusing anybody of speculation or anything like that, but rather than trying to understand what is ahead, surely we should look at what exists to see whether that 400 kV line has had an impact on the communities along its route from the perspectives of health, land value and tourism.</p><p>  Those are the pertinent questions we need to ask if we are to have a proper informed and calm debate about this issue.  It is an important issue for the communities which are most concerned, as are many members present.  If the groups could give us some more information in that regard, I would certainly welcome it.</p></speech>

At present, there is a similar scheme being carried out between France and Spain where they are putting it underground.  That project is referred to in the international expert commission's report.  The position was there was so much resistance on each side of the border that in 2010, the European Commission decided that it would grant a good deal of the funding to put it underground because it was vital for Spain to have some more electricity coming from France.  They constructed an 8 km tunnel, which was finished in April last.  The tunnel is two or three metres in diameter and it had to be drilled through the Pyrenees because, obviously, they could not dig it.  There is a converter station at each end and the technology they are using is high voltage direct current, HVDC.</p><p>  One can move electricity any distance using HVDC.  There is no problem in putting the North-South and east-west interconnectors underground.  They have done it with the east-west one.  It can be put underground using that technology.  On the cost issue, we would contend that the cost would be more or less the same as the overhead line when one takes all the other issues into consideration.</p><p>  EirGrid states it does not want to do it with HVDC because it does not mesh into the grid in the same way.  In other words, EirGrid must comply with what is called N-1.</p></speech>

We are catching up as fast as we can and educating ourselves.  Expertise should be sought in regard to the matter and it should be up to date, independent and objective.  EirGrid is funding the project to the tune of more than &euro;3 billion and promoting its own agenda in regard to it.  The other side of the coin should be sought.</p><p>  With regard to the full cost-benefit analysis of undergrounding along established infrastructure routes, when I specifically asked for a cost-benefit analysis of the routes being proposed, involving no undergrounding or use of existing infrastructural routes, I was told they were not yet costed.  Regarding the proposed routes between Great Island and Dunstown, outside Kilcullen, County Kildare, I was specifically told no cost estimates had been made.  I find it remarkable that the routes suggested as viable were not costed.  It is not that the individual to whom I was speaking was not aware of the costings.  I specifically asked him and he was definite that the costings had not been done.  If they had not been done on the overground routes that are being proposed, one will certainly not get costings from them-----</p></speech>

I represent Sligo-North Leitrim, which is not as badly affected as other areas.  However, I have no doubt that what the delegates are going through will be experienced in the area I represent in respect of hydraulic fracturing.  We will face exactly the same fight and we need to learn from the delegates' experience.</p><p>  There are two or three key points.  My first question concerns the meaning of consultation and the difference between consultation and dictation.  It is not consultation if somebody says to me, the delegates or a member of a community that while there will be full public consultation, the lines will go overground.  That is not consultation; it is dictation.</p><p>  We are dealing with the legacy of an absence of strategy on national power.  Nobody has considered the whole picture, including the impacts on tourism and health, the costs of delays that will inevitably arise if the overgrounding goes ahead, the cost for agriculture and the impact on property values.  People get worried when so-called experts say there is no evidence that property values are affected by overhead lines.  If I wanted to buy a house, I would pay less for one with a pylon behind it than one with no pylon nearby.  It is self-evident and common sense.  People get worried when the nonsense in question is put forward as a rationale for proceeding with overhead lines.  We need a national power strategy.  It should be a 20 or 30 year strategy, not a strategy to get the power infrastructure in place now.</p><p>  People are dismissive of health concerns regarding overhead pylons.  A housing estate near me has two houses that were built too close to an existing pylon.  The houses have small backyards.  The children in one of the houses used to play in their backyard but staff from the power company said to the parents they should not allow them to play there.  The mother said there is a big fence and the children cannot get near the pylon but she was told that was not the issue so much as what is coming from the overhead wires into the children.  Let nobody say to me there are no health effects; of course there are.</p><p>  There are two points I find unusual.  Mr. John McCusker said the driver of the proposal is not the objective of keeping the lights on, which is what the company says.  Mr. John McCusker is the first person to have said that, bearing in mind that most people will recognise we need a secure energy supply in the country.  I ask Mr. McCusker to clarify his point.</p><p>  The second point was made by Mr. Cian Moloney, who said it should not be left to the concerned citizens to fight for their rights.  I disagree in that what the delegates have done is sterling work.  What they are doing represents democracy in action.  If the legislative, planning and political processes are not looking after the delegates' rights, of course they should stand up and fight to ensure they are protected.  While it should not be left to the delegates, it is great they have stood up to defend their rights.  I have no doubt that people in the area I represent will do the same when the discussion arises on hydraulic fracturing.  Well done all.</p></speech>

The reason the witnesses have been invited to meet us is because we had originally considered inviting EirGrid first, but after a discussion at committee level, we decided it was important to hear the concerns emerging locally.  We invited the witnesses to speak to us in order that we could put their questions to EirGrid when its representatives appear before us on 4 December.  The transcript of this meeting will go directly to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I hope the witnesses will view this process as a means of sharing their frustrations and concerns in a public forum.  It is clear this is an issue which gives rise to considerable emotion, and rightly so, but this forum allows us to focus on the problems rather than the personalities.</p></speech>

Like other members, I have met community groups to discuss the EirGrid project.  I am struck by the lack of consultation, which has led to a loss of confidence in EirGrid.  Public confidence has been eroded, and as recently as yesterday, we have received messages from people who have been unsuccessful in getting information from the company.  That is not how one should engage in public consultation.  Deputy Coffey made most of the points I intended to raise regarding the M9 route.  The report of the expert commission indicated that the best route for cables is usually along existing infrastructure, such as large motorways or railway lines.  It referred to the interconnector between Spain and France, which is underground and follows major roads.  I want EirGrid to consider the feasibility of constructing its lines along the motorway network.  It is the shortest and straightest route and, as it is in State ownership, there is no need for compensation.</p><p>  As I drove along the M9 this morning, I conducted a not very scientific investigation into the number of houses that were located close to the motorway.  The cables are to be located at least 50 m away from houses and there did not appear to many houses within that distance from the road.  If the interconnector follows the motorway, it will address many of the concerns expressed by community groups.  This committee has a duty to ask EirGrid to consider the motorway option.  The distance between the connection at Great Island to the motorway is only five or eight miles.  I am not an electrical engineer or an expert but this appears to be the route it should be taking.</p></speech>

In regard to the slogan about keeping the lights on, EirGrid's public relations mantra is rehearsed on every occasion its representatives speak on the national airwaves or in consultation sessions.  Ireland has a strong national grid.  The issue is that memorandums of agreement have been signed between certain EU member states.  France and England are decommissioning a number of nuclear power plants and England is also decommissioning fossil fuel plants.  This decommissioning process will be completed between 2020 and 2025.  The Grid Link project involves the construction of interconnectors to supply renewable energy, which we welcome, across people's houses to Europe.</p></speech>

EirGrid is responsible to nobody, is controlled by the Commission of Energy Regulation, CER and we are not sure if it has to answer to the Minister on how it designs and lays its power lines.  To answer the question on running the power lines along the motorways, there are no motorways in County Monaghan.</p><p>  Somehow 50 m has become an accepted distance between dwellings and the pylons and power lines but we do not know where this 50 m comes from.  In Northern Ireland the distance is 75 m for the exact same line.  Here is a quote from Northern Ireland Electricity's submission to the public inquiry:<blockquote>100 m distance has been established as a general guide in order to address concerns relating to visual amenity.  The 100 m distance has been proposed as, at this distance for a property located on level ground with a garden extending to 15 m from the house, a 10 m tall tree at the end of the garden will screen views of 55 m tall towers located at 100 m from the property.  While these towers applicable to the proposed overhead line (the Northern Ireland section) are up to 42 m in height and are not as tall as those discussed in the Beauly-Denny line, the principles of this approach are still relevant and when these principles are applied to smaller tower heights of up to 42 m, the distance at which screening would not be effective when reduced to 75 m.</blockquote>No matter how stupid and silly that reason is to pick those distances, at least it is some sort of reason, but EirGrid has given no reason whatsoever why it has picked 50 m.</p></speech>

We have been invited here today and we are all very grateful for it, but it is very clear that we are at a very different stage of the process from the group in Monaghan.  They have very different issues ahead of them in respect of the planning process, so I feel it is only fair to point out that we should have separate sittings of the committee so that we can really pass on our feelings.  The process of democracy is very important and we are very grateful for the opportunity to partake in it, but one of the cost factors and constraints now facing EirGrid is the number of people up and down the line who are saying "No" to this.  There needs to be an opportunity for both parties to look at their issues separately.</p></speech>

Of course this is a long process.  There will be other meetings, but we felt that in advance of meeting representatives from EirGrid, we needed to hear about the stages that the different groups are at in different areas of the country.  This will not be concluded at this hearing, and there will be many future hearings.  We have already spoken about an umbrella group for all of the groups that are emerging, and I am sure their views will be heard here at some stage as well.  This committee is a facility that would not be possible in the Chamber, so we want to put that at the disposal of groups like those before us today, in order to give you a voice.  We have to go into discussions in our considerations of this and we must work within the terms of reference ourselves.</p><p>  I would feel that this is democracy in action.

It does not.  To do so would be to acknowledge that there is an unsafe distance from houses, and it does not do that.

That policy was developed by EirGrid, which is a private company, albeit wholly owned by the Minister.  How can a private company develop government policy in this way?  Government policy must reflect the interests of the people of Ireland.  Ireland has some unique attributes compared to other countries, especially in the way we inhabit our rural landscape.  Everybody knows that Ireland has a dispersed settlement pattern, that Irish people live in our landscape to a much greater extent than in other countries.  Fundamentally, I feel that this has not been addressed in the Grid25 process.  Under EU law, people who inhabit a landscape have rights to be involved when decisions are made about that landscape.  That should have happened right at the inception of this process, but it did not happen.</p><p>  There is a really serious question here about Ireland's commitment to these EU conventions on landscapes, and even the Aarhus Convention.  How committed is the Government to implementing those?  When we look at the timelines for the European Landscape Convention, we see that 11 and a half years after we ratified it, there is no national landscape policy.  This goes beyond EirGrid, which has just been given a job to do.  It is about the Government fulfilling its obligations under EU policy for the good of the people of Ireland.  The whole issue needs to be reviewed from that standpoint.  Government policy needs to reflect the needs of the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

EirGrid has never stated that the minimum distance is 50 m.  Its representatives will tell us that they aspire to it being 50 m.  I questioned Mr. John Lowery from EirGrid on this in the Granville Hotel in Waterford, when I asked him what was the absolute minimum distance between a pylon or line and a house.  He did not give me an answer.  I understand it to be 12 m, because of the electrical flashover between a cable and earthing structure like a house.  However, EirGrid has never stated a minimum distance, even for the fall distance of a pylon.  Pylons and heavy lines were blown over a few weeks ago in England following heavy storms, so one would imagine that at least the fall distance of any line or pylon should be taken into consideration.  Let us be clear about this.  EirGrid has never stated the minimum distance is between wires and houses.  Perhaps its representatives might inform the committee next week, and I would love to hear what that minimum distance is.</p></speech>

I understand that they are all lay people, trying to raise their families and live in their communities.  They depend on governments to defend their right to live in an environment that is not a threat to their health.  We have heard and seen excellent presentations, including the EirGrid document that does not mention the elephant in the room.  We have had groups in front of the committee before, and it is a pity that the national group has not been set up yet, but we are where we are with that.</p><p>  I believe the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has signed a memorandum of understanding with our British counterparts who will be served by these lines.  During the lifetime of the last committee, we were supposed to visit underground sites in Europe.  That never happened, although I think it should have happened because we are operating in the dark on this.  I raised the issue at the last committee several times with the previous Minister, former Deputy Eamon Ryan, about putting them down with the motorways.  Some of those roads were only being developed at that time.  We were told that the cables would overheat.  I hate to use the word "lies", but we have been told damned lies all the time.</p><p>  We have seen that people are completely dissatisfied with the sham of a token consultation.</p></speech>

They cannot regulate the temperatures, it is slower for maintenance and I get the impression from them that if something happens along the line, they will not be able to pinpoint where it is.  However, sensors can be placed along the line to pinpoint problems accurately.  They are doing it sub-marine under the channels and the Irish Sea.  There is no reason, particularly with the Gird Link project, they cannot go from Cork to Great Island, Wexford by sea.  They are travelling to Dunnstown, outside Kilcullen, which is probably 20 km inland, at some point.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned health issues and both sides have reports.  When reports are quoted about health concerns, EirGrid will use wording such as there is no "conclusive evidence that there are health effects" or there is no "definitive data".  I reiterate what he said about the precautionary principle and we should err on the side of caution regarding the health of citizens.</p></speech>

No causative effect has been established that EMFs cause cancer and research is still ongoing on the basis of epidemiological evidence that suggests there is a link between childhood leukaemia and EMFs at a low level of between 0.3  and 0.4 microtesla.  EirGrid has published a brochure entitled, &quot;EMF and You&quot; and while health is a serious issue, we would at least expect that the information in this would be correct and accurate.  Page 18 asks what is the view of the Government and then goes on to quote from a review in March 2007 commissioned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and a study that emanated from the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser, which is now closed.  The Department and this office may have been staffed by fine people but they are not the Government<br />The Chief Scientific Adviser states the Government's view as:<blockquote>The Government decided that a single agency State agency be established to deal with both ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation.  This will be achieved by extending by the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to include responsibly for matters relating to non-ionising radiation.  The Government has also agreed to establish a national research programme to undertake further scientific research in Ireland on the health effects of exposure to EMF.  This research programme will build expertise in Ireland and contribute to global knowledge.</blockquote>Those two promises have not yet been fulfilled.  The transfer of responsibility to the RPII from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is in train but it has not happened yet.</p><p>  The Chief Scientific Adviser's document states goes on to state: &quot;In relation to EMF, that is electromagnetic fields, the reports states no adverse health effects have been established below the limits suggested by international guidelines.&quot;  The document is clear that this statement only refers to electric fields and not to magnetic fields.  With regard to the latter, he states: &quot;There is limited scientific evidence of an association between magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia.  This does not mean that magnetic fields cause cancer but the possibility cannot be excluded&quot;.  He then claims: &quot;It is simply not possible for the level of energy associated with power lines to cause cancer.&quot;  I can assure the committee that the Chief Scientific Adviser did not stand over that statement.</p></speech>

We pointed out in our submission that the European Commission has set up a scientific committee on emerging and newly identified health risks, which has produced two reports over the past number of years.  They state that the scientific evidence remains uncertain, EMFs are possibly carcinogenic and might contribute to an increase in childhood leukemia.</p> <p>In addition, they state that, on the basis of their statistical analysis and current review, some type of link cannot be ruled out.  </p><p> Mental health, which is a major problem in Ireland, is also an issue.  If this project proceeds, it has the potential to create serious negative equity problems for tens of thousands of householders.  I am sure the banks will rub their hands and take great interest in how they will get their money back.  How is this issue and the impact of this project on mental health being addressed?  Evidence regarding the health issues arising from the project is described as "inconclusive".  What does this word mean?  It means no one can state definitively that the problem has not been caused.  The statistical evidence suggests there is a link of some description but science has not yet caught up.  As in the case of asbestos and passive smoking for many years, science has not yet caught up.  Will we come to regret our decision when it catches up?</p><p> I will return to the issues of mental health, negative equity and how many people will be affected.  When the EirGrid project in Rush was before the forum a few years ago, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, wrote to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  I understand members have a copy of that correspondence in which the Minister outlined his concerns about health issues arising from the project.  If our Minister for Health has concerns, why is the Government allowing these projects to proceed in the manner proposed?</p></speech>

While my constituency may not be affected by the current proposal, there is no doubt, given its topography, that it will be identified for the future development of wind farms.  To be fair to the delegation, its members did not come here expecting to hear flippant, throwaway promises that all their problems will go away.  It would be disingenuous to make such promises and it would not do any service to the joint committee or these hearings.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey referred to the existing line between Moneypoint and County Kildare.  The joint committee needs to do considerable work in this regard.  We must raise with EirGrid the failure of the company to consult the various groups before us.  We also need to invite in representatives of Clare County Council, North Tipperary County Council and others, to establish how much development has taken place near the line from Moneypoint to County Kildare, for example, in terms of housing development.  We also need to have before us representatives of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and National Cancer Registry as they should be in a position to superimpose on a map of the existing grid the dwellings of people who have been diagnosed with cancer and so forth.  The joint committee must do a proper analysis because we need information.  </p><p>  I accept that the groups before us are not being given information and that the lack of engagement has created a vacuum which is being filled by fear.  We must try to debunk the myth that the grid is not needed.  We should ask the Industrial Development Agency what it requires in the north west, north east, south east and west, which will be the next line.  This would help us to ascertain whether the grid is required.  We hear flippant remarks that it not needed.  Let us find out if it is needed, the reason it is needed and how many jobs the project will support in the regions. We must also ascertain if it can be completed in a manner that accommodates local communities. </p><p>  The joint committee must engage with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Roads Authority.  It would be easy for me, as a Deputy from a constituency that is not affected by the proposal to erect transmission pylons, to demand that they be buried.  Proper engagement is needed with other owners of State infrastructure to ascertain whether they will accommodate EirGrid.  There is no point in asking for cables to be placed under a motorway if the National Roads Authority subsequently refuses permission for X, Y or Z reasons.  We also need to consider using our railway infrastructure.  Broadband cable has been installed through the centre of the country, including along disused railway lines.  </p><p>  Have the groups before us discussed with the relevant local authorities what tourism projects could be affected by the project?  We heard that the project will result in the devaluation of property.  Has EirGrid offered any definitive level of compensation?  I direct that question to the group from County Monaghan.  What is the position of the farmers' organisations?  Are they trying to obtain the best possible deal for farmers? </p><p>  I hope this discussion will mark the start of a process.  To be fair to the groups before us, this meeting will not provide any solutions.  I would like the joint committee to invite some of the agencies to which I referred before us to clarify whether those living in close proximity to the 220kV line that runs from Moneypoint to County Kildare face a greater risk of being diagnosed with cancer than people living in west Cork.  This is the type of information we need.  We also require an independent cost-benefit analysis, setting out how much the proposed route will cost and how much an alternative route would cost.  </p><p>  I went through a similar process in respect of power masts, wind turbines and mobile telephones when I was a councillor.  In my experience, three quarters of the membership of organisations opposed to these developments falls away once a route has been selected because they no longer view the problem as theirs.  Even if the final route selected does not go through their respective area, I encourage the groups before us not to walk away from this issue.  It may not be in their parish but everybody else will be left holding the baby.  One in four people will be affected by this issue. </p></speech>

The company has been pressed to do so but has stated it does not have a national agreement in place.  It is attempting to negotiate a national agreement with the farm organisations.  The policy of the ICSMA is that the line should go underground.  The Irish Farmers' Association is the largest farmers' organisation.  We have met senior IFA figures on a number of occasions who have consistently taken the position that the association will not get involved at this stage.  However, if the project were to secure planning permission, it would get involved in the process with a view to representing farmers from a compensation perspective.  I have made clear to the IFA that it is letting down landowners by choosing not to become involved in the process at this stage.</p><p>  As members are aware, the IFA is holding an election for national president.  Last Thursday night, at a regional meeting close to us, both candidates for the position stated they wanted the lines placed underground and that, as and from last Thursday, this was IFA policy.  We will wait to see if that is the case.  Having made such a public statement, the farm organisations should get involved at this stage.  </p></speech>

I represent Dublin North West where we have had to deal with issues relating to mobile phone masts.  Over the years rules were laid down regarding their proximity to schools, etc.  I have also dealt with individual cases of pylons on estates and so on.  In some cases, there was arcing and noise from the pylons, as a result of which many were raised while some were undergrounded.  There are concerns in areas that are not affected in the same way as those the groups come from.</p><p>  The main issues for all of us are health and safety, the visual impact and the impact on our communities.  We do not know the cost of the project, including the purchase of land, nor do we know the cost of putting the lines underground or whether underground or overground is better in the long term.  I do not accept the argument that the line is not traceable underground given modern technology can do so.  When An Bord Plean&aacute;la is involved in projects such as this, local authorities do not have an input and significant expert knowledge and local knowledge on the ground is bypassed.</p><p>  I refer to the use of the environment impact statements.  They are used for most projects and they give a picture of their effect on the environment and so on.  The European landscape convention was mentioned.  Ireland has not signed up to it and that needs to be examined.  The visual impact of these structures is significant, given their effects on communities.  Perhaps the representatives have suggestions to work on.</p><p>  One expert will say EMF emissions have an effect while others will say they do not.  I have dealt with this issue on a number of occasions.  Some evidence suggests they have an effect on younger children, particularly babies.  We could bring in expert after expert but one will contradict the other.  We must be careful about this issue.</p><p>  I do not know whether EirGrid has considered the issue of the use of roads, paths, rail lines and undergrounding along carriageways and conducted a proper study that says these options should be examined.</p><p>  I recently listened to a programme where landowners said they were conned into signing deals and they did not have sufficient knowledge about what was happening.  Was this widespread?  This is important in the context of future works.  A number of the deals were for land that will not even be used for these routes.  Compulsory purchase is a contentious issue.  Are people concerned about this?</p><p>  The consultation process is an issue and much more needs to be done in this regard because other countries such as France and Spain have investigated undergrounding.  Perhaps more pressure can be applied to establish what has happened in other countries.</p><p>  The committee is concerned that many submissions have to be made by 26 November and that was one the reasons we wanted the groups in to hear their views.  There is no point in inviting EirGrid in when the consultation period is over.  That is why we wanted to hear from people.</p></speech>

As Deputy Coffey said, it is important that everybody should have their say.  Until recently, this issue only affected counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  I am from County Meath and, although I am only recently elected, it was an issue my father worked out but it is suddenly being put into the public sphere more.  The greatest barrier to expansion of the national grid is public acceptance and it is clear from the groups' presentation, protests and public meetings that we do not have that acceptance.  This has stemmed from EirGrid's lack of public consultation.  Anybody who engaged with the company over recent years could have guessed what would be said today and I am disappointed because I had hoped there would be a change in approach with the newer groups but, unfortunately, the process is the same as it was six years ago.  I do not like to hear people saying that public representation is failing them.  Significant work has gone into this over the past six years and nothing has been built overhead or overground for the Meath to Tyrone interconnector but, unfortunately, it is costing the State &euro;30 million a year for 140 km.</p></speech>

I make some points to evoke from them some responses that we can use when the representatives of EirGrid appear before the committee.  They will forgive me if I have to leave.  However, once they put the answers on the record I will be able to get them.  My first question is on public consultation.  Why do the witnesses believe the system of consultation that is in place is flawed?  What system of consultation should EirGrid introduce in order to have proper consultation?  There is an office in my town, Carrick-on-Suir which is open for six hours once a week on a Tuesday.  There are two staff there and on a particular day one was in attendance.  People went in and asked questions.  They went back a number of hours later and the other EirGrid staff member was in attendance.  They got directly opposite answers to the same questions.  That is an example of what is going on.</p><p>  I wish to ask Ms Fitzgerald about the European landscape convention.  Does she believe that EirGrid has breached that convention and that the process is flawed as a result?</p><p>  Mr. Bannigan made reference to EirGrid applying for European funding for other routes.  Are there routes other than the one he mentioned?  I have evidence suggesting that EirGrid has applied to Europe for funding for other routes.  I need clarity on that.</p><p>  Would the witnesses be agreeable if this committee could convince EirGrid to meet a representative group of each of the committees represented today to discuss their concerns about the lack of consultation and how it should move forward?</p><p>   I ask Mr. Peter Smith about the process on the selection of corridors.  Because the village, from which we both come from, Faugheen, has a population of less than 1,000, it is being disregarded and is being subsumed by the corridor.  To what extent should cognisance be taken of population density <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> villages etc.?</p><p>  EirGrid is using surveys and analyses that were done in 2008 to support its arguments.  Even the one that was done by the expert group is now outdated.  There is ongoing research in Germany and Denmark regarding the most recent technological capability of undergrounding cables.  Are the witnesses aware of that and can they give us some information on it?</p></speech>

In our area we understand that local authority members were consulted by EirGrid and had meetings.  They did not see fit to inform the public in a similar fashion to EirGrid.  It was only when we raised the issue and called public meetings, which some of the local representatives were happy to attend, that it emerged that they had had meetings with EirGrid.  Only then did we realise that.  There is an onus on members present collectively and individually to represent the people who elected them.  We call on them to do that.  There is a significant disparity in weighting between the groups here in terms of the finance and the weight behind EirGrid promoting its agenda and the community groups on the other side.  We need the committee's help on that.</p><p>  Deputy McEntee spoke about the cost difference between &euro;2.2 million and &euro;2 million per kilometre.  They do not take any regard of the other effects on the community regarding tourism, devaluation and so forth.  If they are included in a full cost-benefit analysis, then the benefits of undergrounding will be shown to be much greater.</p></speech>

The groups should then be asked to contribute to defining terms of reference of public consultation and what the public consultation should entail.  It is not for us, as simple citizens, to tell EirGrid as a semi-State body how it should conduct its business.  The Government should assist in that.  We are quite happy to agree terms of reference of public consultation.  Once those terms of reference and the issues associated with public consultation are agreed, then the consultation process can start.  Fundamentally as the existing process is flawed, it has to stop immediately and a new format needs to be agreed.</p><p>  Mr. Moloney said that the local authority members were all aware of these projects.  EirGrid has stated in documentation that local authority members, Deputies and Senators were all issued with a documentation pack at stages 1, 2 and 3 of the process.  That includes everybody in this room, effectively.  It is only when the public bring these matters to the attention of the elected representatives that their ears prick up and they start to get interested.  The electorate then bring these issues to the public representatives and not the other way around.  I would be interested to hear what the committee members have to say about the documentation packs they received.  Will the committee make a submission to EirGrid by 26 November on the basis of what the members have heard today?</p></speech>

It is for the Government to comply with it.  When it signed the convention in 2002, it undertook to plan, manage and protect the landscapes of Ireland hand in hand with the communities who inhabit the landscapes.  It needs to recognise the landscapes have value.  Even the less dramatic landscapes of Ireland have value and the Government needs to recognise this in law.  We still do not have a landscape strategy for Ireland 11 and a half years later.  This is mind-boggling when one thinks about the stunning landscape of this country and how important it is to our creativity as a nation, to our national identity and to our tourism industry, which is the bedrock of a sustainable economy in rural Ireland.</p><p>  I do not know whether EirGrid can breach the European Landscape Convention, but the Irish Government's landscape policy has meant that when it gets to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is on very shaky ground in terms of how the Irish landscape has been treated in the process.  I am from south County Carlow.  According to the stage one report, in the absence of a landscape designation from Carlow County Council, EirGrid recognised the lack of consistency in landscape mapping as a data challenge.  It is a known problem and was also in a Mazars report from 2007 prepared for F&aacute;ilte Ireland on this lack of consistency in landscape mapping from local authority to local authority.  In addressing this data challenge, EirGrid took it upon itself to make a value judgment on the landscapes in County Carlow.  It included the constraint of undesignated landscape, which completely flies in the face of the European Landscape Convention.  The community must be involved in identifying landscapes of value.  It cannot be done from a desk using a computer programme because landscapes have value on many different levels, such as historical, aesthetic, cultural and amenity.  It is only those who inhabit and use the landscapes who can assign this value.  In County Carlow's case, the fact EirGrid took it upon itself to assign landscape value without consultation either with the local authority or the local community is a significant shortcoming.</p><p>  If EirGrid pursues this project in its current form, it will be open to challenge.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la must refer it to EU legislation.  In the absence of an Irish landscape strategy, it is blown wide open.  We are galvanising support.  We have been raising money locally and if we need to take this to Europe, we will.</p></speech>

She mentioned that every year the North-South interconnector is not built means a cost of &euro;30 million.  Figures from &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million have been bandied about.  Replies to parliamentary questions have stated it costs the consumer a certain amount of money.  This is not true.  The study states there could possibly be savings of between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million, which would be a benefit accruing to the wholesale market.  How much of this would be passed back to the consumer is anybody's guess.  EirGrid states the operation of the east-west interconnector has resulted in a saving of 7% to the wholesale market, but I do not see a decrease of 7% in my electricity bill.  In fact it is increasing.</p><p>  Senator Landy asked about the latest technology and he mentioned Germany.  In Germany there is a massive discussion about rolling out a new grid of thousands of kilometres.  There are three or four transmission system operators in Germany and between them they propose that more than half of the grid will be built using HVDC technology, both overhead and underground, because it is the best and most cost-efficient method of transferring power over long distances.</p></speech>

EirGrid must use this as a constraint, but it does not take into account smaller villages.  I had to ask about the population of Faugheen and do a head count because it is not listed by the local authority.  This feeds into the differences between the development plans and mapping processes of various local authorities, and as a result it is a common problem.  The same problem is faced by the next village along from us, where it is proposed to go within 100 metres or 150 metres of a national school and an old people's home.  The village is barely even a speck on the map and because a population of 1,000 is the constraint, EirGrid is not required to be concerned and thinks it is open countryside.  As far as we can see, EirGrid has not bothered to look and it should be required to do so.  As far as we are aware, we are listed as a village in the county development plan and it could have looked there.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, to me consultation is about people sitting down together with no set agenda, with everything up for discussion.  It is up to the promoter to set out the positives and negatives of a project.  Nothing should be hidden.  If communities then have issues with the project not only should they have an opportunity to air them but they must be seen to be addressed.  This is not happening.</p><p>  The final report in relation to construction of the North-South interconnector is available on EirGrid's website and includes an appendix which lists the issues of concern to the communities.  No effort has been made to take on board these issues.  It is a case of EirGrid's way or no way.  </p></speech>

Is there any scope for agreement with EirGrid on the North-South interconnector?</p></speech>

I am from Waterford and as such I am directly affected by this issue.  I stand with all of the communities affected, including the organisations present today, who are rightly concerned about this project.</p><p>  There has been much discussion on this issue thus far.  Senator Landy asked Mr. Brannigan for his view on the consultation process.  There is a need to inject some sense of reality into the debate on this issue.  From my perspective the consultation process is flawed and will continue to be so for two reasons.  First, the planning application from EirGrid, be it in respect of the North-South interconnector or the Grid25 project, if EirGrid gets to it, will bypass the normal planning process and go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which creates problems in the first instance.  Second, the consultation process is flawed because in terms of national policy there is no hierarchy to deal with these issues.  For example, we do not, as a State, have a preference for this project overground versus underground or vice versa.  That is the main problem.  As legislators, we should be facing up to our responsibilities to legislate in this regard.  EirGrid can hide behind Government policy and the fact that we do not have a hierarchy of policy of preference in this area.  Legislators have a job to do and need to focus on it.  In my view, many politicians across all parties, at Oireachtas and local level, are rightly concerned about EirGrid's projects from a health perspective - I accept there are conflicting views in this regard - and in terms of visual impact and devaluation of land and so on.  If we want to resolve this issue, we can legislate and change the parameters in terms of the planning process.  </p><p>  I support development of this project underground.  Deputy Coffey's proposal from the south-east and Leinster perspective in terms of utilisation of the motorway network was interesting.  There is already a cable system on the main Waterford to Cork and Waterford to Dublin routes.  Why can these routes not be incorporated into the project?  These are the issues on which we as legislators should be focused.  I would like to hear the delegations' views of this issue.  As long as the focus is on the failures of the consultation process we are not dealing with the elephant in the room.  In my view, as legislators we have failed in our responsibility to ensure joined up policy in this area and to state that, like Denmark, our preference is for this project to be developed underground.  If we were to do this, the game would change.</p><p>  My advice to all of the campaigning groups is to delay this project as much as possible.  Technology is changing all of the time.  I recall EirGrid saying in 2007 that it was not possible to go underground and that it would be 21 times more costly to do so.  It is now known it would be only three to three and a half times more costly and that is only in terms of the initial investment and does not take into account the long term savings in terms of energy lost if the project goes overground.  We need to push for a cost benefit analysis on the project going underground versus overground, which analysis should be independent and based on a 40 or 50 year lifespan.  We must as best we can delay this project using every possible avenue open to us to do so.  I believe that technology is changing in favour of those of us who support the underground option.</p><p>  As legislators, we must face up to our responsibilities, which in my view we have not done to date.</p></speech>

I am a Deputy for County Meath, which has been dealing with this issue for the past six or seven years.  I accept there is a need for structural improvements within the grid and that there is a need for an an-Ireland energy market.  However, no project can proceed in this State against the will of the people.  This needs to be the basis on which we discuss all of the issues arising.</p><p>  One of the major concerns is costs.</p></speech>

These questions have been put to EirGrid but it has not come back with any answers.  Perhaps it is unwilling to do the study or perhaps it knows the answer but does not want to tell us.  We do not know, although we have asked the question.  That is one simple issue that everybody knows about, and it is not a magic or scientific matter that needs a large committee discussion.  It is one of a number of items we have identified that must be undertaken by EirGrid or perhaps another authority, which could do a cost-benefit analysis.  Perhaps EirGrid does not have competence in this matter and that is why it has not been done.  Perhaps the committee needs to inquire about that, and if EirGrid does not have competence in this regard, another authority should do it.</p></speech>

I am an optimist and there is scope for agreement.  I cannot outline how that might be possible.  While Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee has invited Mr. Slye to meet representatives of the group in County Monaghan, the offer has been refused for whatever reasons.  The committee would need to ask EirGrid about that.</p><p>  The only way to have progress on the North-South interconnector is by bringing communities along by addressing their concerns.  This has not happened after six years.  It would be very simple for me to say the interconnector would go ahead tomorrow if lines were put underground, and that is the truth.  That is what landowners and local communities want to see happening.  The Government commissioned an independent study on the North-South interconnector which indicated that the required technology exists to carry out that process successfully.  There is scope for agreement, although not the way things are currently.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane mentioned the following point.  There are no specific guidelines for power lines, although there are such provisions in dealing with wind, roads and so forth.  EirGrid probably did not want to see any specific planning guidelines for power lines until Grid25 was completed, at which time it would be like bolting the stable door when the horse was gone.  Perhaps the committee could start at that point, which is what we must address if we are to go down this line.  It should take in overgrounding and undergrounding, distance from homes and valuation of property.  It is a major task and it will not be completed before next January or February, when we might be facing a new planning application.  That should be done first.</p></speech>

I come from County Carlow, which is possibly the region most affected by this issue, as there are four potential corridors through the county, which is the second smallest in the country.  One would have to wonder how that came about.  I compliment Ms Fitzgerald on her leadership, as this is the first group in the county to deal with the issue.</p><p>  We have heard much about the consultation or lack thereof, and that seems to be the problem.  Approximately a year and a half ago, this process started with EirGrid in our area and to say there was a lack of information is an understatement.  I am a cynic in this regard.  There are four potential corridors identified but I am of the opinion that a corridor has been picked without telling people.  The policy is one of divide and conquer, with four corridors identified and the whole county rightly up in arms.  With human nature as it is - this is the tragedy - when a corridor is picked, three quarters of the people will be happy and think that at least it is not in their back yard.  There will be 25% of people very unhappy.  Mr. McCusker made the point that public representatives were made aware of the process and got packs and so on.  That may be so but there was no interest in the matter.  People were not aware where a line or corridor was to be, and it is only in the past four or five weeks, when corridors were put on a map, that people stood up and took notice.</p><p>  As there is a lack of information, a vacuum exists, and nobody can fill it.  Some of us present are probably more informed than others, especially those from the Monaghan group who have been on the road longer than others, but information must be procured to fill that void.  It should be independent and from appropriate sources.  The solution must be found and the only way for this to come about is through an independent expert group being put in place to formulate such a solution.  There should be a cost-benefit analysis, as Deputy Coffey mentioned, of the underground and overground processes.  There should be analysis of implications from a tourism and environmental perspective.</p></speech>

I know nobody who wants to have pylons.  Everybody wants the power, but everybody wants to put it underground.  That appears to be the very strong message from the public.  There are different groups at different levels on this.  When it was a problem in Meath and Monaghan it was something I followed loosely but it did not tax me.  When it does not land on one's doorstep, one does not have a motive to get as involved as when it does land on one's doorstep.  Likewise, there is no group here from Galway or Kerry, because it is not going through those areas.  There is something fundamentally wrong when communities are forced to get out and fund-raise to go into conflict with a semi-State body, EirGrid, that is supposed to operate for the common good in the interests of the people and was established to assist the economy.</p><p>  With respect to the issue of consultation, information was given out on this over a year ago.  It was sent out in packs.  I can only talk about the south east, with regard to the line from Kilcullen to Wexford and across to Cork.  A study area was identified.  One does not pay that much attention to this until lines appear in a map and one can see exactly what is happening.  I am not here to defend EirGrid but with regard to the consultation, and many people say there has been no consultation, I found in the last few months when I have been involved with this that EirGrid has gone to the public and there is consultation.  There are offices in Kilcullen and Carlow.  As I have seen time and again in the case of development plans, no matter what information one sends out with the best will in the world, there will be people who will miss it.  Some will not see it, regardless of how close something is to them.  I heard somebody say in an interview earlier this morning that letters had been sent to people in the west of Ireland, but some of them did not reach the people.  As far as I know, no letters were sent in the south east.  Am I correct about that?  It was advertised in newspapers and so forth.</p><p>  That said, there is something flawed in the consultation on this.  When communities deal with county development plans, the body is guided by national policy.  Really, the consultation is about the fact that people want it to be put underground, yet EirGrid will say that it will not put it underground.  There is a deep flaw there.  While I am one of the people who would say there is consultation, in many respects it is meaningless because the issues being raised time and again by the community will not ultimately be taken on board.  There is a flaw and that is something that must be addressed at national policy level.  There is legislation promised to put EirGrid on a statutory footing.  It is due to be published at the end of this year or early next year.  I am strongly of the view that a decision should not be made on the routes until that legislation is dealt with.  Let us see if we are willing to pay the extra cost.  Some argue there is no cost differentiation, but it appears to me that there is.  Let us debate and see if we are willing to pay the extra required to put it underground.</p><p>  I note from chapter ten in the Stage 1 report that health was one of the issues taken into consideration in the evaluation process.  There is conflicting evidence on that.  However, leave aside the health issue.  Purely from an aesthetic perspective, the impact on communities and the visual impact are quite horrific.  I never saw as many pylons as I have seen in the last couple of months, when I was looking out for them travelling along the N11.  However, to take the simple example of when the M9 was being constructed from Kilcullen to Waterford, when a route was identified and there was a sterilised area, I cannot understand why the underground cables or actual pylons or whatever system was being put in place was not part of that.  I do not believe for a moment that EirGrid or the ESB was not aware of the necessity to upgrade the grid, given that it was upgraded from the west to the east 20 years ago.  It must have been aware of it.</p><p>  In conclusion, I have a question for the Carlow group.  An environmental consultancy group called CAAS gave a presentation to Carlow County Council.  Who is that, who employed it and what was its remit?</p></speech>

It was debated in a council meeting in October and at that meeting the county manager offered to commission an independent impact assessment of each of the four routes through the county.  He reported to the November council meeting and his report contained a number of recommendations which the council has chosen to adopt.  The most important one from Carlow's perspective, and given the huge lack of consistency in how landscape is mapped from county to county, is that Carlow County Council voted to embark on a process to vary the county development plan to strengthen our landscape character assessment.  That is an important step for Carlow in trying to make the EirGrid mapping more fair.  There was a recommendation to the council to prepare its own constraints report on each route for the county.  To a degree, it takes pressure off the local groups because we have been commissioning expert reports to submit to EirGrid, so for the council to do work on our behalf is a good move as well.</p></speech>

To refer to the point Mr. Bannigan raised about hiring consultants to come up with the answer one wants, my understanding, and the witness can correct me if I am wrong, is that the group I mentioned recommended that the eastern option would have the least impact on Carlow.  That is the route that goes through poor Deputy Deering's homestead and my home village.  It goes through Wicklow.  If the committee intends to invite more groups, that group should be invited.  It recommended a certain route, and I believe that should not be the remit of an independent group.</p></speech>

This has been an ongoing problem with our county council executive.  In 2012, the county council executive issued a letter to EirGrid, welcoming it to the county and selecting the route which runs west of Mount Leinster.  I think it is the D7 route.  Therefore, last year our local authority welcomed EirGrid to use one of the most scenic landscapes in the country.  That letter was issued without discussion in the council chamber.  I do not think the councillors were even copied the letter.  I am part of the group affected by that letter.  When the county manager asked for this other report, it stated, in a work of genius, that the shortest route through the county would have the least impact on the county.</p></speech>

All we can do, as Save Our Heartland has been saying from the start, is present the best case to this process.  The idea that in valuing one's landscape or what is in one's county one is disadvantaging one route is not really true.  EirGrid will make its decision on the entire route but it is not being transparent about how it will make that decision.</p></speech>

It is consultation if one thinks consultation is setting up a stall in a local SuperValu store for a few hours on a Monday or at the local animal mart for a few hours on a Tuesday.  EirGrid did not arrive at 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m. when the farmers arrived at the mart.  EirGrid probably arrived at 10 a.m or 11 a.m.  That is how the tens of thousands of people who live in the area were consulted.  Perhaps that is good consultation to some but I do not think it was.</p><p>  EirGrid, after the Waterford County Council meeting about advertisements in local papers, said it advertised and that is on the public record.  EirGrid did not advertise and has admitted that.</p><p>  It was clearly not a convenient time because a few information days were scheduled to run from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. on a Monday afternoon when people were at work.  Lunchtime or from 11 a.m. onwards would have been a more convenient time.  There was no opportunity for people to get to the afternoon sessions held on a Monday because people look after children, pick them up from school, etc.  Why not schedule information days on a Saturday or Sunday and at a time when people are off work and can participate in the consultation process?  The consultation dates were strategically picked, timed and located.</p><p>  I wish to make a point about visual landscape.  I do not think people understand how tall the pylons will be.  The highest structure in Croke Park is one metre shorter than a pylon.  The pylons will be the height of 20 bungalows piled on top of each other.  Can the committee picture that scenario?  Can members picture the height of Croke Park?</p></speech>

The county development plan clearly states the Comeragh Mountains are a special area of amenity and conservation.  When EirGrid looked at County Waterford, it decided to use the mountains to hide the lines and pylons and its consultants, RPS, admitted that when questioned at the consultation days.  EirGrid aimed for the mountains to hide the pylons and lines.  The Comeragh Mountains are Waterford's jewel in the crown and a popular tourism destination.  They are frequented by hillwalkers and hikers at Mahon Falls and cyclists on the Sean Kelly tour.  EirGrid aimed for the destination to hide its lines and pylons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-20a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Owen Bannigan" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013112000021#U01100"><p>I wish to make a couple of brief comments on EirGrid's consultation and trying to secure public acceptance.  The county development plan was mentioned, in particular the one for Carlow.  Monaghan County Council varied its development plan four years ago in an attempt to keep pylons 100 m from a dwelling, but EirGrid went to the High Court and was successful.</p><p>  My group thought that 100 m was a very decent and respectable minimum required distance from a dwelling house.  I will outline the reasoning behind that distance being chosen.  If the 100 m proviso had been successful, due to the population structure in County Monaghan, EirGrid would not have been able to put an overhead power line through County Monaghan.  I am being honest about that.  EirGrid recognised that possibility and went to the High Court to get the 100 m proviso overruled, so EirGrid is liable to do anything.</p><p>  EirGrid attended a Monday meeting of Monaghan County Council 12 months after the oral hearing had failed in 2011.  the agency had been invited by the councillors to attend but it had nothing major to report.  While EirGrid's representative spoke and addressed the meeting, it had sent letters to every affected party to say it was re-engaging and restarting the failed process, but EirGrid could not answer the question posed at the council meeting.  Our history of EirGrid at council meetings is that it was asked many questions but it could not answer them but submitted written responses up to three months later and ignored half the queries.</p><p>  On the day EirGrid attended the meeting of Monaghan County Council, its electrical engineer attended to tell us about  health effects.  When EirGrid's engineer was questioned on his profession, he said he was an electrical engineer.  Does EirGrid wish to be professional?  Does EirGrid take the people to be fools?  I am trying to build a picture of what EirGrid is like.</p><p>  Recently a helicopter flew over the route, and this started on a Monday morning.  That afternoon EirGrid went on local radio to say it had commenced consultation.  EirGrid laid traffic counters on our roads in the past two months but never contacted or notified the county council to say it was doing so.  As it turned out, EirGrid required planning permission but it did not bother getting it even though it is a semi-State body.  There is something seriously wrong with the tactics EirGrid has used.</p><p>  My group did not come here today just to highlight all the negatives but to raise questions and show what people are faced with.  Before the committee engages with EirGrid it needs to be made aware of what has happened locally.  EirGrid does not want to consult except on where the pylon will be located.</p><p>  EirGrid's final report for statutory consultation clearly states that where the location of the tower or pylon has been identified, if the landowner wants it moved to a different location, he must do a number of things.  He must give EirGrid access to his land to survey.  If the tower is going to be located closer to anybody else's property, the landowner must get acceptance from his neighbour or neighbours.  EirGrid never looked for acceptance from anyone to erect a tower on the first day.  For a landowner to get a tower relocated, and if it is going to impinge more on somebody else's property, whether it is a field, dwelling house or whatever, the person who requests its removal must get acceptance from their neighbour.  Otherwise it will not be considered.  That was clearly written in EirGrid's final solution report.  It is unbelievable what must happen if I want a tower located in my field to be relocated to a more suitable position.  If it is going to be closer to Mr. Hillis's property, I would have to approach him and ask for his permission.</p></speech>

Where the cable sags, EirGrid must get a 9 m clearance and that is what determines the height of a pylon.  It is my understanding there has been no decision on the height of the pylon except what I have outlined.  Am I incorrect?</p></speech>
