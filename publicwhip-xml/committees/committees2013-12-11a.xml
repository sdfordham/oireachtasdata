The Central Remedial Clinic is over 60 years in existence for the provision of many complex services for disabled persons.  The HSE contracts with the CRC to provide clinical services and the Department of Education and Science contracts with the CRC for school-based educational services for disabled persons.  For the first nine months of this year alone the CRC had 3,561 clients with attendances of 55,571 accounting for 105,333 interventions.  The CRC has 278 staff based over a number of locations in Dublin and also in Waterford and Limerick.</p><p>  The three core values of the organisation have been and still are: 1. No child will be turned away; 2. No family will be charged;  and, 3. The CRC sets out to assist each child to achieve his or her potential.  We are very pleased to be here at your invitation, Chairman, and we welcome the opportunity to establish the facts and dispel some of the myths that have been circulating.  The core issue we want to address today concerns the remuneration arrangements of a number of senior managers.  It has been said in some quarters that the levels of remuneration were set without the knowledge of the HSE.  The facts are as follows.  The CRC was, and still is, contractually bound by employment contracts to pay salaries that subsequently were in excess of those determined unilaterally by the HSE in 2009.  At a meeting with HSE top officials in June 2009 - David Martin was one of the directors who attended the meetings - the CRC presented its case that it had these contractual arrangements, an issue which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, acknowledged recently exists in other agencies.  The HSE indicated it could only fund salaries as unilaterally determined by it and subsequently notified the CRC.  The CRC said that it would pay the balance from its own resources and in November of 2009 wrote to the HSE to that effect.  The CRC further confirmed that when management posts concerned fall to be replaced through retirement or resignation, the salary of the incoming replacement will be discussed and agreed with the HSE.  This information is confirmed in correspondence with the HSE.</p><p>  The issue today centres around a meeting with the HSE in 2009.  Following that meeting, all parties were clear on the arrangements in place for the remuneration in question.  My colleague, David Martin, attended that meeting and I believe it is important to hear a first-hand account of what happened at the time.  Following his contribution, we will be pleased to take any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Martin wish to make a statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Martin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121100003#B01600"><p>Yes, thank you, Chairman.  I joined the board of the CRC in 2007.  My work on the board is completely voluntary.  I receive no remuneration at all.  Neither would I seek remuneration.  That is the same right across the board.  Our work is totally voluntary.</p><p>  In 2007 a meeting was arranged with the HSE.  I attended the meeting on 25 June, along with Des Peelo.  The issue being discussed was the salaries of executives of the CRC.</p> <p>At that time I think what had happened was that the HSE had fixed a particular figure that it considered appropriate remuneration for the executives or people working in the sector.  Mr. Peelo, in particular, pointed out that we had a number of executives, I think about nine in total at the time, who had legacy contracts with us - I suppose is the best way of describing them.  We were bound by these contracts.  We are a private company and we are subject to those such agreements.  We explained our particular problem to the members of the HSE at that meeting.  Arising from that, I understood when we left the meeting that the HSE acknowledged our position and understood the difficulty we had and that it would have to be worked out.  Some of those executives were due to retire within a shortish period thereafter and some others are still there.  We explained at the committee meeting that as each of those positions came to be filled they would be filled in accordance with the appropriate HSE rate, which was obviously less than what was being paid to those executives at that time, that we would work that through and that the natural effluxion of time would probably resolve a number of those issues.  My understanding was that this was acceptable to the HSE when we left that meeting.  At that time, while we had told the HSE the company's position, nevertheless we had to get the agreement of our board for this to be done.  We pointed out that we would have to make up the shortfall on these particular salaries.  The HSE, to my understanding, agreed with that position.  Subsequent to that, we had a board meeting.  The board does not meet every month because it is a voluntary board and we meet as an overseeing board.  We met, I think, in or around November subsequent to that.  Des Peelo wrote a letter which was discussed by the board before it was sent to the HSE.  I have a copy here which I will read if the committee does not have the letter.  On 17 November 2009 Des Peelo wrote:<blockquote><br />Ms Laverne McGuinness<br />National Director<br />Primary, Community and Continuing Care<br />Health Services Executive<br />Room 138<br />Dr. Steeven's Hospital<br />Dublin 8<br /><br />Remuneration of Senior Staff at the Central Remedial Clinic</blockquote><blockquote>Dear Laverne,<br /><br />Thank you for your letter 7 Jul '09 and I also refer to our meeting on 25 June '09. [That is the meeting to which I referred].<br /><br />Apologies for the delay in response.  The Governors' meeting re approving the response set out below did not in fact take place until 9 Nov. '09.  On behalf of the Governors I now confirm the following outcome to the HSE:<br />1. We greatly appreciate the involvement of the HSE with the CRC.  We have had a long and good relationship with the HSE and its predecessors. [That was my experience up to then].<br />2. We undertake that the CRC, as a voluntary organisation, will itself fund the excess of salaries concerned as identified by the HSE with effect from 1 Jan.'10.  [That is what happened subsequently].<br />3. As and when the management post concerned fall to be replaced through retirement or resignation, the salary of the incoming replacement will be discussed and agreed with the HSE.<br />We have been very fortunate in the high calibre of management within the CRC over the years and it has always been important to us to be able to attract and hold talented and committed management.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Yours sincerely<br /><br />Des Peelo<br />Chairman<br />Central Remedial Clinic.</blockquote>That letter was sent by us.  I heard nothing about this until more recently when the issue became a public matter.  I started to doubt myself as to whether in fact we had reached this agreement.  I looked to see what was my best recollection, bearing in mind that this was four years ago.  I saw in the HSE's own internal report, which the committee has, at page 47, a reference to &quot;One non-acute agency informed internal audit&quot;.  I will read it to the meeting.  When I read it it was on all fours of my understanding of the agreement that we reached with the HSE at that meeting on 25 June 2009:<blockquote>One non-acute agency informed internal audit that Senior Management Remuneration was the subject of a comprehensive review in 2009, involving the Chairman and other Board Members of the [agency], along with HSE ND-ISD, HSE NDOF and HSE HR manager.  At that time, it was agreed by the Board of Governors [we are described as a board of governors] that --- a lesser amount be charged to the HSE, and --- the balance, for employment contractual reasons, would be directly funded by [the agency], the employer. [...]  It was also agreed that when the posts concerned fall to be replaced through retirement or resignation the salary of the incoming replacements will be discussed and agreed with the HSE.  This agreement took effect from 1st January 2009 and continues to this day.  The only change that has affected the agreed rates since then has been the salary reduction imposed on 1st January 2010.</blockquote> That concurs with my memory of what we discussed at that meeting with the HSE. </p></speech>

The quote in the HIQA report about remuneration stated that there was no remuneration committee of the board and that minutes of the board meetings did not record whether remuneration of the chief executive or members of the management team was discussed.  It was not made clear to the authority how decisions were made at either board or committee level with regard to the appointment or remuneration of senior executive managers in designated or acting roles.  For example, the governance of decisions to substantially additionally remunerate individual post-holders - in one case by more than &euro;150,000 - was not clear.  </p><p>  Following that, the Minister went on the record.</p> <p>The Department of Health's press office's website has a speech, posted on 19 November 2013, by the Minister for Health on a Topical Issue on the HSE audit of section 38 organisations.  In it, he addressed the issue of additional payments to individuals above the sanctioned amount paid from the Exchequer.  He stated:<blockquote><br />This is a Government which is trying to weed out additional sweeteners and expenditures within the health service ... What we need is a clear picture of all payments [made] ... the HSE wrote to all of the agencies in question.  On 30 September copies of the HSE's audit report and Government pay policy were sent to all section 38 agencies with a request that they respond by 28 October, ensuring compliance.  [In total,] 33 agencies responded, some with a holding position and others requesting to seek legal advice.  On 5 November the HSE again wrote [to them], reiterating the requirement that they respond and ensure compliance, with a deadline of today, 19 November.<br /><br /> As the House will be aware, top-up payments of this nature first came to light in May last year when HIQA published a report on governance at Tallaght hospital.  It emerged that an employee of the hospital had been receiving an additional &euro;150,000 in payments since 2005.  In total, five senior management staff had received &euro;739,000 in top-up payments ... Last May, I requested that the HSE conduct an internal audit of all section 38 funding recipients, both hospitals and disability agencies, to ensure similar unsanctioned payments were not being made in other locations.  The HSE's audit report concluded there were 36 different types of allowance being paid to 191 senior managers at an annual cost of &euro;3.224 million ... In some private cases private funding is used to top up approved rates of pay.  [A total of] 13 agencies pay additional remuneration or benefits such as company cars, car expenses or pension contributions to a total of 34 managers to a value of &euro;912,472.</blockquote>The first time this issue came to light was in May 2012 following a HIQA report.  The information on senior management salaries in the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, was as a result of a letter from the HSE, purporting to seek information from section 38 organisations on the payments to senior management in excess of grade 8 salaries.  The CRC responded in 2009, not 2005 or 2012, to that request with the information that is now in the public domain.  Was the CRC the only section 38 agency to respond in 2009 correctly, honestly and up front?</p></speech>

The clerk to the committee made it clear, as well as in various public statements, that the committee wanted to have Mr. Brian Conlan, the former chief executive, before the committee.

He kept in touch during the time he was away.  Towards the end of it, I believe he felt there was a great intrusion into his personal life and that he would prefer to resign, given that he had only been a short time with the organisation as chief executive.  He had been on the board for nine years as a representative of the Mater hospital, where he was chief executive officer at the time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Nugent" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013121100006#E00700"><p>The Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, has access to funding through its activities, which have been going on for many years.  There is no harm in stating at the outset that for the first 25 years of the clinic's work, there was no State funding whatsoever.  All salaries for clinical staff, administrative staff and others were paid from public contributions in one form or another.  At that time, many other institutions were doing this, such as, for example, the Rehab Group and the Mater, which were involved in the process of running their own lotteries and pools as a methodology of raising money to meet the expenses of the organisations.  In the case of the Central Remedial Clinic, we started to get State funding in 1977 and at that, it was not 100% State funding.  This build-up was common enough and obviously, at the time, I understood it was greatly appreciated that the State had started to help because of the nature of the work and its specialisation.  It is a highly complex business and in that context, it is very expensive to run.</p><p>  The development of salaries evolved over time.  The people concerned were employed by a private company in the technical sense.  The salaries were under an employment contract and therein lies the legacy of our responsibility as a company to the employee.  In the case of Mr. Kiely, whatever way the salary built up is one thing but the issue was that when 2009 arrived and we came to 1 January 2010, the HSE at that time indicated the salary it was willing to pay, which was &euro;106,000.  The balance was met from funds we have earned through the lotteries.  Those funds are significant and over many years have built up into substantial amounts of money.  In the first instance, we have used them in the support of the services of the clinic in so far as we can and there are a couple of points I wish to make in that regard.  The fund primarily has been used as capital development funds.  For example, in recent years we have built a new service centre in Waterford, which is a state-of-the-art operation.  The funds we have at present, for example, are earmarked for the CRC in Clondalkin and Scoil Mochua, as well as for a day centre in Swords that has been in preparation for five years and about which we have been waiting to conclude arrangements with the HSE.  As these developments take time, we always ensure those funds are managed by appropriate and responsible agencies.  The board of the CRC assigns the funds to appropriate institutions to take care of those funds.  In building up those funds, it effectively is a reserve we can use from time to time.</p><p>  There was criticism regarding the issue of service cuts in the Central Remedial Clinic.  The Deputy must remember that when a child comes the clinic, he or she is not there just for a short time visit as would be the case were one being admitted into a general hospital, where one might go in for a procedure and then come out and recover and then everything is fine.  Our children are with us pretty well for a lifetime and we must think about that.  If there are cuts - which there must be in times like this and we have no argument with the HSE about that - we try the best we can to find alternative sources of funding.  It is as plain as that.  If we could put more money into the day-to-day service, we would but one must have staff to provide a day-to-day service.  We have an employment embargo, which we also must accept and we do not have any hang-ups about it.  We are stretching the organisation to the very limits at present because of the level of staff reduction that has taken place, while also trying to keep up the service.  One cannot simply tell people they had better go home because one has just run out of money.  A balancing act is going on constantly and as part of that, to carry out the transition from 2010 to the present, given we already had five or six people who were on a higher salary than the new salaries determined but who were contractually there for us to manage, we have made a reduction, wherever possible.  From approximately 11 senior management staff, we are down to approximately five at present and two more will be retiring over the next year or so.  Again, they either will be replaced if the HSE agrees we can replace them or we will be obliged to find an alternative way of doing our business.  However, we will not be breaking the level of pay, which will be determined from the 2010 arrangement.  It is a transition period and we are doing it through natural reduction.  We cannot simply walk in and tell someone we are sorry but we are going to take away half that person's salary away from him or her because we have been told to so do.</p></speech>

The salary is as the figure the Deputy gave in gross terms, that is, &euro;200,000-odd at the final pitch but obviously, it was not at that level 25 years ago.  It grew on foot of all kinds of pay rises, national wage agreements, the benchmarking that took place over the years and it arrived at a figure.  That figure is the contractual figure the Central Remedial Clinic has with the employee.  This is what we are responsible for delivering and had we broken all of the individual contracts, this is common to a lot of organisations, had we gone down to all the people who were given a new salary level and told them they were not getting any more than that, we would be breaking their contracts.  They could sue on it and we estimate one could be into millions of compensation.</p></speech>

When cuts were imposed in the past, the clinic would have taken a decision at board level to subvent these services out of private money, other sources of income, that it had available.  What happened in the latter couple of years was that the HSE brought in more red tape, especially in relation to staff ceilings.  Where the clinic could have and would have replaced individuals who had left out of private funding, as it had done in the past, it was confined by the HSE which stated in a letter to it that if it breached the employment ceiling, the clinic would be fined &euro;750,000.</p></speech>

The clinic, as a corporate entity in its own right, would have taken the decision to employ individuals over and above those funded by the Eastern Regional Health Board, the Health Service Executive or whoever was the paymaster at the time.  In an effort to give the same terms and conditions to staff members working side by side in the same grade, we did not have access to the State pension fund.  In the days when there was no access to the State pension fund and no grants coming from the Exchequer, the clinic had a private pension fund through Irish Pensions Trust.</p> <p>The Irish Pensions Trust was used to give the additional staff who were not allowed into the voluntary hospital superannuation scheme terms and conditions similar to those of their colleagues who had what were called possibly legitimate posts within the organisation funded through the Exchequer.  The clinic was funding both the salaries and pensions of the staff concerned on a similar basis to those of their colleagues alongside whom they worked.</p></speech>

The Deputy is probably aware that pension funds throughout Ireland are in difficulty.  The Central Remedial Clinic's pension fund was no stranger to this either.  Only recently there was a high profile case of ESB workers threatening to pull the plug because the pension fund had not been properly funded.</p></speech>

The Irish Pensions Board set a task for all funds in Ireland to meet the minimum funding proposal, a minimum funding standard.  It went on for a couple of years because the Irish Pensions Board kept shifting the due date for submissions to be made to it.    Eventually, maybe a year and a half ago, there was a window of opportunity whereby the Pensions Board set a date.  The Central Remedial Clinic's advisers on its pension fund, Irish Pensions Trust, took the opportunity of putting together an application in order that the clinic could address the deficit in the pension fund for the Pensions Board.  The proposal had to be balloted on by the staff because it entailed doubling the rate of contribution of staff to the fund.  In and around 70 staff members were affected.  The 70 staff members were balloted.  The partnership arrangement to meet the minimum funding standard by 2017 meant that the individuals had to increase their rate of contribution.  They had to double their rate of contribution.  The clinic had to increase its rate of contribution by 2.5% and put in a lump sum which was actuarially calculated.  Consider the reason the books show the transfer of the &euro;3 million.  The &euro;3 million was the lump sum that went in for those 70 individuals because it was unanimously accepted by the staff to protect their pensions.  They were delighted that the clinic was standing up to take this responsibility on board and address the deficit.  With regard to the reason it was put in is as a loan, there are other contributing factors in the performance of pension funds.  One of the performance indicators is the rate at which the investment, the underlying assets of the pension fund perform in the years up to the date set to reach solvency within the fund.  Rather than gift the &euro;3 million, the advice from both the actuary, Irish Pensions Trust, and our own financial auditors was that, should the performance of the underlying assets be in excess of what was expected within the plan to become solvent by 2017, a repayment of that money could be made to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.  One will just have to wait until 2017 to see how the pension fund assets perform before determining whether anything will be due back.  One way or the other, the board of the clinic took the decision that because it had a liability, it would address it in partnership with the members of the scheme.  That is what it did.</p></speech>

The board suggested I write to the HSE to ask whether the terms were available to that section of the employees within the Central Remedial Clinic who were not in the State pension scheme, the VHSS.

That runs through all activity but, in essence, it is a stand-alone company.  There is a cross-over of directors and it was the way it was set up some time ago.  In discussions with our auditors recently, we have been looking at the issue of cross-over of directors.  Some months back &ndash; not during the course of this debate &ndash; we identified some people who would be independent of us to come onto the board and we are currently doing the same with the CRC board.  In essence, we are looking at the level of good governance needed into the future.  We have been doing some work on that issue and in recent times we have been talking to the HSE about some changes we consider are badly needed.  I am being honest about it.</p></speech>

The point I am making, on which I will ask him to comment, is that, in this deal, it is very likely that the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic have been stuffed.  Some &euro;3 million has gone from that body.  The source of the funds is money given voluntarily, supposedly for sick people.  It has gone from the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic to fill Mr. Kiely&rsquo;s and other people's pockets with better pensions.  That is what happened.</p> <p>Mr. Kiely is totally conflicted, being secretary at both companies in that situation.  This loan is described as a loan and the auditors are obviously extremely doubtful as to whether it will ever be paid back.  It says:<blockquote><br />During the year the company advanced an unsecured, interest-free, [in other words the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic received no security or interest] long-term loan to the Central Remedial Clinic to assist in financing that company's pension liabilities.  Provision has been made [which means it has been written off in these accounts because they do not expect it necessarily to be paid back] for the amount advanced due to uncertainties regarding the long-term ability of the clinic to repay the loan. </blockquote>I cannot understand how, knowing that, one could say, &quot;Okay, throw the money across, it may never come back.&quot;  They are saying that.  In the accounts of the CRC, the recipient of that, it says the loan is unsecured, interest-free and is not repayable in the short term.  That is a gift by any other name.</p></speech>

At the time the Irish Pensions Board indicated that the shortfall had to be made up we had only two choices.  We could go to a bank and borrow money at excessive cost, if we could get it, which was highly unlikely that there would have been money around for that given the period we are talking about.  Secondly, we had our own reserve funds through the friends and it was decided to use our own funds out of the friends to meet this compulsory requirement and protect the employees' pension funds.  More than 70 people are involved.  We are told that as of now, this defined-benefit pension fund is performing well and that we are on track to repaying that &euro;3 million.</p></speech>

We are not trying to protect one or two individuals in the organisation.  The pension rights of some 70 people had to be protected.  In all fairness, that fund was there and could be used for that purpose on a loan basis.  It is a loan.  Of course the auditors would write it up in the books on the basis that it could be at risk, as would their good practice.  There are very few things in life that carry no risk.  I am not being in any way disingenuous about it.  We have phenomenal staff, of whom we are very proud.  They do world-class work and I do not see why we should damage them due to pension fund market fluctuations.</p></speech>

Mr. Nugent did not do it.  It may be paid back but that is unlikely.

We have staff whom the CEO is managing who are on a higher rate than the chief executive.  Some technical, clinical staff may well be on a higher rate than even the manager who is managing them.  It is just how the scales worked out.  We are trying to bring that back into line with the new scales.  It was driven by the new scales and that is fair enough.  We are not arguing with the HSE about it.  We are like many other organisations.  We have a meeting later this week on this very subject with the HSE as a group of organisations and we welcome it because we need to find solutions.  It is only fair to say that the arrangements with Mr. Conlan were revisited and we undertook that from 1 October we would work strictly to the actual scale nominated by the HSE.

You get &euro;16 million a year, or around that, for the past few years, which is by far the majority of your funding, from the State.  That puts you under an obligation to the taxpayer.  It puts you under an obligation not to ignore the Government or the taxpayer where they are instructing you about guidelines.  It seems to me that you have given two fingers to the HSE - which many of us would like to do on lots of issues, I must say - and in order to bypass it, you have gone to another source of funds, although the donors never intended that money to go to Mr. Kiely and others, either in their pension pots or in the form of pay.

As a board, we took a decision that we need to take a look at how the formation of the CRC board of governors should be made up.  It is something I initiated with the board.  We are looking at meeting - I have already indicated this to them - the following stakeholder groupings: the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the staff of the organisation and the parent-client groupings.  There are a number of categories that we would like to have a nominating right of a trustee/governor of the clinic.  That process is in hand.</p></speech>

To me it seems absurd that there would not be a representative of the clients, or the parent group of clients, on the board of governors.</p></speech>

Perhaps it was something that we should have followed through but, very definitely, we had client representatives.</p> <p>I used to sit beside an individual at board meetings who was in a wheelchair, knew all of the difficulties and was a fine contributor.</p></speech>

Does it not seem peculiar that it never asked some highly paid executives to take pay cuts at a time when many other people in the country were being asked that and when the HSE, effectively speaking on behalf of the taxpayer, told the CRC that it was way over the salary cap?

In the mid-2000s, Mr. Kiely's salary was what it effectively is today.  There was no issue in that respect.  We lived in different times.  The one matter that struck me as a board member who met and dealt with Mr. Kiely was his level of expertise, commitment and work.  He was a magnificent chief executive officer of the company.  That is probably why it did not occur to us to say-----</p></speech>

I doubt that there is a public servant in the country who does not feel aggrieved, and probably rightly so, at having to take pay cuts because it is his or her belief that he or she brings a level of expertise and skill.  However, they were still asked to work for less money.  I do not quite accept that.</p></speech>

The HSE determined an amount of money to be paid in salaries and the gap was not regarded as a top-up, as it was already being paid.  The board had sanctioned the salary.  It was never asked to sanction top-ups.</p></speech>

He clearly stated that the board had never sanctioned additional payments.  From January 2010, the HSE was only covering &euro;106,000 of Mr. Kiely's salary.  Presumably, the board would have had to sanction the payment of the remainder of the salary from its own funds.  Mr. Nugent is telling the committee that that happened at a board meeting.  There would have been a discussion and a decision at a board meeting to sanction the remainder of Mr. Kiely and others' salaries.</p></speech>

That was what circled around the meeting in June 2009, the subsequent correspondence that was sent and the agreement that we reached with the HSE in that respect.  There was never any increase in salary from each individual's starting point.  Salaries remained the same.  It was the level of funding that we received from the HSE for those salaries that changed.  That was discussed at board level.  There is probably some misunderstanding of what was or was not discussed, but the letter of 17 November 2009 was equally discussed at board level.  It is quite possible that Mr. Brady may not have been at that meeting.  As the Deputy knows, we do not always have full board meetings.</p></speech>

Nowhere in the file of correspondence between the HSE and the CRC, which went backwards and forwards over a long period, can I see any written confirmation of this from the HSE.  What I can see is a written letter from Mr. Peelo to the HSE outlining what had been agreed.  Sure, I could write Mr. Martin a letter and tell him what we had agreed, too.  I see no written confirmation from the HSE as the paymaster and deliverer, as it were, of the service level agreement.  If there is written confirmation, perhaps Mr. Martin could refer me to it.</p></speech>

That is on all fours with what we discussed and, as far as I am concerned, agreed with the HSE in June 2009, subsequently confirmed in November 2009.</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department of Health asked us to examine the disability sector with regard to salaries and pay scales in the first instance.  This is where we commenced.  Having done so, the CRC replied to us in this regard.</p><p>  I wrote to Mr. Peelo on 24 April 2009, setting out that the Secretary General had requested us to examine the salary scales of the CRC.  I set out the fact the salary levels were far in excess of what had been determined by Government pay policy and what would be expected.  At the time I requested that the board would immediately review and take steps to significantly reduce the level of remuneration for senior management and let me know within two weeks how it proposed to do so.</p><p>  I received a response from Mr. Peelo on 8 June 2009.  He set out very clearly that he was disappointed with the sentiment set out in the letter and that the board could only in effect take account of the fact that it was an independent legal entity, which it is and we recognise this.  He stated:<blockquote>It is our firm contention that the level of Management salaries is a matter solely for the Board of Governors of the CRC to determine.  It would be utterly inappropriate to simply unilaterally &quot;significantly reduce the level of remuneration of senior management staff in the CRC&quot; and indeed it may very well be contrary to the principles of Employment Law.</blockquote>This was referenced by Mr. Martin.</p><p>  On foot of this we further wrote on 15 June, when I stated that it would appear from the data in the letter the CRC was contesting the amount of money we stated was appropriate for the particular salary scale and was suggesting we may have made some inaccuracies in our comparisons.  We tried to assure the CRC that any comparisons on remuneration of senior staff were made either with organisations of similar size in the disability sector, many of which had a very comparable range of specialist health services, education, vocational training and social and personal services, and with various roles in the HSE where general managers were responsible for large budgets across a wide range of specialist services in this regard.</p><p>  In the same letter I set out that although the contention was:<blockquote> that the level of Management salaries &quot;is a matter solely for the Board of Governors of the CRC to determine&quot;... as the main funder of the CRC, the HSE has a responsibility to ascertain whether the current remuneration levels of senior staff in your organisations, as outlined in the information supplied by your organisations represents best use of funding from public sources.</blockquote>At that point I requested the CRC attend a meeting with me and Mr. Liam Woods, the director of finance at the time, and suggested a date.  The meeting took place on 25 June.</p><p>  My reply to the meeting of 25 June was set out on 7 July 2009, and it is important because it does not necessarily concur with statements made by Mr. Peelo.  We acknowledged very clearly the CRC plays a vital role in providing a significant and excellent service to the patients and clients it serves.  We stated we understood its position, that it had historical arrangements, but:<blockquote>the Board of Governors will appreciate the requirement for the HSE to ensure the best value for money in the expenditure of organisations which are substantially funded by the Executive.  This applies even in situations where the organisation has access to other sources of funding.</blockquote>At that point I enclosed a list of senior executives and the rates of applicable pay and set out clearly in the second page that I would appreciate if the chairman would review the information on the salary scales with the board of governors and revert to me with proposals on how the senior staff salary levels could be brought into line with the levels we indicated were appropriate.</p><p>  We received a reply from the CRC dated 17 November 2009 which stated: &quot;We undertake the CRC, as a voluntary organisation, will itself fund the excess of the salaries concerned as identified by the HSE.&quot;  The arrangement as agreed at the meeting on the management posts concerned was that, &quot;As and when the management posts concerned fall to be replaced through retirement or resignation, the salary of the incoming replacement will be discussed and agreed with the HSE&quot;.</p><p>  There was no response to this and we did not agree any amount of extra funding or where the funding was to come from in this regard.  We put in place a set of governance arrangements through a section 38 agency and the parameters under our legal obligations with regard to the public funds which we administer.  Mr. O'Brien can refer to the note.  It was not that there was agreement.</p></speech>

The most important line is the first line, which refers to one non-acute agency informing internal audit.  The report states the exact information the CRC gave to internal audit.  At the previous hearing into this matter, my colleague, Dr. Geraldine Smith, stated:<blockquote><br />The purpose of the audit was to ascertain the environment.  We were trying to develop a picture.  What is clear from the audit report is that there was much speculation over the years about whether allowances were being paid privately, etc.  The purpose of the audit was to take a snapshot, particularly of the private element, which had not been done previously.</blockquote>It is in this context that the direct reference was made to our internal audit report, but this is a reflection on exactly what the CRC told our internal auditor.</p></speech>

Does it want the HSE to hand it a blank cheque and send it off?  It is bound by a service level agreement.  When the HSE, which dispensed the service level agreement, states certain criteria must be met, the CRC might run into contractual difficulties, and I am willing to cede this point because I believe the HSE is also, but it is not solely responsible for management salaries.  It must be cognisant of Government policy.  If one wants to be responsible for Government policy, one runs for the D&aacute;il.  If one is a member of a board of governors receiving taxpayers' money, one must be cognisant of Government policy.  Does Mr. Martin accept this point?</p></speech>

That is why I mentioned that we were going to change the way people joined the board, how the boards related to each other and how decisions were taken about the transaction of funds between boards.  The other dimensions that we have been looking at in some depth for some considerable months are the level of transparency and how we produce information for the public domain.  It is all part of a recognition that our relationship with the public sector of our funding needs to be moved onto a different level.</p></speech>

The witnesses can credibly argue - it does not mean that I agree with them - that many of the issues discussed today were a sign of a different time, a legacy, contractual obligations, etc., but I want to discuss the here and now.  On 20 separate occasions in 2013, the HSE wrote to Mr. Nugent in many cases or to Mr. Goulding or Mr. Kiely in other cases.  They were dated 30 January, 25 April, 2 May, 13 June, 26 June, 28 June, 8 July, 10 July, 15 July - this is important - 23 July, 6 August, 8 August, 14 August, 26 August, 27 August, 4 September, 16 September, 13 November, 6 December and 10 December.  We all have the correspondence to read and share.  On each occasion, the HSE waved a flag reading "Stop".  This relates directly to the appointment of the missing man, Mr. Brian Conlan, as CEO.  The witnesses can argue around the houses - to some degree, we will need to - about Mr. Kiely's level of remuneration and contractual obligations, but there is general agreement that they knew from 2009, including from further correspondence up until this year, how to go about making future appointments.  Despite this, the CRC was issued with a second performance notice by the HSE for non-compliance under the service arrangement, something the HSE described in a letter to Mr. Nugent dated 14 August as being unprecedented in its relationship with its non-statutory provider organisations.  It was issued a first performance notice on 15 July and a second on 6 August.  This point relates to my question about not being solely responsible, in that, while the board must make decisions, it is duty bound to the taxpayer to adhere to Government policy and the HSE service-level agreement.  This notice clearly states that the board did not, since it did not seek prior approval before hiring Mr. Conlan or advertise externally.  The HSE expressed concern about the fact that the CRC involved an external agency to undertake the recruitment process yet filled the post internally.  Some of the CRC's own letters referred to the appointee as being a staff member, but Mr. Conlan was actually a board member.  There seems to have been considerable vagueness about the pension entitlements and remuneration of the now former CEO.  What was happening?</p></speech>

Essentially, we see the function of the board of the CRC as complying with individual directors' corporate responsibilities.  We felt it was a matter for the board to recruit a new CEO quickly in light of Mr. Kiely retiring.  We were well into that process when the letters the Deputy referred to started to arrive.  We had pretty well selected.  The interviews were over.  We had choices to make and we made them.  I believe that we made an excellent choice.  We got an experienced individual.  It would have been good for the clinic.  In fairness, during his first few months he performed exceptionally well.</p></speech>

Why was it not done this time?  For the purpose of this discussion I am accepting the argument about Mr. Kiely's remuneration.  There was no doubt whatever from what I can see - the witness may correct me if I am wrong - as to the procedures that should have been followed in the recruitment of Mr. Kiely's successor.  To Mr. Kiely's credit, on 24 April 2013, Mr. Goulding, the then chairman of the board, had written to Ms McGuinness to state that "Mr. Kiely has told us of his intention to retire at some time in the coming months and we are initiating the process of identifying [a successor]".  Mr. Kiely was not running off into the sunset but he was giving the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, the time to fill the vacancy appropriately.  I am not an expert in service arrangements but according to two performance notices, clause 16 was not complied with, clause 3.2(c)(v) was not complied with, clause 9 was not complied with and there are concerns about section 38 of the Health Act.  Perhaps Ms McGuinness or Mr. O'Brien might cast some light on the non-compliance and why the HSE felt it necessary to take what witnesses have termed an "unprecedented" move.</p></speech>

It is following the correspondence that came from Ms Goulding.  The requirement is set out that they would need to adhere to the following - a robust business case to be provided for the post and the continuation of the post; clear evidence that the restructuring, reorganisation and redeployment options have been exhausted, so nobody could just be assigned to a role; a ceiling compliance requirement and the whole-time equivalent impact; evidence of a link to staff suppressions etc.; evidence of proactive absenteeism management and also comparative data; and the appropriate approval sanctioned at senior management level.  By and large, the section indicates that in order to recruit at a grade 8 level or above, approval must be received from the area manager in the first instance in order to proceed with the recruitment.  That is set out in a section of the service level arrangement.</p><p>  In a follow-up letter of 13 June to Mr Goulding, Ms Anne O'Connor, our area manager, wrote:<blockquote>I am writing to you as I have been made aware that the board of the Central Remedial Clinic has now appointed a new CEO, Mr. Brian Conlon, to replace the outgoing CEO, Mr. Paul Kiely, with effect from 1 July 2013.  I would note that I have neither seen nor approved any application to replace Mr. Kiely.</blockquote>That is set out in the service level arrangement, which is managed at area level with the organisations.  Ms O'Connor continues by setting out the stipulation for the provider: &quot;The provider, if required, will comply with its obligations in respect of employment monitoring reports&quot;.  That is the section of the Act and it is set out clearly in the correspondence of 13 June 2013.</p><p>  On 26 June we wrote again about the issue, indicating there was a clear breach with regard to the service arrangements in place.  It was indicated that the process for replacing any post above grade 8 level was clearly outlined in circulars and also in the service level arrangement, and it was advised that these were issued to the CRC in April 2007.  It was also indicated that the process was outlined to the outgoing CEO at the integrated monthly meeting on 25 April 2013.  As part of the management of our section 38 service level arrangements, a monthly meeting would take place with representatives of the agency.  The letter continues &quot;The non-adherence to this process is viewed by the HSE as a very serious matter.&quot;  At that stage there is a formal notification that there was no approval to proceed and Mr. Kiely had agreed not to leave his post until a replacement was ready to commence, thereby enabling the CRC to continue the level of service provided heretofore.  The letter essentially asked the CRC not to proceed with the process.</p><p>  We acknowledge that we received a letter from the CRC on 27 June in which the organisation set out its search arrangements for the replacement of Mr. Kiely.  It was indicated in the letter that the preferred option was to fill the post from within its existing resources and there were expressions of interest.  In the letter it is stated the priority of &quot;the board of governors has always been the provision of top quality service to our clients&quot;, and it was also indicated that the CRC had suppressed one additional post.  It indicated that the recruitment process would proceed.</p><p>  There is ongoing correspondence and on occasions we indicated that we were disappointed we had not received a request.  There was much correspondence before we took the step of taking out the first performance notice.  We were not getting the level of information required at any point.</p></speech>

Yet, those services came to an end very rapidly, which is most regrettable.  I appreciate the witnesses might not be able to answer my question directly but how much of a grant did the HSE provide for that and for how long was it drawn down?

Is that not an interesting thing?  I will tell the witnesses why I raise it and why it struck me so forcibly.  I read a letter from Mr. Nugent to Mr. Leo Kinsella, regional director of operations, HSE Dublin north east, dated 19 July 2013.  Ms Laverne McGuinness, who is with us today, described this particular letter in an e-mail we have - I hope she does not mind me referring to it - as coming short of telling the HSE to get lost, and I do not disagree.  The issue I want to focus on here is where Mr. Nugent justifies the appointment of Mr. Conlan in quite trenchant language.  I would consider this an aggressive letter if it landed on my desk.  Mr. Nugent made the following commentary.  "The person who leads an organisation is at the very heart of its performance [fair enough], its ethos and its function."  That is stated in this letter.  It just occurs to me, and I wonder if it has occurred to the staff of the Central Remedial Clinic, what the pay practices and the decisions which Mr. Martin so robustly defends citing company law represent in terms of the ethos of the clinic not at a local level or at a front-line level, but at the very top end of management.  Would Mr. Nugent care to comment on that?</p></speech>

First of all, can I just take the generality of staff to whom, as the Deputy put it, no top-up was ever applied?  I think the best way I can describe it is that the vast bulk of the staff were on salaries that were in line with their employment contracts and there was no requirement on us to reduce their employment contract entity or the amount of money given to them under their employment contract.</p></speech>

That is what happened.  Nothing that Mr. Nugent has said today mitigates against that, which is profoundly worrying.  It is profoundly worrying from an organisation which is excellent in its service provision but which relies on the State for over 80% of its funding.  Does Mr. Nugent not grasp how worrying that is?

Of course the directors have duties that they have to fulfil.  Nobody is gain-saying that but as a director of the Central Remedial Clinic, Mr. Nugent must be cognisant of the fact that the vast bulk of the clinic's funding comes from the HSE.  It is public money.  He also has to be cognisant of the fact that in association with that public money, there are rules, regulations and oversight.  No responsible director or board sets those aside in such a cavalier fashion to protect some notion of themselves and their fellow governors.  That strikes me as a very peculiar approach in terms of discharging one's duties.  I do not believe that respecting the HSE governance requirements and remuneration policy and adhering to them in any way undercuts the role of directors or undermines the authority or function of the board.  That is not true.  Mr. Nugent keeps repeating it but it is not true.</p></speech>

Mr. Martin gave a robust defence of the integrity, position and decision-making capacities of the directors.  He cited company law and suggested that to respect the regulations, rules and oversight associated with substantial public moneys would somehow run counter to the standing of the board.  I am putting it to him that is rubbish.  It is a very lame defence of what went on here and I wish he would desist from it.  Whether or not the HSE should have a director on the board is an argument for another day, although it is probably a good suggestion.  The directors have failed to give a full explanation as to why Mr. Conlan was put in place when the board knew full well that certain procedures had to be gone through.  The correspondence just indicates that he was the best person for the job and that was it.  That is astonishing.  The directors have also tried to explain away the circumstances surrounding Mr. Kiely's individual salary arrangements and those of other individuals on the basis of "legacy" contracts, fear of litigation and further costs to the clinic.  Yet, with the very same Mr. Conlan, as my colleagues have established, the directors were happy to breach pay regulations and HSE guidelines yet again.  This suggests to me, whatever about the technicalities and details, an incredible level of arrogance that I suggest does not sit well with the ethos of the CRC.  It is very worrying and at the risk of being repetitive, I do not believe one can have a board of directors charged with the provision of such critical services to people with disabilities who, quite frankly, find the HSE a nuisance, find concerns expressed by the taxpayer a nuisance and want to take money from the Exchequer and then drive on and operate in whatever way they wish.  Then, to top it all, they come before a committee of the Oireachtas and in a very robust fashion, put that position forward.  I was alarmed, worried and concerned coming into this meeting.  I am now more alarmed, having heard what the directors have said.</p></speech>

The board of the HSE has always been a stakeholder with us.  The services that we provide are, as the Deputy rightly said, well funded by the HSE and the Department of Health.  Everyone is very conscious that it is public money.  In anything we did in terms of finding the best candidate to fulfil the position of CEO that arose, we did not set out to run a cavalier show at all - quite the opposite, in fact.  There was great concern about how we were doing it and that is why we had an expert from outside to oversee what we were doing.  The board of the CRC at the time, as I said earlier, sought to protect the ethos and something of the independence of the organisation.</p></speech>

In fact, the actions of the directors, collectively, have potentially undermined the ethos of the clinic and have, one imagines, caused terrible distress for the staff and users of the services.  They have also gravely dented public confidence, the public upon which the CRC relies for charitable donations.  Can Mr. Nugent appreciate at all the level of that damage, which is a negative for the clinic?</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald is alluding, in part, to the appointment of Mr. Conlan.  My understanding and feel for the way people in the organisation had responded to him was that they recognised a very competent and capable person who had tremendous energy for his position.</p></speech>

The issue here is about the board, when making a senior appointment, going through a process that is open, transparent and beyond reproach.  I would imagine that in any set of circumstances for a service such as the CRC, that would be the standard to be applied but particularly so when the clinic is in receipt of substantial public moneys.  How this looks to a person looking on is that there was, dare I say it, a bit of boy's club, with insiders.  We have seen it in other organisations.</p> <p>It is very unhealthy.  While promotion from within the ranks is legitimate, when promotion is purely an internal process one has to question how good that is for any organisation.  When an organisation is in receipt of public moneys it is not a runner.  I have made my point.</p><p> I do not know any of the witnesses but I am surmising, given their commitment to an organisation such as the Central Remedial Clinic, that they are people of good will and intent.  That is my working supposition.  With the greatest of respect to the witnesses individually, however, I have to say that the facts reflect that enormous damage has been done.  I do not believe that damage can be repaired while the current board is in place.  That is not possible.</p><p> On pension arrangements, about which I do not propose to speak at length, is it correct that Mr. Kiely will receive only one pension?</p></speech>

I wrote to the HSE in relation to treating all staff in a similar way.  It was at the time of the early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes at the end of 2010.  I thought that, in the interest of equity for the staff, all of them could have been treated the same and those schemes could have been opened up to them.  One of the ways of doing that would be to freeze the pension they were already in and allow them to accrue benefits under the VHSS going forward.  That would have been of great benefit, if one likes, to the financing of the deficit in the private pension fund as well.</p></speech>

The CRC receives significant income from fund-raising.  The situation is that the board completely ignored the HSE.  I have read the correspondence.  It only replied to the HSE on 27 July, having received a performance warning letter the previous day.  Furthermore, it informed the HSE in the letter that it was going ahead in appointing Mr. Conlan come hell or high water.  For reasons of integrity and to restore trust in the non-profit voluntary sector, do the board members not feel they have a moral obligation to step down?</p></speech>

We have been over considerable ground this morning but I would like to make a couple of points and put some questions to them.  The recently resigned chief executive, Mr. Conlan, was a member of the board of the CRC previously.  According to media reports in the past two days, he has been replaced by an individual by the name of Ms Joan Hurley.  I understand Mr. Nugent also has a role as acting interim chief executive.  I understand the arrangements are that he will act as the interim chief executive while Ms Hurley will undertake a role of looking after day-to-day operations.  Is it the case that Ms Hurley currently works for or has worked for the CRC?</p></speech>

She is the senior manager in charge of clinical services and has been in place for a considerable number of years.  As the most senior of the senior management team, she was the obvious choice to co-ordinate the day-to-day activity.</p> <p>In respect of the idea of myself standing in as something like an acting CEO, I cannot give it 100% of my time.</p></speech>

I am doing it to keep the thing together.  We are actively looking at how we do something about that.

National wage agreements and general pay rises or cuts would apply.</p></speech>

The fact that we would not have been increasing salaries and reviewing them to increase them was because everyone was largely covered by whatever was going on with regard to the national wage agreements.  Broadly speaking, it just involved overseeing that, but there was no requirement on us to do a major exercise on individuals or groups of individuals with respect to special increases.  They were all pre-set way back in history.</p></speech>

My understanding of his advice, and it would be the advice of this committee, is that you consider your position.  My opinion and that of my colleagues is that your position and that of other board members is completely untenable.  </p><p> It seems to me from the remarks that you made to the media in recent days that you are blaming those who have uncovered this debacle, and the media, as opposed to focusing on your own management and that of the board of the organisation.  That is a ridiculous and, dare I say, very arrogant position to take.

I suppose he had been consulting with his family and those close to him.  Beyond that, I have had no further detailed comment from him.</p></speech>

He was inside pay policy.  There was no issue with remuneration.  He had done nothing wrong, yet he still he decided he should leave.</p></speech>

I know that when we got to grips with what the arrangement should be with the HSE salary I worked with him in bringing about the contract that would be the correct contract.  Subsequently, as Ms McGuinness said, the contract was effective from 1 October.  That was the date agreed.  Because he had gone on leave, the only way I had of communicating with him, because he was abroad, was periodic phone calls.  Certainly up to the last few days before he resigned it was never even hinted that he might think of resigning.  I just assumed he was coming back to work.  He resigned on the Friday and did not turn up on the Monday.  All I got was the message that he felt it was intrusive and he did not particularly wish to go forward.</p></speech>

We have clarified that now.  If anybody else wants to follow up on the matter, that is fair enough.  Some people present have asked that the board of the CRC resign.  I have studied this matter and it seems that the HSE knew very well what was happening.  It issued letters and warnings and posed questions for a number of years.  The HSE was responsible for policing this.  When is enough enough and where does the HSE draw the line with regard to infractions of guidelines which it has responsibility for policing?  In my opinion, the HSE was aware for a long period that there was widespread disregard for the guidelines in the context of public sector wages as they relate to section 38 agencies.  I am of the view that the executive engaged in a paper-pushing exercise over a number of years and that it never actually drew the line.  It never instructed boards or made it clear to them that this type of behaviour would not be tolerated.  We have now arrived at the point where public hearings into the matter have been required.  If individuals are going to request that board members resign, they should also look to the HSE and those responsible for policing this.  The fact that the people who were responsible for that policing work in government should not mean that they are immune from that kind of sanction.  I understand that the problem may have been identified and that it was made clear to the boards in question that what they were doing was contrary to public sector wage guidelines.  However, the HSE could have done more in the context of dealing with this matter definitively.  I do not believe it did deal with it definitively.</p></speech>

The HSE takes the responsibilities conferred upon it under the Health Acts very seriously.  The detail identified by Dr. Geraldine Smith in the audit, the quality of the audit report and the identification of each of the agencies involved clearly indicates that it was far more than a paper-pushing exercise.</p><p>  I received the report in March and within six days I, as the manager responsible for implementing all of the recommendations, gave a comprehensive reply.  If the Deputy considers the period since March, he will see what has happened.  A new formal pay policy for the health sector has been approved by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health and every manager and every section 38 voluntary agency has been advised of this in order to ensure full compliance.  We have come before the group and by way of an update we forwarded a note which says that tomorrow we will be meeting all of the chairs of the section 38 agencies, with each to be accompanied by one other board member.</p><p>  Yesterday I issued notification to 353 agencies which are deemed to be section 39 bodies.  We used the threshold of &euro;250,000 as being the grant aid we give to each of these agencies.  There are a couple of thousand below that threshold.  Despite the fact that they are not covered by Government pay policy, we have brought it to the attention of each of the agencies to which I refer that in the context of the remuneration of their senior managers, particularly CEOs, they should have regard for Government public sector pay policy.  We have been very diligent.  There is a very important point to be made here.  What the audit has discovered is that - through no fault of the HSE - there is now a due diligence process required for individual employees of section 38 agencies who have contractual entitlements to certain rates of pay where no approval was given by the Department, the former health boards or, since 2005, the HSE.  That is a reasonable analysis of where we find ourselves today from the perspective of the HSE.</p></speech>

We can look at the services that we have been providing and the growth of the CRC in the recent past, and its continued growth as shown in what it intends to do, in its plan.

We accept that more than 400 people work in the organisation and do an excellent job.  We also accept that more than 3,000 people receive a fantastic service.  Nobody is taking away from that.  He stated this morning that it is his role.  I have a direct question for him.  With regard to the CRC's objectives and what has been said this morning, do the witnesses think that they have been prudent managers?  Have they been resourceful with the money?  Has the money been spent wisely?  My question relates to what has been said this morning and the revelation about top-ups and salaries paid.  We are talking about a CEO being paid more than the Taoiseach, at a particular time.</p></speech>

The answer, in my opinion, is "Yes."  The Deputy can fillet me here for the next half an hour but I will not change my opinion in that regard.  I am not someone who has worked hands on every day of the week regarding the running of the organisation.  Along with the rest of the board, we have done the job entirely on a voluntary basis to the best of our ability.  One must look at the services and end product that have been delivered.  I think that we are delivering a very good service to people who need it.</p></speech>

With regard to that particular question, as I said earlier, we took a view.  When we spoke to the HSE back in 2009 we explained the difficulties that the CRC had with a number of contracts that people had with the clinic regarding their salary.  In that respect, we took a view - sorry we did not take a view - but are legally bound to meet those commitments.  I am not going to go out there and start breaking contracts that were legally binding.  Apart from the fact that when we looked at it, we said okay what if we do that, then what will it cost us.  It is the lesser of two evils, as always.</p></speech>

I am not taking from that.  The CRC objectives state: "We agree to be prudent and resourceful, in our use of time and money," and that relates to how the organisation is managed.  The CRC was advised, as outlined in the service agreement, that the salaries were above the scale or the recommended scale.  However, the board did not take it upon itself to have a conversation with the staff.  That is questionable.  Other people have referred to the matter this morning regarding the board and how it looks.

There are three proposals that we have made as an interim measure, that we are working towards and will work with the CRC on.  They are as follows - first, the use of the Public Appointments Service to select a new candidate for the CEO appointment in the future; second, the appointment of independent trustees to the board of the CRC; and, third, consideration should be given to assignment, in the interim, of an agreed executive by the HSE to fill some of the interim roles and support the interim responsibilities, with the CRC, during the period of search.  Those matters are under consideration.  The chairman will discuss them with his board and has until 13 December to do so.

We had an assistive technology and custom seating department within the clinic.  A lot of assessments would be done on children with physical disabilities for their seating requirement and recommendations would be made for the purchase of specialised seating for certain clients.  That seating would then be purchased on the market.</p><p>  A business case was brought by one of the senior managers to cut out the middle man and that we would set up a company to supply specialised seating and, hopefully, make a profit and create an income stream.  A business case was made for it, the company was set up, it started trading, and the recession hit and orders collapsed.  They tried to trade their way out of it and when I was leaving the organisation in June, they were putting together a proposal for its future as to whether it could trade out of the difficulties it was in or would be put for sale.</p></speech>

It is clear from the correspondence that although Mr. Nugent states he had a good relationship with the HSE, it reminds be a little of my relationship with the HSE - it is a little on and off.  The CRC certainly wrote to the HSE in terms that would give me the impression that the CRC was determined to do its business independently of the HSE, make its own decisions and implement them, and any of the recommendations or rules that were being applied by the HSE were certainly not acknowledged in the course of 2009.</p><p>  I put it to the HSE that it had little correspondence after 2009.  It did not respond to Mr. Peelo's letter which, essentially, tells the HSE what transpired at this meeting.  It would give anyone reading this the impression that all was well.  That was dated November 2009.</p><p>  One must go to 28 September 2012 before the next piece of correspondence.  At best, the HSE was haphazard in the way it managed the section 38 organisations.  The HSE certainly seemed to have been pushed about by the CRC and the HSE, in its correspondence, was not up to then intent on laying down the law and making the CRC comply because one must go along to another letter dated 2013 to where the HSE refers matters to Arthur Cox.  The HSE seems to be laying a paper trail in 2013, as it were, covering its tracks, to show that it had been heavily engaged with the CRC, but that does not seem to be the case from 2009.</p> <p>Again, I refer Mr. O'Brien to his comments on the correspondence from the CRC where he said it was good as "get lost".</p><p> It is clear to me from reading the correspondence that the HSE knew about this.  What it did not do was constructively engage with the CRC to deal with the real issue, which is the legal contracts the CRC had with its employees.  That might have been a better course of action for the HSE to take because it would then have unravelled the series of arrangements the CRC has in respect of the various employees.  The year 2013 was a big year for the HSE in terms of trying to get the CRC sorted and to engage but the real issue is that back in 2009 when these contracts were being established and when these top ups were being paid, the HSE knew about them and knew about the contracts because that is Mr. O'Brien's area of expertise.</p></speech>

On the other hand, with regard to the CRC as far as I can see from this correspondence the HSE just carried on and I believe it no intention of changing things.  There is a lot correspondence but it tells the one tale.  In correspondence dated 25 September 2013 in respect of the appointment of Mr. Conlan, Mr. Nugent agreed that the following provision was included in Mr. Conlan's contract:<blockquote><br />In pursuance in his/her duties hereunder, the Chief Executive shall perform such services and accept any office in any trade, sectoral body or association as the Agency may from time to time reasonably require without any further remuneration unless otherwise agreed with the Minister for Health given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditures and Reform.</blockquote>Was that being put into the contract because he was considered to be a public servant?  What was the purpose of it?</p></speech>

If you look back at the opening statement on the last day from Mr. Tony O'Brien, our director general, it is important to note that he clearly advised members of the committee that between March and November 2011, the HSE at the request of the Department of Health sought to establish the level of compliance by section 38 agencies with various aspects of approved public sector pay policy.  We would have corresponded with all section 38 agencies rather than with the CRC specifically.  We were actively pursuing compliance with public pay policy in 2011 and were doing a number of things whereby we would have asked them to confirm their compliance with FEMPI and the issue of pay-related schemes.  We also restated the fact that in September 2011, we sought specifically from all section 38 agencies confirmation that CEOs were not in receipt of additional remuneration from any services or duties required by virtue of their role.  We were pursuing these matters across all the section 38 agencies.</p></speech>

I asked him specifically about section 38 agencies, how they were accountable and if there was an audit in respect of their compliance in terms of the understanding they have with the HSE regarding the funds of which they are in receipt.  In honesty, only after that, did the HSE get serious about it.  Mr. O'Brien is quoting letters from 2011.  What happened after 2009?  What happened in 2010?  I am not forgiving the CRC.  I am just saying that if &euro;0.6 billion of taxpayers' money is going into section 38 agencies, the HSE had a very flawed way of overseeing that or auditing that money and that is why the CRC is here today.  I would also put it to Mr. O'Brien that the HSE did not flex its muscle as a provider of those funds in ensuring that they complied with everything that was going on.  That is what I take from this correspondence.  The HSE is as guilty as the CRC in terms of what is going on here and in respect of the management of the funds.</p></speech>

On the first page, I said that we have an obligation because of our public accountability and the level of funding we give to the CRC to discharge our functions in that regard.  On the second page, I said that I would appreciate if the CRC would review the information with its board of governors and revert to me with its proposals on how the senior staff salaries can be brought into line with the levels we indicate as appropriate and we set out those levels.  The response from Mr. Peelo concerned how the CRC was going to do it.</p><p>  I must draw the Chairman's attention to our legal obligations and our governance abilities under both the Health Act and section 38 arrangements.  This will bring things on from 2009.  Up until 2009, there were many different types of contracts in place with various service providers, of which there are over 4,000.  During the course of 2009, a very lengthy engagement took place between the providers of the disability sector, etc., with a view to drawing up what is known as a standardised service level arrangement, which is a very comprehensive arrangement.  There are two sections to that setting out the entire volume of service to be provided and the level of funding that we can provide in order to carry out those particular services.  That is the extent of our legal ability under section 38.  It is in respect of public funds.</p><p>  During the course of those discussions and negotiations, it was very clear that these entities and organisations are independent and cannot be treated as subsidiaries of the HSE and that level of independence had to be recognised very clearly.  Part of it is contained in the service arrangement itself.  The accountability set out in the service arrangement is in respect of the public funds.  We further built on that in 2010 with a view to having those section 38 arrangements signed and then built into it the requirement to comply with public pay policy as a result of what came to light when we wrote to them.</p></speech>

I know Ms McGuinness's letter was before Mr. Peelo's response but if I got his response, I would have responded immediately and told him "No" and would have referred him back to the letter within which was given two weeks to respond..  However, Ms McGuinness did not do that.  In fact, there was no response in respect of the demand from the HSE to respond within two weeks.  As a result of that and of Ms McGuinness not persisting with it but easing off a little, which might be the way to describe it, Mr. Peelo responded and it was left at that.</p></speech>

We could not compel the organisation.  It clearly advised us that it had legal obligations or legal contracts.  We were clear that when the posts came up for renewal or reappointment, the appointments and salary levels would have to be agreed before they could be renewed.

There is a bigger issue in respect of section 38 providers.  In regard to compliance with health sector pay policy, the HSE has stated that, for the avoidance of doubt, employees of section 38 providers are public servants.

The issue arising is that there was a separate pension fund rather than a debate over whether the individuals concerned were public servants.  One of the key recommendations was clearly enunciated approval by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of a public sector pay policy.  As the Chairman noted, it was stated they were public servants.</p></speech>

On the appointment of the new CEO, Mr. Conlan, the recommended pay scale was &euro;83,000, but the client service manager, the administrator and managers of HR and IT would have been on higher salaries.  They were being paid salaries and top-up payments.</p></speech>

To be in full compliance with public pay policy, the CRC wrote to reassure us that Mr. Kiely was about to retire and, as previously committed to by Mr. Peelo, it would re-engage with us.  What actually happened, however, was that it proceeded to make the appointment without getting formal approval for the salary the post would attract.  It subsequently emerged that the board of the CRC had determined the pay rate Mr. Conlan would attract without approval or direct engagement by the HSE.  That is where the issue arose subsequently when, on a retrospective analysis, we stated &euro;125,000 was never the approved salary for the job.  Therefore, we agreed that from 1 October a contract of employment at an agreed pay rate would apply.</p></speech>

When the next CEO is appointed, he or she will be on a salary of &euro;83,000 and five of the existing managers will be on salaries and top-up payments of approximately &euro;79,000, plus &euro;32,000.</p></speech>

The section 38 arrangements that we currently have state they have to now comply with public pay scales.  That is in respect of the new people coming into employment into those organisations.  We are now moving a step further to enhance our governance arrangements and, as the chairman has said, we are meeting with the chairmen of all the section 38 agencies tomorrow.  We are putting in place an enhanced governance arrangement and a new compliance statement.  In the statement, we will look for the chairman of the board and one other director to sign off on the level of compliance regarding pay, risk management systems of control, etc.  We will also ask in areas of non-compliance how long there has been non-compliance, when they will be compliant and how we will work with them to ensure that compliance takes place.</p></speech>

However, this is taxpayers' money and the HSE should have taken every step to ensure the audit was set down properly and protocols were put in place and it should not be doing that now.  That is why we have this problem today.  The problem was created by the CRC and the HSE, which did not try to resolve it.  I am amazed that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in overseeing a budget of &euro;1.6 billion going from one Department to the other and to the HSE did not raise the issue and did not see what was going on in the Department of Health or the HSE.  I would have expected more scrutiny of this issue.  Has Ms McGuinness a list of organisations and the top-ups paid to employees within them?  Is she aware of a list?  The CRC issue, for example, came about because a question was asked.  Deputy Ross spoke about the accounts and then we asked a question.  Does she have a table of organisations and the number of employees in receipt of top-ups reflecting this issue or problem?  If so, can she make it available to the committee?</p></speech>

I am concerned that the HSE has referred to withholding or withdrawing money or whatever the process will be but we must be concerned about the service users in this instance.  The fact that there is poor governance should not negatively impact on them and we have to protect them.  I am appalled by that correspondence, the lack of engagement with CRC and the lack of effort from 2009 onwards to bring closure to a serious problem.</p></speech>

In the interests of clarity, it is a completely separate matter to what is before the committee but Mr. O'Brien was requested by the HSE to take up a new role in 2016 that effectively changed his substantive position.  On this basis, he entered into a pay arrangement.  He received written confirmation of these new terms from the HSE.  He was not aware until recently that the HSE had failed to properly process the new arrangement.  Had Mr. O'Brien known that the arrangement had not been properly processed, he would have ensured that it was immediately rectified in order to correctly reflect the agreement.</p><p>  As far as we are concerned, a genuine error was made and Mr. O'Brien entered his role in good faith and has carried out all the duties of that role.  His current role as director general is totally separate and it has been fully and appropriately approved and negotiated by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health.</p></speech>

To a layman looking in, it looks like CRC Medical Devices which appears to have been a loss maker, bar one year, had accumulated loans of more than &euro;500,000 and it was transferred from being a subsidiary of the CRC group.  Effectively, the CRC was bailed out by Friends and Supporters of the CRC Limited for this dead duck of a company which Mr. Nugent told the Chairman had been sold.  To whom has it been sold?  For how much has it been sold?  How much money which should have been used for front-line services will Friends and Supporters of the CRC Limited end up having to use to bail out what is, effectively, a commercial concern?  Will Mr. Nugent put figures on it?  Am I correct in saying the loan is approximately &euro;550,000?</p></speech>

We are not strengthening the service level arrangement again, but we are putting in place a new arrangement involving compliance statements signed by agencies' boards.  A chairman and director must state that their agency is fully compliant or, if it is not, where that failure in compliance has occurred and how it will be addressed.  In this regard, a meeting has been arranged with the chairmen of all section 38 agencies for tomorrow evening.  This issue will form part of the discussion, as will additional enhanced corporate governance arrangements for boards, the various committees that should be in place - the CRC already has some such committees - and the independence of some of the boards.</p></speech>

It was touched on by Deputy McDonald and others when I was absent.  It concerns governance.  There is an elephant in the room that disturbs me and should be mentioned, or it certainly deserves explanation.  So many of the directors and people in positions of power in the CRC have close associations with the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern.  I am thinking in particular of the late Mr. Tony Kett, who had a senior position and was a great friend of Mr. Ahern.  I am also thinking of Mr. Des Peelo, a former chairman who represented in the tribunal and was a close friend of Mr. Ahern.  I am thinking in particular of Mr. Vincent Brady, a current director, who was a Cabinet colleague, Mr. Kiely and Mr. Nugent, who both received preferment under Mr. Ahern's Government.  Is this purely a coincidence or are these people part of a very narrow pool who somehow got picked in that way?  Is it totally coincidental?</p></speech>

I do not think this is particularly relevant to the agenda but I should say that I knew Lady Valerie Goulding from the mid-1970s, long before I was asked to take on the position of chairman of CERT, as I was regarded as technically competent in sorting out a major problem there.  I did a long number of years on it, with a number of different Taoisigh asking me to stay on.  It was a very successful programme of work that sorted out the requirements of the tourism industry.  Subsequently, out of the blue, I was asked to go on the board of the Central Bank.  I did not expect that.  When I came to the CRC it was at the request of Lady Valerie Goulding and had nothing to do with any interest I had, one way or the other, in politics.</p></speech>

Next week, as an opener, we will deal with that issue specifically.  We will ask for someone from the Mater Hospital to come before us to assist us with that inquiry.

It is regrettable that Mr. Conlan took the course of action that he did.  We found sufficient information around his employment and circumstances but he showed poor respect for the CRC and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is something that the members will deliberate on at a later date.  I thank the witnesses again for coming along.

The next item on the agenda is the scrutiny of the EU proposal before members today.  As for Schedule B, is it agreed the proposals in Schedule B do not warrant further scrutiny?  Agreed.</p><p>  The first item on Schedule A is COM (2013) 753, a proposal for a Council regulation fixing for 2014 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in EU waters and, for EU vessels, in certain non-EU waters.  It is proposed that this proposal requires further scrutiny by way of a letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine requesting a detailed summary of the total allowable catch for Ireland as negotiators at the upcoming December Council meeting of fisheries ministers and furthermore, that the joint committee undertakes to write directly to the Commission expressing its concerns about the indications of this particular proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  It is proposed that the following proposals do not warrant further scrutiny, namely, COM (2013) 702, a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulations (EC) No. 754/2009, (EU) No. 1262/2012, (EU) No. 39/2013 and (EU) No. 40/2013, as regards certain fishing opportunities, COM (2013) 712, a proposal for a Council regulation fixing an adjustment rate to direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No. 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2013 and repealing Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 964/2013 and finally, COM (2013) 812, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries, namely SWD (2013) 469 final and SWD (2013) 470 final.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  As there is no further business, I wish all members a happy Christmas and new year.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.  The delegates are advised that their opening statements will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice in respect of references to persons outside the House and officials.  I ask both witnesses and members to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off, as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment and the translation service.</p><p>   Last September the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, published a draft general scheme for an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013, as well as draft regulations for discussion ahead of the enacting legislation.  The Bill will apply to all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools and the proposed regulations aim to underpin a fair, consistent and transparent enrolment process that precludes school places from being allocated on the basis of waiting lists and prevents schools from seeking deposits or payments as part of the admission process.  The draft general scheme and the draft regulations were referred to the committee for consideration, and we undertook a process of general consultation on the general scheme which resulted in a large number of submissions that are now under consideration.  Approximately 50 submissions were received, and we have invited anybody who specifically sought to address the committee to do so.  In all, we expect to hear some 25 presentations over the course of three meetings, the first of which took place last week.  Today is our second meeting.</p><p>  I welcome Dr. R&iacute;ona N&iacute; Fhrighil of Cearta Oideachais; Mr. Kevin De Barra of Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge; Ms  Bl&aacute;thnaid N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in of Gaelscoileanna Teo; Mr. Mark O'Connor of Inclusion Ireland, which is the umbrella group for Down Syndrome Ireland, Irish Autism Action and the Special Needs Parents Association; Ms Hilary Harmon of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre; Ms Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland; Mr. Ken Whyte of Presentation College, Cork; and Mr. Caoimhin &Oacute; hEaghra of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  I ask witnesses to keep to their allocated five minutes.  We have received their presentations and will go through them in detail; what would be helpful from each speaker today would be an outline of the submission, highlighting the issues of greatest importance.  The value of these meetings is really in the question and answer session.  I now invite Dr. N&iacute; Fhrighil to give her statement.</p></speech>

Is tuismitheoir m&eacute; f&eacute;in, dar nd&oacute;igh, agus lena chois sin baineann c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus sealbh&uacute; teanga imeasc na n-&oacute;g le mo r&eacute;imse saineolais mar l&eacute;acht&oacute;ir ollscoile in Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh.</p><p>  I dtaca leis an dr&eacute;acht bhille um roll&uacute; scoile agus leis na rialach&aacute;in, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn an gr&uacute;pa roimh &aacute;bhar an bhille agus tuigtear d&uacute;inn go bhfuil g&aacute; leis na na leasaithe seo le comhdheiseanna oideachais a chinnti&uacute; do leana&iacute; na linne seo.  Imeasc ph&aacute;ist&iacute; na ngaelscoileanna is gr&uacute;pa mionlaigh iad na p&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar ch&eacute;ad teanga acu.  T&aacute;imid ag caint ar 3% de phoball na ngaelscoileanna.  Creidimid gur ch&oacute;ir go mb&eacute;adh cead ag gaelscoileanna t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt don mhionlach seo.  N&iacute;l aon rud suntasach faoin seasamh seo, leoga.  Is mar seo at&aacute; i dt&iacute;ortha ilteangacha ar fud an domhain agus i gcoinbhinsi&uacute;in &eacute;ags&uacute;la de chuid na N&aacute;isi&uacute;n Aontaithe, mar a n-aithn&iacute;tear go bhfuil cearta ag p&aacute;ist&iacute; oideachas a fh&aacute;il tr&eacute; mhe&aacute;n na ch&eacute;ad teanga acu.  C&eacute; nach gcuirtear cosc follasach, n&oacute; bac de jure, ar ghaelscoileanna ins na dr&eacute;acht rialach&aacute;in teanga baile an ph&aacute;iste a chur san &aacute;ireamh, is geall le cosc &oacute;s &iacute;seal, n&oacute; bac de facto, rial&aacute;ch&aacute;n 20, mar a ndeirtear, "It shall not be permissible for schools to interview parents or students as part of the school's admissions process".

T&aacute; eisceacht amh&aacute;in sonraithe ins na rialacha cheana f&eacute;in.  De r&eacute;ir rialach&aacute;n 21, beidh cead ag scoileana c&oacute;naithe cuireadh chun agallamh a thabhairt do iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; agus do thuismitheoir&iacute;, c&eacute; nach gceada&iacute;tear don scoil an t-agallamh sin a &uacute;s&aacute;id le cumas acad&uacute;il an iarrth&oacute;ra a mheas.  </p><p>  An moladh at&aacute; ag Cearta Oideachais n&aacute; go dtabharfa&iacute; cead teoranta den chine&aacute;l ch&eacute;anna do ghaelscoileanna, cead a bh&eacute;adh d&iacute;rithe go sonrathach orthu si&uacute;d arb &iacute; an Ghaeilge an teanga baile agus orthu si&uacute;d amh&aacute;in.  N&iacute; bheif&iacute; ag iarraidh cumas acad&uacute;il an ph&aacute;iste a mheas ach a dhearbh&uacute; gurb &iacute; an Ghaeilge an teanga baile.  T&aacute; an leas&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; mholadh againn leagtha amach san aighneacht a chuir muid faoi bhr&aacute;id an choiste.  I mbeag&aacute;n focal, creidimid gur ch&oacute;ir agus gur g&aacute; cead a thabhairt do ghaelscoileanna cuireadh a thabhairt don ph&aacute;iste agus don tuismitheoir bualadh leis an phr&iacute;omhoide lena dhearbh&uacute; gurb &iacute; an Ghaeilge an teanga baile.  </p><p>  T&aacute; taighde go leor d&eacute;anta againn ar an chur chuige i gCeanada agus san Fhionlainn.

The four organisations would also like to extend our thanks to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, for consulting on the proposed legislation on admission to schools.  I forwarded members a brief summary of the recommendations contained in our submission to the consultation process.  We work directly with people with intellectual disabilities or autism and their families.  The impact of the proposed legislation on families and children with disabilities was our primary consideration when writing our submission.</p><p>  Head 9 allows the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to direct a school to enrol a child.  While this is a welcome principle, there are issues with the finer details.  The NCSE will get involved when a parent fails to obtain any school placement for his or her son or daughter.  This measure should be changed to mean an appropriate school place.  "Any school place" means that a special educational needs organiser, SENO, could consider a place in a special school when a mainstream school placement would be the most appropriate for the child.</p><p>  Under these proposals, the SENO can direct a school to take a child, but can only recommend that the Minister make resources available.  A lack of resources can severely affect families.  A school can limit the time a child spends in school by citing health and safety reasons due to insufficient resources.  Children have been granted as little as one hour of schooling per day, with a parent needing to wait outside the school.</p> <p>Children have been granted as little as one hour of schooling per day, with a parent having to wait outside.  Other children have been stuck at home for months while a school waits for the resources to come through from the Department.  Ideally, a school placement should be in a local, mainstream school of the parent&rsquo;s choice.  This needs to be resourced by the Department.  Parents who have contacted the four organisations face a dilemma.  They can choose to send their child to a mainstream school without therapeutic inputs from the Department of Health or send him or her to a special class or special school with therapeutic inputs.  This flies in the face of the concept of inclusive education as set out in the EPSEN Act.  A lack of resources to support a mainstream placement should never result in a child entering a special school or class.</p><p> When the NCSE intervenes to enrol a child in a school, it must ensure the school is local to the child and that children are dispersed to ensure a school with some resources is not overwhelmed by additional pupils with high support needs.  A school placement should be based on the assessed needs of a child and resources must follow the child in a timely manner.  This point ties in directly with assessments and IEPs as envisaged in the EPSEN Act, a key part of the national disability strategy.  Currently, lack of resource is an impediment to full implementation of the EPSEN Act, but the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and the NCSE assert it is a key vision for supporting children with special educational needs in school.  For this reason, the proposed legislation and any future policy must adhere to the principles of the EPSEN Act.</p><p> On heads 5 to 7, inclusive, these sections remove an independent appeal and replace it with one that is not independent or transparent in any way.  Appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 are by no means perfect, but they should not be abolished.  The appeal mechanism should be reformed to make determinations on whether an admissions policy is discriminatory.  An example would be special classes for children with autism that are attached to mainstream schools, which we are told by parents are refusing to take on children who are severely or moderately autistic.  One parent who contacted Inclusion Ireland had been refused a place for her child by 30 schools and the child ended up having to travel 50 miles to the nearest school that could accommodate his needs.  This must be stopped.  </p><p> The legislation allows for only a principal to decide on enrolments.  If a child is not enrolled, a parent may appeal to the board of management of the school.  The decision of the board is final.  These is no independence or transparency in the appeals process.  The only option is for a parent to seek a judicial review.  This option is, however, only available to people who can afford it.  </p><p> Head 4, when combined with regulation 12(b), content of policy, introduces a role for the Garda and the HSE in school enrolments.  Either organisation can object to the enrolment of a child in a school if it would have a &ldquo;serious detrimental effect&rdquo; on the safe running of the school.  The regulation does not detail any right of reply for the pupil or parent.  It is a denial of a person&rsquo;s right to a good name and natural justice.  The case of MQ <i>v</i>. Gleeson determined that when information was to be passed on, the person concerned must have a right to due process.  This means that the Garda or the HSE would have to carry out an extensive investigation before passing on information on any pupil.  Neither organisation has this additional capacity.</p><p> The four organisations I represent represent thousands of people with a disability.  While the proposed legislation is welcome in principle, it can be improved to copperfasten the rights of children with a disability to an appropriate education in as inclusive a manner as possible.  Resources are key.  They must be made available where an assessment so directs.  The resources must be appropriate to the child&rsquo;s needs, provided in a timely manner and never be contingent on hm or her being enrolled in a special class or special school.  This is in line with the vision of the EPSEN Act.  The independent appeal against a decision not to enrol a pupil must remain.  To repeal section 29 of the Education Act 1998 is to remove a vital cog of natural justice.  This must be reformed, not abolished.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

Many members will be aware that Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre has been working since 1985 to challenge racism and promote Traveller and Roma inclusion in Ireland.  Core to Pavee Point's work is a commitment to promoting and supporting Traveller inclusion in the education system.</p><p>  As we have already made a detailed submission to the committee, I propose to only outline our main concerns.  Enrolment policies have long proved to be a significant obstacle for Travellers in accessing and progressing through the education system.  They have often served to perpetuate a pattern of institutional discrimination towards Travellers within the education system.  Pavee Point welcomes the opportunity the Bill presents to break this pattern of discrimination and ensure all children can fully enjoy their right to education.</p><p>  While there has been a significant improvement in the past few years in the educational outcomes for Travellers, unfortunately, they continue to fair badly in comparison to their settled peers.  Some 55% of Travellers will leave school before the age of 15 years.  The educational attainment of Travellers is significantly lower than that of their settled peers.  As per the state of the nation's children report in 2012, Traveller and immigrant children and children with special educational needs were more likely to be bullied in school.  The withdrawal of a considerable number of Traveller specific education supports in the 2011 budget has had a significant impact on Traveller enrolment, transfer and retention in the education system.</p><p>  The first of our recommendations speaks to the aims of the Bill to make the process more parent friendly and consistent.  To this end, we are recommending that all school admissions policies and application forms be written in plain English and standardised across the system to ensure they are as accessible as possible to all parents.  We also recommend that the timeframe for the admissions process be standardised across schools to ensure all parents and students are aware of the deadline for applications and when they will be notified of decisions.  These are simple recommendations which if taken on board, could have a profound impact.  It is worth bearing in mind that one in six adults in Ireland today has a literacy difficulty.  We also propose that primary school principals be responsible for ascertaining that 6th class students have a place in a post-primary school and notifying the NEWB of students who do not have a place or are in danger of not transferring to a post-primary school.  Currently, no individual or institution is responsible for ensuring a student transfers from primary to post-primary education.  For children at risk of early school-leaving, this is a particularly vulnerable juncture. </p><p>  Pavee Point has serious concerns about heads 5 and 7.  While we acknowledge that section 29 can be cumbersome and time-consuming, if withdrawn, there will be no way the education and welfare officer can ascertain whether a school is full.  The unfortunate reality is that many schools have in the past used the excuse of being full to prevent Traveller students from enrolling.  It is unclear how, as recommended under head 9, the National Educational and Welfare Board would be able to designate a school for a student if it could not establish whether the school was full.  To ensure boards are effectively and fairly implementing their admissions policy, decisions made on admissions should be, as part of the whole school evaluation process, examined by the inspectorate.  This would ensure transparency and accountability on the part of a board and serve to instil confidence in the process for parents.  Given the close working relationship between most boards and principals, a serious question arises about the impartiality of boards in deciding on an appeal and their expertise to do so.  It is imperative that an independent appeals process, outside the school in question, be put in place in order that children and parents can have confidence in the system.  </p><p>  The past pupil criterion is, by its very nature, discriminatory and has a disproportionate impact on communities with high levels of educational disadvantage.  It is these communities that we should be targeting and facilitating to participate in the education system.  They should not face further discrimination in the enrolment process.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study, undertaken by Pavee Point in 2010, found that 38.5% of 30 to 44 year olds and 25.8% of 45 to 64 year olds within the Traveller community had only primary level education.  This means that for a large number of Traveller children, the chances of their parents having attended a post-primary school are remote.  The past pupil selection criterion is also discriminatory of Travellers who are nomadic.  We strongly recommend that schools be prevented from implementing this criterion in their selection process.</p><p>  I thank the committee for its time.  We will be happy to respond to questions from members.</p></speech>

As legislators, what would members do if I was sick and my local State-funded hospital told me that it might be able to treat me but only after it had first treated all sick Catholics?  What would they do if I was burgled and garda&iacute; in my local Garda station told me they might be able to help me but only after they had first dealt with all Catholic crime victims?  What would they do if any State-funded service had two separate queues, one dealing with Catholics and the other to deal with the rest of us later?  Would members tell me it was okay as a majority of people in my local area were Catholic and that it was what the local majority wanted?  Would they tell me I had a choice to move elsewhere or set up my own hospital or police service?  Would they tell me the State had decided to pay Catholics to run State-funded services according to their Catholic ethos?  No, they would not.  As legislators, they would tell me they would defend my human rights to freedom of conscience, freedom from discrimination, equality before the law and to a private and family life.  I know this because the State has already signed various international human rights treaties and guaranteed these rights for me.  Nevertheless, when it comes to State-funded education, my children and I are forced to leave our human rights at the school gate.  The State allows my only local State-funded school to tell me it will admit all Catholic pupils first and that it might then get around to my children if there are extra places available and only if we do not undermine its ethos.  That breaches my human rights to freedom of conscience, freedom from discrimination, equality before the law and to a private and family life.  It also breaches the rights of the child.  This is not acceptable in a democratic republic in which all citizens should be treated equally.</p><p>  Imagine if my local State-funded hospital, police force or other public service not only helped all Catholics before getting around to me but also actively promoted Catholic faith formation while helping me.  What would legislators tell me then?  Would they talk, as they do now, about the possibility of opting out of Catholic faith formation?  That still breaches my human rights as both the United Nations and the European Court have stated that is not enough to protect my human rights.  Article II of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on the right to education obliges the State to respect secularism as a philosophical conviction and there is a positive obligation on it to respect this conviction throughout the entire education system.  A positive obligation means that it must actively do something; it is not just a negative, a right permitting us to let our children opt out from religious instruction classes.  Opting out will not fulfil the State&rsquo;s obligations under human rights law.  This right to respect is an absolute legal right, not one to be balanced against the rights of others or the ethos of the school or to be gradually achieved.  Even if opting out was enough - which it is not - we cannot even opt out in practice as nearly all State-funded schools integrate their religious ethos into all subjects of the State curriculum.  The State is legally obliged to protect secular families from this religious integrated curriculum because it is not delivered in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner.  Just last month the UN human rights committee asked Ireland what it was doing to protect these human rights and what progress it was making in setting up non-denominational schools around the country.  As legislators, members would not allow hospitals, the police force or any other public service to help Catholics before dealing with anyone else, to actively promote Catholic faith formation to non-religious citizens, or to integrate that ethos into their work.  Therefore, why are they doing it with State-funded schools?  Why are legislators forcing me and my children to leave our human rights outside the school gate?</p><p>  Atheist Ireland&rsquo;s written submission describes exactly how these issues breach human rights law and what changes are needed to protect our human rights, including changing section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act.  Please do not use the committee to fine-tune our &quot;separate but equal&quot; laws for State-funded schools that pretend to be inclusive but that have an admissions policy based on discrimination and segregation.  Please pass laws that treat all children of the nation equally, regardless of the beliefs of their parents about religion or atheism.  Please protect equally all of our human rights to freedom of conscience, freedom from discrimination, equality before the law and to private and family life, as well as the rights of the child.  I am happy to answer questions in this regard.</p></speech>

The joint management board on behalf of voluntary schools has made a substantial submission covering nearly all of the heads of the Bill and the regulations.  I was asked by our board to draw the committee's attention to some concerns, the first of which relates to head 4 which gives the Minister power to make regulations concerning the admission of students to schools.  Heads 12 and 13 indicate that a patron and the Minister might appoint somebody to operate the admissions policy.  We have some concerns that by giving power to bodies outside the board of management to operate a schools admission policy, it would, in effect, amount to micro-management.  The board of management is responsible for the management of the school and should be allowed the authority to exercise that responsibility.  Should it not comply with various laws and regulations, the Minister would have the ultimate power to remove it.</p><p>  A second point is on heads 5 and 7 and section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  We are concerned about the removal of the appeal to the Secretary General, which might be a retrograde step.  We believe strongly that there should always be an appeals mechanism beyond the school and the current process has worked well, although at times it is a little cumbersome.  It is considered to be a fair and transparent process.  By eliminating it, the only option left to parents will be the courts and the last thing the education system needs is more litigation.</p><p>  There is also the matter of the past pupil criterion.  We support the idea of having the children of past pupils in our school.  Their involvement brings a sense of tradition and history to a school.  We do not see the logic in putting a cap on the number of offspring of past pupils that may be admitted and question the claimed benefits of such a cap.</p></speech>

Do the delegates believe it was an oversight on its part in not including the opportunity for an interview?  Obviously, if we are going to be able to provide students who have been educated through Irish at primary school level the same opportunity at secondary school level, it would not make sense.  It is a big weakness in the Bill.  Have the delegates had feedback on any engagement they might have had with the Department on the issue?</p><p>  The representative of Inclusion Ireland pointed to the need for therapeutic supports, particularly in mainstream schools.  How is this working out?  What is the current position?  Obviously, there are significant issues with admission to schools, regardless of the set-up proposed in the Bill.  Will the representative elaborate further on the current position and the gaps in the system that are making it very difficult for students to be admitted to mainstream schools owing to the fact that therapeutic supports are not available to meet their particular needs?</p><p>  Ms Harmon from Pavee Point Travellers Centre spoke about principals taking on responsibility for ensuring students progress and have a school to which they can transfer.  Will she elaborate further on this point?  It would be quite a responsibility.  She has identified a gap in that respect, but will she elaborate on her thoughts on it?</p><p>  Ms Donnelly of Atheist Ireland said opting out was not enough.  Will she elaborate on her overall proposal, other than entirely changing the system for providing an education?  Obviously, people who wish to have their children educated in denominational schools of their chosen faith would say they want to have a right to do this.  Ms Donnelly's point is that she has an equal right in that regard.  There is obviously a gap because the vast majority of schools are denominational.  How does she propose to address that difficulty for people with a secular philosophy?</p><p>  Mr. Whyte from Presentation College, Cork made the point that children of past pupils should be able to enrol.  Pavee Point Travellers Centre has pointed to how it believes this discriminates particularly against the children of Travellers who would not have been pupils in a school previously.  What are his reflections or comments on this point?</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Children also made a submission on the education Bill in which she made some recommendations.  She recommends that the derogation with respect to the past pupil criterion be removed.  It is a strong recommendation.  She has made other points, including on the Equal Status Act.  There are conflicting rights.  There is the right of a school to its own ethos and the right of individuals to access a proper education, with no school being able to impose its ethos on an individual.  We are going through a transition and I do not believe the Bill is sufficiently robust to deal with much of it.  I accept the point made by Pavee Point Travellers Centre.  The Department of Education and Skills stated last week it only happened in an over-subscribed scenario.  However, there would have to be a very robust system in place to check that schools would not be able to state they were full or over-subscribed.  Perhaps there should be further checks at that level in terms of exactly how many schoolchildren were in the class, how many classes there were in that year and so forth.  The position would have to be checked in detail.  The question is whether the Department could do all of this in micro detail because that is what would be required.  It would be very easy for a school to state it was over-subscribed and leave it at that.  I do not think the legislation is robust enough to deal with the issues that have been raised.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, many meetings take place on a Wednesday.  </p><p>  I have the radical idea about Irish education that children should be taught together.  Many people in the education sphere consider that idea incredibly radical and that it could never be achieved.  A minority of schools manipulate their admission policies to keep certain children out.  For that reason, the suggestion that a cohort of schools be allowed to admit children on the basis that their parents or grandparents are past pupils is not good enough.  How can one compete for admission to a school if one's parent did not attend a secondary school, if one's parent attended secondary school but not in Ireland, if one is from outside the State or moved from a different part of the country?</p> <p>That sort of thing must be removed in its entirety.  I accept that 25% is a move in that direction but it is not enough.  </p><p> There are situations where parents with a child with an educational need, from an ethnic background or a Traveller background are told by a principal we would love to take the child but there is a school down the road that has all of the lovely resources and can provide a much better education.  There is effective segregation whereby school A is  very monocultural and school B, for whatever reason, must face many challenges. </p><p>  Glacaim go bhfuil ceist ann maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Ar bhonn bunreacht&uacute;il, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir iachall a chur ar thuismitheoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; le Gaeilge na p&aacute;ist&iacute; sin a chuir chuig scoil l&aacute;n-Bh&eacute;arla.  Glacaim le sin agus s&iacute;lim go bhfuil arg&oacute;int l&aacute;idir ag na finn&eacute;ithe ansin.  At the same time it is important, when using the spirit of the legislation, to be as generous as possible.  I do not want people to use that spirit in a wrong or negative manner.  We must construct an educational system that does not have an incredible competition to keep certain people out and does not allow other people in.  Sin r&aacute;ite, glacaim leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag na finn&eacute;ithe agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo as a bheith anseo.</p><p> With regard to the broader question of ethos, I have great sympathy with what Atheist Ireland has said.  I shall outline  an outrageous situation that exists in my constituency and around the country but perhaps it is not as acute in an urban context because people are more mobile and, therefore, have a greater choice.  One is confronted with a situation where one is told that if one baptises a child in a faith that one does not share he or she will be allowed into the local school.  That is not in keeping with the ethos or vision of a modern republic.  That is completely outside of the vision for a modern republic that a parent would and is being told if their child is not baptised it will be organised.  As a local Deputy, I have been presented with such a scenario.  My response has been to say that at present, unfortunately, the schools have a right to do so. </p><p> Let us be honest, most schools work hard to be as inclusive as possible, to care for the children in their care and to give them the best education that they possibly can.  However, there are schools who manipulate their admission policies to keep out Traveller children and immigrant children, to keep children with special needs out and to keep children with certain disruptive backgrounds out.  We must be sure that when we construct a new admission policy that every schools adopts that spirit in the right way and not manipulate it in the wrong way.  Go raibh maith agat. </p></speech>

It is my understand that the Minister made reference, on a radio show, when he was quizzed on the point in terms of thuismitheoir&iacute; l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  He made the point that Church of Ireland schools could give priority to students from Church of Ireland or Protestant families and it is a similar situation for Gaelscoileanna.  I presume, similar to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that the logic of parents who raise their children through Irish having access to a scoil la gheailge is being accepted by the Department and I hope it will be reflected.</p><p>  I welcome Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's comment that constitutionally we cannot envisage a situation where a parent who raises their child or children through Irish is left in a situation where they are forced, in whatever manner, to send their child or children to a scoil Bh&eacute;arla or scoil l&aacute;n-Bh&eacute;arla.  They should, therefore, have access to education through the Irish-medium at primary and second levels.  I also believe that they agree with the point made about access.  If a child attends a primary l&aacute;n-ghaeilge then they should go a second level school also.  I assume that is understood.  </p></speech>

Exceptions have been made elsewhere in the Bill.  Our logical recommendation is that an exception be made of Gaelscoileanna and that an interview be allowed.  The latter would be informal and not very structured.  Rather, it would allow the principal to meet the parents and ascertain whether the child is being raised through Irish.  If application forms are the sole means of ascertaining a child&rsquo;s language background, every parent could tick a box and claim to be raising his or her child through Irish.  We want the committee to recommend that an exception be made for Gaelscoileanna at primary school level so that a board of management can have the discretion to meet parents.</p><p>  Many colleagues have mentioned discrimination.  We want to ensure that people who raise their children through Irish are not discriminated against in their children&rsquo;s access to education through Irish at bunscoil and meanscoil levels.</p></speech>

As Mr. De Barra stated, it is more of an observation, as it tends to be informal and is often done through play to see how the child reacts to toys and whatnot.</p><p>  We followed the wording, but also the spirit, of the exception in the regulations for boarding schools.  The exception would be used to ascertain the home language, not a child&rsquo;s academic ability.  We should all remember that speakers of Irish are not immune to dyslexia or other forms of learning difficulty or disability.  For this reason, it is important that such children are afforded services through their first language, that being, Irish.</p><p>  I will address Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in&rsquo;s point about diversity.  Within the Gaelscoil population, the native Irish speaker adds to diversity, as that population is such a tiny minority.  We are referring to just one child in 30.  It is important that this diversity be preserved.</p><p>  I will cite Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude in Tallaght as a school with a commendable policy, in that it encourages native speakers and provides 10% of places for other minority groups, be they linguistic or cultural minorities.  As parents who raise children through Irish, we welcome this diversity.  We do not want our children to grow up in an ethnic bubble.  This approach is great, as it would normalise multiculturalism and multilingualism if our children were educated with others who do not speak English at home.  It is important that we preserve the diversity of Gaelscoileanna.</p></speech>

It is as simple as that.  Approximately 50% of our intake are the children of past pupils.  The other 50% are determined primarily by lottery.</p><p>  Regarding minority groups, the Act provides for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and others to make regulations and tell schools to accept pupils.  I do not know why the provision cannot be extended somewhat.</p></speech>

As my colleagues have outlined, it is used as a mechanism to assess the linguistic background of families and parents.  It is important to mention that the interview is used in Irish-medium school only in cases of over-subscription.  All applicants to Irish-medium schools are accepted unless there is pressure on places, in which case over-subscription criteria are employed.  Some schools use the interview mechanism at that stage to ascertain linguistic background.  Not all of the 29% of primary schools that have over-subscription issues use the interview mechanism.  It is important for boards of management to be given the autonomy to use their own authority and expertise to decide what the appropriate criteria are, based on the profile of its community.</p><p> I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's support for the system.  In the case of each of the challenges to which he alluded, it boils down to a question of over-demand.  It is important to reiterate that all children are accepted where demand can be met.  We cannot meet the demand at present.  That is the big issue for us.</p></speech>

The right to education is a human right.  It belongs to the child.  He or she owns that right.  By ratifying the various international treaties, the State has already guaranteed that child can access a local school without discrimination on any of the known grounds.  I read the regulatory impact analysis that was prepared by the Department of Education and Skills.  In the section of that analysis relating to the rights of citizens, it is made clear that the right to be educated in a place of choice is subject only to the use by schools of "lawful over-subscription criteria".  That is a nice way of saying discrimination, especially when 96% of the primary schools in Ireland have a religious ethos.  I would like to explain to the committee what is meant by "lawful over-subscription criteria" in practical terms on the ground.  I am not picking on the three schools I intend to mention - I just happened to find these details.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Donnelly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013121100011#K00600"><p>Okay.  In the case of one school, the first criterion relates to Catholic children residing within the geographical boundaries.  The school offers places to Catholic children resident within the Catholic parish of Sacred Heart.  I will not read out the full name of the parish.  In another case, the school offers places in turn to Church of Ireland children of the parishes, Church of Ireland siblings, Protestant siblings, Church of Ireland children from outside the parish, Church of Ireland children of inter-church marriages, other Protestant children of member churches of the Irish Council of Churches, including Presbyterians and Methodists, other siblings, children of inter-church marriages - Church of Ireland and other - where the child is not Church of Ireland, children of permanent staff members, Roman Catholic children, Orthodox children and other children.  My children fall into the very last category.  This is what the regulatory impact analysis of the Department of Education and Skills refers to as &quot;lawful over-subscription criteria&quot;.  It is religious discrimination.  It is terrible to say something like that to a parent whose child has been refused access to his or her local school because a baptism certificate was not produced, or because he or she does not belong to a certain religion.</p><p>  As I have said, the right to education belongs to the child.  Under Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, parents have the human right to have their religious or philosophical convictions respected.  Secular parents have exactly the same right as religious parents.  If one makes the argument that parents have the right to ensure their children receive a religious education, one has to recognise that other parents have the right to ensure their children receive a secular education.  That is not what those who make this argument are saying, however.  They could not possibly be saying that.  No State could guarantee a religious education to every family in the country.  I do not know whether the committee realises that approximately 136 bodies in this country claim to be religions.  They have made applications under the Civil Registrations Acts.  Legislators cannot possibly guarantee that the State will pay for the children of families of every one of those religions to receive a religious education.  It is not possible.  Instead, the State is giving a right to a majority in a particular area.</p><p>  The right to opt out is not enough.  Under human rights law, secularism must be respected as a philosophical conviction.  I can give the committee a definition of that which has come from the European court.  It can be examined in the context of the Education Acts.  On the question of respect, Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights does not permit a distinction to be drawn between religious instruction and other subjects.  It enjoins the State to respect parents' convictions, be they religious or philosophical, throughout the entire State education programme.  That duty is broad in its extent as it applies not only to the content of education and the manner of its provision but also to the performance of all the functions assumed by the State.  The verb &quot;respect&quot; means more than &quot;acknowledge&quot; or &quot;take into account&quot;.  In addition to a primarily negative undertaking, it implies some positive obligation on the part of the State.  The term &quot;conviction&quot;, taken on its own, is not synonymous with the word &quot;opinion&quot; or the word &quot;idea&quot;.  It denotes views that attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance.  That should be considered if the word &quot;respect&quot; is being put into legislation.  That has already been done in section 15(2)(<i>e</i>) of the Education Act 1998, which obliges boards of management to &quot;respect&quot; the ways of life &quot;of a democratic society&quot;.  If one wants to guarantee that, one should adopt the recommendation of the Irish Human Rights Commission regarding section 15 of that Act, which is that the State should ensure the curriculum is delivered &quot;in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Harmon" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013121100011#K00700"><p>I would like to respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  It is surprising nobody has actual responsibility to ensure that a child transfers from primary to post-primary school, given that children have to stay in school up to junior certificate or their birthday, depending which comes first.  The reason we decided that primary principals should be given a responsibility to check whether that transfer had happened was because, as I understand it, in May of next year the extended report card will be introduced and every primary school will have to fill in this report card for every student in the school.  When a student successfully enrols in a post-primary school, that school will get in contact with the primary school and ask it to send on this extended report card.  Therefore, principals should be left in a position where, if there are five extended report cards that have not been sent on to the post-primary school, it should be quite evident that those children do not have a place.</p><p>  From our experience of working with the National Educational Welfare Board, we have found that one of the key issues is when a school hears too late that a child does not have a place or has not secured a place.  What we are asking is that when principals become aware, as they will become aware through the extended report card, that students do not have a place in a secondary school, either they contact those students and ask them what the situation is, or contact the National Educational Welfare Board and flag that there could be a potential issue with the students.  This is to safeguard against those children dropping off, given this is one of the key areas we have noticed, specifically with Traveller students.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013121100011#K00800"><p>I wish to respond to Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s point.  With regard to therapeutic inputs for young children, the situation is that quite a number of disabilities are best treated through education and also with the input of those like occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, psychologists and so on.  There is an issue with the current moratorium on recruitment into the HSE, particularly as quite a number of professionals left in the large redundancy programme at the end of 2011.  I am involved in the national co-ordinating group on progressing children&rsquo;s disability services.  Quite a number of the regional disability managers have been reported that their staffing levels in therapy services are at crisis point.</p> <p>That is coming from the management.</p><p> As to how it affects schools, one of the largest providers of therapeutic inputs into schools has taken a decision that, based on its resources, it will not support children who have a mainstream school placement.  As a result, schools have been informing parents that they cannot accommodate their child in the absence of such therapeutic supports.  This leaves parents having to make a decision on whether to have their child educated in an inclusive manner or in a special school or special class where the child will receive therapeutic supports.  That is the current position.  Inclusion Ireland's position is that where a child has assessed need - this is generally done by an arm of the State, whether the Health Service Executive of National Educational Psychology Service - the recommendations of the assessment should be followed through.  Furthermore, a mainstream, inclusive education should be the first port of call in such cases.  We must support children in that type of education placement, rather than placing parents in a dilemma on whether to send their child to a special school.</p></speech>

I had to speak to an amendment I had tabled in the Seanad.  With that in mind, I apologise if I repeat something that was said in my absence.</p><p>  The Bill is very important as this issue could affect the child of anyone present.  The issue is particularly important in areas of rapid population growth, including Galway where I live.  As Ms N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in stated, excessive demand is where the problem arises in most cases.  Mr. Whyte indicated that the Minister appears to be effectively micro-managing a school.  Based on some of the things I have observed, such micro-management is necessary in some cases.</p><p>  Is it fair on the part of schools to retain broader catchment areas, which include schools outside the parish in which they are based, if it works to the detriment of local children?  In some cases, there are five or six primary schools in a parish.  The children of the parish have a reasonable expectation that they will be able to attend their local second level school.  I refer to the problems experienced by the eldest children in families as the siblings of children enrolled in a school are favoured when enrolment takes place.  The eldest children in a family must try to get on the first rung of the ladder, as it were, but are subjected to a waiting list or lottery, as is the case in Mr. Whyte's school.  Some of them do not succeed and whereas most children know which second level school they will attend the following September, some children are left on a waiting list.  The children enrolled in a school must take a test in January - I will not use the term "entrance examination", whereas the children who do not succeed in the lottery are not invited to take the examination.  These children may be offered a place later in the year if other children drop out.  It is particularly cruel to exclude such children.  Is it fair that schools retain wide catchment areas with outlying primary schools when this acts to the detriment of local children? </p><p>  Dr. N&iacute; Fhrighil alluded to adopting a 10% threshold criterion for all groups.  Do the witnesses accept that all schools should be required to accept a minimum percentage of children from a number of strata, for example, children with learning difficulties, children of various religions and none and children from ethnic minorities?  A publicly funded, inclusive school system must be prepared to do this.  Currently, many schools engage in a form of exclusion for the purpose of safeguarding their results.  </p><p>  The analysis I have done shows that the disciplinary system in place in some schools hurts children with learning difficulties, particularly ADHD.  Children with this disorder do not learn in the same way as other children.  When they answer out of turn they are told they are interrupting the learning process of other children in the class and given cards for breaches of discipline.  If X number of cards lead to suspension, some of these children will lose time in school because of the disciplinary card system.  Eventually, some of them will receive so many suspensions that they must leave the school, which poses problems in respect of admission to other schools.  This is an unreasonable approach which does not work for the education of the child.  As Ms Donnelly noted, children have a right to education.  I ask the witnesses to respond.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of the proposals made by Inclusion Ireland as they would move us towards a much more inclusive type of education.  I would like children with a disability to be able to attend their local school and have support services available to them.  Should schools be allowed to differentiate between different types of special needs without unnecessarily discriminating against students?

I think our system lays too much emphasis on parental choice.  That is a huge driver of inequality in our system because parents who are well organised can use the system to the advantage of their children over those of parents who are less organised or are disadvantaged.  I represent a developing area where there is a lot of disadvantage.  I have dealt with a constituent who had to walk 40 minutes to a Catholic school because she could not get her child into the Educate Together school right beside her.  The first come, first served policy can discriminate against Travellers or immigrants or people who are disadvantaged although it does not always work out that way.</p><p>  My favourite model is the multidenominational State model but it is my experience, in my constituency, that Catholic schools are some of the most inclusive for those who are disadvantaged, or for Travellers.  I am not saying that is always the case but I want to balance the picture.  I am aware of classes in the local Catholic school in which a third of the pupils are Muslims but that would not arise in the Educate Together schools.  In my area there are Educate Together schools which are emergent schools and have significant numbers of disadvantaged and immigrant pupils.</p><p>  I do not encounter the parental rule in my constituency but I know that Travellers suffer discrimination because they do not enrol their children as babies in the local school which has a first come, first served policy.  People who move into the area also face discrimination and disadvantage.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?  What about other enrolment policies such as the first come, first served policy?  Would Ms N&iacute; Fhrighil like to respond to the latest questions?</p></speech>

If a native Irish speaker being raised outside the Gaeltacht does not get into the local gaelscoil, whether at primary or secondary level, the problem is not just that the child does not get into the school of their choice, they do not get an education of their choice through their native language.  If a child for whom English is the mother tongue does not get into an English language school of their choice they will be educated nonetheless through English and will not be disadvantaged.  If, for example, my first child does not get into the local gaelscoil it makes our effort at home much more difficult.  All the research shows that his proficiency will drop off dramatically in a short space of time if Irish is used only in the home domain.  There is a difference between a school of choice and an education of choice.</p><p>  I mentioned Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude, which has reserved 10% of places for other linguistic and cultural minorities.  We as a group, Cearta Oideachais, have no problem with that being standard because we welcome diversity and multiculturalism.  In raising our children in a language that is not the language of the community we endorse that.  We are putting our money where a map is.  I have no experience of report cards yet.</p><p>  In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, it is obvious that if we do not look after the native Irish speakers being raised outside the Gaeltacht, who depend on the gaelscoil to promote their use of the language outside of the home, so that they learn to socialise through the medium of the language, we are looking at a very dismal future.  We all agree that we need to support the next generation of Irish-speaking children if in 20 years time we are to have a language and if anybody will need to access State services through the medium of Irish.  All of the research, including the comprehensive sociolinguistic analysis of the Gaeltacht published in 2005 by &Oacute; Giollach&aacute;in and Mac Donacha paints a very bleak picture if we do not look after the native Irish speakers inside and outside the Gaeltacht.  Irish language speakers in the gaelscoil system are not only a minority but also a very important resource.</p><p>  All of us who are <i>au fait</i> with research in education since the 1970s, from Vygotsky on, realise that peer learning and scaffolding are very important.  These children are the bridge between their peers who are learning through their second language, or in some cases their third or fourth language, and those for whom Irish is the first language.  It is important to remember that Irish medium education should be an education of choice.  We do not want anybody to be forced to learn through their second, third or fourth language but those for whom Irish is a first language are a vital resource in the system and we must see that they are supported and that they support the system.</p></speech>

If this Bill were to be passed as it is there will be a loophole that allows for those parents who have decided to raise their children through Irish to be excluded from gaelscoil education.  Those children could be excluded from the State service of Irish medium education.  A logical and simple amendment will ensure that an exception is made for gaelscoileanna so that those raising their children through Irish can be sure they will get preference in gaelscoil education.  This applies to areas inside and outside the Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>  On the first day of school for children in primary school the language input from the parents is almost negated in that they need the support mechanism of peer learning.  Dr. N&Iacute; Fhrighil alluded to this.  The input a child receives from those around him or her, who are of the same age, is more important than the language at home.  If the children raised through Irish do not have Irish language education they will be raised in an Irish language bubble in their home but the language they acquire through English medium education will not be the first language that they spoke until they entered school.  Their language skills when they reach the age of 18 will be less than they would have been in their first language, the one they speak at home.  It is important to recommend this simple amendment to the draft legislation to ensure that we allow an exception to gaelscoileanna and that the schools can meet the parents in advance to ascertain what language is spoken at home.</p><p>  For some reason, elitism often comes up when we talk about gaelscoileanna.  It may be important to see where these gaelscoileanna are located.  Many are located in DEIS schools or in areas of disadvantage.</p> <p>Another important point is that gaelscoileanna are elite schools.  It is very important that the schools be allowed recognise the language input received by the students in their education up to the point at which they enter primary school.  We should look towards r&eacute;amhscola&iacute;ocht and na&iacute;onra&iacute;.  Preschool education through Irish should be permitted to be recognised by the schools which the current draft legislation does not allow.  It is important to allow the gaelscoileanna to treat this as an exception.</p></speech>

On the question of using percentages as a means of including minorities, I know of some schools with up to 25% allocated for immigrant children.  While we commend this proactive effort at inclusion I would be slightly concerned that it may be more inclusive not to ring-fence places and to leave the system open to ensure that places are offered to every child where there is not an issue of over-subscription.  This returns us to the question of over-subscription and supply and demand.</p><p>  In response to Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh about the scoileanna l&aacute;n Gaeilge and the role they play in the strategy, they are often regarded as the nucleus of Irish language development.  There is too much responsibility placed on Irish-medium schools to save the language.  The State has a greater responsibility to ensure that the future of the language is not placed solely in the hands of a school.  The predominant aim of any Irish-medium school is to provide an excellent standard of education and they do that through the medium of Irish.  I do not think it is right that they should also be responsible for ensuring the language does not die, basically.  On the question of the implications if our recommendations are not accepted, one of the implications would be that accusations of elitism would thrive.  Over-subscription issues make people unhappy and often in that case, elitism and other accusations are used.  There is no proof that these schools or the system are elitist.  We know this from our own statistics which I will happily forward to the committee.  Children of all profiles are represented in the schools, such as children with special educational needs, children with different linguistic backgrounds and children of all abilities. </p></speech>

That is not to say that parents in other types of schools are not also highly motivated.  However, it is the case that the parents may have been involved in establishing and developing the school and this is a help.</p><p>  On the question about elitism, our organisation is actively trying to encourage more immigrant and minority groups to participate in the system.  Our information leaflets on the immersion system of education are translated into seven languages.  For the past number of years we have been meeting with representative bodies of these groups.  There is a perception that it is not an open system and our statistics prove that this perception has no foundation.</p></speech>

I am aware of one particular case which worries us with regard to the involvement of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.</p><p>  A parent told me about her son who was in a mainstream class but he had issues with the teaching process.  He was at times quite boisterous in the class, jumping up to answer questions, for example.  The school decided to teach him apart from the rest of the class in a small room, which his mum referred to as an isolation chamber.  The young chap, being reasonably clever, decided that if there was no light in the room they would not be able to use the room so he took out the bulb and broke it into the bin.  However, the next day they put him back into the room in the darkness.  I have seen pictures of the room and the window is small.  He then thought, quite logically, that if he broke the window they would definitely not be able to keep him in the room.  He broke the window and the school expelled him.  He is the kind of guy I assume the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have objections about him going to another school.  This is a dangerous precedent and the problems arose because his needs were not met in the first place.  </p><p>  I have a concern about catchment areas.  Our position is that Traveller children, children with special educational needs, children from other countries, should, in so far as possible, be able to attend their local school.  As mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, quite a number of schools place soft barriers.  There is an issue with regard to secondary schools, in particular, principals who are trying to protect the 100% record of students progressing to university.  For example, children with special educational needs are not facilitated by the provision of the applied leaving certificate curriculum because that will not allow for 100% record of students going to UCD or where ever.  That is a particular issue.</p></speech>

Equally, different groups have indicated that the current system is not perfect either.  In the view of the delegates, what is an appropriate replacement mechanism which would not involve the Department or the Secretary General?  I have concerns that removing the section 29 provision will mean more legal actions being taken at school level.  It can become very awkward for schools to defend cases.</p></speech>

I will deal first with the section 29 appeals.  The new section 29 is a bit cumbersome but it is very transparent and it works.  We think that it should be retained.  The issue of over-subscription was raised.  It is the case that over-subscription will always happen with population increase.</p> <p>It is particularly prevalent in areas where there are younger families and where children are entering that age bracket.  The same situation would not apply in the case of my school because the children in the area are much older.  It would not be a huge issue for most of the voluntary schools but it is certainly one for the newer schools that opened during the past 20 years.  No matter what system is put in place, there will be people who are disappointed.  Ours is an old school and taking on the sons and grandsons of past pupils enhances it.  They kept the school going in the bad times when there would not have been many people who wanted to send their children to us.  In some cases, they would have travelled 15 or 20 miles in order to attend the school.  It is a matter of trying to find a balance.</p><p> We must be careful in terms of the future because the demographic changes taking place now are going to have a severe impact on schools.  The solution in this regard is ensuring that schools will be located in the right places.  The relevant data from the CSO indicates the areas in which the population will be concentrated, and extrapolating from that is a fairly straightforward matter.  In essence, it is a planning issue.</p><p> I am somewhat bothered by the concept of the report card.  A child who is on the relevant spectrum should not be put on a report card as a result of how he or she reacts to particular situations.  I have worked for 20 years in both the vocational and voluntary sectors and I find it difficult to believe that teachers would put children on report cards because they behave in a certain way.  As a principal, I would ask why a particular child's name was placed on a card.  Most principals with whom I am familiar would be of the same view.  In such circumstances, I cannot answer the question because I have not come across the particular scenario.</p><p> Most schools have selection procedures for pupils and then they carry out application tests in respect of those who are chosen.  Our school does not stream pupils but it is good to carry out tests in order to split the children up in a fair way.  I do not know of any schools that carry out interviews or tests prior to selection.  I do not believe it is a good habit.</p></speech>

I was referring to areas within parishes in which there is high population growth and where there are five or six primary schools.  As a result of the fact that these schools have enrolment policies which apply to much wider catchment areas, local children lose out in the lottery and do not gain entry to some of them.

In other words, when they reached the 10% they would use that fact as a way out of enrolling children from disadvantaged communities, the Traveller community, etc.</p><p>  We have had experience with the disciplinary card system in the Traveller community.  We are of the view that the Bill is slightly weak in the context of transferring children mid-term and with regard to expulsion.  We frequently find that children with perceived behavioural problems face quite an amount of discrimination if they transfer mid-term or if they are expelled.</p><p>  It is my understanding that from May or June of next year all school principals will be obliged to complete extended report cards in respect of all sixth class students.  When a student is accepted into a secondary school, the latter will contact his or her primary school and request his or her sixth class report card.  What should happen is that we should reach a position where primary school principals will have transferred all of these extended report cards to their counterparts in post-primary schools.  If, at the end of this process, a school still has five report cards left, it is obvious that there is an issue.  The matter will either have to be taken up with the children's parents or, ideally, it will be flagged with the National Education and Welfare Board.  Our experience has been that the later matters of this nature are flagged with the board, the more problematic it becomes to secure a place for a child.</p><p>  Deputy Tuffy referred to the first-come-first-served approach.  This is problematic for Traveller parents.  That is why - as our submission indicates - we are seeking standardisation of deadlines across all schools.  The deadline for enrolment in two primary schools ten miles apart can vary quite substantially.  The Irish system is incredibly confusing, not for just for members of the Traveller community but also for anyone who is new to it.  This is particularly the case if families are not embedded in their communities <i>per se</i>.  Such families will not have the relevant knowledge and in many instances the necessary information is communicated through the Catholic church, at mass or whatever.  The latter is a problem for those who do not participate in religious ceremonies, etc.  The standardisation of deadlines would increase awareness and improve people's capacity to be organised in the context of enrolment processes.</p><p>  The final point relates to the appeals system.  I am of the view that it must be known by another name.  As Mr. Whyte indicated, the one good thing about the section 29 provision is that it is very transparent.  It could, however, be made considerably more user-friendly for parents.  A transparent and open system must be put in place in order to instil confidence among parents.</p></speech>

Traditionally, it has proven to be practical for Gaelscoileanna to draw pupils from such areas.</p><p>  In the context of the percentage access and the existence of a kind of positive discrimination, I am unsure about percentages being applied.  It is important to remember - I do not want this point to become lost in the overall debate - that Irish-medium schools are exactly the same as English-medium schools.  The only difference is that children are taught through the medium of Irish.  They are employing criteria - with the exception of those we are putting forward today - to give priority to children who speak Irish at home.  The rest are the same.  An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta's policy is that the highest level of access should be afforded to as many students as possible.  This is reflected in the fact that the schools which come under the remit of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta have different types of ethos, from Catholic to inter-denominational to multi-denominational.  Our primary aim is to further Irish-medium education through whatever ethos and to afford access to the greatest number of people possible.</p><p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh as a r&aacute;iteas.  Maidir leis an gceist i dtaobh strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, b'fh&eacute;idir go leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh as B&eacute;arla ar mhaithe le chuile duine an m&eacute;id a bhfuil le r&aacute; agam a chloisint.  The role of Irish-medium schools in the context of strait&eacute;is<font color="#222222"> </font>na Gaeilge and furthering the language is recognised as being crucial by all.  In the context of Department's dealings with strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge and its engagement with Irish-medium patrons such as ourselves - An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta is the largest such patron - an economic argument is being put forward at present.  The Department will state that its responsibility is to provide places in schools for children and it does not matter to it whether those places are in Gaelscoileanna or other types of school so long as there is a place for each child.</p> <p>If we are seriously engaging with strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge, the Department needs to recognise that the Gaelscoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge is crucial to achieving the targets of the strait&eacute;is in furthering the language in that it creates a community.  The schools in An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta act quite often, as Ms N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in stated, as the nucleus of those communities in giving not only the children but the parents, staff and the wider community an opportunity to normalise the use of the language in that community in their extracurricular and parental involvement and wider use of the language.  In terms of this opportunity to further the language, the model we promote is through Gaelscoileanna and not through any other facility such as an aonad model at second level, which is a smaller minority within the bigger English-medium school.  It does not give those schools an opportunity to develop except in very rare cases.  Therefore, we would encourage the Department to consider providing stand-alone Gaelscoileana throughout the country where possible, or promote satellite schools where the demographic demand is not as great as in other places, which would be a school under the board of management of another Gaelscoil.</p><p> The issue of elitism is always raised.  In one of our schools in Lucan the pupils attending are of 13 different nationalities and among them there is every point on the spectrum of ability and special educational needs.  The schools do not discriminate in this manner.  The idea of elitism comes from the fact that, as covered in the statistics mentioned, 22% of children applying to Gaelscoileanna at primary level do not get access to a place in a Gaelscoil, and 29% of children applying at second level do not get access to a place, which points blatantly to the fact that there are not enough schools and places in the first place, thus creating this image of them.</p><p> On the point about there being too much emphasis on parental choice, the catchphrase of this Government has been parental choice and parents' rights.  What we want to do is to ensure that everybody's rights are respected and to find acceptable criteria in admissions policies, as referred to by Mr. Ken Whyte.  Not everybody will be happy no matter which criteria are applied, but finding criteria that are acceptable to all of us and that do not discriminate is the key.  </p><p> On the section 29 appeal system, the proposal that the onus in this respect should fall on the board of management will result in more litigation for boards of management and much more difficulty for those groups that are performing on a voluntary basis for the State.  This proposal will put an onerous responsibility on them.  While the current system is not perfect, it is transparent and it works.  Unless there is a model that is agreed and that is far more efficient, I would stick with the system in place instead of placing the burden of that responsibility on the board of management.</p></speech>

This is very simple for me.  If we base an education system on human rights, we will find all the answers there.  We talk about choice and the choice of parents, but the right to education belongs to the child.  I do not know whether I am the only parent here, but I have been discriminated against on two grounds - because I am an atheist and also because I have a child with special needs.  The connection between those two and the feelings associated with such discrimination are the same; discrimination hurts.  If we give a child his or her right to education and we make that the priority, that child's access to the school must not be a burden to his or her parents.  We cannot say to a local family that if they cannot get their child into the local school because it is oversubscribed by a certain category of students, they will have to go 50 miles outside the area.  That is a breach of their human rights.  It is as simple as that.  The Government has promised us those human rights.  By ratifying all those United Nations treaties it has said that we can have those rights, and it has said to children that it will guarantee their human rights.  It cannot give every parent a choice.  It is ridiculous to talk about choice because choice means nothing to me.  I keep hearing those words but I never have any choice.  One only has a choice of a particular school or a particular patron body.  The Government cannot give every parent a choice and fund a certain type of education for every family in the country.  One has to think about that, because it cannot be done.  The Government is picking and choosing.  It is picking the majority in a particular area instead of concentrating on the rights of the child to be brought up in his or her community with children from diverse backgrounds.  That is the way forward.</p><p>  Article 42.3.1&deg; of the Constitution, which everybody ignores, states: "The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State."  The Irish State ignores that Article because secular parents have no choice but to send their children to schools with a religious ethos, where they leave their human rights at the school gate.  That is what happens to us.  The Government violates our conscience and lawful preference, and the UN is telling it that.  The UN told the Government that in 2008.  The UN told the Irish State, under the international covenant of civil and political rights, that the integrated curriculum in denominational schools constitutes discrimination and breaches the right to freedom of conscience, the rights of the child, and the right to equality before the law of secular parents and their children, and everybody just ignores that.  Atheist Ireland and the Irish Human Rights Commission believe that the Government should base its future policy on human rights law and treat all children in the State equally.</p></speech>

We in Inclusion Ireland believe, as do the other disability groups represented, that it should be retained but reformed.  There are serious issues with it.  Currently, as it stands, section 29 can look at the school policy and whether it was applied fairly; however, it does not look at the soft barriers, or whether a policy in itself is discriminatory.  I have looked at quite an amount of them in dealing with advocacy cases.  There are quite an amount of them that are blatantly discriminatory.  School authorities will say they will take children up to a certain level of disability, but after that level they will not.  It does not deal with the fact that a child may be taken into a school for one hour a day.  The mum or dad has to sit outside and wait for their child to come out; the child is thrown out after one hour because it is a health and safety risk to keep the child for any longer than the one hour.  It does not deal with the fact that a school has taken a child in it must wait for those resources, while the mum and the child are sitting at home for maybe six or eight months waiting for the resources.  If we could reform the section 29 appeal system to deal with some of those issues, instead of just looking at policies, that would be helpful.  One only has to do a trawl through some of the policies that are publicly available to note that they are not fair, but a section 29 appeal cannot deal with that.</p><p>  We had one man who had to go to 22 different schools to get his son enrolled in a school.  He took a section 29 policy case against one school that was blatantly discriminating against his son.  The school authorities said that they were not applying for the resources to have his son come to their school.  He took the section 29 policy case but because the school had stuck to its enrolment policy, which was publicly available, it did not have a case to answer, so the young chap ended up having to travel 90 minutes each way to school.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, they are unable to be with us today.  </p><p>  In view of the fact that the proceedings are being carried live, I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even in silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  Each week we receive complaints from the recording staff that the audio will not be clear if a mobile phone rings.  I would appreciate it if everyone respected this instruction.</p><p>  The item on today's agenda was unexpected - to express sympathy on the death of the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the South African ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Jeremiah Dingaan Ndou.  I am aware that the ambassador's term in Dublin will expire shortly and that this will be one of his final public events in the Oireachtas.  As we bid farewell to Nelson Mandela, we also bid farewell to him and wish him well in his new position in Pretoria.  I thank him for being with us for the past few years.</p><p>  Nelson Mandela was blessed with a long life.  He spent 27 long years incarcerated in a South African prison, but he achieved much as a civil rights activist and an anti-apartheid campaigner.  He has left a legacy of inspiration to the people of South Africa and the civil rights movement throughout the world.  He visited Ireland in July 1990 when he addressed the D&aacute;il.  He became the first black President of South Africa in 1994 and his success in unifying the nation won him international acclaim.  He was also an advocate of conflict resolution.  He believed very much in diplomacy and reconciliation and became an inspiration for all those striving for peace throughout the world.  Rebuilding South Africa was a key priority for him during his presidency and afterwards.</p><p>  Nelson Mandela recognised the healing power of sport and the very important role it would play in unifying his people and restoring his country's international reputation, having been ostracised from participation in international sports during the apartheid era.  Most people remember his gesture of reconciliation when he donned the green Springboks jersey and baseball cap.  I will always remember seeing the picture of him presenting the Rugby World Cup to Fran&ccedil;ois Pienaar in 1995.  I also remember seeing him in Dublin during the Special Olympic Games in 2003.  I will always remember the roar of the crowd when he appeared with the Special Olympians.  It was only fitting that he made his final public appearance at the FIFA World Cup final in 2010.  Sport was extremely important to him.  He was a legend and will always be remembered.  There will never again be anybody like him.</p></speech>

Last week I met the ambassador and thought that would be our final meeting, but, unfortunately, the death of such an iconic figure has meant we are meeting again today.  Our generation was very privileged to have witnessed the influence and positivity of such an international figure.  Every year we learn of problems which can seem too much to confront, never mind overcome, but, thankfully, people of such stature as Mr. Mandela rise to these challenges.  His enormous legacy will endure.  President Obama referred to him as the great liberator of the 20th century.</p><p>  Apartheid South Africa was a country in which there was enormous tension and which was challenged by particular difficulties.  Nelson Mandela's leadership showed through and he was a constant calming influence.  He was a leader with real vision and who put together the rainbow coalition which was generous and understanding of all.  His achievements as President in a new political architecture were enormous.  We are aware of the grave injustices under the the apartheid regime and they were well documented at the time.  If modern communications technology was available between 1948 and the early 1990s, they would have been even better documented for the rest of the world.</p><p>  I pay tribute to the 12 Dunnes Stores workers, 11 women and one man, and their campaign from 1984 to 1987.  They took a direct stand against Nelson Mandela being condemned to hard labour in the desolation of Robben Island.  They also campaigned against the injustices inflicted on so many South Africans.  We should also note the Irish rugby players, many of whom were household names and revered in the world of rugby, who spurned the chance to tour South Africa with the Irish team.  They showed real courage in so doing.  </p><p>  The ANC has shown real appreciation for the work of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  Some of us were privileged to meet Kader Asmal while he taught in Trinity College Dublin and before he returned to South Africa.  He was a constant and great advocate in dealing with the difficulties in South Africa.  He always displayed real enthusiasm and determination in arguing that the issues had be addressed.  I met him while he was at Trinity College Dublin and also in the South African Parliament when he Minister for Water Affairs and Forestry.  It was a real privilege to know him and see him being able to return to his country to participate in government, having been a great advocate for the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.</p> <p>Nelson Mandela, as we all know, suffered a very long imprisonment and that takes a toll on family life.  A person is imprisoned for so long at immense personal cost.  The culmination of the racist society in South Africa was the creation of apartheid in 1948.  Thankfully, the South Africa of today that Nelson Mandela was behind is unimaginably different from the one into which he was born.  My party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said yesterday that "to emerge from it without a heart turned to stone is a truly remarkable testament to the man".  That says a lot with regard to the attitude, work and great leadership Nelson Mandela showed when he was released from prison and when he entered government.  The few words we have to say here are in recognition of a truly iconic figure - an international statesman who shone through in great adversity.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of South Africa at this difficult time - a time when they have the opportunity to celebrate his legacy as well as to mourn his passing.</p></speech>

One can think of Gandhi and possibly John F. Kennedy and Pope John XXIII who made a mark that will be there as long as humanity is existence on this planet.  Nelson Mandela is one of those people.  I have been to South Africa on several occasions and have also carried out voluntary work in Namibia and Zambia so I have seen at first hand the influence he had.  The tributes being paid to him by the international community reflect his standing and presence in the world.  South Africa was extremely lucky that somebody like Mandela came along when he did.  Patriotism is often bandied about very easily.  We talk about patriots but if we want to quote a real patriot to his country, Nelson Mandela surely fits that bill more than anyone else.</p><p>  We saw the cruelty and injustice of apartheid in South Africa but we see it to some extent in many countries.  It comes at different levels but one of the most extreme levels in my lifetime was surely that found in South Africa.  We will not forget those who worked with Nelson Mandela.  While he was the main contributor because he was the leader and chief who delivered justice where there was an unjust society, we should also remember those who were with him, supported him and died for what he believed in.  I join my colleagues in remembering the Dunnes Stores strike because I was around when all that happened.  Perhaps we would recognise as well what the Mandate union did at the time in deciding that a stand should be taken on apartheid in South Africa.  </p><p>  Nelson Mandela achieved freedom for his people at extreme cost to his own life.  Few people I know have taken such a stand and devoted their lives.  Perhaps it was sometimes easier to be executed for an issue than to spend 27 years in prison to ensure a positive outcome for his people.  I join others in Fine Gael in paying tribute, as did the Taoiseach yesterday, to the life, work, presence and success of Nelson Mandela.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013121100004#C00300"><p>I welcome the South African ambassador, H.E. Azwindini Jeremiah Dingaan Ndou.  I wish I had the eloquence to articulate or capture in words some of the essence of Nelson Mandela.  Nelson Mandela, or simply "Madiba" or "Tata" to those who those knew him, sadly passed away last week.  He was a man who dominated the end of the 20th century.  He will be remembered across the world as one of the most remarkable, charismatic and principled leaders ever.  Mandela first became politically active when he met Walter Sisulu, the ANC activist, while staying in the township in Johannesburg.  He could have had a comfortable life with his family background and education but he could not sit idly by and watch the discrimination and State-sponsored oppression of the apartheid system.  He was not prepared to live or be treated as a second-class citizen in his own land.  It was on the occasion of Walter Sisulu's 90th birthday celebrations that Mandela said: "What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived.  It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead."</p><p>  Throughout the 1950s, Mandela continued to rise through the ranks of the ANC youth league and finally ended up on the ANC national executive.  Mandela had become convinced with others that the use of violence was justified in the battle to bring down apartheid.  He received military training in Ethiopia in 1962, learning how to use automatic rifles, pistols, mortars, bombs and mines, and was trained in sabotage.  He also travelled to Algeria in 1962 to receive guerilla training in the last days of that country's war against its former colonial ruler France.  He was arrested in South Africa in August 1962 and later sentenced to life in prison.  Thirty-two years ago, Mandela was moved and influenced by Bobby Sands, as were many young people of my generation.  When Bobby Sands died after 66 days on hunger strike, Mandela sent a message of solidarity and support from his prison cell on Robben Island on the day of Sands's funeral.  ANC members were also in attendance in Belfast on that historic day.  Prisoners on Robben Island were later to use the hunger strike weapon to successfully improve their prison conditions.  I am also told that a copy of "Nor Meekly Serve My Time", a book written by three former blanket men, also holds a place of honour in Madiba's study.  </p><p>  During his 27 years in prison, Mandela became a symbol of hope for the majority of the oppressed people in South Africa and those who laboured for freedom, equality and democracy all over the world.  His struggle and aptitude was so wide that when violence and the oppression of the white minority in South Africa were at their peak, the echo of protest could be heard half a world away in Dublin's Henry Street at the Dunnes Stores picket.  I am embarrassed to say that I proudly stood in the picket and supported that cause because it is a bit like people talking about 1916 and those who were in the GPO but numbers of people turned up and we shared the firm belief that an injustice to one is an injustice to all.  </p><p>  Internationalism is important for every struggle.  It brings recognition and allows the world to see injustice being carried out, but it also allows a sharing of experiences and success.  While right-wing conservatives like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan labelled him a terrorist and David Cameron took part in the young Tories' "Hang Mandela" campaign, common men and women were marching, protesting and agitating for his release and the dismantling of the brutal apartheid regime.  That historic day came when Mandela was elected as South Africa's first black president in 1994.  The moment filled the world with hope and optimism.  The rainbow nation was born.</p> <p>Mandela's life story and intellect will never be forgotten and he will continue to inspire those who struggle and strive for freedom, equality, fairness and justice for all.  His long walk to freedom is over but his work continues.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

However, I must confess that I will need to blend my membership of the Labour Party with a personal chronology.  As a 20 year old I left Ireland along with two colleagues.  We hit Africa in late 1969.  Travelling down through Africa to our ultimate destination of South Africa took six and a half months.  This allowed us to absorb the magnificent culture of Africa because we travelled through so many diverse nations.  The only country to which we were refused entry was Rhodesia at the Kariba dam.  We duly went to Kasungula through Botswana and entered South Africa at Francistown.  My political outlook was evolving and becoming clearer.  We were treated in an overly friendly way by a white farming community in Francistown.  I did not quite get it until later that the link was that they as Boers regarded us Irish as their heroes because our common enemy was England.  I lived in South Africa during the apartheid era.  Not only the South African experience but the experience of living in Africa for three to four years committed me to return to Ireland and to enter the world of politics.  The horrors of the apartheid era in South Africa caused me to come back to Ireland and to become politically engaged and ultimately to join the Labour Party.</p><p>  My time in South Africa was a very enlightening and not uneventful experience.  I worked in Alexandra township.  On the way from Johannesburg every morning it was not possible to see Alexandra township because it was covered in fog caused by the burning of cheap coal.  People stood at the hosepipes to collect water.  I spent some time there and then I went to the great leader's land of the Transkei where I spent six months.  It is a most beautiful part of Africa.  Everywhere we went we bonded with very good, decent, progressive Africans, Indians and coloureds.  Mandela was a member of the Xhosa who have a magnificent clicking language.  I remember the dancing of the women, the colour of the traditional dress and the round houses in the spectacular landscape.</p><p>  I eventually moved on but I got in trouble with the security forces.  BOSS was a very active intelligence agency and I am happy to say I paid a very small penalty by spending time in John Vorster Square.  We are honouring the memory of the great leader of the ANC.  I remind the audience that many political activists were incarcerated in John Vorster Square, some of whom were murdered.  People like Imam Abdullah died in 1969, ostensibly by slipping on the stairs, and Ahmed Kamal died in 1971, ostensibly having fallen from a tenth floor window.</p><p>  Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a jail.  As a white person I experienced the brutality of the white, mainly Boer, English-speaking Dutch Reformed Church.  The treatment of the African community was hair-raising and frightening in its viciousness.  The security people stopped people alighting from trains and incarcerated them or sent them back to where they came from.  The vicious pass laws and apartheid destroyed families in Africa.</p><p>  I am honouring the great leader because I could imagine I would be so embittered at the white regime if I were an African, an Asian or a coloured person that I would not have been able to restrain my people.  I offer my greatest respect to the leader of the ANC, a man who managed to create the rainbow country which is today's South Africa.  When we in Ireland look enviously at that country's economy and its economic growth, we see what he achieved in South Africa in such a short time.  He was a man who was unparalleled in the world.</p></speech>

I represent the Independent Deputies and Senators.  I welcome the ambassador.  I offer my deepest sympathy to the family of Nelson Mandela and to the people of South Africa.  His death was a very sad day for that country and also for the international community which held Nelson Mandela in such high regard.  His name is associated with the attributes of courage, freedom, grace, dignity, humour and reconciliation.  He has been a major influence on his own people but also on many Irish people, as previous speakers have said.  I heard about the protests against apartheid when I was a young teenager and I learned about the situation in South Africa.  In 1984, like my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, I am very proud to have been one of those people who joined the picketers.  I worked in Dorset Street at the time and I used to come out every evening after school and do an hour or two on the picket line with the strikers.  It was a very lonely place in 1984 and there was not a lot of support for them.  A gang of us got together and we raised money for the Dunnes Stores strikers.  The ambassador and the South African people acknowledged the role they played.  The name of the shopworkers' trade union was IDATU.  Two good friends of mine were involved in that union, Brendan Archibald and John Mitchell, who were instrumental in bringing that motion on boycotting South African goods through the union's national conference.  Mandela inspired us all to fight discrimination, injustice and inequality.  A group of people who grew up in Ireland were strongly influenced by him.</p><p>  I express my appreciation of his role in and support for the Irish peace process.  I also acknowledge the ambassador's strong support for the conflict resolution proposals to which Deputy Crowe referred.  Mandela was one of the people who pushed for inclusive politics and he supported freedom, democracy and justice.  He knew the hurt of isolation, and he knew the hurt of discrimination and the hurt of racism.  We have witnessed sectarianism on this island.  I thank the ambassador for his role and for the role played by Nelson Mandela in helping us to get out of a very bad mess.  This has not been forgotten and is deeply appreciated.</p><p>  President Obama and President Raul Castro shook hands at yesterday's funeral service.</p> <p>If Nelson Mandela had been alive, he would have had a nice smile for that.  Their two nations had not spoken with each other for more than 50 years.  That they shook hands at his funeral was a message of hope.  I have been to Cuba, where I saw at first hand what the embargo had done to the Cuban people.  I met the families of the Miami Five, for whose release we have been campaigning.  Nelson Mandela would have appreciated the handshake.  I will take this opportunity to ask the Irish Government to use its clout - it supports my position on the embargo - to help bring people from both countries together so that they might reconcile and enjoy their diversity.  This was Nelson Mandela's message.</p><p> We need to develop relationships.  Our history is steeped in imperialism and colonialism.  I saw the stone breakers' yard on Robben Island, but we know the influence of the stone breakers' yard in Kilmainham Gaol, which is one of our top museums.  I noticed that South Africa has also turned Robben Island into a museum.  It is important that we remember those who struggled for freedom, justice and equality down through the centuries.  Nelson Mandela would not be happy if we turned our backs on the Palestinians and other oppressed peoples.</p><p> I remember President Nelson Mandela as someone who loved freedom, justice, democracy and reconciliation.  My colleagues mentioned the Special Olympics, where he supported the rights of people with disabilities.  I thank the ambassador and his people and offer my sympathy and solidarity.</p></speech>

On behalf of myself and the Government and people of South Africa, I wish to express our appreciation to the Chairman and members of the committee for organising this session to pay tribute to former President Nelson Mandela.  We truly appreciate this effort and thank you deeply for keeping our young nation in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.</p><p>  We also want to thank Ireland for the role it played during the anti-apartheid struggle.  Many people here supported not only the campaign to release Mandela but the general struggle against apartheid.  I thank the Irish Government for having agreed to establish a scholarship fund dedicated to bringing ten students every year to Ireland. This scholarship was named after Kader Asmal, who played a key role in mobilising and leading the anti-apartheid movement.  We also appreciate the attendance of the delegation at the memorial service, which included the Dunnes Stores strikers.</p><p>  Former President Mandela lives on as an international icon of the struggle against injustice which was conducted by millions of people across the globe.  We have lost a great patriot and the world has lost an icon.  Our beloved Madiba served our country and the world with distinguished dignity and we will forever remain indebted to him.  He was a great, fearless and compassionate leader whose resilience and charisma made an impact on millions throughout his life.  He cannot be replaced in person, but his legacy of selfless and principled dedication to equality and justice lives on in the minds of South Africans and of all the citizens of the world.  He has left an indelible mark on our society.  He dedicated his life to attaining justice for his people in South Africa, and long after his release from prison he continued to fight for human rights everywhere.</p><p>  His legacy also lives on in South Africa's prudent micro-economic policies and sound fiscal management implemented during his reign as President of the Republic of South Africa.  Under his leadership, South Africa implemented the reconstruction and development programme to address the immense socioeconomic challenges brought about by many years of apartheid.  Almost 20 years after achieving democracy, South Africa is reaping the benefits of the solid foundations laid by former President Mandela's administration to deal with these challenges.  Undoing the damage of the evil apartheid system in a short space of time was never going to be an easy task.  However, the South African Government continues to work to pursue the ideas initiated by former President Mandela to try to deal with the challenges we face.</p><p>  Next year marks the 20th year since we attained democracy in 1994, and we can proudly say that society has been transformed and that the process of transformation has continued in every sphere since then.  Education levels are high and many millions of people now have access to basic services such as water, electricity and sanitation.  This is all the more remarkable since many of these services have been achieved from a very low base in 1994.  We have risen from the ashes of apartheid and stand proud on the world stage.  Our voice and presence is keenly felt at institutions such as the United Nations and the African Union.  We have not allowed our divided past to shape our future and together we have built a new society based on the values of a united, non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa, an ideal that former President Mandela always cherished.  There has been an increase of 47.5% in the number of households using electricity over the past 20 years.</p><p>  This is a time to reflect on the strides we have made in achieving the vision of a better life for all - a vision that former President Mandela has always been passionate about.  Undoubtedly, while much has changed, there are still challenges on which we must work.  The legacy left by former President Mandela will endure and the challenges will continue to be pursued.  We remain committed to forming a society based on equality, freedom and human dignity for all, as fought for by Nelson Mandela and others.   Nelson Mandela's legacy lives on in our democratic dispensation, which he ushered in as the leader of the majority party.  It lives on in the bill of rights enshrined in our constitution and adopted during his presidency.</p><p>  Before I conclude, our thoughts are with Ms Graca Machel and the entire Mandela family as they mourn the loss of a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather who meant a great deal to his family, his nation and the world.  Our thoughts are also with the millions of South Africans and our friends around Ireland and the globe who are collectively mourning the passing of former President Mandela.  We are deeply moved by the good wishes and expressions of support we continue to receive.  He has left an indelible mark on our society.</p> <p>He dedicated his life to attaining justice for his people in South Africa.  His gentle yet unyielding determination for freedom and dignity for every human being earning him love and respect throughout the world, particularly in Ireland.  Having overseen the transition from apartheid to a society built on the pillars of democracy and freedom, his legacy lives on in our commitment to ensure a just and fair society for all, including the rights of dignity and freedom of expression.  </p><p> Although we mourn Madiba's passing, we will take this time to celebrate his life and acknowledge his unwavering commitment to the principles of justice, equality and a non-racial South Africa.  To celebrate his life we need to stay true to his ideals.  All South Africans and all humanity have a responsibility to promote freedom and defend democracy in honour of Madiba's lifelong commitment to those ideals.  We shall continue to address the difficult issues that we face by engaging in dialogue but be mindful that any solution must be of benefit to all.</p><p> We say a special thank you to Madiba's many great friends in Ireland, especially the former members of the anti-apartheid movement, the Dunnes Stores workers, the unions, media, artists, poets and the many ordinary Irish people who campaigned tirelessly for the rights of ordinary people in South Africa.  His friends and comrades in Ireland helped to change our future and our thoughts are with them as they share our loss of a great leader with us.  </p><p> Nelson Mandela inspired us, as a nation, to look towards a brighter future.  Most importantly, he taught us to understand the power of forgiveness.  We salute our beloved hero as we bid him farewell with love and peace in our hearts.  Our greatest gift to the father of our nation is to continue to work together, continue his legacy of peace and reaffirm his vision for equality and dignity for all of the people all over the world.  Let us be true to Nelson Mandela's legacy and remain committed to forming a society based on that principle.  </p><p> Lastly, we give thanks for his life, his leadership, his devotion to humanity and humanitarian causes.  We salute our friend, colleague and comrade.  We thank him for the sacrifices that he made for our freedom.  May his soul rest in peace in eternity.</p></speech>

His death occurred after arrangements had been made for today's meeting.</p><p>  The main purpose for meeting the council is to hear about its report entitled Time to Go? which explores the social and economic impact of youth emigration and its implications for the future.  The council has carried out an in depth study on the subject.  Emigration has been part of life for many in the State, to such an extent that everyone here and their families have been touched by emigration.  Over the past number of months the committee has touched on the issue of emigration reform.  I call on Ms Cunningham to make her presentation.</p></speech>

I will base my input on the research referred to by the Chairman and published last May entitled Time to Go.  It is a qualitative research study that explored the experience and impact of emigration on the current wave of new young emigrants who left Ireland in the past two years and emigrated to the UK and Canada.</p><p>  The study identifies the push and pull factors influencing Ireland&rsquo;s young to emigrate and explores the policy implications of sustained emigration of young people from Ireland.  For details on the background to the research, the research methodology, the key research findings and all of the report's recommendations, I refer the committee to the report that was circulated to Members in advance.  Given the time limitations I shall focus on the most salient and relevant aspects of the research.  There are seven report recommendations but I shall focus on the three most relevant to the work of the committee. They are as follows: the appointment of a ministry with responsibility for responding to and connecting with the Irish abroad; the need to develop and adopt a new strategic approach to meet the needs of new young emigrants; and the needs for centralised and ongoing data collection on emigrants.</p><p>  As the Chairman has said, we all know emigration has become a prevailing part of Irish society.  It is worth reflecting on the statistics in this regard.  According to the most recent estimates compiled by the Central Statistics Office have revealed that 177,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 years of age have left the country over the past five years, and 89,000 people left the State in the year up to April 2013.  At the start of the recession, outward migration was mainly accounted for by workers from new EU member states.  Since 2010 emigration by Irish nationals has increased significantly and now accounts for more than half of total emigration. </p><p>  Data collected by the NYCI has revealed that over the past two years over a quarter of the population has been affected by the emigration of a close family member and 51% of 18 to 24-year olds would consider emigrating.  It is widely acknowledged that the number of people emigrating is concentrated heavily on the youth population.</p><p>  Despite high levels of unemployment, poor labour market status and increasing emigration by Irish nationals, Ireland still receives significant immigration.  </p> <p>Dr. Mary Gilmartin asserts that such immigration reflects a shortage of workers with appropriate skills in some areas.</p><p> Another interesting aspect of the recent data on outward migration is the destination of choice of emigrants.  The data reveal that 24% of emigrants are moving to the United Kingdom, 17.3% to Australia, 16% to the EU-12, 13% to the EU-15 and 6% to Canada.</p><p> I propose to highlight some key findings from a recent study by University College Cork, which was published at the end of September as part of UCC's Emigre project.  The findings are pertinent to the discussion and reinforce some of our findings in respect of the brain drain.  The study found that 62% of recent emigrants hold a third level qualification, which suggests graduates are over-represented among those leaving.  More than 17% of emigrants worked in construction or construction related industry prior and 47% were in full-time employment prior to departure.  Under-employment was a major driving factor, with 13% of emigrants working in part-time jobs before their departure.  Almost 23% of those leaving were unemployed before departing and the vast majority, more than 70%, of emigrants are aged in their 20s when they depart.</p><p> Emigration is a very emotive issue arousing many different feelings, emotions and perspectives.  When it comes to the topic of emigration there is a tendency to bemoan the fact of emigration, dwell on how terrible emigration is and deny that for some emigration is an escape from unemployment and limited opportunities at home.  Our research reveals this journey often has many twists and turns and highs and lows and that it can be a positive or negative experience.  Regardless of how we perceive emigration, we have a responsibility to support emigrants before and after they leave, maintain links with our citizens abroad and facilitate their return in future if they so wish. </p><p> Two key points contained in the analysis of the Time to Go? report were the social and economic implications of large-scale youth emigration.  Notwithstanding the significant social costs of emigration, which are outlined in great detail in chapter 8 of the report, emigration costs the State money in the long term.  While it may temporarily help alleviate the problem of unemployment, in the long term the prevalence of large-scale emigration produces a significant loss to the State in terms of the public funds invested in the education system and the brain drain of highly skilled and educated young people.  Any future upturn in the economy requires a pool of well-educated young people to attract investment and stimulate and sustain economic growth.  The question of how to reduce the loss and increase the gain to the economy as a result of emigration is a key policy issue that requires further consideration.  Moreover, for those young people left with no option but to emigrate, every effort should be made to attract them back to Ireland when jobs in the labour market arise.  I will return to this point.</p><p> On the impact of demographic changes arising from emigration, the estimates of the numbers currently emigrating are alarming as they indicate that if emigration continues at the current pace, it will result in a significant change in the age structure of the population.  Prior to the economic crisis, Ireland exhibited one of the largest youth cohorts in the OECD, with young people accounting for 16% of the population.  As a result of rising emigration, this figure currently stands at 12%.  This alteration in the age structure, combined with an ageing population, has profound and long-term consequences for many aspects of social policy.  For example, in the case of pensions the ratio of people of working age to people of pension age is expected to fall.  The increase in life expectancy and in the number of people of retirement age will call into question the sustainability of funding State pensions to an adequate level.  </p><p> How should the Government respond?  The State must continue to work towards economic recovery to provide a stable economic environment that can attract migrants back when the economy recovers.  One of the positive aspects of emigration is that many young people who emigrate acquire skills and knowledge while abroad.  The vast majority of young people interviewed in our study expressed a strong desire to return if job opportunities become available to them.  The improved skills and expertise they possess have the potential to provide a significant return to the State.  This needs to be recognised and harnessed.  The Government needs to maximise the rate of return of emigrants when the economy starts to improve.  Not only does this make economic sense but it is vital for future economic growth and the social fabric. </p><p> I will focus on the three recommendations of our reports that are of relevance to the remit of the joint committee.  The first is the recommendation to appoint a Minister with responsibility for responding to and connecting with the Irish abroad.  The research highlights the need for the Government to ensure greater connections are made and sustained with young people who are leaving the country.  Emigrants suggested one way of responding would be to appoint a Minister with responsibility for connecting with the Irish abroad.  The Minister would have specific responsibility for ensuring long-term planning in the development of public policies, responding to the needs of emigrants and liaising with key public employment services to facilitate return migration to fill gaps in the labour market as they arise in future.</p><p> Engaging with the diaspora was thought by research participants in the Time to Go? study to be extremely important.  One emigrant proposed that the Government ensure greater connections are made and sustained with young people who are leaving the country.  In the absence of local or national representation of the Irish abroad, the appointment of a dedicated Minister to respond to and connect with our emigrants and diaspora is extremely important.  Aside from the moral imperative to meet the needs of emigrants, a Ministry of this nature would also benefit Ireland greatly in terms of exploiting the potential social and economic gains that can be derived from emigration.  When one considers that approximately 70 million people of Irish heritage and 1.2 million Irish born citizens live overseas the argument supporting the appointment of a Minister for the Irish overseas becomes most compelling.  Such an appointment would serve to greatly enhance and build on existing connections with our emigrants and diaspora throughout the world.  This is even more relevant in the current context of large-scale emigration of young people, many of whom wish to be included in Irish life and society and return home some day if they have an opportunity to do so.  I cannot emphasise enough the extent to which we need these highly educated and skilled young people to return. </p><p> The second key recommendation is to develop and adopt a new strategic approach to meet the needs of young emigrants.  The Government needs to develop and implement a new strategy for emigrants.  The strategy requires an action plan and the necessary supports to take account of the diversity of needs and provide structural supports at home to inform and assist young people who are emigrating.  The strategy must also include ways of incentivising emigrants to return when the economy recovers.  It is vital that the State develop a long-term plan which is responsive to changes in migration and demography and the needs of those who have emigrated.  It should, for example, provide for adequate housing and social services that are equipped to respond to returning migrants.  Ireland should not be complacent about return migration.  In its recent report, the OECD cautioned that "international competition to attract workers with specialised skills has become fiercer and the automatic return of migrant workers should not be taken for granted".</p><p> The third recommendation relates to data collection and the need to inform a public policy response and strategy.  Reliable and robust data on the profile of emigrants have been absent to date.  Data collection and profiling is integral to future policy planning and the maintenance of good links with our citizens abroad.  While the recent UCC Emigre study has contributed significantly to addressing the data deficit, a commitment is needed that such data will be collected on an ongoing basis and will be used to inform a policy response.  A more long-term policy perspective must be incorporated in policy planning to take account of changes in demography and migration. </p><p> Tracking emigrants and investing in the facilitation of return migration could reduce the risks of a permanent loss of valuable qualified workers from the labour market.  As I noted, more robust data on the profile of emigrants is required.  </p><p> Emigration needs to be recognised as having a significant impact on society and the economy.  While it is often considered as a panacea to addressing the problem of unemployment in the short to medium term, it should be recognised that in the long term, the impact of emigration can cause significant problems in terms of skill and labour shortages, salary costs and long-term economic growth. </p><p> Our research on youth unemployment reaffirms the importance of prioritising emigration in all aspects of public policy.  The way in which we respond to prospective and current emigrants and support them before and after they leave Ireland will determine the type of country we will have.  Our recommendations are informed by the qualitative research on the experience of young Irish people who have emigrated.  It is important that we listen to them, learn from their experience and take on board their advice on meeting the needs of the current wave of emigrants.</p> <p>We acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment to reviewing the existing policy on emigrants and developing a new global diaspora policy, which we understand will include a focus on meeting the needs of new young emigrants.  We believe such a strategic review of policy has the potential to respond to the changing needs of younger and older Irish emigrants and our diaspora throughout the world.  The development of such a policy requires the support and commitment of all political parties and sufficient resources to ensure it is fully implemented.  Such a policy should provide for rigorous review and monitoring to ensure it is effective.  A new global diaspora policy is not only timely but also provides an opportunity to consider how we respond to the needs of Irish emigrants throughout the world.  We welcome the initiation of this policy review by the T&aacute;naiste and his officials in the Irish abroad unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We look forward to contributing significantly to the formulation of a new strategic policy framework in 2014.</p></speech>

There is no doubt the timing of her appearance before this committee is very good.  We will hold hearings on the foreign policy review in the new year.  We will take her comments on board in that context.  We are reviewing our foreign policy at an important time.  Given that so many Irish people are living abroad, it is obvious that the diaspora should play an important role in that review.  When the economy recovers, it will be important for them to come back.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McAleer for her presentation.  The briefing material we have been given is very comprehensive.  I do not think there is much in the presentation that we could disagree with.  During the Seanad referendum campaign, when we debated the role of a second House of Parliament, it was pointed out that a clear and obvious opportunity exists to appoint someone to the Seanad to represent the diaspora.  It would be a way of keeping the concerns, issues and challenges facing people who emigrate on the political agenda in the Oireachtas.  I do not know whether a Government Department should be established.  The Taoiseach of the day always faces pressure to establish specific Departments depending on the issues challenging the country at a particular time.  There are obvious merits to this proposal.  I would think, on the basis of my experience of attending embassy functions abroad, that young people do not engage with the embassy network as much as the older generation.  It is generally the older cohort of people who attend such events.  Maybe there is a difficulty in encouraging some of our young people to engage.  Perhaps there is a lack of effort on the part of the embassy network.  I do not know.  I would be very reluctant to criticise our diplomatic network anywhere in the world.  It does a fine job for our country.  A better form of connection is probably needed.</p><p>  I presume the unit for the Irish abroad that has been proposed would target a number of specific areas and would engage with and assist people.  We are all aware of the various societies and clubs in cities such as Birmingham, London and Coventry, as well as in the United States.  They often assist older people who do not have any immediate family support, or who need financial assistance during challenging periods in their lives.  There is a GAA club in almost every part of the world, thankfully.  The overseas branch of the GAA is almost like a formalised network for Irish people.  One could see a Clare or Cavan jersey in any part of the world.  The Clare jersey is very popular this year.  I welcome the visibility of those jerseys.  I know from many of the young emigrants to whom I have spoken that the GAA club has really become a focal point of their lives.  It provides sporting activity and helps them to make friends.</p><p>  Ms McAleer has outlined the type of work that a Government Department in this area could engage in if such a Department were to be established.  I am reminded of the Department of Labour that existed until the early 1990s.  It dealt with labour relations and labour market policy.  It was merged with the old Department of Industry and Commerce to become the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I think Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was the first Minister in the new Department in the early 1990s.  Perhaps there is a case for doing some further work to assess the value of the old type of administrative structure that existed in this country when the Department of Labour was in place.  I was struck by one or two of the statistics mentioned by Ms McAleer in this context.  According to her submission:<blockquote>47% of emigrants were in fact employed in full-time jobs before leaving.  Just under 40% of these emigrants left because they wanted to travel and to experience another culture.  These were often people with qualifications that other countries coveted, such as valuable IT skills or health professionals.</blockquote>To my knowledge, we have a shortage of workers in many of those areas.  Ms McAleer mentioned that a great deal of the immigration into this country is related to the attractiveness of the job opportunities that are available here.  It is apparent that there is a mismatch between our training and labour market policies.  Perhaps a greater focus on this area is needed.</p><p>  Ms McAleer made it clear that our emigrants need support as they leave our shores, on a constant basis while they are abroad and - hopefully - as they prepare to return.  All of us realise that the best programme of assistance that could be offered to any potential emigrant would come in the form of job opportunities.  We are all conscious of that.  The Chairman and some members of this committee recently visited the United States to seek further support for the immigration reform Bill that has been proposed there.  To the knowledge of Ms McAleer, are we active in this area?  The visa policies of Canada and Australia can make it difficult for some people who wish to emigrate to get into those countries.  Difficulties can also be encountered by people whose visas expire while they are in those countries.  I know that particular hardship was imposed on some young people who had to leave employment out there and return home even though there appeared to be plenty of job opportunities in the sectors they were working in.</p><p>  Ms McAleer's work is very welcome.  This material will be of great value to us as we reflect on the need to support our emigrants.  I come from a very rural community.  We are conscious that many people in the age cohort mentioned by Ms McAleer are leaving.  We see the much-reduced panels that are available to football and hurling clubs and other sporting organisations.  This is a huge challenge for the country.  Support is needed.  The creation of job opportunities here would be the most successful way of eliminating the difficulties faced by so many of those people.  I thank Ms McAleer again for her presentation and welcome her work in this regard.</p></speech>

I hope I do not repeat what Deputy Smith said on this issue.  Ms McAleer mentioned that a quarter of the population had been affected by emigration.  I think this is an indictment of the political system and of us all.  Youth unemployment and emigration are the two biggest issues and challenges facing Ireland.  The difference between Ireland and the rest of Europe is that emigration is not as significant a factor elsewhere.  Ms McAleer mentioned many of the destinations to which many young people are going.  Does she see a pattern there?  Many young people go to Australia or Canada because they know someone there.  There is a pattern of going to countries where the English language is spoken.</p></speech>

When the CEO of Glen Dimplex spoke at the jobs committee recently, he referred to difficulties associated with Australia being so far away.  He was talking about children going abroad.  Around 1 million jobs are available in Germany.  That never comes on the radar, even though Germany is just 2 or 3 hours from Dublin and the rest of Ireland.  Why do people not emigrate to Germany?  Is it simply a question of the language barrier?  I ask Ms McAleer to comment on that.</p><p>  We have heard about how difficult it can be to settle in a new country.  What is Ms McAleer's view on the level of support that new emigrants receive from the Government?  Could the embassies be doing more to assist them?  In what way could they be of assistance?  My party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, recently brought out a report about his meeting with Australian trade unions.</p> <p>Again, it concerned the difficulties faced by young people going to Australia.  It was about rights.  The information was helpful because we do not want people to be exploited.  It dealt with basic stuff like if one rented somewhere in Australia, one did not have furniture.  Could we do more in that respect?  Ms McAleer spoke about difficulties in the United Kingdom.  She spoke about opening a bank account.  Could she explain it a little more because we have Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and others there?  She also spoke about voting rights.  Is there strong support among emigrants in this regard?  The issue came up during the presidential election and a number of parties, including mine, tried to put it down. I agree with the idea of having seats within the Seanad.  How important is this issue to emigrants?  </p><p> In respect of the information pack on Australia, did this issue come up among respondents in Canada and the United Kingdom?  Would such a pack be useful for those going to these countries?  How would it be distributed?  If one starts to give people information, is one encouraging them to go?  I notice that in the five year plan many talk about returning to Ireland if the economy improves.  I suppose it is natural for young unmarried emigrants to want to return to their home country.  It is everyone's aspiration.  I heard people who had come back during the boom say in interviews that they felt let down about the fact that they had left a really good life behind.  How could we improve the position?  </p><p> Will Ms McAleer expand on some of the different issues, particularly the difficulties arising in the United Kingdom?  Opening a bank account is getting more and more difficult, even for people in Ireland, but I would have thought it was simple.  There were also difficulties in this area in the United States.  Is there a role for banks in this regard?</p></speech>

I agree entirely with her analysis and think she has done a very good job.  There are lessons for all of us.  First, we need to focus on the future needs of a growing population, something we have never really done in this country.  We have moved from boom to bust in a series of crises over a number of years and never made real provision for the future.  We need to make provision for a bigger population.  We need to identify the skills available and that are required and marry the two.  We also need to diversify the way in which we create jobs and their placement.  There are large areas of the country that never see a job created, particularly the rural areas referred to.  In today's world of high technology, it is much easier to locate jobs with a high IT skills requirement in places that do not have a large amount of infrastructure provided they have Internet access and meet other electronic requirements.  We know that there are more opportunities in more populated places.  That creates its own ongoing social problems through a convergence of the population in particular areas.  We have learned so many lessons in my lifetime that I wonder when we will have qualified and achieved some academic status in that regard.  </p><p> In a former incarnation as a Minister of State, I liaised with Irish associations in Boston, New York and Camden in London.  It is heart-rending when one meets people, some of whom are not so young anymore.  Some have integrated, while others have not.  Some look back to the country they left and think it remains as it was, even though both it and the world in which we live have changed vastly.  We need to recognise that we live in a challenging global economy, that people are coming here and filling positions that we do not always fill and that they will continue to do so.  We must expect this to happen, as it is their right in a global economy.  We need to have the skills required, prepare people to be available for the jobs that are available in the economy and make sure there is the investment to have an ongoing stream of employment.  </p><p>  The population of the island will grow to at least ten million in the next 20 years.  I predicted this and it is already on course to happen.  Twenty years ago I predicted where the population was heading.  The population of this part of the island is almost double what it was in 1956 when it had a population of 2.56 million or thereabouts.  We have moved quite a distance since.  With that movement there is the challenge of making provision.  I have referred to the creation of job opportunities, but housing is another issue that is of huge importance for young people.  Sadly, after the boom and bust, we are not providing it.  Fr. Peter McVerry was on television last week and correctly identified that young people were being squeezed out.  Owning their own house or renting it from a local authority is a basic aspiration for all young people.  We have been told that we should be like the rest of Europe and depend on the private rental market.  Sadly, as it has failed to deliver, we need to address the issue.  With a house goes security.  As somebody has to build it, there is a job for somebody in building it.  At least one job will be provided in the building of a house.  This may seem separate from what we are talking about, but it is very relevant because we all see those affected in our clinics every weekend.  Young people and young families come crying because they have nowhere to go.  That is a sad reflection on our society.  </p><p>  The report produced by Ms McAleer is excellent.  It focuses on the issues that have been determined.  I am not so sure Ms McAleer would get the post of Minister of State with responsibility for the Diaspora.  I think some Minister who is already overburdened will have to take on that responsibility.  He or she could and should do so and liaise with relevant parties.  I am not sure there is a great surge of support for votes for emigrants, although we have tossed the idea around from time to time.  We need to recognise emigrants, be there for them, look over their shoulders and look straight between the two eyes at all times to recognise that they may or may not be abroad permanently.  Our objective should be to create a place for them if they wish to come back.</p></speech>

It is fascinating because it is so relevant to Irish society.  I do not know whether we can tease it out with the delegation and get an opinion from it.  It might have heard me say I left Ireland in 1969 and arrived in Africa in 1970.  The three of were tradesmen - an electrician, a plumber and a carpenter.  The reason I am highlighting this issue relates to the term "emigrant".  Was I an emigrant?  I felt we were adventurers - three people who wanted to see the world.  The report states 47% of emigrants are employed full time, which was the position we were in in 1969.  Just under 40% had left because they wanted to travel and experience another culture.  One could almost read me into that statistic, but I never saw myself as an emigrant.  I wonder, therefore, whether there is a definition.  Are those of us who travel automatically labelled as emigrants because we might only go with a view to spending some years away and then returning?  It is even more complex than this.  </p><p>  The delegation might have noticed that the Immigrant Council of Ireland has a 24 hour picket outside Leinster House.  I went and spoke to people on it.</p> <p>There are as many as 30,000 undocumented workers here and 50,000 undocumented Irish in America.  Most of the undocumented in this country are in employment and enjoying their lives.  We live in a global world and emigration today is nothing like that when I was a kid.  Because of the peaks and troughs in the construction industry my uncles emigrated.  There were great movements of people from County Donegal to Northern Ireland, for example.  This is now one of the member states of the European Union.  I might be falling into the same trap as the Minister for Finance - if it is a trap - but I have a daughter in London and a daughter in America.  They are my only children.  Are they emigrants?  They are both highly educated, having left Ireland to pursue third level studies in London.  They are economically viable and happy and can return at Christmas.  They may wish to return to Ireland one day or they may not.</p><p> I will recite an interesting story.  When I was a member of the then Eastern Health Board, we all heard the complaints about nurses being educated and then leaving the country.  It was a matter of how to balance their desire and right to emigrate with the policy to recruit Filipino nurses to take their places.  We can no longer regard the global movement of people in the same light as the poor, unskilled labourer arriving in London to build roads and railways and ending up impoverished and living in hostels and digs.  Nowadays, our educated workers are packing in their jobs. </p><p> I agree with and support three of the recommendations made.  I have not read all five recommendations.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Joint Committee on European Affairs are examining our foreign affairs policy.  I have covered a number of elections in other countries.  To our eternal shame, countries that were criticised, including Ukraine or Romania, open their embassies on election day to facilitate their citizens living outside the country.  Despite our proclaimed love and understanding of the Diaspora, we do not allow them to vote in general or presidential elections.  There is a case to be made to engage more seriously with the Diaspora, the members of which are a tremendous asset.  We are not unique.  It was noticeable that many Chinese were among the marchers today.  Two thirds of the Chinese who leave China to study or work never return.  The Chinese Government knows this is a loss to the country. </p><p> Why are people going as far away as Australia or Canada when we have the beautiful European Union of 28 countries?  Is it question of language?  I ask for an explanation of the figures which show a figure of 16% for the EU 12 and 30% for the EU 15.  </p><p> The Chairman led a delegation to represent the undocumented Irish in America at a time when there are 30,000 undocumented people outside the door here.  These 30,000 people have the right to register and vote in local elections.  I hope the work of the delegates will be further debated.</p></speech>

I am fascinated by the study because I was involved in developing the first policy paper by any political party on the Irish overseas.  One of the recommendations was to have a Minister for the Diaspora.  Many countries with a diaspora smaller than ours have dedicated ministries.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy &Eacute;amon Gilmore, has also spoken on this matter in recent times.  I tie this suggestion with the delegation's third recommendation on data collection.  Someone has to be in charge of collecting the data and the Irish abroad unit could be central in this regard.</p><p>  Members have spoken on the issue of voting rights for emigrants.  The shocking fact is that what was proposed at the Constitutional Convention was the lowest form of expression of democracy.  Giving a vote in a presidential election, an office which is largely ceremonial, represents the lowest form in the democratic world.  Of the 186 countries in the world, 121 give a vote to the diaspora.  Only eight restrict the vote to presidential elections, but these eight countries have an executive president.  Ireland is considering giving the Diaspora a vote in a presidential election, a ceremonial office.  I refer to the executive power held by President Obama.  We are considering what is the least we could do, yet we are hesitating.</p><p>  Of more immediate value to the Diaspora would be having a Minister in charge of co-ordinating the work of various Departments to ensure the rights and concerns of the Diaspora are dealt with.  For example, I refer to the particular issue of driving licences for Irish people moving to Canada.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport informs the authorities in Ottawa that it does not deal at sub-national level.  Ottawa and British Columbia are bigger than Ireland and have larger populations.  Each province in Canada has its own driving licence system, yet the Department has no interest in dealing with Irish emigrants.  This illustrates the need for a Minister to undertake that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would deal with the issue of driving licences in Canada for Irish emigrants.</p><p>  I commend the work done in compiling the information contained in the report and know how difficult it is to compile information which can be hard to find.  The report suggests one agency should deal with the data required.  Every party should commit to the appointment of a Minister for the Diaspora in advance of the next election.  When the manifestos are merged, it is to be hoped a ministerial office could be created, whether with a Minister of State or a full Cabinet Minister.  It is essential to engage with the resource that is the Diaspora because otherwise it is a loss to Ireland and a loss for Irish people abroad.</p></speech>

I had to smile at the notion of a ministry for the Diaspora.  I remember the national outcry when the Department of Social Protection wrote to people telling them about jobs in some other country - I cannot remember which but perhaps it was Germany or somewhere else.  There was an uproar that the Government was trying to get people to emigrate.  There is a danger that such a ministry would be seen as encouraging emigration.  However, I take the point being made by the delegation.  </p><p>  I agree with the proposal to have a person to negotiate on behalf of the Diaspora on the issues of driving licences and passports.  </p><p>  Deputies Eric Byrne and Bernard J. Durkan raised a point on the validity of the notion behind emigration, about which I also thought.</p> <p>This is not to deny that there is involuntary emigration; there is, although my children chose to go in the good times.  They might have liked to return but they cannot.  There is still voluntary emigration, but there is definitely involuntary emigration; there is no point in denying that.  Even for them it is a different concept.  We have immigration and emigration.  The word "emigration" has connotations that no longer seem relevant, particularly in a global economy where we in Europe see mobility as a good thing and something we strive towards.  It raises questions about how we discuss emigration.</p><p> Unlike the emigrants of long ago, many emigrants are educated and well able to look after their own needs when they go abroad, but there are some needs that must be looked after by a national government.  If we could look after their needs at home, we would not have emigration.  The best thing we can do for emigrants is to stop the need for involuntary emigration by providing jobs at home.  That is the ultimate aim of what the NYCI is talking about.  I have no questions about that.  Collecting data and knowing what is happening and the movement of people is vital for planning for ourselves and our immigrants and emigrants, so it is a worthwhile document and discussion.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

They have done the State some service by producing this very thought-provoking study.  There is much in it that we probably knew already, but it is very useful to see it in print and set out in an easily-read format.  Deputy Durkan spoke about some parts of the country suffering from emigration much more than others.  I am from Ballinasloe in County Galway, where the surrounding areas have lost significant numbers of manufacturing jobs in the past decade.  Many of the small towns and villages in that locality have been decimated by emigration.  Many of the people who have gone have done well but many yearn to return to Ireland in the future.  There is an onus on the Government in this regard, and I am glad to see it devoting such major attention to job creation.  I have a number of family members in Australia, who are doing well, but some of them keep inquiring of me whether things are improving because they hope to return to Ireland to work in the future.  One of the important points in the report is the significant change in age structure in the country.  We could fast become a nation of elderly and very young people.  There will be a lost generation if we do not accelerate the creation of employment.</p><p>  Improvements in ICT and communications have brought about a much better situation than was experienced by people who emigrated many years ago.  Family members overseas say they probably speak to parents and other relatives more often now than they did when they were at home.  It is important that we keep that connection.  I support the idea of having a Minister of State who would connect with emigrants and the Irish diaspora.  I hope our Ministers will go abroad in the future and try to attract many of those people to return to fill key positions in companies here.  I would especially like to see this connection between the Minister and emigrants who are faring less well than the well educated, highly skilled people who have emigrated.  There are many, as we know, in communities in the UK and other parts of the world who have not been so fortunate and who have suffered from problems with drink and addiction, and all the problems we have at home.  I am concerned that those people do not have the backup and services they need.  It is important for them to have a Minister.</p><p>  Our embassies are stretched but I would like there to be encouragement of a greater connection between our emigrants abroad and the embassies in those countries.  I could not disagree with the suggestion about data collection.  That should be much easier to do now because of technology.  On votes for emigrants, there is a logistical issue and there are problems and difficulties there.<b></b> I welcome the fact that there is a commitment to give emigrants a vote in presidential elections in the future.  We can start from there and hopefully progress that further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie-Claire McAleer" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013121100013#M00300"><p>There are many questions.  I thank the members for their comments.  The question on destinations that are English-speaking raise a very significant issue.  In ten minutes it is very difficult to summarise a dense report, but one of the key issues that arose in the research was the need to promote foreign languages at secondary and third level so that Irish people have the linguistic skills to compete for work both nationally and internationally.  An example was highlighted by an emigrant who said there are Irish people who have first-class business degrees who cannot take jobs in Ireland because they do not have the language skills.  It is a very significant issue and is the reason many people opt for English-speaking countries such as Canada and Australia.</p><p>  Emigration is extremely complex, as our summary of the key findings highlight.  Many people go abroad to experience new horizons and access greater opportunities, particularly while young, but the limited employment options and the lack of opportunities at home were cited as the determining factor prompting their decision to leave.  The question "What is an emigrant?" is interesting.  The people who participated in this study regarded themselves as emigrants.  Many said that if there had been work for them at home they would not be abroad, although some were more open to it than others.  They felt there was a disconnect between Ireland and their experience as emigrants abroad and felt there needed to be a greater link between Ireland and its diaspora.  They said it felt very much as though, when they were going, it was a case of "Goodbye and good luck," and nobody really cared what happened.</p><p>  Deputy Smith touched on Irish networks and support.  These were highlighted in great detail and the report found them to be of tremendous value to many emigrants.  The GAA and the London-Irish centres were mentioned, among others.  They provided not only companionship and networks of Irish friends, but they were also a great support for people in good times and in bad.</p> <p> The Irish abroad unit funds some fantastic initiatives in host countries.  I profiled one relatively new example, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre, which receives seed funding from the emigrant support programme.  The centre was established largely by people who had emigrated in the 1970s and came together to provide some support to immigrants.  It provides very good information on how to adapt to the Canadian labour market, transform an Irish curriculum vitae into a Canadian r&eacute;sum&eacute; and prepare for the differences in the recruitment process in Canada, which has a different labour market from Ireland.  It also provides crucial advice and assistance on visas, heath requirements and many other issues.  Young emigrants described the service as fantastic but noted it would have been even better if this type of resource had been available to them before they left Ireland.  There are many similar organisations receiving funding from the State.  We recognise that an infrastructure is in place.  The issue is to ensure we build on it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1277" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Cunningham" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013121100014#N00200"><p>Deputy Crowe asked whether providing information encourages people to emigrate.  It is necessary to have a mature conversation about emigration and the shame that has been associated with it historically.  We need to grow up in that regard and respond to the reality of the lives of young people.  Emigration is a reality and people emigrate for positive and less positive reasons.  We need to embrace it as it is part of the reality of young people's lives.  What information do young people need to ensure they are well equipped before they go abroad?  This point was highlighted by the assumption many emigrants made that their qualifications would transfer to their destination.  They did not realise, for example, that it costs a significant amount of money to have one's qualifications verified in Canada.  Those who do not receive sufficient financial support from parents or family members to complete this process can find themselves on the back foot.</p><p>  On bank accounts, I do not know if members have tried to open an additional bank account here.  Even when one approaches the same bank, it can appear that one does not exist as one must produce utility bills and so forth.  This also applies in the United Kingdom in cases where a person seeks to open an account in the same branch of a bank where he or she has a bank account.  Problems then arise because people cannot get an address or receive a utility bill until they have a bank account.  Addressing this issue should be a matter for discussion. </p><p>  Young people are also finding it very difficult to obtain a contract for a telephone because many of them do not have a credit history.  Practical information on these types of issues would make life much easier for emigrants.  We all have family members abroad.  Even those who are well qualified are finding that life is not the bed of roses they had anticipated, particularly in Australia where the cost of living is crippling.  While emigrants may not be living in digs, they often stay in hostels for long periods. </p><p>  On Deputy Brendan Smith's point, many emigrants will ask what would be their first point of contact if they encountered a problem.  For many of them, the first point of contact is not the Irish embassy but the local GAA club.  That is not to detract from the excellent work being done by Irish embassies.  Nevertheless, they could do more to reach out in a more proactive manner and make themselves available to young people, not specifically those facing a dire problem but simply letting people know they are available.  The GAA network overseas has great strength and young people take with them from their home communities a strong connection with the GAA.  One finds the young people from certain villages and towns often congregate in the same place abroad for the same reason.  Young people left behind in Ireland will travel to X, Y or Z town in a foreign country because it is where people from their home town are located.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie-Claire McAleer" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013121100014#N00300"><p>I draw members' attention to some of the key findings at the end of the report.  Ms Cunningham referred to the perception that people will walk into a job when in many cases it takes between six and eight weeks to secure employment abroad.  The accreditation of Irish qualifications is a major issue.  I am heartened by some of the members' comments in respect of establishing a dedicated Ministry.  One of the reasons for this recommendation was the representation of issues pertaining to Irish people abroad and the absence of voting.  Incidentally, voting was not a major issue in our research and does not inform a substantive part of our policy agenda.  However, many stakeholders have done substantial work in this field.  I am aware from the Emigre study that there is significant support for extending the vote to emigrants in presidential elections.</p><p>  The major issue we encountered was that no one at home was representing Irish youth who were living abroad.  In that regard, no one is co-ordinating a policy response.  Emigration cuts across a number of Departments.  In such a vacuum, the appointment of a dedicated Minister would be a means of connecting with people abroad.  The other issue is that we need young people to return.  Many have indicated they are open to returning, with 39.5% of respondents stating they would like to return and 22% expressing the view that it was unlikely they would return but the decision would depend on economic circumstances.  As one respondent stated, there is a window during which one may or may not return and the decision will depend on what type of attractions are available, what the State is doing and what their personal circumstances are.  If we do not have data on the people leaving and do not know their profile or where they are going, how can we possibly attract them back if jobs become available?</p><p>  To reverse the issue of providing information about work opportunities abroad, would it not be nice if, when an engineering position arises, we had information about an engineer who had emigrated to Canada and could e-mail him or her, asking that he or she consider returning?  This option is not available without data.</p><p>  The issue is one of building on current infrastructure, providing people with information and maintaining links with emigrants.  I concur with the point that the most vulnerable emigrants need most assistance. </p></speech>

A delegation of the committee visited some Irish emigrant centres.  Any time members have travelled abroad, the local embassy has arranged a function for us attended by many Irish people who have registered with them.  They also use GAA clubs and other centres for emigrants.</p><p>  The Government provides substantial funding to overseas emigration centres.  The Emerald isle and Aisling centres in New York and other centres in London receive funding.  We visit these centres when we travel abroad because it is important to connect with the diaspora to the greatest possible extent.  I give the ambassadors and consul generals a thumb's up for the work they do in connecting with the diaspora.  </p><p>  Ms McAleer makes a valid point on job vacancies.  Connect Ireland has been a successful initiative aimed at attracting people abroad to come home and establish a business.  While there is much that we can do, much is also being done.  The resources of our embassies are limited and there is only so much that can be done.</p><p>  I commend the National Youth Council of Ireland on the work it is doing and hope many of its recommendations will be taken on board in the review.  I thank the witnesses for engaging in an energetic and lively conversation on the task facing the joint committee.  Irish people living abroad are very important to us.</p> <p>With Christmas coming, some members of the diaspora who return will not be going abroad again.  The statistics are there - jobs are being created, the rate of unemployment is decreasing and some people are coming home.  Clearly, however, there is still a significant challenge.  The work being done by the National Youth Council of Ireland is valuable and we will takes its opinions on board.  I thank our guests for attending.</p></speech>

Petition No.48/12 from Mr. Patrick Martin, claiming that his father was murdered in disputed circumstances in 1979.  Additionally, the petitioner alleges corruption on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in reporting the death of his father, together with collusion between the Garda, the attending doctor, the Coroner and the County Registrar.  The petition is deemed to be inadmissible under the committee's standing orders in that it names individuals, contains language which is in the nature of being defamatory, is asking the D&aacute;il to do something which it does not have the power to do and is asking the committee to consider an individual complaint which has already been determined by a District Court and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p> <p> Petition No. 37/2012 is from Mr. Jimmy Ryan who claims that at his original assault trial and subsequent appeal the Director of Public Prosecutions introduced allegedly incorrect fingerprint evidence.  The petitioner is seeking the assistance of the committee in clearing his name.  The decision of the committee is that the petition is deemed to be inadmissible under Standing Orders in that it requests the D&aacute;il to do something it does not have the power to do.  In addition, it asks the committee to consider an individual complaint which has been the subject of a decision by a body established for the purposes of redress.</p><p> The reason we have a number of inadmissible petitions today is we had a backlog.  We have since received legal advice on the matters involved and, therefore, are now able to deal with them together.  It may seem negative that we are deeming a number of petitions to be inadmissible, but that is the nature of how we deal with our work at times.</p><p> Petition No. 46/2012 is from Mr. Matthew Vincent Smith who claims he was wrongfully convicted of assault in circumstances where a garda had allegedly lied under oath.  He is seeking the assistance of the committee in having his conviction for assault overturned and the garda in question fired.  The decision of the committee is that the petition is deemed to be inadmissible under Standing Orders in that it requests the D&aacute;il to do something it does not have the power to do.  In addition, it asks the committee to consider an individual complaint which has been the subject of a decision by a body established for the purposes of redress.</p><p> Petition No. 80/2012 is from Mr. Kevin Tracey who claims he was the victim of an assault by a garda and that subsequently the same garda accused him of assault on another individual and charges were brought against the petitioner.  He is alleging that he was charged with assault as a result of making a complaint to the Garda Complaints Board.  This matter has been dealt with by the courts.  The decision of the committee is that the petition is deemed to be inadmissible under Standing Orders in that it asks the committee to consider an individual complaint which has already been determined by the courts.</p><p> In regard to petition No. 48/2012, the committee has adjudicated that the petition is inadmissible and, following legal advice, we have agreed that we wish to return the documents submitted in accordance with section 92(4) of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 to avoid a scenario in the future where the petitioner may seek to claim privilege over said documents. </p><p> Petition 26/2013 is from Mr. Jim Beirne.  The petition stems from a county council's interpretation of a planning application fee calculation and the subsequent invalidation of a planning application by the petitioner.  The petitioner is of the opinion that not all county councils are charging the same planning fees as set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  The petitioner took his complaint to the Ombudsman who investigated the matter and made a ruling on it.  The decision of the committee is that the petition is deemed to be inadmissible under Standing Orders in that it asks the committee to consider an individual complaint which has been the subject of a decision by the Ombudsman or a body established for the purposes of redress.</p><p> We now have a fast-track system to deal with matters that have been adjudicated on by a court or the Ombudsman.  It will not be the committee's role to second guess these bodies and in the future we will relay that information promptly to petitioners.  We apologise if people were waiting for considerable periods.  In the future we will make it clear to petitioners that where matters have been decided by a court or the Ombudsman, we have no legal right to second guess the decision.</p><p> Petition No. 24/2013 is from Mr. Kevin Sharkey and concerns recruitment policy at RTE.  The decision of the committee is to write to RTE inviting it to respond to the assertions and allegations made by Mr. Sharkey.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. 18/2013 is from Ms Margaret Gilbert of Gillygordan and Crossroads Youth Club in County Donegal and seeks legislation against cyberbullying and anonymous websites.  The petitioners are seeking legislation to make cyberbullying a criminal offence.  They are also seeking the banning of anonymous websites.  I invite Deputy Seamus Kirk to set out the committee's initial recommendation.</p></speech>

The petition came in response to a double tragedy in her community.  As Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh suggested, we will acknowledge the seriousness of the matter, outline the work which has been done and inform the petitioner that we will be taking the course of action suggested by Deputy Seamus Kirk.</p><p>  Petition No. 29/2013 is from Mr. P&aacute;draig Murphy and seeks the legalisation of cannabis in Ireland.  A Private Members' Bill was recently introduced in the D&aacute;il on this issue and has been subject to considerable debate.  Furthermore, another Bill will be tabled on the issue in the near future .   The committee does not propose to debate the matter further when there is already so much ongoing debate and analysis.  We will communicate this decision to the petitioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Petition No. 67/2012 is from Mr. Liam &Oacute; Tuathail and pertains to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010.  Members will recall this petition was initially considered at our meeting on 16 October, at which time members requested that legal advice be obtained on the issues arising in respect of it.  After receiving legal advice, the committee has deemed the petition to be inadmissible.  We will write to the petitioner with a clear explanation of the grounds on which we believe it to be inadmissible.  While we clearly have to inform petitioners when their petitions are inadmissible, when we have to receive legal advice, the secretariat will be able to draw on the assistance of the Parliamentary Counsel in drafting letters.</p><p>  I return to petition No. 46/2012 from Mr. Matthew Vincent Smith who claims he was wrongfully convicted of assault in circumstances where a garda had allegedly lied under oath.</p> <p>Regarding that petition, we are advised by the parliamentary legal advisers that we should return the documents to the petitioner in accordance with section 92(4) of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act so as to avoid any scenario in the future where the petitioner may seek to claim privilege over said documents.  We will return the documents to the petitioner.</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention that if a new system comes into play whereby a person who is caught speeding receives three penalty points, a learner or novice driver who equals or exceeds six penalty points would be given one strike, and on two strikes he or she is out.  If we change the number of points to seven, it would mean that learner drivers would be given another chance before being put off the road.</p><p>  I have tabled this amendment to give members an opportunity to discuss the impact of penalty points.</p></speech>

They need to be careful and mindful of speed limits.  We have all broken speed limits on many occasions and have the penalty points to show for it but, notwithstanding that, if we are to change the way in which we do things I would be inclined to leave it at six.  I do not have a major issue with what the Deputy is trying to do, and if there is general agreement I will go with it.  However, in principle I would like the total to remain at six.</p></speech>

If somebody received three points on two occasions he or she would have six penalty points, which is a harsh penalty for two offences.  With six penalty points a young driver or a person with a provisional licence would be put off the road, but by increasing the number to seven we are giving them a little extra leverage.  One can argue from the safety point of view whether that extra leverage will make much of a difference.  In this case, I think the penalty is too high for a learner driver.</p></speech>

This issue was raised on Second Stage.  I am genuinely seeking the advice and views of the members on this as I am not 100% sure either way.  The way things stand is that one is disqualified from driving after 12 penalty points and one gets two points every time one is caught speeding.  Therefore, one must have been caught six times before one is disqualified.  The risk in this legislation is that we go too far in the other direction.  A learner or novice driver will be disqualified from driving after getting six penalty points, but we are increasing the penalty for speeding to three points.  That means that after two strikes the person is disqualified from driving.  I am aware of an instance in which a person was caught by a speed camera in Islandbridge and got penalty points and was caught in the same place two days later, but because did not receive the first notice until the following week, he had not had an opportunity to modify his behaviour.  I am genuinely interested in members' views, but my inclination is to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The complicating factor is the alignment of penalty points North and South, in which case we may need to go six, but new legislation will be required at that point.  That could be the time to review it.  We have the option between now and Report Stage to consult with members of the parliamentary party to see what they think.</p></speech>

They arise out of the review of penalty points conducted by my Department in 2012.  Since drafting the Bill I have agreed to a number of additional changes to the system, which I am proposing in this amendment.  I shall outline them briefing.</p><p>  I am proposing to raise the penalty points for using a commercial vehicle without a speed limitation device or with a device that is not compliant with the regulations in cases where a device is required.  At present one gets two penalty points for that offence.  I am proposing to increase the number of penalty points to three, and five upon conviction.  That is consistent with the increase in the number of penalty points for speeding.  This applies to people with heavy goods vehicles or commercial vehicles who are required to have a speed limiter on their vehicles but do not comply.</p><p>  In amendment No. 4, I propose to correct an erroneous reference which should read &quot;section 16(2)(e)&quot; but currently reads &quot;section 16(e)&quot;.</p><p>  Amendment No. 5 proposes a new penalty points offence for using a goods vehicle trailer or semi-trailer without an authorisation plate or with a plate that has been altered to make it inaccurate.  That is an important issue with regard to the suitability of vehicles on the roads.  I am proposing three penalty points for that offence on payment of a fixed charge and five on conviction.</p></speech>

Because the person is a learner permit holder, he or she is not actually qualified to drive.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  It will involve a change of culture.  It is very common in Ireland at the moment for people who have learner permits to go out and drive on their own but it is not the norm in other countries.  People in other countries take much more seriously that one must take lessons and get a company driving logbook and that one sits the driving test and only when one passes it can one drive on one's own.  That is not the subject of this amendment.</p></speech>

Much of the motivation from my perspective was based on a case in Monaghan, that of Shane O'Farrell, whose case has gone through the courts.  I do not want to comment on it.  It struck many of us, including the Minister and his officials, that there was a gap in the law and that it needed to be tidied up.  I thank the officials who have worked with us and the Minister for accepting this amendment in the Principal Act.  Certainly it will act as a deterrent.  It has the capacity to change a culture whereby people felt that by leaving the scene of an accident, whether intoxicated or not, they would not be liable to the provisions of the current legislation, thereby leaving people to die needlessly on the side of the road.  This amendment would require people to be of good behaviour, to remain at the scene and to provide whatever assistance is possible to an injured party.  Its inclusion in the legislation has the capacity to change the culture that, unfortunately, existed.  The motivation was Shane O'Farrell.  I hope this provision will become known as &quot;Shane's law&quot; in recognition of Shane, who was a young trainee barrister and who was deeply involved in law.</p></speech>

No. 109 of 2000)) or a fire brigade of a fire authority (within the meaning of the Fire Services Act 1981) of a vehicle in the performance of the duties of that member, or<br />(b) a person driving or using a vehicle under the direction of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,</blockquote>where such use does not endanger the safety of road users.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote>I propose this amendment to replace section 18 of the Bill.  The purpose of section 18 is not being changed.  It  seeks to provide greater clarity in the meaning of the term &quot;ambulance service&quot;.  At present, the Road Traffic Acts provide exemptions for the emergency services from a number of road traffic restrictions.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fire authorities are clearly defined in law, so there is no confusion there, but the term &quot;ambulance service&quot; is not.  In the Bill I have proposed defining an ambulance service as one provided by a pre-hospital emergency care service provider recognised by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  What this means in practice is that emergency services are exempt from various traffic and parking provisions, although not from the provisions relating to intoxicated driving, driving without reasonable consideration, careless driving, and dangerous driving, and they will still be obliged to provide breath tests, blood tests or urine samples where required.  There are exemptions from certain rules for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fire services.  It has been unclear up to now what defines an ambulance service.  Deputy Dessie Ellis first raised this issue with me about two years ago.  It is difficult to define &quot;ambulance service&quot;, but this is the best definition we can suggest, which is that an ambulance service is one provided by a pre-hospital emergency care service provider recognised by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  Drivers of such vehicles would be expected to have the driving skills necessary.</p></speech>

I have proposed a number of amendments to the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 to tidy up some of the issues that have caused problems arising from the Act.  The Act established the Road Safety Authority as the body responsible for overseeing commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing.  Since its introduction, lessons have been learned which show the need to make some amendments to that Act.  I have included a number of these amendments in the Bill itself.  I have also decided that several more minor amendments are necessary.</p><p>  Section 25 of the 2012 Act deals with the powers of authorised officers to enter CVR testing premises and conduct inspections and issue directions relating to failures to comply with the requirements and to the measures necessary to correct this.  As originally drafted, the 2012 provisions inadvertently led to a situation whereby only the individual authorised office who conducted an inspection could issue a direction.  I propose to amend this in order that other authorised officers could issue the direction.  The situation I want to address is one in which an officer makes an inspection, produces a report on that inspection but may not be available when directions are sent out.  I think this is an essential and practical change and is what was intended in the first place.</p><p>  I am also amending section 34(1)(a) of the 2012 Act, which deals with the powers of inspectors.  At present, section 34(1)(a) allows an inspector to stop and inspect a vehicle if the inspector is accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I propose to extend that to members of Customs and Excise, so that if Customs and Excise stop the vehicle, the RSA inspector will be able to carry out an inspection.  At present they are only allowed to do that if vehicles are stopped by a Garda.</p><p>  The final change is to amend the language in section 41(4)(b) the original Bill which reads &quot;enforcement officers, consultations or advisors&quot; but should read &ldquo;authorised officers, CVR inspectors, consultants and advisors&rdquo;.  I am not sure if the spell check caused that one.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Paul McGowan and Cathy Mannion.  I will discuss the first three or four slides of our presentation and then hand over to Mr. McGowan, who will cover the rest.  The first objective of the presentation is to examine the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the second is to outline the general drivers of energy costs.  Clerly, another objective is to examine the latest price trends.</p><p>  I will talk briefly about the role of the CER.  The CER is Ireland's independent energy regulator.  It was set up by statute consequent to legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  It has broad functions in the area of economic regulation and it also has considerable safety functions concerning energy.  It may well be appointed as the water regulator in the near future but this is entirely dependent on the decision of the Oireachtas.  Further detail is available on the website of the CER, .</p><p>  I will try to give a sense of our mission and what we genuinely believe our functions are.  In a world where energy supply and energy prices are highly volatile &ndash; oil and gas price movements are considerable &ndash; the mission of the CER is to act in the interest of consumers and ensure the lights stay on, that gas continues to flow, that prices charged to consumers are fair and reasonable, that the environment is protected, and that energy is supplied safely.  We will be changing that mission and vision in the near future if the Oireachtas decides to give us water functions.</p><p>  I have tried to give some sense of what the CER is trying to do and what it is about.  Mr. Paul McGowan will continue with the presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McGowan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52013121100004#H00400"><p>I will refer to electricity and gas prices, beginning with a summary of the electricity price drivers in Ireland at present.  Some 60% of the price of electricity is made up of the wholesale price of electricity in the single electricity market.  That market is regulated on an all-island basis by the committee comprising the utility regulator in Northern Ireland, the CER and an independent member.  The biggest cost driver in our wholesale market pertains to gas but it is also fair to say that PSO is a factor in terms of the wholesale price of electricity.</p><p>  The second major component of electricity prices comprises the networks, a monopoly.  That represents approximately 30% of the price.  This cost aspect is regulated by the CER.  In this area, capital expenditure in terms of the rolling out of networks, both at distribution and transmission levels, is a big cost driver.</p><p>  The final element determining electricity prices concerns the competitive supply side, that is, the cost of running supply businesses and other associated costs and margins.  That represents approximately 5% to 10% of the price of electricity.  In this area, given that we no longer regulate the price of electricity in the market, our focus is on customer protection.</p><p>  The next slide serves to illustrate the weighting the various fuels have in the wholesale market.  Members can see that the wholesale market is very much dominated by gas, first and foremost.  Some 50% of the power comes from that fuel.  It is followed by coal, which results in 19% of the power.  Renewables constitute a large proportion, with 16% of the power being from wind.</p><p>  The first graph I have made available to members illustrates neatly the very strong relationship between the price of gas and our wholesale market price for electricity.  The two track each other very closely and have done so pretty much since the market was established.  The following graphs illustrate that there is generally a trend of increasing prices for electricity across Europe.  Ireland is broadly following the trend but our industrial prices are generally above the EU average and our domestic prices, while closer to the EU average, are none the less above the EU average although slightly below the euro area price.</p><p>  There are three broad gas price drivers.</p> <p>The first, which makes up 50% of a typical gas bill, is the actual cost of the gas itself.  That cost is linked to the wholesale price of gas in Great Britain, the market from which we access our supplies.  That wholesale price is pretty much outside Ireland&rsquo;s control.  Another factor is the euro-sterling exchange rate.  For example, while there was a rise in wholesale gas prices in 2013, this was offset by the exchange rate which went in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.</p><p> The second major component of gas prices is the cost of networks, both transmission and distribution.  Most of these costs are fixed.  In this area, falling demand is a key factor.  As these costs are largely fixed, where there is falling demand, those revenues have still to be recovered.  This was a key factor in the price determination in 2013.  Between 8% and 10% of the gas price is related to supply costs.</p><p> Bord G&aacute;is Energy originally requested a 5.43% rise in residential tariffs.  This would have been in excess of 7% were it not for a decision the commission took on transmission tariffs that knocked some millions of euro off the process.  More demand is a key driver of the price rise which we ultimately sanctioned and which came to 2.04%.  The transmission and distribution pipes need to be there to meet demand, particularly during cold spells in the winter, and they need to be paid for.  With falling demand, the average unit price of those pipes rises.  We recognise that an average rise of &euro;16 in gas bills is significant but we have sought to exercise the maximum constraint through our examination of costs.  Across Europe, gas prices have tended to rise but Irish gas prices still compare favourably with the EU average and the eurozone average.</p><p> We continue to see switching rates in both the electricity and gas markets at 11% and 17% respectively.  These rates are reasonably good by European standards.  One of the key drivers to this reasonably healthy level of switching is the fact that the process is easy and free.  This has allowed people to exercise choice, 250,000 in the electricity market and 110,000 people in the gas market in 2012.</p><p> We recognise that in these difficult times people are struggling with meeting bills.  As a result, we have put in place various measures to support the overall system whereby if people fall into arrears they can be supported.  We have seen a fall in the level of disconnections and we have seen a strong roll-out of pay-as-you-go meters.  This is an area we are continuously reviewing.  An accreditation system has been established to allow price-comparison websites to be launched.  We have set out minimum service levels suppliers must provide in the cases of disconnections.  Disconnections are a last resort.  There is no reason for a person in financial difficulty to be disconnected as a pay-as-you-go meter is available to them.  We are actively engaging with stakeholders such as St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, to promote the roll-out of these meters, as well as working with local authorities to ensure the message is disseminated among their housing tenants.  We have worked with the networks business to ensure the roll-out is as efficient as possible.  Installation rates have improved significantly compared to 12 months ago.</p></speech>

Some of the half-year accounts for some energy suppliers show large profits.  Is the commission taking everything into account when one of these energy suppliers requests a price increase?  The commission claims it is setting a price based completely on the cost of the gas and the network with a marginal profit for the suppliers involved.  How can they earn billion euro profits in a full year then?</p><p>  There are significant charges for those who were disconnected from the network to be reconnected.  Even those making small alterations to their houses or changing meters are being landed with &euro;3,000 bills.  Will the commission explain the reasons for this?</p></speech>

I know these are difficult economic times and people are concerned about any price increases.  We are trying to keep prices to the most possible minimum level.  Energy companies make profits.  However, the legislation is set up so that like any other commercial company, they are allowed to make reasonable profits.  Whether they are State or private is not an issue for the commission.  We are there to ensure they have a reasonable rate of return.</p> <p> The committee had a concern that the ESB's first half profits were high last year.  I said at the time that the second half would be much lower, and I think that turned out to be the case.  We also sent details to the committee last year about ESB profitability in general, and how it compared to other companies abroad in a similar position; by that I mean large companies that have both generation and networks.  I can resend those to the committee and come back and discuss them if members wish, but they show that ESB's profitability is actually slightly lower.  Any sense of a State company earning profits can annoy people in difficult times, but I can assure the committee we are doing our best to keep the profitability low and price at cost.</p><p> When we are setting cost, we do not set electricity costs.  We rely on competitive forces in a deregulated market.  To some extent that is in accordance with the whole European Commission framework and our statutory objective to promote competition, which would see that in the medium to long run, competition is better than regulation.  On the specific gas aspect, we did everything we could to keep costs low.  I know that even 2% is difficult, but gas price increases in other countries have been significantly above this.  For example, the average gas price increase in Great Britain was about 9% to 10%.   We have done everything we can to keep things low.  I really believe that and I hope I have done my best to convince the committee on this.</p></speech>

I apologise for not precisely remembering the numbers, but I think it was a 7% increase.  As we are bound to do, we had to consult on that and give a period of time for people to comment on it.  We noted in the consultation that the company had asked for 7%.  We were minded to give the company less, but we also noted that over the six to eight weeks before a final decision was due, fossil fuel prices could change and in fact, they did change.  Gas prices basically increased over the eight week period, so as a result, the final increase was higher than 7%, even though we still cut costs.  We did our very best to put that message across.  Perhaps we could have done better, because it somehow got lost at the time.  However, I can assure the Deputy that in the end the company applied for an increase of 1% to 1.5% above what we ultimately sanctioned.   Perhaps we could do better with our message next time, but I can assure the Deputy that we did not give the company more than it sought.</p></speech>

Where more competition exists with suppliers, does it follow that unit prices are lower?  There is much debate about wind generation, alternative renewable energy and so on.

In arriving at the unit price, does the CER consider the wider competitiveness of the economy and the social affordability when setting prices?  One of the biggest overheads of small to medium enterprises is energy.  We can continue to raise prices if we are going to reduce economic activity.  Does that come into the consideration of the CER?</p><p>  Mr. Nolan also mentioned the circumstances that cause challenges on the social side.  Unfortunately, there are still many disconnections for people who simply cannot afford their utility bills.  Are these taken into account generally when the CER is setting the price?  Mr. Nolan said that the switching rates are quite healthy when compared to other jurisdictions but they have gone from 20% in 2009 to 11% in 2012.  Perhaps he can explain why that has happened.</p><p>  I note from the presentation that the CER remit goes into the approval of capital expenditure for the various utilities.  Is it right that the CER must approve any major capital investments by utility companies before they go ahead with them?  The EirGrid proposals are topical.  Does the CER have a role in approving those investment proposals?  If it does, are comparisons made between an overground investment versus an underground investment?  I ask that because many members of the public are calling for underground proposals from EirGrid.  What impact would that have on the unit cost of electricity?  There needs to be more clarity on this issue.  We are told that putting wires underground costs three times more than overheads.  If that is the case, does it have an impact on the unit price of electricity?</p><p>  The CER is taking on a new role, with responsibility for water networks and systems.  The CER is independent and responsible for ensuring appropriate standards of supply of all utilities, including the gas, the electricity and now water.  It is my understanding that where an electricity supply is contracted to a business or domestic user, such an electricity supply must to be a certain standard, as per the contract.  Do penalties apply if that supply or utility is sub-standard? Does the CER have a role in that?  If somebody has a contracted electricity supply and it is sub-standard, the utility is penalised to some degree.  Will such penalties apply in the case of water, if pressure or quality of the water are substandard?  What is the role of the CER in setting the free threshold or allowance for domestic consumers with regard to water?</p></speech>

Competing entities and consumers have a choice between them.  In answer to the question on renewable and nuclear energy, there is probably a small element of nuclear energy coming in under the new east-west interconnector from the UK.  It is probably not very much, simply because the use of nuclear energy by the UK has fallen considerably in the last five years.  There is some coming in, but it is not a huge amount in terms of affecting the price here.  There is not enough interconnection.  The interconnector is valuable for all kinds of reasons but the nuclear energy does not have a huge effect.</p><p>  Renewable energy is a very controversial and interesting area.  Without going into too much detail, nearly 17% of our electricity comes from wind energy, and that proportion will rise considerably over the next seven or eight years.  By and large, when the wind blows it is nearly free, so that drives down the price a lot.  On the other hand, perhaps two thirds or even 70% of the time, the wind does not blow so it has no effect.  The overall average affect of that depends on what the price of gas would have been.  If gas or coal prices are very high, then renewable energy will lower the price.  If gas prices are very low, then renewable energy may actually raise the price somewhat.  There is that sort of trade off and it will really depend on fossil fuel prices generally.  The public service obligation, or PSO, is set by government policy but the CER calculates it every year.  A proportion of that - perhaps 2.5% of the entire electricity bill - goes on supports for renewable energy, so that is also a factor.</p><p>  I will pass on to my colleague to deal with the other queries, bar the networks and water.</p></speech>

Until recently, the consumer was exposed to the cost of both a disconnection and a reconnection, but a decision taken by the CER reduced the exposure for customers to 50% of that disconnection.</p> <p>The issue of disconnections is a concern for us.  The pay-as-you-go meter is a real alternative to disconnection which we encourage customers to take and is free for customers in financial hardship.  We are trying to get the message out that customers in difficulty must engage with their supplier.  Suppliers have clear guidelines under which they must engage with customers, including trying to implement a payment plan which will allow the customer to meet his or her bills and, if that fails, offering a pay-as-you-go meter.  We would encourage people to take that up as an alternative to disconnection.</p></speech>

We have put some rules on the market whereby every time a customer who has taken a pay-as-you-go meter buys a top-up, a certain proportion of that goes to pay off the debt and the remainder goes towards the electricity the customer will use.  We have put in place very strict rules whereby suppliers have to contact the customer a certain number of times by telephone, e-mail or letter before they can discuss disconnection.  We audit the suppliers in terms of how they perform and so far they have outperformed against the rules we have put in place.  We are working with them on that to see what further rules can be developed.</p></speech>

On social affordability, the only residential tariff we set is the gas price.  We do not have a social tariff system in Ireland.  In setting the gas price, our role is to examine all aspects of cost, including the networks, gas price and cost of supply, to ensure they are as low as practicable in the circumstances.  Social welfare schemes, such as the free gas and free electricity allowances, deal with people's ability to pay, and those are outside our remit and outside the energy market.</p><p>  The fall-off in switching was mentioned.  We would like to see healthier levels of switching across the piece, but the gas switching level of 17% is regarded as a healthy level of switching at a European level.  The level of switching in the electricity market is lower than it was but is still above the threshold we set in terms of the indicators for there being enough competition in the market for us to deregulate.  It is lower than it was.  One factor in that was that there were some very successful marketing campaigns by certain suppliers in the market two or three years ago and that generated a very high level of switching.  Perhaps that level of marketing is not there now, but at 10% or 11% it is still a reasonably high level of switching.</p></speech>

The higher the level of switching, the more competitive an offering customers will receive from a supplier because suppliers will want to keep that custom.  We recognise there is a certain level of inertia among 60% of customers and we are trying to think of ways to engage with those customers to get them to think about moving.  Some customers still think if they change supplier their electricity supply will somehow be less secure, which is not the case.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, EirGrid is a monopoly which we regulate directly.  Capital expenditure and all its expenditure, capital and operating, must be approved by us.  In accordance with standard practice for economic regulators, we generally do this by way of a five year plan.  I hope that does not sound too Stalinist.  Every five years we do a very major review of prices, capital expenditure, operating expenditure and make it as efficient and make as many cuts as possible.  We are doing one again in the next 18 months.  In so doing, the capital expenditure comes for approval in terms of expenditure by the CER.</p><p>  Undergrounding and overgrounding have received much attention recently.  We have approved some of the capital expenditure on the basis of it being overgrounded.  In terms of the effect the Deputy referred to regarding undergrounding, I will try to give my best estimates.  The one in three to which the Deputy referred was an independent study commissioned by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which focused specifically on one project, the North-South interconnector.  It was done by a panel of independent experts and came out with a conservative estimate that there would be at least a 3:1 ratio in terms of capital expenditure, and maybe a little higher.  The only thing for which there is very clear evidence is that there is at least a 3:1 ratio on capital expenditure.</p><p>  Some of the other projects, including Grid Link and Grid West, have not been subject to that specific degree of analysis.  In terms of the estimates I will talk about, we are assuming roughly a 3:1 proportion generally.  That could vary according to different minds but that is our best guess now.  If one gets that 3:1 proportion, and this is purely capital cost, we estimate it will lead to an overall increase of approximately &euro;2.1 billion to underground all those projects instead of overgrounding.  I will not comment on whether that is right, wrong or indifferent.  That is our current estimate.  In terms of the effect undergrounding would have on prices, generally capital projects cost a lot to build and are paid for over time.  Something of that nature is generally recovered over 40 years, or in this case more likely 50 years.  We have done some imperfect estimates.  If the three major projects that are the subject of this debate, Grid West, Grid Link and the North-South interconnector, were all undergrounded, we estimate it would lead to an average increase of 3% per year for the next 50 years.  That is our best estimate.  That is 3% on one's bill every month.</p></speech>

Let us optimistically say one's bill is &euro;100 per year.  If nothing else changed for the next 50 years, one would pay &euro;103 per year for the next 50 years.  That is our best estimate but there are some caveats.  In terms of the expert opinion we have seen, this is on the lower end of the range.  There have been some estimates that it could be higher than that.  The independent report is our main source and it suggested that one in three was the minimum level.  There are two possible issues relating to that.  Although this has not been worked out to the same quantitative extent, it is likely that operating costs of an underground cable may be somewhat higher than an overground cable.  I have spoken about capital expenditure.  In terms of maintaining that cable, we have reason to believe from what we have seen that the operating costs would be likely to be higher.  I am not trying to give a definitive view.  There are also potential quality issues.  I am going to be very careful about this.  It is not so much that there would be more faults with an underground cable, there probably would not be, but faults in an underground cable of that magnitude might be more difficult and take longer to fix and could therefore present as some kind of security of supply risk.  I am not trying to pass the buck, but this is a debate for society and the Oireachtas to deal with, and I am trying to present the facts.</p></speech>

It is helpful and it is an important element of information to contribute to the wider debate on energy security and the cost of electricity.  CER has a very important role to play in that.</p> <p>I understand we are talking about &euro;500 million investment in the EirGrid projects.  That is what the public is being told.  I am not trying to box the CER into a corner, but is it correct that the CER would have to approve that level of investment before EirGrid could go ahead with it?  Am I correct in thinking that EirGrid has only made the overhead proposals to the CER for approval and that it has not sought approval for any underground lines?</p></speech>

I will do my best to answer the question, but I want to let the Chairman know that.  We have not been called before any other committee on this.</p><p>  The CER does not have a role in regard to the free allowance.  That is essentially a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.  In regard to quality of supply, I cannot answer that question because it will depend on the legislation that is ultimately approved.  I will make some general comments regarding quality of water supply, but in the context of looking forward to a role we do not have.  There is a sense that significant investment is required in water over the next period.  People have talked a lot about the cost of water, but often they are just talking about the cost in terms of providing clean drinking water.  Our estimates so far, which are not perfect, are that the overall cost of providing water is just over half of the cost, because much of the cost is for waste water disposal - efficient and clean disposal of waste water and sewage.  Significant investment will be required in that area.  I am not answering the Deputy's question precisely, but the answer depends on the legislation and the role we are given.</p></speech>

I have six questions.  I preface my remarks by saying that sometimes we put questions to witnesses when we should be putting them to ourselves, because we are the people who decide on legislation and determine policy.</p><p>  The Gas Regulation Bill 2013 passing through the Houses allows for the privatisation of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  I fear this increases the risk of large price hikes and the prevalence of fuel poverty.  I am sure the CER is aware of the rumblings of price fixing between the big six in the British market and I fear we face the same risk here.  Will Mr. Nolan talk us through how these concerns will be addressed?</p><p>  I get confused when I look at claims regarding electricity price increases.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul states it paid &euro;10.4 million in 2011 for households that could not pay their electricity charges.  That sum is 25% of what the society pays out in total.  In 2008, the amount it paid out was &euro;3.8 million.  A major factor in this increase is that people's incomes have been dramatically reduced over the years, but there has been an increase of approximately &euro;500 per household in energy bills over the past three years.  However, when we look at the percentage increase figures issued, they state the increase is 2.04% or similar.  This does not seem as if it could amount to &euro;500 per household over the past three years.  Am I reading this wrong or are there different measurements being used by different bodies?</p><p>  Does the CER have any input into regulation of or has it any control of the price of connecting to the national grid?  I am aware of a person in Monaghan who invested a good deal of his money in developing a biomass project.  This project could work wonders at reducing the amount of waste for landfill and could provide significant industry in such a rural area.  Everything was going swimmingly with the project until this person began to inquire about the cost of connecting to the national grid.  He was quoted a cost of &euro;500,000, which meant the project could go nowhere.  My concern is that while we say the right words regarding micro generation, we are not serious about it.  We are so blinded by the headline projects that we forget about the micro ones.  Does the CER have any input or responsibility for the cost of connection to the national grid?  Is a change required in this regard?</p><p>  Until quite recently, I was not aware of the need for so-called security deposits for small industries.  A man who runs a hotel in the north east was billed for a &euro;15,000 security deposit, despite the fact he had been with the company for a number of years.  He assures me he always paid his bills promptly, but he received a bill for a security deposit of &euro;15,000.  He did not have that money available to pay straight away, but the company came to disconnect his hotel, despite the fact there were guests in it and despite the fact the owner had paid his bills on time for the previous two years or so.  I believe this practice is wrong.  A security deposit should not be handled in the same way as an outstanding bill.  Also, in the context of being able to switch suppliers, because the &euro;15,000 showed as a debt against his business, the potential for this man to switch was zero.  He had to go to the bank to get the money and pay company so that his supply would be maintained.  This practice is wrong and is anti-business.  It is certainly anti-small business.</p><p>  My next question concerns the CER's view on consumer prices, which has been partly answered.  Part of my question related to the situation if renewable energy development is accelerated.  What does the CER feel the impact would be on electricity prices if fracking for shale gas or nuclear energy is permitted in this country?  Does the CER have people working with it who can look at what is happening in these markets?  Is the CER aware that the realistic lifetime of a fracking well is not 20 years, as claimed, but only four or five years?  What is the role of the CER in regard to this and how does it see fracking for shale gas impacting on prices if it is permitted here?</p><p>  If Ireland or any nation tries to ride the two horses of renewable energy and, for example, shale gas development, one or both will suffer.</p> <p>We cannot afford to ride the two horses.  I am concerned renewable energy will suffer for the short-term gain available from other energy sources.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on this.</p></speech>

The privatisation issue is delicate and it is a policy issue.  If Bord G&aacute;is Energy were privatised, we would treat it in exactly the same way.  At present we set a regulated price and it is likely in the near future, as with electricity, the market will be deemed sufficiently competitive that we will not set direct controls over it.  As to whether a private or public company would behave differently, it is a difficult question for me to answer and I will not express a specific opinion if that is all right.  We will treat it in exactly the same way regardless.  Last year, I told the committee that in my view there is a very strong case for keeping essential networks such as the wires and gas pipes in State control.  The issue of whether a company which generates and sells energy but is not a natural monopoly should be publicly or privately owned is a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.  It is a policy issue.</p></speech>

The average annual gas bill in Ireland is approximately &euro;982 and the average annual electricity bill is approximately &euro;1,200.  A typical household incurs just in excess of approximately &euro;2,100 to &euro;2,200 per year in energy bills.  Referring back to the graph we showed earlier, prices have been increasing throughout Europe since 2008.  I do not have the exact figures but the &euro;500 in the context of an overall energy bill of &euro;2,200 would not be completely unreasonable given the changes in gas and electricity prices which have occurred since 2008.  I cannot give specific numbers and I will have to come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We do not have a view on the hedging policies of independent entities.  When it comes to gas prices, Bord G&aacute;is Energy hedges.  It typically hedges at least a year in advance but it does not hedge all of its fuel price.  It hedges various tranches for various periods of time.  When we come to set the final price of gas, some fuel needs to be hedged and hence the price can increase or decrease.  For every day in the year the amount of gas it has contracted in the wholesale markets will never exactly meet its demands.  It will always either be selling into the spot market or buying from the spot market on the day.  There can never be absolute certainty over the price of gas.</p></speech>

Security deposits are a matter for individual companies.  We do not have anything in our guidelines which prohibits security deposits.  However, there is a clear process in our guidelines that if somebody feels any aspect of the service they receive is unfair, or makes a complaint to a supplier, and a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the consumer complains to us.  We have a statutory obligation to deal with these complaints and we have powers of arbitration in that we make binding determinations.  If we find against the supplier or the network company, the decision is binding on it and this can include compensation or a reversal of a decision.  Where somebody facing disconnection has a genuine complaint or dispute, a disconnection would not be carried out until we have dealt with the issue at hand.</p></speech>

The Deputy's concern is it stops customers switching because they cannot afford to pay the deposit.  We want to increase switching rates so we will examine it.  We will come back to the Deputy on this issue when we have finished our work with the suppliers to see what the issue is.  We must remember the supplier buys electricity at the wholesale price and is responsible for paying for it as soon as it is taken.  Many customers do not get billed until after they have used the electricity so a deposit is required to cover the risk from when the supplier buys the electricity to when the customer pays for it.</p></speech>

The vast majority of our gas comes from the UK National Balancing Point, NBP, which is the main liquid hub for gas.  We price against this.  I expect any new source of gas will mark to this market.  Having cheap gas from a source would not necessarily mean the market price for the gas was cheaper.  Certainly it would compete against the NBP price but it does not follow it would be substantially lower because it would be priced against what was available elsewhere in the market.</p></speech>

A body of thought is emerging which suggests that such developments do not stand up to a cost-benefit analysis.  The question arises, therefore, of whether wind energy makes economic sense.  Does the CER have an opinion on that?</p><p> The witnesses stated that CER plays a role in ensuring safety in energy generation.  Does that role extend to health and, if not, perhaps the witnesses will comment on the matter.  Has it considered providing a line for Deputies to make inquiries about providers?  When we receive representations we try to contact the relevant provider but we are told they can only deal with the account holder.</p></speech>

There have been a significant number of renewable developments in Germany, partially wind but also solar, and some people are now asking whether they were worth it.  The Nordic countries are broadly supportive of renewables.  I hope I am not characterising people unreasonably when I note that many of the eastern European countries are sceptical about renewables.</p><p>  The vast majority of our renewables are envisaged to involve wind.  Hydroelectric power generation is not suitable for the Irish system.  Our target is to achieve 40% wind energy by 2020.  On the Deputy's question about whether it will be cheaper, much will depend on the price of fossil fuels.  I will try to explain the factors behind that answer.  If the price of gas in 2020 is the same as its current price, it is likely that we will have more expensive electricity overall as a result of taking on 40% wind.  However, if the price of gas increases, we may have cheaper electricity.  It is a complex task to model the factors that will determine the outcome.  We have done some modelling ourselves and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Eirgrid are also conducting a study of various scenarios.  Subsidies for wind generation relate to the public service obligation.  My estimate, which I think is reasonably accurate, is that wind's contribution to the overall price of electricity in terms of subsidy is between 2% and 2.5%.  It is likely that the figure will rise over time but the subsidies are set for a fixed period and will eventually go away.  The other perceived cost to renewables is the fact that some element of capital expenditure on the grid is required for renewables.  Some of this investment is simply aimed at keeping the grid safe and secure and keeping the lights turned on, but a portion is required to support renewables.  The most obvious of the three projects in this regard is Grid West because much of the wind is in the west.  As opposed to what might be perceived as the cost of renewables, when the wind blows it is free.  It does not always blow but there is no question that the new entrants into the market are driving down the wholesale price and the average cost of generating electricity.  In terms of the overall balance, that is what the studies are trying to achieve.  Ultimately, they will come to some sort of view - I am not sure that I would say gamble - as to whether gas prices will be high or low in five, 15 or 20 years' time.  I apologise that I cannot give a precise answer but they are the factors affecting the matter.</p></speech>

We have a wider remit on safety in respect of the gas chain from well to burner tip.</p><p>  On the question of Deputies making representations on behalf of customers, the reluctance on the part of suppliers is firmly rooted in data protection issues and avoiding a breach of the Data Protection Acts.  I am not sure we could do anything to allow those Acts to be bypassed and I suggest that it is a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></speech>

I have heard some of their responses to members' questions but have missed other responses because I had to leave the meeting to attend other business.</p><p>  CER may become the regulator for Irish Water.  I hope it does not get this role because I am not satisfied with its record in regulating energy providers.  I recently travelled with several of my colleagues to a European country which forced all the suppliers to reduce their prices.  The country's President made the decision that prices should be cut by 33%.  In the context of the current recession, the most up to date figures by SEAI for 2012 show increase after increase despite the fact that businesses are suffering.  I am a small businessman.  The figures for businesses show they have had to endure frightening increases.  We are trying to build a competitive economy and good value but the increases keep coming.  Bord G&aacute;is recently applied for an increase of 5.43% but CER only agreed to 2.4%.  That is coming on top of other increases.  Other countries can force companies to cut prices.  When we visited the aforementioned country we asked how utilities will be affected and whether companies will be able to reinvest but people are lining up to take over the utility companies.  We are being led a merry dance and CER is ineffectual.</p><p>  I hope it is not given responsibility for Irish Water because the only good thing about Irish Water is the name, An Bord Uisce.  I do not agree with the decision to establish it because it will take away control and knowledge from local authorities, as happened with the HSE, SUSI and the driving licence fiasco.  Ordinary people are paying their bills.  Many people have been disconnected.  I disagree with the way that issue has been addressed.  It is not possible to argue over a bill; one must pay it.  Even when one pays it, one's credit rating is affected.  One cannot move anywhere else.  CER needs to be more robust because it is not doing the business for the consumer or the business person.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked about the wind strategy.</p> <p>The power generated from the wind strategy and whatever is taken across the routes all over the country, including those used by the Chairman.  I refer to the lack of engagement by the company that is doing this, the lack of meaningful consultation and the attitude that the company can do what it likes, where it likes and when it likes and that it can effectively ignore agencies, including Mr. Nolan's agency.  Is it merely ticking boxes?  The people are paying the piper and the prices are there to be seen.  I could read them out to Mr. Nolan as I have two pages of them here.  They are appalling.  Some of them are up as much as 15% over a 15 month period.  It is madness in a deep dark recession where everybody has been cut back, everybody has taken significant pain and businesses are trying to hang on.  These are areas where consumers feel them must pay because otherwise the lights will go out.  The likes of EirGrid have taken the attitude that they are keeping the lights on but it is at the expense of consumers paying the bills no matter what medicine they must take.  In this case, consumers must put up with whatever kind of infrastructure the company deems fit and nobody is to ask whether this is healthy or safe.  In his response, Mr. Nolan might explain if the CER has a role in that regard and has it a view on the proliferation of the wind energy as well?  On the vast amount of turbines being proposed, there is something mad going on here and it needs to be checked and reined in before we all are blighted with obstacles in the country.  There are other ways of looking at matters.</p><p> I have asked Mr. Nolan a number of questions.  I have no faith in the CER's ability to control prices in any shape or form.  Mr. Nolan may look at the page I hold here and see the evidence over the past number of years in which everybody has faced significant cutbacks.</p></speech>

I am sorry he has no faith in us.  All I can do is assure him that we are trying to keep costs as low as we possibly can.</p><p>  He asked about the mandate.  Our mandate is to set prices at the efficient cost.  I can go into more detail, if the committee likes.  The efficient cost of producing energy in Ireland has risen considerably, and, indeed, almost continually, for the past five or ten years.  There are a number of factors for that which I can go into.  I would also note that this has happened in many, not all, other European countries but I can explain that too.  I would look at the prices, for example, in the United Kingdom, which has a similar energy mix to us in the sense that they also rely mostly on gas and to some extent coal, and they used have nuclear.  Prices in the United Kingdom have risen considerably.  Over the past five or six years, they have risen by more than prices in Ireland.  Prices in France have not risen so much.  France is 80% nuclear.  Prices in Norway have not risen much.  Norway has 95% hydroelectric.  These countries are not subject to fossil-fuel prices.  They are not subject to external forces in the price of fossil fuels which, frankly, we, as a small country, cannot control.</p><p>  Given our mandate, we are supposed to set prices at efficient cost.  We are - all I can say is I give the committee my assurance for whatever that is worth - doing our best to keep it low.  I accept that it has been a most difficult five to six years for the Irish people.  I accept prices have risen and it is difficult to pay but we are doing all we can to keep prices as low as possible.  I am not sure if there is much more I can say on that.</p><p>  On wind, I was asked about the idea of networks.  I touched on this early.  The idea is we approve expenditure.  The planning structures, etc., on how that is done are ultimately a matter for EirGrid.  I would very much hope that there is open consultation.  I understand the idea that communities are affected by these matters and want to have their views taken on board.</p><p>  On the last comment on the proliferation of wind turbines, that is a policy issue.  The Government decided that there would be a 40% renewable target for various reasons, many of which are to do with climate change and carbon reduction.  That is ultimately a policy issue.  If the Government and the country want to achieve that, no doubt wind is our best and, to some extent, only option.  It is really not a matter for me to say whether that is the right choice or not.  The CER's job will be to ensure that it is done as efficiently as possible.</p></speech>

Has the CER ever refused outright a price increase request from a supplier and could they give the details and frequency, if any, of such outright refusals?</p><p>  On a separate matter, how can the CER justify its decision that all gas providers must pay for the cost of the two interconnectors between Britain and Ireland, whether they use them or not?  Are they aware that such decision is jeopardising a &euro;1 billion project in north Kerry by Shannon LNG which will create 650 jobs over four years during the construction phase and a further 50 permanent jobs?  How can such a decision be good for competition and keeping down or, perhaps even lowering, prices?  Could they explain the rationale for that?  If the High Court decision due today is in favour of that company, will they give a commitment not to pursue the matter further and allow the project, and the creation of those badly needed jobs, to proceed?</p></speech>

I have quite a few questions.</p><p>  How much extra does pay as you go cost the consumer?  Does it cost more per unit of electricity?  Is there interest to pay on what one is paying back?  Also, they make it sound a good deal more rosy than it is in that if consumers cannot pay their bills, they can go on pay as you go and will not be cut off.  That creates the following dire scenario.  If a child is unfortunate enough to live in a home where the parents are not organised enough for whatever reason or are not good with money, what solace will it be to that child as he or she sits in the dark and in the cold that mammy and daddy have pay as you go.  There were many scenarios in my youth where I did not know whether the lights would have been on and it would not have been reassuring to know that there was pay-as-you-go installed.</p><p>  At this stage, the three-to-one cost ratio in the underground-overground power lines argument is bordering on farce.  How can anyone have figures on this until he or she first asks the people whether they want the power lines to go underground or overground?  I said this last week at this committee but it seems it must be repeated because people keep missing the point.  One cannot have a ratio of overground to underground unless one knows what sort of terrain one is going through.  The ratio that we are getting appears to be the result of where they already decided we are going overground and chose a route on that basis and that it had better be fairly solid terrain on which to put the pylons, but if they decided first that they were putting it underground they would choose a different route.  This ratio is completely irrelevant.</p><p>  They estimate a 3% increase in electricity prices if the power lines go underground.  How did they arrive at this cost increase?  Also, there was mention of increased costs afterwards if the power lines go underground.  What about the decreases in costs from the danger of overhead lines being blown down?  We are told climate change is happening before our eyes and there will be more unpredictable weather.  Surely, they should be concluding that putting the power lines overground might involve more long-term costs.</p><p>  Has the CER any say over the power that will be produced in the midlands, and if not, why?</p> <p>Why have the proposals to produce electricity in the midlands not been included in the remit of the CER?  Is the legislation that set up the CER not cover all energy production in Ireland?  Can the delegates supply the legislation that governs the CER and show how the proposals designated for the midlands are exempted from its control, if that is the case?</p><p> Can the delegates indicate the term for the memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the UK, as we are in the dark on that one?  When will that finish?  What will happen to the carbon credits thereafter?  Are we, in effect, giving away our rights to these carbon credits forever?</p><p> In terms of renewable energy and wind turbines, will there be a gate 4 grid and, if so, when will those who are in the queue be formally invited into such a gate grid and for what year will that be?  If we are currently meeting our wind renewable energy targets under the Kyoto Protocol, which I understand we nearly are, with what is already connected and what is contracted to be connected, will we be setting new targets for even greater amounts of electricity from wind energy in the future and what might those targets be?  Would it not be sensible to have the carbon offset that would be created in the midlands available to us to meet future targets?  </p><p> Further to a question Deputy Colreavy asked - this fits into the idea of people's acceptance of renewable energy and I believe that if it was locally produced and driven it would receive much more acceptance - I have question on cost of connection.  Applications for a connection to the ESB are currently &euro;27,000 and that is only the cost to lodge an application - to say "Hello, I am there".  What sort of control has the CER over that cost?  From listening to what Ms Cathy Mannion said earlier, I understand that the CER is considering going back to the companies to see what they are thinking of doing about this.  This has been going on for way too long.  Irish people or non-nationals living here who want to set  up a biomass or an anaerobic digester plant or something like that and use their own private initiative are being prohibited from doing so.  We need to know what exactly the CER is doing about that.  The idea that one would have to hand over &euro;27,000 just to say "hello" to them is astonishing and it does not show a serious approach being taken when it comes to renewable energies, except if one is a big multinational and owns a bulldozer that one can use for consultation.</p></speech>

I apologise for having had to leave the meeting for a vote that was called in the Seanad.  I hope that none of the questions I have for the delegates have already been asked.  Some 110,500 customers switched suppliers last year.  Is an increase anticipated in the coming year?  On switching suppliers does a time stipulation apply?  Can a customer switch back to his or her previous supplier and switch forward to a competitor or must the customer remain with a supplier for six months, a year or two years?</p><p>  Pay-as-you-go meters have been installed.  Am I right in saying that they are installed free of charge?  What would be cost for a household comprising two adults and two children to pay under the normal meter compared to the cost of switching to the pay-as-you-go meter system?  Would the delegates have an idea of the comparison of annual costs for such a household?  Is there any saving between the two systems?  I believe the pay-as-you-go meter system is more expensive, although I cannot quantify that.  The delegates might confirm if that is the case.  </p><p>  I welcome what the delegates said that on the question of the disconnection of supply, every opportunity possible is given to consumers, including deferred payments.  I presume disconnection is a last resort ,and that is the way it should be.  Some colleagues mentioned reconnection costs.  I must declare that I am a former ESB employee.  I consider that reconnection costs are exorbitant.  It cost one consumer recently upwards on &euro;1,700 to be reconnected in circumstances where he had no outstanding bills.  He had his electricity disconnected while an extension, painting or rewiring work was being carried out and a reconnection fee of close to &euro;2,000 is exorbitant.  </p><p>  I note from one of the delegate's presentation that industrial and commercial prices in Ireland are above averages in the euro area and in the EU.  Is there a main reason that is the case?  Will the situation improve with EirGrid's G25 proposals for the next five to ten years?  Will electricity costs be more competitive for commercial, industrial and domestic consumers which would make us more competitive?  The delegates might comment on that aspect.</p></speech>

When the CER is establishing an price increase, does the level of profitability of a company play any apart in that calculation?  Does the CER get such information and are the delegates satisfied that they are getting accurate information in terms of company profitability?  Has there been a recent case here or elsewhere where were prices were lowered by an energy regulator instead of increased?  Have the delegates any figures for the projected timescale for the continuation of the supply of gas from Europe?  How long do they expect that we will able to continue to get gas from Europe?  Have any figures been produced to indicate that timescale?</p></speech>

On Deputy Griffin's question on whether the CER has ever refused a price increase, I have not been with the CER for its entire existence.  I am not sure about that and I will revert to the committee.  The general practice is that a company will generally put something in - the committee may not agree with this but a company will generally not put in an outrageous figure, it is generally a figure close to the cost - and we generally reduce that.  I am not sure if we have ever gone to zero but, in anticipating Deputy Colreavy's question, we certainly have had price reductions in the past, admittedly not in the past two or three years but we have certainly ordained price reductions.</p></speech>

On the question of the Shannon LNG case, the judgment issued today, I will say two things about it.  The first issue is that we took that decision, and probably given that it is in some sense still potentially <i>sub judice</i> in the context of the court, we believed that if we did not change the framework that existed, and we did so in accordance with European law, gas prices in the country would be significantly higher over the next ten, 20 or 30 years.  There were various numbers but we were thinking of a potential transfer from the producer to the consumer of hundreds of millions of euro; therefore, gas prices would be hundreds of millions of euro higher over the period of time.  I accept the points about the jobs and I have no problem saying that I would very much like to see the project go ahead.</p> <p> On the question of jobs, that is not something we are allowed to consider from a statutory aspect.  We are supposed to be focusing on the cost of fuels.</p><p> I cannot give the undertaking sought by the Deputy and we must wait to see the judgment.  In general, we will have to take what is in our view the best interest of the consumer in our decisions.  That is all I can say on the issue.</p></speech>

How could that be good for competition and prices?</p></speech>

I will try to give a short answer, which is the sense that the interconnectors need to be paid for.  They were authorised before the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was set up and they provide valuable security of supply benefits.  Given the nature of the way the charging system was when they were set up, the price of gas from Britain was linked to their usage.  To give a hypothetical numerical example, if the cost of price was &euro;100 and the price of transport was &euro;5, if use of the interconnector fell drastically, the cost of transport could rise to &euro;20, so the overall price of gas would go from &euro;105 to &euro;120.  We believed that would be difficult and harmful to consumers so we changed the system.  I have probably said all I can on that issue.  We will see what happens with the court case and then take a view.</p></speech>

Certainly, the power exists, although that is all I can say.  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked about a variety of issues.  On the 3:1 ratio estimate relating to costs, we have not made a decision about undergrounding or overgrounding.  EirGrid has a view that an overground solution was the most cost-efficient for at least the North-South interconnector, although the decision has not been made for the other two.  The Department also commissioned a report.  The Deputy is questioning the 3:1 ratio, indicating that an underground solution might take a very different route attracting a lower cost.  I do not know if I can comment on that specifically but the independent report examined scenarios and came out with a particular view.  I do not know if that satisfies the Deputy's point but it is essentially the process that has happened.</p><p>  I mentioned a caveat about the other two issues earlier, and there was less surety about potential increased operating costs.  That is something we will continue to follow.  In terms of quality, I indicated earlier there may be fewer faults, although they may be slightly more difficult to fix.  I am not making definitive claims on that and we can pursue the matter further if the Deputy so wishes.</p><p>  With regard to renewables, Gate 4 and general issues, the CER is currently planning to do something about - for want of a better word - what we call Gate 4.  We will consider if targets have been met and what scope there is for further connection from renewables to the grid.  However, that will be guided to some extent by Government policy and it will depend partially on whether the 40% targets are being met.  We will take some policy guidance on that.  There is a process in place to consult early in the new year about connections along the lines of Gate 4.</p><p>  On the midlands issue, I do not wish to be evasive, although the Deputy may think I am.  It is a policy matter.  Some of our staff are engaged in working groups on the issue but it is really a matter for the Government to decide whether this should go forward.  If it is going forward, it is unclear as to whether the process will be regulated.  If it is set up in a way that is connected to the main grid, it is likely there would be a regulatory role for the CER.  Currently, some of the proposals are that it will be an entirely separate entity from the electricity grid, with wind turbines directly connected to the UK.  If that is the case, it is unlikely we would have any regulatory role unless the Oireachtas chooses to give us one.</p></speech>

We began with the &euro;2.1 billion figure.  I indicated earlier to an idea that the way major network investments are made - particularly one of this magnitude - is to pay for them over 50 years.  We considered the &euro;2.1 billion as going over the 50-year period.  It is repaid according to a rate of return, which is standard for all major network investments.  We used a couple of different rates of returns and got a figure around that.  We have basically considered how to pay the &euro;2.1 billion over 50 years, which is standard practice, with a rate of return allowed on the investment.</p></speech>

One has those customers who for reasons of financial hardship receive a pay-as-you-go meter from ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is Networks.  For those customers the price is the same if not cheaper than the standard tariffs offered by those suppliers.  There are other suppliers on the market whom I will not name but the committee probably knows who offer pay-as-you-go meters for lifestyle choices.  People who take those meters tend to pay more for their electricity than those who have meters installed due to financial hardship.  Those customers have made a lifestyle choice and have decided to go with those suppliers and therefore implicitly have decided to pay those charges.</p></speech>

The key point on the pay-as-you-go option is that in the case of financial hardship the cost of the meter is socialised, whereas, where a choice is involved the company offering it needs to recover the cost.</p><p>  The process for switching in Ireland is straightforward and it is free.  One exercises one&rsquo;s choice freely and there is no prohibition on people re-exercising the choice to switch to another supplier.  However, certain suppliers when they sign up customers might have reached a certain deal with them and there might be a termination provision in the contract but, generally speaking and all things being equal, if it is a straightforward domestic supply contract without any of those provisions then customers are free to switch at any time they choose.</p><p>  We have addressed the question on the cost of pay-as-you-go meters.  Essentially, where there is financial hardship the cost is socialised and recovered through the market but where financial hardship is not an issue and the meters are offered by a commercial entity the cost must be recovered by it through its tariffs.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan also inquired about pay-as-you-go meters.  It is important to bear in mind that if somebody is on a pay-as-you-go meter and they do not make payments then their electricity could be cut off.</p></speech>

In terms of the idea that pay-as-you-go meters would be rolled out without any regard, that is something of which we have to take due account.  For example, when suppliers deal with customers they also check to see whether the customers are vulnerable.  That has some impact on whether they offer the meters.</p></speech>

Deputy Flanagan is correct; one is going from being disconnected by a network to self-disconnection and that creates its own problems.  We know that and what we have done is put emergency credits on the meter so that at least in one of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy there is some credit that will let people continue to use electricity for a period.  The amount is approximately &euro;5 which is perhaps a day or so&rsquo;s worth of electricity.  Another measure is that at certain times of the day or over weekends the meter will not disconnect because one wants people to have the opportunity to buy credit in order to top up their meter.  What one does not want to happen is that the electricity would run out during the night and that suddenly there would be no electricity.</p><p>  I have one other point to make about vulnerable customers.  The supplier has to demonstrate to us that the customer actively wants to have a pay-as-you-go meter for the very simple fact that it is self-disconnection and it does not suit certain customers.  The supplier has to be very clear with the customer on whether they want that type of meter.</p></speech>

One outstanding question is about electricity prices and why they might be higher in Ireland than in other areas.  One point to note from an earlier slide is that gas dominates the pricing of electricity in Ireland whereas, as the commissioner, Mr. Nolan, noted earlier, other countries benefit from the wide availability of relatively cheap nuclear energy or hydro energy, which we do not have.  That could be one factor on why prices are higher here than elsewhere.  There is also the fact in terms of gas, for example, that it has to be transported over longer distances in order to reach the Irish market.  There are a number of factors feeding into electricity prices.</p></speech>

I made a point about the EirGrid G25 proposals.  Will that help to liberalise or equalise the cost of commercial and industrial units to domestic consumers?</p></speech>

Grid25 is being rolled out for a number of reasons, first, to help meet renewable targets.  The wires are needed in order to ensure the system can handle that level of renewables, but also to ensure that the lights stay on.  Much of the emphasis on grid roll-out is on security of supply.  A cost will be associated with those wires but, for example, the North-South interconnector infrastructure would remove between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million of constraint costs from the single electricity market per annum.  I think that is the correct number but it might be lower than that &ndash; between &euro;20 million and &euro;30 million.  In that instance, that particular wire has a direct cost impact on the market.</p></speech>

On whether we look at the profitability, no, we look at the costs underlying the price.</p><p>  In terms of gas from the EU, I would not be able to give any definitive view on the matter.  We would have to consider whether there is available information in terms of how long it will last.  Since my time in the energy industry, the availability of gas at a European and global level has continued to go further out.</p> <p>It is fair to observe that the change in the gas price situation in the United States is an example of where further resources have been sourced.  This has had an impact in Europe in terms of the price of coal, for example.</p></speech>

The legislation for the CER is for all of Ireland.  Has a provision been built into it that I have not seen?  Have we now gone so far that not only is Ireland an offshore windfarm for Britain but also part of Britain?  The CER does not seem to have any say.  It is strange that the legislation establishing the CER concerns the whole of the country.  How come there is a hole in the midlands?</p></speech>

Our legislation is supposed to protect customers, those who will actually be charged for Irish electricity in Ireland.  I spoke about generation and supply.  Bearing in mind what I said about the connection to the grid, the key is that we are supposed to regulate the grid.  The grid has a specific legal existence in some sense.  In particular, it must be a monopoly and one cannot privately build one's own grid.  The statutory objective is to regulate it to set an efficient cost and to allow connections to it for generators.  Without the connection to the grid, we would not have a statutory role.  If, as a result of what I have alluded to, energy were not directly sold into the Irish market and people were not supplying that directly, we would not have a role.</p></speech>

If there is a connection to the grid, we must have some sort of regulatory role.  As to how that would be constituted, I do not know.

I have proposed a number of amendments to the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 to tidy up some of the issues that have caused problems arising from the Act.  The Act established the Road Safety Authority as the body responsible for overseeing commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing.  Since its introduction, lessons have been learned which show the need to make some amendments to that Act.  I have included a number of these amendments in the Bill itself.  I have also decided that several more minor amendments are necessary.</p><p>  Section 25 of the 2012 Act deals with the powers of authorised officers to enter CVR testing premises and conduct inspections and issue directions relating to failures to comply with the requirements and to the measures necessary to correct this.  As originally drafted, the 2012 provisions inadvertently led to a situation whereby only the individual authorised office who conducted an inspection could issue a direction.  I propose to amend this in order that other authorised officers could issue the direction.  The situation I want to address is one in which an officer makes an inspection, produces a report on that inspection but may not be available when directions are sent out.  I think this is an essential and practical change and is what was intended in the first place.</p><p>  I am also amending section 34(1)(a) of the 2012 Act, which deals with the powers of inspectors.  At present, section 34(1)(a) allows an inspector to stop and inspect a vehicle if the inspector is accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I propose to extend that to members of Customs and Excise, so that if Customs and Excise stop the vehicle, the RSA inspector will be able to carry out an inspection.  At present they are only allowed to do that if vehicles are stopped by a Garda.</p><p>  The final change is to amend the language in section 41(4)(b) the original Bill which reads &quot;enforcement officers, consultations or advisors&quot; but should read &ldquo;authorised officers, CVR inspectors, consultants and advisors&rdquo;.  I am not sure if the spell check caused that one.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Paul McGowan and Cathy Mannion.  I will discuss the first three or four slides of our presentation and then hand over to Mr. McGowan, who will cover the rest.  The first objective of the presentation is to examine the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the second is to outline the general drivers of energy costs.  Clerly, another objective is to examine the latest price trends.</p><p>  I will talk briefly about the role of the CER.  The CER is Ireland's independent energy regulator.  It was set up by statute consequent to legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  It has broad functions in the area of economic regulation and it also has considerable safety functions concerning energy.  It may well be appointed as the water regulator in the near future but this is entirely dependent on the decision of the Oireachtas.  Further detail is available on the website of the CER, .</p><p>  I will try to give a sense of our mission and what we genuinely believe our functions are.  In a world where energy supply and energy prices are highly volatile &ndash; oil and gas price movements are considerable &ndash; the mission of the CER is to act in the interest of consumers and ensure the lights stay on, that gas continues to flow, that prices charged to consumers are fair and reasonable, that the environment is protected, and that energy is supplied safely.  We will be changing that mission and vision in the near future if the Oireachtas decides to give us water functions.</p><p>  I have tried to give some sense of what the CER is trying to do and what it is about.  Mr. Paul McGowan will continue with the presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-11a.1561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McGowan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013121100003#H00400"><p>I will refer to electricity and gas prices, beginning with a summary of the electricity price drivers in Ireland at present.  Some 60% of the price of electricity is made up of the wholesale price of electricity in the single electricity market.  That market is regulated on an all-island basis by the committee comprising the utility regulator in Northern Ireland, the CER and an independent member.  The biggest cost driver in our wholesale market pertains to gas but it is also fair to say that PSO is a factor in terms of the wholesale price of electricity.</p><p>  The second major component of electricity prices comprises the networks, a monopoly.  That represents approximately 30% of the price.  This cost aspect is regulated by the CER.  In this area, capital expenditure in terms of the rolling out of networks, both at distribution and transmission levels, is a big cost driver.</p><p>  The final element determining electricity prices concerns the competitive supply side, that is, the cost of running supply businesses and other associated costs and margins.  That represents approximately 5% to 10% of the price of electricity.  In this area, given that we no longer regulate the price of electricity in the market, our focus is on customer protection.</p><p>  The next slide serves to illustrate the weighting the various fuels have in the wholesale market.  Members can see that the wholesale market is very much dominated by gas, first and foremost.  Some 50% of the power comes from that fuel.  It is followed by coal, which results in 19% of the power.  Renewables constitute a large proportion, with 16% of the power being from wind.</p><p>  The first graph I have made available to members illustrates neatly the very strong relationship between the price of gas and our wholesale market price for electricity.  The two track each other very closely and have done so pretty much since the market was established.  The following graphs illustrate that there is generally a trend of increasing prices for electricity across Europe.  Ireland is broadly following the trend but our industrial prices are generally above the EU average and our domestic prices, while closer to the EU average, are none the less above the EU average although slightly below the euro area price.</p><p>  There are three broad gas price drivers.</p> <p>The first, which makes up 50% of a typical gas bill, is the actual cost of the gas itself.  That cost is linked to the wholesale price of gas in Great Britain, the market from which we access our supplies.  That wholesale price is pretty much outside Ireland&rsquo;s control.  Another factor is the euro-sterling exchange rate.  For example, while there was a rise in wholesale gas prices in 2013, this was offset by the exchange rate which went in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.</p><p> The second major component of gas prices is the cost of networks, both transmission and distribution.  Most of these costs are fixed.  In this area, falling demand is a key factor.  As these costs are largely fixed, where there is falling demand, those revenues have still to be recovered.  This was a key factor in the price determination in 2013.  Between 8% and 10% of the gas price is related to supply costs.</p><p> Bord G&aacute;is Energy originally requested a 5.43% rise in residential tariffs.  This would have been in excess of 7% were it not for a decision the commission took on transmission tariffs that knocked some millions of euro off the process.  More demand is a key driver of the price rise which we ultimately sanctioned and which came to 2.04%.  The transmission and distribution pipes need to be there to meet demand, particularly during cold spells in the winter, and they need to be paid for.  With falling demand, the average unit price of those pipes rises.  We recognise that an average rise of &euro;16 in gas bills is significant but we have sought to exercise the maximum constraint through our examination of costs.  Across Europe, gas prices have tended to rise but Irish gas prices still compare favourably with the EU average and the eurozone average.</p><p> We continue to see switching rates in both the electricity and gas markets at 11% and 17% respectively.  These rates are reasonably good by European standards.  One of the key drivers to this reasonably healthy level of switching is the fact that the process is easy and free.  This has allowed people to exercise choice, 250,000 in the electricity market and 110,000 people in the gas market in 2012.</p><p> We recognise that in these difficult times people are struggling with meeting bills.  As a result, we have put in place various measures to support the overall system whereby if people fall into arrears they can be supported.  We have seen a fall in the level of disconnections and we have seen a strong roll-out of pay-as-you-go meters.  This is an area we are continuously reviewing.  An accreditation system has been established to allow price-comparison websites to be launched.  We have set out minimum service levels suppliers must provide in the cases of disconnections.  Disconnections are a last resort.  There is no reason for a person in financial difficulty to be disconnected as a pay-as-you-go meter is available to them.  We are actively engaging with stakeholders such as St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, to promote the roll-out of these meters, as well as working with local authorities to ensure the message is disseminated among their housing tenants.  We have worked with the networks business to ensure the roll-out is as efficient as possible.  Installation rates have improved significantly compared to 12 months ago.</p></speech>

Some of the half-year accounts for some energy suppliers show large profits.  Is the commission taking everything into account when one of these energy suppliers requests a price increase?  The commission claims it is setting a price based completely on the cost of the gas and the network with a marginal profit for the suppliers involved.  How can they earn billion euro profits in a full year then?</p><p>  There are significant charges for those who were disconnected from the network to be reconnected.  Even those making small alterations to their houses or changing meters are being landed with &euro;3,000 bills.  Will the commission explain the reasons for this?</p></speech>

I know these are difficult economic times and people are concerned about any price increases.  We are trying to keep prices to the most possible minimum level.  Energy companies make profits.  However, the legislation is set up so that like any other commercial company, they are allowed to make reasonable profits.  Whether they are State or private is not an issue for the commission.  We are there to ensure they have a reasonable rate of return.</p> <p> The committee had a concern that the ESB's first half profits were high last year.  I said at the time that the second half would be much lower, and I think that turned out to be the case.  We also sent details to the committee last year about ESB profitability in general, and how it compared to other companies abroad in a similar position; by that I mean large companies that have both generation and networks.  I can resend those to the committee and come back and discuss them if members wish, but they show that ESB's profitability is actually slightly lower.  Any sense of a State company earning profits can annoy people in difficult times, but I can assure the committee we are doing our best to keep the profitability low and price at cost.</p><p> When we are setting cost, we do not set electricity costs.  We rely on competitive forces in a deregulated market.  To some extent that is in accordance with the whole European Commission framework and our statutory objective to promote competition, which would see that in the medium to long run, competition is better than regulation.  On the specific gas aspect, we did everything we could to keep costs low.  I know that even 2% is difficult, but gas price increases in other countries have been significantly above this.  For example, the average gas price increase in Great Britain was about 9% to 10%.   We have done everything we can to keep things low.  I really believe that and I hope I have done my best to convince the committee on this.</p></speech>

I apologise for not precisely remembering the numbers, but I think it was a 7% increase.  As we are bound to do, we had to consult on that and give a period of time for people to comment on it.  We noted in the consultation that the company had asked for 7%.  We were minded to give the company less, but we also noted that over the six to eight weeks before a final decision was due, fossil fuel prices could change and in fact, they did change.  Gas prices basically increased over the eight week period, so as a result, the final increase was higher than 7%, even though we still cut costs.  We did our very best to put that message across.  Perhaps we could have done better, because it somehow got lost at the time.  However, I can assure the Deputy that in the end the company applied for an increase of 1% to 1.5% above what we ultimately sanctioned.   Perhaps we could do better with our message next time, but I can assure the Deputy that we did not give the company more than it sought.</p></speech>

Where more competition exists with suppliers, does it follow that unit prices are lower?  There is much debate about wind generation, alternative renewable energy and so on.  We also hear that we are importing nuclear energy from the UK.  Perhaps the witnesses can clarify if that is the case.</p></speech>

In arriving at the unit price, does the CER consider the wider competitiveness of the economy and the social affordability when setting prices?  One of the biggest overheads of small to medium enterprises is energy.  We can continue to raise prices if we are going to reduce economic activity.  Does that come into the consideration of the CER?</p><p>  Mr. Nolan also mentioned the circumstances that cause challenges on the social side.  Unfortunately, there are still many disconnections for people who simply cannot afford their utility bills.  Are these taken into account generally when the CER is setting the price?  Mr. Nolan said that the switching rates are quite healthy when compared to other jurisdictions but they have gone from 20% in 2009 to 11% in 2012.  Perhaps he can explain why that has happened.</p><p>  I note from the presentation that the CER remit goes into the approval of capital expenditure for the various utilities.  Is it right that the CER must approve any major capital investments by utility companies before they go ahead with them?  The EirGrid proposals are topical.  Does the CER have a role in approving those investment proposals?  If it does, are comparisons made between an overground investment versus an underground investment?  I ask that because many members of the public are calling for underground proposals from EirGrid.  What impact would that have on the unit cost of electricity?  There needs to be more clarity on this issue.  We are told that putting wires underground costs three times more than overheads.  If that is the case, does it have an impact on the unit price of electricity?</p><p>  The CER is taking on a new role, with responsibility for water networks and systems.  The CER is independent and responsible for ensuring appropriate standards of supply of all utilities, including the gas, the electricity and now water.  It is my understanding that where an electricity supply is contracted to a business or domestic user, such an electricity supply must to be a certain standard, as per the contract.  Do penalties apply if that supply or utility is sub-standard? Does the CER have a role in that?  If somebody has a contracted electricity supply and it is sub-standard, the utility is penalised to some degree.  Will such penalties apply in the case of water, if pressure or quality of the water are substandard?  What is the role of the CER in setting the free threshold or allowance for domestic consumers with regard to water?</p></speech>

Competing entities and consumers have a choice between them.  In answer to the question on renewable and nuclear energy, there is probably a small element of nuclear energy coming in under the new east-west interconnector from the UK.  It is probably not very much, simply because the use of nuclear energy by the UK has fallen considerably in the last five years.  There is some coming in, but it is not a huge amount in terms of affecting the price here.  There is not enough interconnection.  The interconnector is valuable for all kinds of reasons but the nuclear energy does not have a huge effect.</p><p>  Renewable energy is a very controversial and interesting area.  Without going into too much detail, nearly 17% of our electricity comes from wind energy, and that proportion will rise considerably over the next seven or eight years.  By and large, when the wind blows it is nearly free, so that drives down the price a lot.  On the other hand, perhaps two thirds or even 70% of the time, the wind does not blow so it has no effect.  The overall average affect of that depends on what the price of gas would have been.  If gas or coal prices are very high, then renewable energy will lower the price.  If gas prices are very low, then renewable energy may actually raise the price somewhat.  There is that sort of trade off and it will really depend on fossil fuel prices generally.  The public service obligation, or PSO, is set by government policy but the CER calculates it every year.  A proportion of that - perhaps 2.5% of the entire electricity bill - goes on supports for renewable energy, so that is also a factor.</p><p>  I will pass on to my colleague to deal with the other queries, bar the networks and water.</p></speech>

Until recently, the consumer was exposed to the cost of both a disconnection and a reconnection, but a decision taken by the CER reduced the exposure for customers to 50% of that disconnection.</p> <p>The issue of disconnections is a concern for us.  The pay-as-you-go meter is a real alternative to disconnection which we encourage customers to take and is free for customers in financial hardship.  We are trying to get the message out that customers in difficulty must engage with their supplier.  Suppliers have clear guidelines under which they must engage with customers, including trying to implement a payment plan which will allow the customer to meet his or her bills and, if that fails, offering a pay-as-you-go meter.  We would encourage people to take that up as an alternative to disconnection.</p></speech>

We have put some rules on the market whereby every time a customer who has taken a pay-as-you-go meter buys a top-up, a certain proportion of that goes to pay off the debt and the remainder goes towards the electricity the customer will use.  We have put in place very strict rules whereby suppliers have to contact the customer a certain number of times by telephone, e-mail or letter before they can discuss disconnection.  We audit the suppliers in terms of how they perform and so far they have outperformed against the rules we have put in place.  We are working with them on that to see what further rules can be developed.</p></speech>

On social affordability, the only residential tariff we set is the gas price.  We do not have a social tariff system in Ireland.  In setting the gas price, our role is to examine all aspects of cost, including the networks, gas price and cost of supply, to ensure they are as low as practicable in the circumstances.  Social welfare schemes, such as the free gas and free electricity allowances, deal with people's ability to pay, and those are outside our remit and outside the energy market.</p><p>  The fall-off in switching was mentioned.  We would like to see healthier levels of switching across the piece, but the gas switching level of 17% is regarded as a healthy level of switching at a European level.  The level of switching in the electricity market is lower than it was but is still above the threshold we set in terms of the indicators for there being enough competition in the market for us to deregulate.  It is lower than it was.  One factor in that was that there were some very successful marketing campaigns by certain suppliers in the market two or three years ago and that generated a very high level of switching.  Perhaps that level of marketing is not there now, but at 10% or 11% it is still a reasonably high level of switching.</p></speech>

The higher the level of switching, the more competitive an offering customers will receive from a supplier because suppliers will want to keep that custom.  We recognise there is a certain level of inertia among 60% of customers and we are trying to think of ways to engage with those customers to get them to think about moving.  Some customers still think if they change supplier their electricity supply will somehow be less secure, which is not the case.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, EirGrid is a monopoly which we regulate directly.  Capital expenditure and all its expenditure, capital and operating, must be approved by us.  In accordance with standard practice for economic regulators, we generally do this by way of a five year plan.  I hope that does not sound too Stalinist.  Every five years we do a very major review of prices, capital expenditure, operating expenditure and make it as efficient and make as many cuts as possible.  We are doing one again in the next 18 months.  In so doing, the capital expenditure comes for approval in terms of expenditure by the CER.</p><p>  Undergrounding and overgrounding have received much attention recently.  We have approved some of the capital expenditure on the basis of it being overgrounded.  In terms of the effect the Deputy referred to regarding undergrounding, I will try to give my best estimates.  The one in three to which the Deputy referred was an independent study commissioned by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which focused specifically on one project, the North-South interconnector.  It was done by a panel of independent experts and came out with a conservative estimate that there would be at least a 3:1 ratio in terms of capital expenditure, and maybe a little higher.  The only thing for which there is very clear evidence is that there is at least a 3:1 ratio on capital expenditure.</p><p>  Some of the other projects, including Grid Link and Grid West, have not been subject to that specific degree of analysis.  In terms of the estimates I will talk about, we are assuming roughly a 3:1 proportion generally.  That could vary according to different minds but that is our best guess now.  If one gets that 3:1 proportion, and this is purely capital cost, we estimate it will lead to an overall increase of approximately &euro;2.1 billion to underground all those projects instead of overgrounding.  I will not comment on whether that is right, wrong or indifferent.  That is our current estimate.  In terms of the effect undergrounding would have on prices, generally capital projects cost a lot to build and are paid for over time.  Something of that nature is generally recovered over 40 years, or in this case more likely 50 years.  We have done some imperfect estimates.  If the three major projects that are the subject of this debate, Grid West, Grid Link and the North-South interconnector, were all undergrounded, we estimate it would lead to an average increase of 3% per year for the next 50 years.  That is our best estimate.  That is 3% on one's bill every month.</p></speech>

Let us optimistically say one's bill is &euro;100 per year.  If nothing else changed for the next 50 years, one would pay &euro;103 per year for the next 50 years.  That is our best estimate but there are some caveats.  In terms of the expert opinion we have seen, this is on the lower end of the range.  There have been some estimates that it could be higher than that.  The independent report is our main source and it suggested that one in three was the minimum level.  There are two possible issues relating to that.  Although this has not been worked out to the same quantitative extent, it is likely that operating costs of an underground cable may be somewhat higher than an overground cable.  I have spoken about capital expenditure.  In terms of maintaining that cable, we have reason to believe from what we have seen that the operating costs would be likely to be higher.  I am not trying to give a definitive view.  There are also potential quality issues.  I am going to be very careful about this.  It is not so much that there would be more faults with an underground cable, there probably would not be, but faults in an underground cable of that magnitude might be more difficult and take longer to fix and could therefore present as some kind of security of supply risk.  I am not trying to pass the buck, but this is a debate for society and the Oireachtas to deal with, and I am trying to present the facts.</p></speech>

I am not trying to box the CER into a corner, but is it correct that the CER would have to approve that level of investment before EirGrid could go ahead with it?  Am I correct in thinking that EirGrid has only made the overhead proposals to the CER for approval and that it has not sought approval for any underground lines?</p></speech>

I will do my best to answer the question, but I want to let the Chairman know that.  We have not been called before any other committee on this.</p><p>  The CER does not have a role in regard to the free allowance.  That is essentially a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.  In regard to quality of supply, I cannot answer that question because it will depend on the legislation that is ultimately approved.  I will make some general comments regarding quality of water supply, but in the context of looking forward to a role we do not have.  There is a sense that significant investment is required in water over the next period.  People have talked a lot about the cost of water, but often they are just talking about the cost in terms of providing clean drinking water.  Our estimates so far, which are not perfect, are that the overall cost of providing water is just over half of the cost, because much of the cost is for waste water disposal - efficient and clean disposal of waste water and sewage.  Significant investment will be required in that area.  I am not answering the Deputy's question precisely, but the answer depends on the legislation and the role we are given.</p></speech>

I have six questions.  I preface my remarks by saying that sometimes we put questions to witnesses when we should be putting them to ourselves, because we are the people who decide on legislation and determine policy.</p><p>  The Gas Regulation Bill 2013 passing through the Houses allows for the privatisation of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  I fear this increases the risk of large price hikes and the prevalence of fuel poverty.  I am sure the CER is aware of the rumblings of price fixing between the big six in the British market and I fear we face the same risk here.  Will Mr. Nolan talk us through how these concerns will be addressed?</p><p>  I get confused when I look at claims regarding electricity price increases.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul states it paid &euro;10.4 million in 2011 for households that could not pay their electricity charges.  That sum is 25% of what the society pays out in total.  In 2008, the amount it paid out was &euro;3.8 million.  A major factor in this increase is that people's incomes have been dramatically reduced over the years, but there has been an increase of approximately &euro;500 per household in energy bills over the past three years.  However, when we look at the percentage increase figures issued, they state the increase is 2.04% or similar.  This does not seem as if it could amount to &euro;500 per household over the past three years.  Am I reading this wrong or are there different measurements being used by different bodies?</p><p>  Does the CER have any input into regulation of or has it any control of the price of connecting to the national grid?  I am aware of a person in Monaghan who invested a good deal of his money in developing a biomass project.  This project could work wonders at reducing the amount of waste for landfill and could provide significant industry in such a rural area.  Everything was going swimmingly with the project until this person began to inquire about the cost of connecting to the national grid.  He was quoted a cost of &euro;500,000, which meant the project could go nowhere.  My concern is that while we say the right words regarding micro generation, we are not serious about it.  We are so blinded by the headline projects that we forget about the micro ones.  Does the CER have any input or responsibility for the cost of connection to the national grid?  Is a change required in this regard?</p><p>  Until quite recently, I was not aware of the need for so-called security deposits for small industries.  A man who runs a hotel in the north east was billed for a &euro;15,000 security deposit, despite the fact he had been with the company for a number of years.  He assures me he always paid his bills promptly, but he received a bill for a security deposit of &euro;15,000.  He did not have that money available to pay straight away, but the company came to disconnect his hotel, despite the fact there were guests in it and despite the fact the owner had paid his bills on time for the previous two years or so.  I believe this practice is wrong.  A security deposit should not be handled in the same way as an outstanding bill.  Also, in the context of being able to switch suppliers, because the &euro;15,000 showed as a debt against his business, the potential for this man to switch was zero.  He had to go to the bank to get the money and pay company so that his supply would be maintained.  This practice is wrong and is anti-business.  It is certainly anti-small business.</p><p>  My next question concerns the CER's view on consumer prices, which has been partly answered.  Part of my question related to the situation if renewable energy development is accelerated.  What does the CER feel the impact would be on electricity prices if fracking for shale gas or nuclear energy is permitted in this country?  Does the CER have people working with it who can look at what is happening in these markets?  Is the CER aware that the realistic lifetime of a fracking well is not 20 years, as claimed, but only four or five years?  What is the role of the CER in regard to this and how does it see fracking for shale gas impacting on prices if it is permitted here?</p><p>  If Ireland or any nation tries to ride the two horses of renewable energy and, for example, shale gas development, one or both will suffer.</p> <p>We cannot afford to ride the two horses.  I am concerned renewable energy will suffer for the short-term gain available from other energy sources.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on this.</p></speech>

The privatisation issue is delicate and it is a policy issue.  If Bord G&aacute;is Energy were privatised, we would treat it in exactly the same way.  At present we set a regulated price and it is likely in the near future, as with electricity, the market will be deemed sufficiently competitive that we will not set direct controls over it.  As to whether a private or public company would behave differently, it is a difficult question for me to answer and I will not express a specific opinion if that is all right.  We will treat it in exactly the same way regardless.  Last year, I told the committee that in my view there is a very strong case for keeping essential networks such as the wires and gas pipes in State control.  The issue of whether a company which generates and sells energy but is not a natural monopoly should be publicly or privately owned is a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.  It is a policy issue.</p></speech>

The average annual gas bill in Ireland is approximately &euro;982 and the average annual electricity bill is approximately &euro;1,200.  A typical household incurs just in excess of approximately &euro;2,100 to &euro;2,200 per year in energy bills.  Referring back to the graph we showed earlier, prices have been increasing throughout Europe since 2008.  I do not have the exact figures but the &euro;500 in the context of an overall energy bill of &euro;2,200 would not be completely unreasonable given the changes in gas and electricity prices which have occurred since 2008.  I cannot give specific numbers and I will have to come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We do not have a view on the hedging policies of independent entities.  When it comes to gas prices, Bord G&aacute;is Energy hedges.  It typically hedges at least a year in advance but it does not hedge all of its fuel price.  It hedges various tranches for various periods of time.  When we come to set the final price of gas, some fuel needs to be hedged and hence the price can increase or decrease.  For every day in the year the amount of gas it has contracted in the wholesale markets will never exactly meet its demands.  It will always either be selling into the spot market or buying from the spot market on the day.  There can never be absolute certainty over the price of gas.</p></speech>

Security deposits are a matter for individual companies.  We do not have anything in our guidelines which prohibits security deposits.  However, there is a clear process in our guidelines that if somebody feels any aspect of the service they receive is unfair, or makes a complaint to a supplier, and a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the consumer complains to us.  We have a statutory obligation to deal with these complaints and we have powers of arbitration in that we make binding determinations.  If we find against the supplier or the network company, the decision is binding on it and this can include compensation or a reversal of a decision.  Where somebody facing disconnection has a genuine complaint or dispute, a disconnection would not be carried out until we have dealt with the issue at hand.</p></speech>

The Deputy's concern is it stops customers switching because they cannot afford to pay the deposit.  We want to increase switching rates so we will examine it.  We will come back to the Deputy on this issue when we have finished our work with the suppliers to see what the issue is.  We must remember the supplier buys electricity at the wholesale price and is responsible for paying for it as soon as it is taken.  Many customers do not get billed until after they have used the electricity so a deposit is required to cover the risk from when the supplier buys the electricity to when the customer pays for it.</p></speech>

The vast majority of our gas comes from the UK National Balancing Point, NBP, which is the main liquid hub for gas.  We price against this.  I expect any new source of gas will mark to this market.  Having cheap gas from a source would not necessarily mean the market price for the gas was cheaper.  Certainly it would compete against the NBP price but it does not follow it would be substantially lower because it would be priced against what was available elsewhere in the market.</p></speech>

A body of thought is emerging which suggests that such developments do not stand up to a cost-benefit analysis.  The question arises, therefore, of whether wind energy makes economic sense.  Does the CER have an opinion on that?</p><p> The witnesses stated that CER plays a role in ensuring safety in energy generation.  Does that role extend to health and, if not, perhaps the witnesses will comment on the matter.  Has it considered providing a line for Deputies to make inquiries about providers?  When we receive representations we try to contact the relevant provider but we are told they can only deal with the account holder.</p></speech>

There have been a significant number of renewable developments in Germany, partially wind but also solar, and some people are now asking whether they were worth it.  The Nordic countries are broadly supportive of renewables.  I hope I am not characterising people unreasonably when I note that many of the eastern European countries are sceptical about renewables.</p><p>  The vast majority of our renewables are envisaged to involve wind.  Hydroelectric power generation is not suitable for the Irish system.  Our target is to achieve 40% wind energy by 2020.  On the Deputy's question about whether it will be cheaper, much will depend on the price of fossil fuels.  I will try to explain the factors behind that answer.  If the price of gas in 2020 is the same as its current price, it is likely that we will have more expensive electricity overall as a result of taking on 40% wind.  However, if the price of gas increases, we may have cheaper electricity.  It is a complex task to model the factors that will determine the outcome.  We have done some modelling ourselves and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Eirgrid are also conducting a study of various scenarios.  Subsidies for wind generation relate to the public service obligation.  My estimate, which I think is reasonably accurate, is that wind's contribution to the overall price of electricity in terms of subsidy is between 2% and 2.5%.  It is likely that the figure will rise over time but the subsidies are set for a fixed period and will eventually go away.  The other perceived cost to renewables is the fact that some element of capital expenditure on the grid is required for renewables.  Some of this investment is simply aimed at keeping the grid safe and secure and keeping the lights turned on, but a portion is required to support renewables.  The most obvious of the three projects in this regard is Grid West because much of the wind is in the west.  As opposed to what might be perceived as the cost of renewables, when the wind blows it is free.  It does not always blow but there is no question that the new entrants into the market are driving down the wholesale price and the average cost of generating electricity.  In terms of the overall balance, that is what the studies are trying to achieve.  Ultimately, they will come to some sort of view - I am not sure that I would say gamble - as to whether gas prices will be high or low in five, 15 or 20 years' time.  I apologise that I cannot give a precise answer but they are the factors affecting the matter.</p></speech>

We have a wider remit on safety in respect of the gas chain from well to burner tip.</p><p>  On the question of Deputies making representations on behalf of customers, the reluctance on the part of suppliers is firmly rooted in data protection issues and avoiding a breach of the Data Protection Acts.  I am not sure we could do anything to allow those Acts to be bypassed and I suggest that it is a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></speech>

I have heard some of their responses to members' questions but have missed other responses because I had to leave the meeting to attend other business.</p><p>  CER may become the regulator for Irish Water.  I hope it does not get this role because I am not satisfied with its record in regulating energy providers.  I recently travelled with several of my colleagues to a European country which forced all the suppliers to reduce their prices.  The country's President made the decision that prices should be cut by 33%.  In the context of the current recession, the most up to date figures by SEAI for 2012 show increase after increase despite the fact that businesses are suffering.  I am a small businessman.  The figures for businesses show they have had to endure frightening increases.  We are trying to build a competitive economy and good value but the increases keep coming.  Bord G&aacute;is recently applied for an increase of 5.43% but CER only agreed to 2.4%.  That is coming on top of other increases.  Other countries can force companies to cut prices.  When we visited the aforementioned country we asked how utilities will be affected and whether companies will be able to reinvest but people are lining up to take over the utility companies.  We are being led a merry dance and CER is ineffectual.</p><p>  I hope it is not given responsibility for Irish Water because the only good thing about Irish Water is the name, An Bord Uisce.  I do not agree with the decision to establish it because it will take away control and knowledge from local authorities, as happened with the HSE, SUSI and the driving licence fiasco.  Ordinary people are paying their bills.  Many people have been disconnected.  I disagree with the way that issue has been addressed.  It is not possible to argue over a bill; one must pay it.  Even when one pays it, one's credit rating is affected.  One cannot move anywhere else.  CER needs to be more robust because it is not doing the business for the consumer or the business person.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked about the wind strategy.</p> <p>The power generated from the wind strategy and whatever is taken across the routes all over the country, including those used by the Chairman.  I refer to the lack of engagement by the company that is doing this, the lack of meaningful consultation and the attitude that the company can do what it likes, where it likes and when it likes and that it can effectively ignore agencies, including Mr. Nolan's agency.  Is it merely ticking boxes?  The people are paying the piper and the prices are there to be seen.  I could read them out to Mr. Nolan as I have two pages of them here.  They are appalling.  Some of them are up as much as 15% over a 15 month period.  It is madness in a deep dark recession where everybody has been cut back, everybody has taken significant pain and businesses are trying to hang on.  These are areas where consumers feel them must pay because otherwise the lights will go out.  The likes of EirGrid have taken the attitude that they are keeping the lights on but it is at the expense of consumers paying the bills no matter what medicine they must take.  In this case, consumers must put up with whatever kind of infrastructure the company deems fit and nobody is to ask whether this is healthy or safe.  In his response, Mr. Nolan might explain if the CER has a role in that regard and has it a view on the proliferation of the wind energy as well?  On the vast amount of turbines being proposed, there is something mad going on here and it needs to be checked and reined in before we all are blighted with obstacles in the country.  There are other ways of looking at matters.</p><p> I have asked Mr. Nolan a number of questions.  I have no faith in the CER's ability to control prices in any shape or form.  Mr. Nolan may look at the page I hold here and see the evidence over the past number of years in which everybody has faced significant cutbacks.</p></speech>

I am sorry he has no faith in us.  All I can do is assure him that we are trying to keep costs as low as we possibly can.</p><p>  He asked about the mandate.  Our mandate is to set prices at the efficient cost.  I can go into more detail, if the committee likes.  The efficient cost of producing energy in Ireland has risen considerably, and, indeed, almost continually, for the past five or ten years.  There are a number of factors for that which I can go into.  I would also note that this has happened in many, not all, other European countries but I can explain that too.  I would look at the prices, for example, in the United Kingdom, which has a similar energy mix to us in the sense that they also rely mostly on gas and to some extent coal, and they used have nuclear.  Prices in the United Kingdom have risen considerably.  Over the past five or six years, they have risen by more than prices in Ireland.  Prices in France have not risen so much.  France is 80% nuclear.  Prices in Norway have not risen much.  Norway has 95% hydroelectric.  These countries are not subject to fossil-fuel prices.  They are not subject to external forces in the price of fossil fuels which, frankly, we, as a small country, cannot control.</p><p>  Given our mandate, we are supposed to set prices at efficient cost.  We are - all I can say is I give the committee my assurance for whatever that is worth - doing our best to keep it low.  I accept that it has been a most difficult five to six years for the Irish people.  I accept prices have risen and it is difficult to pay but we are doing all we can to keep prices as low as possible.  I am not sure if there is much more I can say on that.</p><p>  On wind, I was asked about the idea of networks.  I touched on this early.  The idea is we approve expenditure.  The planning structures, etc., on how that is done are ultimately a matter for EirGrid.  I would very much hope that there is open consultation.  I understand the idea that communities are affected by these matters and want to have their views taken on board.</p><p>  On the last comment on the proliferation of wind turbines, that is a policy issue.  The Government decided that there would be a 40% renewable target for various reasons, many of which are to do with climate change and carbon reduction.  That is ultimately a policy issue.  If the Government and the country want to achieve that, no doubt wind is our best and, to some extent, only option.  It is really not a matter for me to say whether that is the right choice or not.  The CER's job will be to ensure that it is done as efficiently as possible.</p></speech>

Has the CER ever refused outright a price increase request from a supplier and could they give the details and frequency, if any, of such outright refusals?</p><p>  On a separate matter, how can the CER justify its decision that all gas providers must pay for the cost of the two interconnectors between Britain and Ireland, whether they use them or not?  Are they aware that such decision is jeopardising a &euro;1 billion project in north Kerry by Shannon LNG which will create 650 jobs over four years during the construction phase and a further 50 permanent jobs?  How can such a decision be good for competition and keeping down or, perhaps even lowering, prices?  Could they explain the rationale for that?  If the High Court decision due today is in favour of that company, will they give a commitment not to pursue the matter further and allow the project, and the creation of those badly needed jobs, to proceed?</p></speech>

I have quite a few questions.</p><p>  How much extra does pay as you go cost the consumer?  Does it cost more per unit of electricity?  Is there interest to pay on what one is paying back?  Also, they make it sound a good deal more rosy than it is in that if consumers cannot pay their bills, they can go on pay as you go and will not be cut off.  That creates the following dire scenario.  If a child is unfortunate enough to live in a home where the parents are not organised enough for whatever reason or are not good with money, what solace will it be to that child as he or she sits in the dark and in the cold that mammy and daddy have pay as you go.  There were many scenarios in my youth where I did not know whether the lights would have been on and it would not have been reassuring to know that there was pay-as-you-go installed.</p><p>  At this stage, the three-to-one cost ratio in the underground-overground power lines argument is bordering on farce.  How can anyone have figures on this until he or she first asks the people whether they want the power lines to go underground or overground?  I said this last week at this committee but it seems it must be repeated because people keep missing the point.  One cannot have a ratio of overground to underground unless one knows what sort of terrain one is going through.  The ratio that we are getting appears to be the result of where they already decided we are going overground and chose a route on that basis and that it had better be fairly solid terrain on which to put the pylons, but if they decided first that they were putting it underground they would choose a different route.  This ratio is completely irrelevant.</p><p>  They estimate a 3% increase in electricity prices if the power lines go underground.  How did they arrive at this cost increase?  Also, there was mention of increased costs afterwards if the power lines go underground.  What about the decreases in costs from the danger of overhead lines being blown down?  We are told climate change is happening before our eyes and there will be more unpredictable weather.  Surely, they should be concluding that putting the power lines overground might involve more long-term costs.</p><p>  Has the CER any say over the power that will be produced in the midlands, and if not, why?</p> <p>Why have the proposals to produce electricity in the midlands not been included in the remit of the CER?  Is the legislation that set up the CER not cover all energy production in Ireland?  Can the delegates supply the legislation that governs the CER and show how the proposals designated for the midlands are exempted from its control, if that is the case?</p><p> Can the delegates indicate the term for the memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the UK, as we are in the dark on that one?  When will that finish?  What will happen to the carbon credits thereafter?  Are we, in effect, giving away our rights to these carbon credits forever?</p><p> In terms of renewable energy and wind turbines, will there be a gate 4 grid and, if so, when will those who are in the queue be formally invited into such a gate grid and for what year will that be?  If we are currently meeting our wind renewable energy targets under the Kyoto Protocol, which I understand we nearly are, with what is already connected and what is contracted to be connected, will we be setting new targets for even greater amounts of electricity from wind energy in the future and what might those targets be?  Would it not be sensible to have the carbon offset that would be created in the midlands available to us to meet future targets?  </p><p> Further to a question Deputy Colreavy asked - this fits into the idea of people's acceptance of renewable energy and I believe that if it was locally produced and driven it would receive much more acceptance - I have question on cost of connection.  Applications for a connection to the ESB are currently &euro;27,000 and that is only the cost to lodge an application - to say "Hello, I am there".  What sort of control has the CER over that cost?  From listening to what Ms Cathy Mannion said earlier, I understand that the CER is considering going back to the companies to see what they are thinking of doing about this.  This has been going on for way too long.  Irish people or non-nationals living here who want to set  up a biomass or an anaerobic digester plant or something like that and use their own private initiative are being prohibited from doing so.  We need to know what exactly the CER is doing about that.  The idea that one would have to hand over &euro;27,000 just to say "hello" to them is astonishing and it does not show a serious approach being taken when it comes to renewable energies, except if one is a big multinational and owns a bulldozer that one can use for consultation.</p></speech>

I apologise for having had to leave the meeting for a vote that was called in the Seanad.  I hope that none of the questions I have for the delegates have already been asked.  Some 110,500 customers switched suppliers last year.  Is an increase anticipated in the coming year?  On switching suppliers does a time stipulation apply?  Can a customer switch back to his or her previous supplier and switch forward to a competitor or must the customer remain with a supplier for six months, a year or two years?</p><p>  Pay-as-you-go meters have been installed.  Am I right in saying that they are installed free of charge?  What would be cost for a household comprising two adults and two children to pay under the normal meter compared to the cost of switching to the pay-as-you-go meter system?  Would the delegates have an idea of the comparison of annual costs for such a household?  Is there any saving between the two systems?  I believe the pay-as-you-go meter system is more expensive, although I cannot quantify that.  The delegates might confirm if that is the case.  </p><p>  I welcome what the delegates said that on the question of the disconnection of supply, every opportunity possible is given to consumers, including deferred payments.  I presume disconnection is a last resort ,and that is the way it should be.  Some colleagues mentioned reconnection costs.  I must declare that I am a former ESB employee.  I consider that reconnection costs are exorbitant.  It cost one consumer recently upwards on &euro;1,700 to be reconnected in circumstances where he had no outstanding bills.  He had his electricity disconnected while an extension, painting or rewiring work was being carried out and a reconnection fee of close to &euro;2,000 is exorbitant.  </p><p>  I note from one of the delegate's presentation that industrial and commercial prices in Ireland are above averages in the euro area and in the EU.  Is there a main reason that is the case?  Will the situation improve with EirGrid's G25 proposals for the next five to ten years?  Will electricity costs be more competitive for commercial, industrial and domestic consumers which would make us more competitive?  The delegates might comment on that aspect.</p></speech>

When the CER is establishing an price increase, does the level of profitability of a company play any apart in that calculation?  Does the CER get such information and are the delegates satisfied that they are getting accurate information in terms of company profitability?  Has there been a recent case here or elsewhere where were prices were lowered by an energy regulator instead of increased?  Have the delegates any figures for the projected timescale for the continuation of the supply of gas from Europe?  How long do they expect that we will able to continue to get gas from Europe?  Have any figures been produced to indicate that timescale?</p></speech>

On Deputy Griffin's question on whether the CER has ever refused a price increase, I have not been with the CER for its entire existence.  I am not sure about that and I will revert to the committee.  The general practice is that a company will generally put something in - the committee may not agree with this but a company will generally not put in an outrageous figure, it is generally a figure close to the cost - and we generally reduce that.  I am not sure if we have ever gone to zero but, in anticipating Deputy Colreavy's question, we certainly have had price reductions in the past, admittedly not in the past two or three years but we have certainly ordained price reductions.</p></speech>

On the question of the Shannon LNG case, the judgment issued today, I will say two things about it.  The first issue is that we took that decision, and probably given that it is in some sense still potentially <i>sub judice</i> in the context of the court, we believed that if we did not change the framework that existed, and we did so in accordance with European law, gas prices in the country would be significantly higher over the next ten, 20 or 30 years.  There were various numbers but we were thinking of a potential transfer from the producer to the consumer of hundreds of millions of euro; therefore, gas prices would be hundreds of millions of euro higher over the period of time.  I accept the points about the jobs and I have no problem saying that I would very much like to see the project go ahead.</p> <p> On the question of jobs, that is not something we are allowed to consider from a statutory aspect.  We are supposed to be focusing on the cost of fuels.</p><p> I cannot give the undertaking sought by the Deputy and we must wait to see the judgment.  In general, we will have to take what is in our view the best interest of the consumer in our decisions.  That is all I can say on the issue.</p></speech>

How could that be good for competition and prices?</p></speech>

I will try to give a short answer, which is the sense that the interconnectors need to be paid for.  They were authorised before the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was set up and they provide valuable security of supply benefits.  Given the nature of the way the charging system was when they were set up, the price of gas from Britain was linked to their usage.  To give a hypothetical numerical example, if the cost of price was &euro;100 and the price of transport was &euro;5, if use of the interconnector fell drastically, the cost of transport could rise to &euro;20, so the overall price of gas would go from &euro;105 to &euro;120.  We believed that would be difficult and harmful to consumers so we changed the system.  I have probably said all I can on that issue.  We will see what happens with the court case and then take a view.</p></speech>

Certainly, the power exists, although that is all I can say.  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked about a variety of issues.  On the 3:1 ratio estimate relating to costs, we have not made a decision about undergrounding or overgrounding.  EirGrid has a view that an overground solution was the most cost-efficient for at least the North-South interconnector, although the decision has not been made for the other two.  The Department also commissioned a report.  The Deputy is questioning the 3:1 ratio, indicating that an underground solution might take a very different route attracting a lower cost.  I do not know if I can comment on that specifically but the independent report examined scenarios and came out with a particular view.  I do not know if that satisfies the Deputy's point but it is essentially the process that has happened.</p><p>  I mentioned a caveat about the other two issues earlier, and there was less surety about potential increased operating costs.  That is something we will continue to follow.  In terms of quality, I indicated earlier there may be fewer faults, although they may be slightly more difficult to fix.  I am not making definitive claims on that and we can pursue the matter further if the Deputy so wishes.</p><p>  With regard to renewables, Gate 4 and general issues, the CER is currently planning to do something about - for want of a better word - what we call Gate 4.  We will consider if targets have been met and what scope there is for further connection from renewables to the grid.  However, that will be guided to some extent by Government policy and it will depend partially on whether the 40% targets are being met.  We will take some policy guidance on that.  There is a process in place to consult early in the new year about connections along the lines of Gate 4.</p><p>  On the midlands issue, I do not wish to be evasive, although the Deputy may think I am.  It is a policy matter.  Some of our staff are engaged in working groups on the issue but it is really a matter for the Government to decide whether this should go forward.  If it is going forward, it is unclear as to whether the process will be regulated.  If it is set up in a way that is connected to the main grid, it is likely there would be a regulatory role for the CER.  Currently, some of the proposals are that it will be an entirely separate entity from the electricity grid, with wind turbines directly connected to the UK.  If that is the case, it is unlikely we would have any regulatory role unless the Oireachtas chooses to give us one.</p></speech>

We began with the &euro;2.1 billion figure.  I indicated earlier to an idea that the way major network investments are made - particularly one of this magnitude - is to pay for them over 50 years.  We considered the &euro;2.1 billion as going over the 50-year period.  It is repaid according to a rate of return, which is standard for all major network investments.  We used a couple of different rates of returns and got a figure around that.  We have basically considered how to pay the &euro;2.1 billion over 50 years, which is standard practice, with a rate of return allowed on the investment.</p></speech>

One has those customers who for reasons of financial hardship receive a pay-as-you-go meter from ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is Networks.  For those customers the price is the same if not cheaper than the standard tariffs offered by those suppliers.  There are other suppliers on the market whom I will not name but the committee probably knows who offer pay-as-you-go meters for lifestyle choices.  People who take those meters tend to pay more for their electricity than those who have meters installed due to financial hardship.  Those customers have made a lifestyle choice and have decided to go with those suppliers and therefore implicitly have decided to pay those charges.</p></speech>

The key point on the pay-as-you-go option is that in the case of financial hardship the cost of the meter is socialised, whereas, where a choice is involved the company offering it needs to recover the cost.</p><p>  The process for switching in Ireland is straightforward and it is free.  One exercises one&rsquo;s choice freely and there is no prohibition on people re-exercising the choice to switch to another supplier.  However, certain suppliers when they sign up customers might have reached a certain deal with them and there might be a termination provision in the contract but, generally speaking and all things being equal, if it is a straightforward domestic supply contract without any of those provisions then customers are free to switch at any time they choose.</p><p>  We have addressed the question on the cost of pay-as-you-go meters.  Essentially, where there is financial hardship the cost is socialised and recovered through the market but where financial hardship is not an issue and the meters are offered by a commercial entity the cost must be recovered by it through its tariffs.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan also inquired about pay-as-you-go meters.  It is important to bear in mind that if somebody is on a pay-as-you-go meter and they do not make payments then their electricity could be cut off.</p></speech>

In terms of the idea that pay-as-you-go meters would be rolled out without any regard, that is something of which we have to take due account.  For example, when suppliers deal with customers they also check to see whether the customers are vulnerable.  That has some impact on whether they offer the meters.</p></speech>

Deputy Flanagan is correct; one is going from being disconnected by a network to self-disconnection and that creates its own problems.  We know that and what we have done is put emergency credits on the meter so that at least in one of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy there is some credit that will let people continue to use electricity for a period.  The amount is approximately &euro;5 which is perhaps a day or so&rsquo;s worth of electricity.  Another measure is that at certain times of the day or over weekends the meter will not disconnect because one wants people to have the opportunity to buy credit in order to top up their meter.  What one does not want to happen is that the electricity would run out during the night and that suddenly there would be no electricity.</p><p>  I have one other point to make about vulnerable customers.  The supplier has to demonstrate to us that the customer actively wants to have a pay-as-you-go meter for the very simple fact that it is self-disconnection and it does not suit certain customers.  The supplier has to be very clear with the customer on whether they want that type of meter.</p></speech>

One outstanding question is about electricity prices and why they might be higher in Ireland than in other areas.  One point to note from an earlier slide is that gas dominates the pricing of electricity in Ireland whereas, as the commissioner, Mr. Nolan, noted earlier, other countries benefit from the wide availability of relatively cheap nuclear energy or hydro energy, which we do not have.  That could be one factor on why prices are higher here than elsewhere.  There is also the fact in terms of gas, for example, that it has to be transported over longer distances in order to reach the Irish market.  There are a number of factors feeding into electricity prices.</p></speech>

I made a point about the EirGrid G25 proposals.  Will that help to liberalise or equalise the cost of commercial and industrial units to domestic consumers?</p></speech>

Grid25 is being rolled out for a number of reasons, first, to help meet renewable targets.  The wires are needed in order to ensure the system can handle that level of renewables, but also to ensure that the lights stay on.  Much of the emphasis on grid roll-out is on security of supply.  A cost will be associated with those wires but, for example, the North-South interconnector infrastructure would remove between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million of constraint costs from the single electricity market per annum.  I think that is the correct number but it might be lower than that &ndash; between &euro;20 million and &euro;30 million.  In that instance, that particular wire has a direct cost impact on the market.</p></speech>

On whether we look at the profitability, no, we look at the costs underlying the price.</p><p>  In terms of gas from the EU, I would not be able to give any definitive view on the matter.  We would have to consider whether there is available information in terms of how long it will last.  Since my time in the energy industry, the availability of gas at a European and global level has continued to go further out.</p> <p>It is fair to observe that the change in the gas price situation in the United States is an example of where further resources have been sourced.  This has had an impact in Europe in terms of the price of coal, for example.</p></speech>

The legislation for the CER is for all of Ireland.  Has a provision been built into it that I have not seen?  Have we now gone so far that not only is Ireland an offshore windfarm for Britain but also part of Britain?  The CER does not seem to have any say.  It is strange that the legislation establishing the CER concerns the whole of the country.  How come there is a hole in the midlands?</p></speech>

Our legislation is supposed to protect customers, those who will actually be charged for Irish electricity in Ireland.  I spoke about generation and supply.  Bearing in mind what I said about the connection to the grid, the key is that we are supposed to regulate the grid.  The grid has a specific legal existence in some sense.  In particular, it must be a monopoly and one cannot privately build one's own grid.  The statutory objective is to regulate it to set an efficient cost and to allow connections to it for generators.  Without the connection to the grid, we would not have a statutory role.  If, as a result of what I have alluded to, energy were not directly sold into the Irish market and people were not supplying that directly, we would not have a role.</p></speech>

If there is a connection to the grid, we must have some sort of regulatory role.  As to how that would be constituted, I do not know.
