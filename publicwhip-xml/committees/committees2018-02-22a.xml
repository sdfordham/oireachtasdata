He is accompanied by Ms Patricia Devlin, the deputy director of audit in his office.  Apologies have been received from Deputies McDonald, Cassells, Aylward and Farrell.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 15 February 2018.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I have one question in this regard.  We wrote to the HSE a week or two ago about salary overpayments.  Has any response been received?  I understand we will have a reply to that next week.  That is grand.  It may or may not be a significant item.  We will wait and see.  We will move on to correspondence received.  We have some correspondence today.</p> <p>  The first item of correspondence is No. 1105A, briefing material from the Revenue Commissioners for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 1107A is briefing material on corporation tax from Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish that and circulate it to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, both of which may also have an interest in it.</p> <p>  Under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings of this committee, No. 1081 was received on 12 February last from the Higher Education Authority.  It comprises a follow-up review report, carried out by Dr. Richard Thorn, regarding certain matters and allegations relating to the University of Limerick.  We mentioned this last week.  Dr. Graham Love has requested that the report be dealt with confidentially and that it not be published.  He has also mentioned that there are three related ongoing High Court actions.  Having checked with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser here in Leinster House, we have circulated the report.  I propose that we will respect the request for confidentiality and therefore will not publish it.  The report is available to members but is not being published.  I ask members not to publish or circulate it by any other means.  We will note the item for now.</p></speech>

The previous item, No. 1087, is a letter providing figures "before and after the Tribunal determination for the valuations upheld and changed by the Valuation Tribunal by reference to .... the C&amp;AG chapter".  Mr. O'Sullivan says in the letter that "because of the requirement to validate this information with the records of the Tribunal, I regret that it was not possible to have same included with the material forwarded to the Committee with my letter of 8th February" and accordingly, he is now asking us to include this document with our previous correspondence received from the Valuation Office.

We understand that issue.  We ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come back to us on that specific issue as part of his ongoing work.  We will let him report back on whatever he thinks is the best and most efficient format from his point of view.</p> <p>  No. 1089 is a letter, dated 14 February 2018, from Mr. John McCarthy, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Following our recent discussions on the funding of local authorities, we requested follow-up information on local government funding and local property tax allocations, as well as a note from the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  We will note and publish that.  We have that on our work programme.  They will be coming before the committee in a couple of weeks.  We will discuss that on our work programme.</p> <p>  No. 1091 is correspondence, dated 15 February 2018, from Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, who is the chief executive of the National Shared Services Office, providing follow-up information in relation to the previous meeting.  I have marked item No. 8 on the correspondence in question and I want to raise it now.  We asked her for a written explanatory note on how the figure for temporary rehabilitation remuneration is calculated.  I was keen to know how they calculate this figure when people are out for extended periods on temporary remuneration for rehabilitation purposes.  She wrote back to say that regulation 6 "provides that the rate of pay of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is the same as the rate of pension that the individual would be paid if they were to be ill-health retired".  In other words, I asked her how her office calculates this and she wrote to say that it calculates it in the same way that it calculates something else.  We will have to go back to ask her to give us a specific information note on how this figure is calculated.  It is not enough to say it is calculated in the same way as something else if we do not know how the something else is calculated either.  Deputies will understand my question.</p></speech>

This is the one where they had the overpayments.  It subsequently transpired that there were substantial overpayments in other payroll systems in the public service, the biggest one being the HSE.  We will have a response from the HSE next week in relation to the level of overpayments in the HSE.  At that point, we will be able to compile a more complete picture.  The National Shared Services Office deals with a certain number of public servants only.</p></speech>

If it is for the chamber of commerce, maybe it is reasonable enough.  Who is getting their third-level fees paid?  The relevant figure is &euro;47,000.  The figure for training - &euro;270,000 - is still huge.  Are we employing untrained people to the extent that such a significant amount of the budget needs to go into training?  I suggest that &euro;80,000 seems a lot for office security.  I have made a couple of points on that.

Dr. Love has indicated that no further action is required because this report has been given to us.  We are not going to circulate it, but it has been given to us.  The difficulty is that we will have a report from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We do not know what that report will contain.  Therefore, it is not right to say that at this point no further action is required.</p> <p>  I am even more concerned about a second point.  It states that on the basis of Dr. Thorn's findings, the HEA is satisfied that no further action is required in this regard apart from the need for UL to implement fully the recommendations made by Deloitte.  I have a difficulty with that.  Deloitte should not set down recommendations.  It can publish a report, but at some point we will have our own report which will deal with some of these issues.  It is up to policymakers to set down what changes should be made and not Deloitte.  I have no difficulty with Deloitte publishing a report setting out the problems.  I have a difficulty if the university and the HEA are suggesting that the recommendations to fix problems will come from Deloitte.  I do not accept that at all.  Given that this will be part of our work programme, I am sure we will come back to it because we will have the special report from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will have them back in here at some point.  This letter is trying to bookend the issue by saying we have this report, there are recommendations from Deloitte and everything is okay, but it is not.</p></speech>

We also need to ask what recommendations the HEA is making.  This goes back to what we collectively have been saying for some time, namely, that the HEA is the body that should be setting down what changes should be made, not Deloitte or any other organisation which is a private company which should not be the body that recommends changes.  What changes does the HEA recommend?  It is the oversight body.</p></speech>

Yet again there was a significant consequence for the whistleblower.  If it is going to be on the work programme, the most effective time to talk to the whistleblower, which we should do, would be closer to the point where we will deal with this on the work programme because it will be fresh in our memory and of more assistance.</p><p>We should give some assurance that this matter will not be ignored and that we will revisit it.</p><p> I accept the point made about the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  As several of us have repeatedly said, the HEA delegation was less than impressive when they were here.  We want the HEA to change its culture of oversight.  It should not be down to the Committee of Public Accounts to provide the oversight that the HEA is supposed to provide.  It is not about outsourcing the job to some other agency or company.</p></speech>

The HEA appointed Dr. Thorn to examine this matter and compile a report, which we have received but will not publish.  We also have the Deloitte report.  Is it an internal audit report?  Was Deloitte commissioned to do some work?  Is Deloitte the internal auditor?</p></speech>

I think when UL was here last year it was announced that Dr. Thorn would undertake an examination of a number of issues in the university.  While that work was going on, the university appointed Deloitte to look at matters.  Deloitte reported in August.  Dr. Thorn took account of that and the findings relating to that.  He was commissioned to do a follow-up report.  What the committee has today is the follow-up report, specifically relating to the contracts that were placed with two individuals whose employment was subject to a severance agreement.  This, if one likes, dealt with one specific issue in the university.</p> <p>  Deloitte's recommendations were to the governing body.  It is for the governing body to accept and own or, if one likes, make alternative proposals for actions to be taken.  If one likes, Deloitte has no purpose in this beyond making its report to the governing body.  Deloitte did not publish the report itself.  It was the university that made it available to the committee following on from the committee's interest in its activities.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with Deloitte being employed to do a job, but this matter goes back to what I have said for some time.  Again, Deloitte has compiled a report for a third level institute.  Deloitte has been paid by the third level institute to analyse the difficulties within the institute.  I would have preferred a different process.  I would have preferred if the HEA based its recommendations on the report compiled by Dr. Thorn.</p> <p>  I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, that Deloitte was commissioned by the university to do a job of work and it reported back to the board, which is independent and which can accept, reject or do what it likes with the recommendations.  Dr. Thorn was then asked to do a separate piece of work and he would have incorporated into his work, if I am right, the Deloitte recommendations.</p></speech>

The authority should set out what it believes should happen and not simply say that it will accept the recommendations made by Deloitte, which is a body that was employed and paid specifically by the institute.

Obviously it is up to the governing body of any university to employ independent organisations to carry out an analysis and make recommendations and they will be guided by that.  The HEA is the governing body.  As we have said for some time, the HEA needs to adopt a more hands-on approach and not simply say that Deloitte has done a report and it accepts the recommendations made by Deloitte.  No, the HEA has a role.</p></speech>

It requests the committee to investigate the correctness of the opinions stated by the local authority in a Kerry County Council planning zoning document, which is attached.  I printed it for myself, and as the document is 200 pages in length, I chose not to read it last night.  This matter is outside the remit of the committee.  I propose that we write to the individual advising him that he should contact the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  Let us not go there.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 1084, is correspondence from an individual, dated 13 February 2018, updating the committee with a copy of correspondence between him and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, regarding St. Angela's College, Sligo.  This matter has been before the committee before.

Correspondence No.1088 dated 14 February is from an individual in respect of expenditure relating to the Irish language.  The individual questions whether value for money is being achieved.  While it does not seem the correspondent is a supporter of the Irish language, the question of whether value for money is being achieved in relation to Irish language teaching and spending is a question which strong supporters of the language may also wish to address.  I believe Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga has dealt with these issues in the past.  Does anyone want to deal specifically with it?  We will note it but not take specific action.

I have met some of the workers and unions involved on this outside of my work on this committee.  I am sure other members have as well.  This is something the unions raised with me.  The Pensions Authority was informed on 4 September 2009 that the scheme was no longer in compliance with the statutory funding standard as set out in Part 5 of the Pensions Act.</p> <p>  In the wake of the financial crisis the authority adopted a general policy of allowing schemes extra time to enter into a funding proposal, which they were required to do.  Has the Pensions Authority the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  That is what seems to have happened here.  A separate briefing document, prepared for CI&Eacute; and released under an FOI request, was given to the secretariat.  It is not in the pack for this week.  I think it was sent yesterday.  It refers to CI&Eacute; pensions and superannuation schemes.  One paragraph refers to the board's responsibilities as set out in the statutory base rules.  It goes on to say that independent legal advice would suggest it would be difficult for the board to ignore the advice recommended by the authority, unless there was some compelling reason to believe that the authority's recommendation was flawed.  There is no reason to believe the data on which the valuation is based is incorrect.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Does the authority have the right to override what is a statutory instrument?  The second and bigger issue is one the unions are asking us to try to establish.  Is there a policy in CI&Eacute; to engage in deliberately underfunding the defined pension scheme in an effort to make it insolvent at some point?  There are serious questions that need to be answered.</p></speech>

We will come back then.  We will note that and we will follow it up with the specific questions raised.  Correspondence No. 1092C from an individual dated 16 February regarding the sale of land by the congregation of Christian Brothers at Clonkeen College in Blackrock in County Dublin.  The individual wrote to the committee regarding this matter last year.  We sent the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the individual.  The person has now asked the committee to look at the role of the Department of Education and Skills arising from its failure to safeguard fully the State's investment in schools that were built on land owned by third parties, and in particular on lands owned by religious orders.</p> <p>  This may be an interesting point.  I propose we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an information note on the models used to protect capital investment by the State on land owned by private or charity entities.  This has far reaching effects, with the State investing money in lands not in its ownership.  A local authority would not build a house on land it did not have the title deeds to.  We want to get a note from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  We will come back to that broad issue.  Agreed.  </p> <p>  The next item is correspondence 1093 from Deputy Alan Kelly suggesting amendments to our working document in relation to our report.

The next item is the Health and Social Care Professional Council, a clear audited opinion, and again attention is drawn to the pensions liability issue by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The following item is the Regulator of the National Lottery Regulator's Administration account, a clear audited opinion.  Then we come to the National Lottery Fund, a clear audited opinion.</p> <p>  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General just explain that to us?  We know the regulator is paid by the lottery operator, as I understand it.  It is meant to regulate the new games or new contracts that come up.

The accrued liability that staff have earned is recognised as a future liability.</p></speech>

They account for pensions as they pay them, and because that is not consistent with what is required under FRS 102, I draw attention to it.  It is a deviation from FRS 102.

Again it is an issue because one would have assumed that the reporting of all public bodies would be in line with approved international accounting and financial standards, but the Minister can overrule that in legislation.  On the legislation for the HSE, in particular, and other health organisations such as we have seen here, there is a statutory provision to account for it in the way the Minister says so, notwithstanding that it is not in accordance with international accounting standards.</p> <p>  Another major example of this that the Comptroller and Auditor General will give is the almost &euro;2 billion in claims against the State, mainly for medical negligence is not recorded in the HSE's financial statement.  There is no organisation of this size anywhere in the world that can produce its financial statement, given that it has a calculated estimated liability of the claims against it, and utterly exclude them.  They put a little note to say the State Claims Agency are dealing with it, but they are not recorded in the accounts in the normal way.  It is in line with the legislation passed by the Oireachtas but it is not in line with anything else.  </p></speech>

What I am proposing to do is to manage the meeting by breaking it up into two chunks.  In the morning we will deal with the central government funding of local authorities, and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be here to deal with that, as the funding body.  We will also deal with the Local Government Fund on that day, even though that is closing down a bit, but it was in existence last year; funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which goes to local authorities; and, funding from Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  There is a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on motor taxation.  In the morning session, I propose that we agree to deal with the funding of local government, and that includes the roads funding as well as funding directly from the line Department.</p></speech>

For a third level college to spend &euro;500,000 on a partnership with Cork Opera House is one matter.  The reply to that from UCC was that funding from UCC comes from non-taxpayer revenues.  However, we need to have public revenues in the first place to be able to generate non-taxpayer revenues.  We have had this debate here for hours with all third level colleges.  The partnership and the link-up is a separate matter.  To claim the college has non-taxpayer generated revenue, when the reason it has income in the first place is because of taxpayer funds, is a laugh.</p></speech>

The chapter is on corporation tax.  It is important that members of the public remember that corporation tax accounted for 15% of total tax receipts in 2016.  This tax has displayed considerable volatility in recent years.  Some 70% of all corporation tax is paid by the top 100 companies, and 37% by just ten companies.  Such a concentration represents a serious risk to the Exchequer and the payment for public services in the years ahead.  The committee wishes to understand fully this risk and how it might best be dealt with.</p><p>The area of corporation tax in a global economy is complex and poorly understood by many people.  Dr. Brian Keegan, director of public policy on taxation with Chartered Accountants Ireland, was contracted by the committee to provide a briefing to it to develop its understanding.  In our first session last week, in private session, he gave us a briefing.  We are here today to provide that briefing in public session for the benefit of the public who want to follow the discussion.  He is accompanied today by Ms Norah Collender, also from the institute.  In the afternoon, we will have further engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to bring our consideration of this matter to a conclusion for now.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  </p><p>I thank Dr. Brian Keegan for the briefing documentation he has already provided to the committee and for the update we received from him in recent days.  I invite him to make a brief opening statement.  May we note and publish the opening statement and briefing document provided for the meeting today?</p></speech>

Members will have received our briefing document on corporation tax.  I am happy to provide any further explanations and whatever clarifications I can in the course of the meeting this morning.  I am joined today by my colleague Ms Norah Collender.</p> <p>  Any charge to tax on companies in Ireland hinges on the concept of residence.  All developed countries operate residence rules by virtue of the place of incorporation, or the place of management and control, or a hybrid arrangement.  In Ireland, the charge to corporation tax is, first and foremost, based on the place of incorporation.  A company incorporated here is tax resident here.  </p> <p>  In Ireland, the headline corporation tax rate is 12.5%, but other rates also apply to companies.  Investment or passive income is taxed at a rate of 25%.  Capital gains &mdash; namely profits arising from the sale of a capital asset, such as land or buildings &mdash; are taxed at 33%.  Many companies are subject to further surcharges on profits, and these companies are known as close companies.  The majority of companies in Ireland are close.  Close companies are defined as companies that are owned and controlled by a small group of people; often they are family ventures.</p> <p>  The Irish tax system operates to ensure that, all else being equal, it is more costly in tax terms for a business to operate through a company compared to operating the business through sole ownership, even though the prevailing company rate of 12.5% is far lower than the top rate of income tax, 40%, plus USC and PRSI.  That is because money leaving the company is taxed under the income tax regime while money remaining in the company is taxed under the corporation tax regime and then potentially surchargeable at a rate up to 20%.</p> <p>  One of the consequences of the close company legislation is that relatively few companies in Ireland pay corporation tax, and those that do pay small amounts.  Most corporation tax is typically paid by non-close companies, that is, publicly quoted companies or multinationals.</p> <p>  There are other special classes of company that feature in the Irish tax system.  For example, real estate investment trusts allow investors purchase shares in investment property while taxing the returns as if the investors had directly bought the investment property and rented it themselves.  Charities are subject to an exemption from mainstream taxes.  A section 110 company is a particular type of company used to facilitate asset management in the International Financial Services Centre.</p> <p>  There are also particular tax regimes that can apply depending on the nature of the company's activities.  Incentives exist for investments in intellectual property, for the development of intellectual property through research and development, and for the exploitation of intellectual property recognised under the knowledge development box rules.  We have provided an outline of the rules applying to these special classes of companies and incentives in the briefing document.</p> <p>  The Irish Corporation Tax system also works within a framework of international agreements and conventions, not least our undertakings by virtue of our membership of the European Union.</p> <p>  No taxes can be modified by the European Union without unanimous agreement among the 28 EU member states.  In terms of corporation tax specifically, there exists a number of EU directives to ensure that, within the confines of EU member state borders, no double taxation accrues when EU-based companies pay each other dividends, royalties or interest, nor should there be a tax penalty when companies seek to merge their businesses across EU member state borders.</p> <p>  The EU treaties also provide for the safeguarding of four fundamental freedoms &ndash; the freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital.  All Irish law, not just corporation tax law, must be compliant with these principles.  Under the state aid rule, no country can grant a selective advantage to a company or to a sector of which other companies or sectors cannot avail.  </p> <p>  Beyond EU membership arrangements, Ireland is also party to more than 70 bilateral double taxation treaties, which attempt to ensure that a company cannot be taxed twice in two different jurisdictions on the same profits.  These relieving measures are mainly policed by systems of withholding taxation.  </p> <p>  To conclude these opening comments, we were asked to describe the discretion available to the Revenue Commissioners in the pursuit of their responsibilities under the taxes Acts.  In so far as Revenue officers have any discretion available to them, that discretion is circumscribed by the legislation.  We have described in the briefing note the main circumstances in which discretion or judgment might be applied.  I would be happy to expand on these further and, indeed, on any aspect of the briefing note.</p></speech>

I am interested in the section on transfer pricing.  That comes out of the report, Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, by Mr. Seamus Coffey.  If transfer pricing were to be extended to non-trading transactions that would include transfer pricing examination of matters such as renting property, how would that apply in respect of real estate investment trusts, REITs?  The witness has described withholding tax to us and the tax being liable.</p> <p>  I will put an example.  If 80% of shareholders were in one of the other European countries, essentially the tax liability, with the exception of the withholding tax liability, is in the country of their origin.  Would this recommendation in the Coffey report have any bearing on where the tax liability might fall?  We are seeing, in effect, property become mobile for the first time.  The understanding was that property was the one thing that could be taxed in one location and was not mobile.  Where would that intersect with these real estate investment trusts, if at all?</p></speech>

The Deputy's conclusion, "if at all", is probably the answer.  When we speak of transfer pricing, we are normally speaking about transactions between connected companies, most often those under common ownership.  A REIT is by definition a kind of stand-alone management arrangement for a particular property or group of properties.  Transfer pricing arrangements might conceivably apply if two REITs were in common ownership in different jurisdictions.  I am not aware if that is a common structure.  They are probably separate issues and I do not see any immediate interaction between the two.</p></speech>

If this is a strict arm's length transaction between two associated companies, would that be allowed?  That is where it would come in.  Generally, transfer pricing has to do with sales of products between companies.  They are the trading transactions talked about.  However, when talking about rental, as currently constituted, Irish transfer pricing would not look at those kind of structures.</p></speech>

Is there a way of disaggregating some elements of commercial trading?  I refer to the banks.  I can understand a small company may have accumulated debts and writes those debts off against taxes.  That is understandable.  I can visualise why that would be required.  Is there a way of separating out the two?  Can a bailed-out bank be treated differently for tax purposes?  Can portions of the corporate sector be separated out or must there be equal treatment right across the board?</p></speech>

For that reason, to take the most obvious example, we cannot apply a different tax rate to a bank than a corner shop.  It has to be 12.5%.  We cannot make a distinction between different sectors of industry.  The same principles would apply where availability of tax reliefs was being restricted.</p> <p>  Technically, it would be possible to draft legislation which would restrict the use of losses in a particular industry such as banking, manufacturing or whatever industry one cares to choose.  Whether that would be permissible under EU rules which ensure no one sector can be favoured over another is a question that would really have to be teased out.  Having said that, there are procedures, and Ireland does this all the time, whereby we approach the European Union, say we are proposing to do this in our tax legislation and ask whether it is acceptable under state aid rules.  Conceivably, some kind of arrangement might be possible, but on first principles, we would need to be cautious about doing it.</p></speech>

It relates, fundamentally, to the number of shareholders, that is, five or fewer.  The idea behind a close company is to ensure that individuals do not put their businesses through as a company and avail of a 12.5% rate instead of a 40% rate.  The laws are almost penal and are designed to ensure that if someone is incorporating a business in Ireland, he or she has to have very good commercial reasons to use a company structure and should not be doing so for tax purposes.  There are special rules to do with leaving moneys in the company whereby if they are not distributed out, they are surcharged.  There are special rules on how much money a director or shareholder can take out of the company without a tax penalty and so on.  The combined effect of all those rules is that it is much more efficient for close companies to pay out their profits by way of salaries to the participators.  Therefore, those profits, which one might expect to be taxed under corporation tax rules, are actually taxed under the income tax rules because they are paid out by way of salary or ultimately, by way of dividend.  That happens because it is tax inefficient to do otherwise because the tax system is designed to ensure it is inefficient to do otherwise.  The consequence of that is that the bulk of corporation tax is paid by more widely held companies which typically, by definition, are bigger companies.  They tend to be multinationals and they tend to be publicly quoted.  Due to the nature of the economic environment in which we all find ourselves, an increasing amount of the value and profitability of the corporate sector is derived from intellectual property.  By contrast, 100 years ago the profitability of the corporate sector was mainly derived from the holding of natural resources.  Things have moved on and it is those industries which have a very high reliance on intellectual property, like the pharmaceutical and ITC sectors, that are making the big money now.  It is a by-product of economic factors on the one hand and the particular structure in Ireland on the other.  The Irish structure is pretty unique in terms of how it actually penalises individuals.  The UK started off with a similar set of arrangements in the 1970s, which have been very much watered down since, but we have retained the strict close company regime and that is a big factor in explaining why there are relatively few companies paying corporation tax.  It is not that tax is not being paid or that Irish companies are not making profits but that the tax on those profits tends to be collected through the income tax as distinct from the corporate tax system.  </p></speech>

One of the reliefs, to which Deputy Catherine Murphy alluded earlier, is based on losses being carried forward.  Where a business has incurred losses in previous years, it can carry those losses forward and offset them against the taxable profits in the current period or a future period.  That is certainly a contributing factor.  There are also provisions whereby if a company engages in capital investment like buying new plant or machinery or intellectual property - things like copyrights, patents, trademarks and so forth - it can use the money expended on those capital assets to reduce the amount of profit that is subject to tax.  That is above the line, so to speak, and one comes up with the taxable figure and tax is charged at 12.5% or 25%, as appropriate.  However, below-the-line credits can arise, mainly in two areas.  They can arise in terms of the indigenous tax credit for research and development, which is a huge factor in the Irish tax system.  It is very much tied up with the notion of intellectual property and therefore, by definition, it is tied up with those companies which tend to make the most money because of their economic structure.  We also operate a system of tax credits whereby if holding companies in Ireland are receiving a dividend from abroad, a credit attaches to those dividends by virtue of foreign tax paid by foreign subsidiaries, for example.  That would reduce the overall effective rate.</p> <p>  There are factors above the line that reduce the actual taxable profit and there are factors below the line which, after the tax is calculated, reduce the amount of tax payable.  Both sets of factors influence the so-called effective rate.  </p></speech>

It would be quite useful to hear about the changes that were made in the UK with regard to smaller companies.  Usually when there is a newspaper headline relating to corporate tax, the response is that a small number of companies pay the vast majority of corporate tax and that is actually the case.  However, Dr. Keegan has drawn a distinction between close companies and how their tax is treated and other companies.  In actual fact, we are not comparing like with like.  We are not talking about 107,000 companies being liable for corporate tax - only a portion of those companies are liable.  Dr. Keegan also described the tax treatment of close companies as "penal".  It could be viewed as an inhibitor in terms of Irish companies growing if we cannot apportion tax in a fair way and if some groups of companies are enjoying a disproportionately advantageous tax treatment in comparison with others.  Smaller or close companies appear to have a bigger hill to climb.  What changes did they make in the UK?  Were those changes assessed in terms of whether they improved the prospect of survival of companies or the flourishing or even the incorporation of those companies if they grew enough to trade outside of the jurisdiction?</p></speech>

In very basic terms, the UK replaced its close company legislation with a procedure known as IR35.  That procedure allows Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to look through the corporate structure and tax the individuals as if the earnings of the company had arisen directly to themselves.  It is a much more convoluted structure.  The great advantage of our close company regime is that it is well defined and well understood.  When I say "penal", I should clarify what I mean.  If one is trying to game the system and trying to use the corporate structure to have profits taxed at 12.5% instead of at the income tax rate, one will get caught.  It is for that reason that Irish business owners are careful to ensure that those rules are not triggered and that money is paid out and accounted for through the income tax system.  The net effect is probably the same but the revenue authorities in the UK found they had to impose the IR35 mechanism to effectively undo the undoing that they had done on their close company regime.  I hope that explains it for Deputy Murphy.</p></speech>

We might have spoken during private session last week about a warehousing company in the midlands.  It is not reliant on research and development or on new techniques or new software for its profitability.  By definition, therefore, it is not going to engage in research and development in the first instance and, as a result, will not be able to avail of tax incentives for such activity.  By and large, there are very few incentives left in the corporate tax system.  One of the by-products of the reduction of the main rate from 40% to 12.5% was the elimination of various reliefs.  For example, there used to be a system known as free depreciation whereby if a company bought an asset, it could write the full cost of that asset straight off against its tax liability.  All of those kind of reliefs went and we are left with the 12.5% rate, research and development and the knowledge development box.  That is really all that is left.</p></speech>

I do not mean to be flippant in any way .  I think it is only in its second year of operation.  I am not clear that there is any particular evidence even from the returns of the extent of its take up.  All I can say about the knowledge development box is that, unusually, it was not designed to be compliant with OECD regulations.  They took the OECD regulations and applied them in the design of it.  There was already an OECD-proof structure for knowledge development box regimes.  They are available in a number of different territories.  It would have been brought in to complement the overall Irish tax incentive offering.  It sits alongside research and development so there is the research and development relief and then by virtue of the fact that a company is doing research and development, it can then apply what it has developed further in pursuit of the knowledge development box tax relief as well.</p></speech>

I was not here for the private session last week due to a hospital appointment but I read the document.</p> <p>  There are three areas I wish to discuss with Dr. Keegan.  He talked about capital investment as one of the allowances that can be used to reduce a company's corporation tax.  We know that, in 2014 and 2015, there was a spotlight on intangible assets and the 80% cap was reduced for a period.  This resulted in the amount involved increasing from &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;29 billion, so it was quite substantial.  The number of companies that availed of it was quite small.  Could Dr. Keegan talk me through what actually happened there?  I do not know whether he has a competency in this area.</p></speech>

First, it would appear that intellectual property, by which I mean copyright, trade marks and patents, assets which are intangible but which add to the value of a product being created, must be located somewhere.  As a consequence of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting project, BEPS, which really tried to get to the heart of cross-border transactions, it became less and less worthwhile for those assets to be located in what were known as traditional tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands so they were brought on shore into legitimate tax regimes of which Ireland is one.</p></speech>

I understand the concept of it.  There was an 80% cap, which was changed in 2014.  What was the nature of that change?  There was another change in 2017 or this year but it was not made retrospective.  Could Dr. Keegan explain the position in terms of percentages and figures and what is or is not allowed?</p></speech>

Of the &euro;100 I have made on the product using the patent, I can only reduce that by 80% so there will always be &euro;20 left in charge.  When the intellectual property regime was introduced, that 80% restriction was there.  It was removed some years later and was reinstated by virtue of the Finance Act 2017.</p></speech>

The value, in tax terms, is paid.  In respect of the &euro;1 million a company would have spent on acquiring the patent in the first place, that allowance remains until I have exhausted it but I cannot exhaust it by reference to 100% of my profits each year.  I can only exhaust it by reference to 80% of my profits each year so what is happening is that the tax benefit of the company's investment in the patent is being deferred slightly rather than being extinguished completely.

However, the actual precise individual affairs of taxpayers never came to light except in the context of court proceedings, for example, if a taxpayer took a case through the courts relating to their tax affairs.

It has been the practice right the way along that a taxpayer's affairs are strictly private and confidential.  For example, there is no way of establishing purely in terms of tax rules what any individual's income is or what are his or her personal circumstances.  Sometimes those personal circumstances can be very sensitive.  For example, if an individual is claiming medical expenses, he or she might not necessarily want that to be out in the public domain.  That has been the case irrespective of whether or not the taxpayer is an individual or a body corporate.  We only ever see the detailed workings of an individual taxpayer's affairs, be they corporate or individual, in the context of judicial proceedings.</p></speech>

If one is an employee, one is engaged by an employer to provide under a contract for services.  An employee also has all kinds of entitlements under the employment and labour laws and protections that exist within the State's ambit.  If one is providing a contract of services, for example, if one is trying to operate through a company, then one no longer has those kinds of protection.  That is one aspect of it.</p> <p>  I will use a simple example to show how it works in practice.  Let us say that I was to incorporate my business and that, instead of invoicing as Brian Keegan, I invoiced as Brian Keegan Limited.  It would simply be a matter for me of putting the work through the company.  The company would keep its own books and records.  Invoices would be issued from Brian Keegan Limited and that money would belong to Brian Keegan Limited.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, I would be paid a salary by the company.  In so far as the profits of the company were not extinguished from the salary, those profits would be liable to tax at 12.5%.  The wrinkle, which links with the previous questions on close company rules, is that, if I leave the money that was taxed at 12.5% in the company, it becomes liable to a surcharge of 20% after 18 months.  For me to avoid that, I would have to pay out the money I had left in the company by way of a dividend, in which case it would be immediately taxable under the income tax rules.  These are all of the wrinkles.</p> <p>  As I said in private session, when I am asked by individuals from time to time whether it is worth their while to incorporate, I always tell them not to do it for tax purposes.  If there is a commercial reason for doing it, for example, if they need the protection of limited liability, then by all means they should do it, but they should not do it for tax reasons because there is no tax advantage.</p></speech>

Some companies operate on a leading edge basis.  As they manufacture, research and development is happening.  How is that audited?</p></speech>

It is one of the rare occasions where Revenue will have recourse to an outside expert or party to investigate the actual activities of the company that is claiming the research and development tax credit to ensure that it is bona fide research and development and there is an entitlement to the credit.  Beyond that, it is audited in the same way as any activity of the company being audited.</p></speech>

As long as they follow those guidelines, it is possible for companies to establish clearly in euro and cent exactly how much they should be eligible for.  There is also an auditing process, one that can be two-staged.  First, Revenue's audit ensures that the legislation and guidelines are being properly followed.  Second, there can be a further investigation involving an external technical expert to ensure that the kind of work that is being undertaken is bona fide research and development and, therefore, eligible.</p></speech>

Dr. Keegan stated that there may not be a tax advantage to incorporate.  If a large portion of what in normal circumstances would be considered a salary is treated as profit from a company and is subject to corporation tax, can whatever is left in the company be invested in, for example, property or something else?  It would not be drawn down as a dividend on which tax would be paid.</p></speech>

As far as the tax system is concerned, it does not care where the profits have gone.  They are just undistributed profits.  The only commercial situation where the surcharge would not apply would be where there was a company law reason for a distribution not being capable of being made, for example, if the company was insolvent, but we are discussing the extreme edges there.  Generally speaking, it does not matter what the company does with the money.  It is not absolved of the requirement to pay the surcharge.</p></speech>

According to page 37, the head office was not tax resident in any country.  I do not want to get into the specifics, as I understand the matter is before the courts, but I will ask in a general way as a result of what Dr. Keegan stated.  There was a head company, with two companies operating in Ireland - Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe.  A decision was made to tax them based on their operations in Ireland.</p><p>Most of the profits go to the head office.  We knew at the time that the head office was not tax resident in any country, including Ireland or the US.  Could that happen now?</p></speech>

Second, while this is a generalisation, I think it is a fair one.  The emphasis on Irish tax law in recent years has moved away from companies being resident by virtue of where they are centrally managed and controlled to the default position being that they are taxable by virtue of their place of incorporation, which is here.  The rule involving central management control is still very important in the context of our dealings with businesses in double taxation treaty countries but the general taxing rule is considerably tighter now than it was five years ago.</p></speech>

I am following his document.  Paragraph 1.4 on page 7 addresses trading income versus passive income.  Passive income is generally a term for income derived from investment - rental income from property investments - that is subject to a tax of 25%.  For a company to access the 12.5% rate of corporation tax on its trading profits, it must demonstrate a degree of regular commercial trading activity associated with generating the income.  How does a company say it is trading?  How much of its income has to be trading income versus passive income to qualify for the 12.5% rate?</p></speech>

The actual amount does not matter.  Tax does not generally work on <i>de minimis</i>.  It does not distinguish as to whether there is 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% which is passive.  Generally speaking, it is not often an issue because if a company is trading, it is fairly obvious.  If it is buying and selling stuff, manufacturing, or providing services, it is trading.</p></speech>

Is the income from those properties passive?  Is the investment the company has made in properties passive?  If the company has a dozen properties in its property portfolio, is actively managing them, buying here and selling there and doing those kinds of things, has it moved from a passive return on a property investment to a trading return because it is actively dealing and actively managing those properties?  That would be a typical grey area.</p></speech>

Taxation of real estate investment trusts is mentioned.  It states that shareholders are taxed where a real estate investment trust, REIT, pays a distribution in the form of a property income dividend, and the property income dividend paid to a corporate shareholder is subject to a 25.5% rate.  It continues to state that the property income dividend paid by a member of a group to another member of the REIT is exempt from corporation tax and that the property income dividend is taxed at 12.5% in the hands of institutional investors such as banks.  We have a 25% rate, a 12.5% rate and a 0% rate, an exemption.  Will Dr. Keegan flesh that out for me verbally?  When I look at taxation of REITs, there are three different tax rates.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is what people can relate to.  We understood the example about the rental property.  Give us an example of this.

The return on the REIT is passive in nature.  It is taxed at 25% on that.  Banks and institutional investors tend, going back to our first example about passive investment, to actively manage their investments.  Therefore, the rate which is attracted is 12.5%.  As a general principle, there is no tax on inter-company dividends within Ireland because the notion is that an Irish company has already paid its tax and is paying a dividend to another Irish company so there would be a double charge of tax if there was tax on those dividends.  That, in very broad terms, describes the three.</p></speech>

I am just moving through them and picking up a few little points as I go.  We might put the question on the BEPS action plan of the G20, commenced in 2013, to Revenue.  It is stated on page 21 that the purpose of the action plan is to enhance transparency for tax administration, providing adequate information to assess high-level profit shifting and other BEPS-related risks, as a crucial aspect of tackling the BEPS problem.  Will Dr. Keegan translate what I have read out into simpler English?</p></speech>

One would probably know where the company is headquartered but not necessarily if it has other subsidiaries or fellow group companies in different territories.  The notion behind country-by-country reporting is that the revenue authority would get an overview of all the companies in that group which are subject to common ownership, where they are operating and how much tax they are paying in each individual territory.  A revenue authority, whether in Ireland or wherever else, is not looking at a company's affairs in isolation and can form a better overall picture of what is at issue.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Keegan for his briefing note.  That is a matter we will raise in more detail with Revenue in the afternoon.  The briefing note was helpful for that.</p><p>I am moving on to page 26 of the briefing document and the capital allowance relating to intellectual property.  We are talking about research and development.  I refer to the final paragraph on page 26, which states:</p><blockquote>Tax relief takes the form of a tax credit which reduces the company&rsquo;s tax liability.  This can arise based on either revenue expenditure or capital investment.</blockquote> <p>A company has to have clear procedures for accounting separately and I would imagine that to claim a big tax credit, it would maybe have to have an independent audit from a scientific point of view and a financial point of view which, by way of comparison, the public sector does not seem to be able to do when it comes to investment in spin-out companies identifying how much was spent.</p><p>That is not Dr. Keegan's topic.

Revenue engages a specialist.  For example, there may be some branch of electronic engineering.  Revenue might engage a specialist in that branch of electronic engineering to assist it.  It is not independent in that sense.  It is not the company which commissions the independent adviser; it is Revenue.</p></speech>

The same paragraph goes on to state:</p><blockquote>The credit equates to 25% of a company's qualifying R&amp;amp;D expenditure ... The company can also take a deduction worth 12.5% for revenue type R&amp;amp;D expenditure ... in arriving at taxable profits.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#O01300"><p>I am moving on to page 28 of the document.  I am making it easy for people to follow what I am referring to.  I refer to one of the middle paragraphs and to the knowledge box.  It states:</p><blockquote>When a company develops its own IP, and uses that in the manufacture of a product incorporating that IP, the profits on that product are taxed at a special reduced rate.  In Ireland that reduced rate is 6.25%, that is to say, half of the 12.5% standard corporation tax rate.</blockquote> <p>There is therefore a special reduced rate.  I think Dr. Keegan mentioned in his opening statement the 12.5% corporation tax rate, passive income being taxed at 25% and capital gains being taxed at 33%.  However, this figure is only taxable at 6.25%, and we know from the briefing note we received in the afternoon that Revenue says about &euro;5 million was in the system in 2016.  It does not have more recent figures.  That is, again, a very attractive-----</p></speech>

We have learned something new today about this and we will take that up with Revenue.  I know it is a relatively new tax allowance, but the members and witnesses can see why I wanted to raise it.  This is how a company can easily get an effective rate combining that 6.25% and that 37.5% write-off on the 6.25%.</p> <p>  I move to page 42.  I thank Dr. Keegan.  He has given us a summary note on the Coffey review, which was carried out by Seamus Coffey.  For the record, I understand Mr. Coffey made a presentation some time ago to the finance committee so I did not invite him here today to repeat what he has already said in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What he said is reported on the record.  He makes a number of recommendations in the review, and we as a committee will take note of pages 42, 43 and 44 of Dr. Keegan's briefing relating to this.  We will not restate the recommendations.  They are already on the public record.  Mr. Coffey essentially highlights the risk to the taxpayer of over-reliance on this and talks about intellectual property, base erosion and profit shifting and transfer pricing.  Dr. Keegan's summary note on this is helpful to us.</p> <p>  I turn to page 45.  I refer to the issue of tax residency in the second paragraph.  I think I asked Dr. Keegan about this on the previous occasion while the committee was in private session.  An individual's tax residence can be primarily determined by their physical presence.  Generally an individual is considered to be resident for tax purposes in Ireland if they spend 183 days or more in Ireland in any one year.  That is six months.  I cite the example of someone who spends four months in one country, four months in another country and four months somewhere else.  He or she is not resident for tax purposes anywhere.  I know Dr. Keegan will say he or she pays tax on the income generated in each of those areas, but a clever person could have the majority of his or her income somewhere else and not be tax resident anywhere.  That can happen.</p></speech>

There is no hook on an individual as there is with a company.  One always knows where a company was incorporated.  There is not that same link in the case of an individual.  One must look at where the individual is physically located at a point in time.</p></speech>

The second paragraph outlines the fear the public probably has.  It reads: "A concern frequently levelled against double taxation treaties is that they sometimes achieve double non-taxation - that is to say the interaction of the rules means that  income does not get taxed at all."  Will Dr. Keegan flesh out that statement?  People get very concerned that, while double taxation agreements are set up to make sure one does not pay tax twice, Dr. Keegan believes it is possible there might be double non-taxation rather than double taxation.

This kind of situation might arise if, for example, a company has a number of operations, one of which may be in a very low-tax jurisdiction, perhaps a jurisdiction known as a tax haven, where a particular double taxation treaty stipulates that there is no withholding tax on royalties going to that particular territory.  This will result effectively in a form of double non-taxation in that income is taxed neither in the paying company nor in the receiving company.  It is these kinds of situations, to take a very straightforward example, that give rise to concerns.</p></speech>

The committee thanks him for the briefing documentation and thanks his colleague, Norah Collender, who was here with us the previous day as well, for the work.  The purpose of this is that when we meet Revenue and the Department of Finance, we have a body of research that we have been able to take on board and take into account and which assists us in discussing what commenced with a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on corporation tax.  </p> <p>  The committee will now go into private session until the voting session in the D&aacute;il.

We had a briefing session this morning from Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland on corporation tax.  We hope to bring our consideration of this matter to a close this afternoon following our meeting with Department of Finance and Revenue officials.  We are joined today by Mr. Niall Cody, chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Jeanette Doonan from the corporation tax branch, Dr. Keith Walsh and Mr. Liam Gallagher.  From the Department of Finance, we are joined by Mr. John Hogan, assistant secretary of the tax division, Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession, Mr. Pat Leahy and Mr. John Palmer.  I remind members and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their phones entirely.  That means putting them onto airplane mode because they will interfere with the recording system if they are only on silent.</p> <p>  This is a continuation of our previous discussion on this matter.  I gave the witnesses details on the Defamation Act 2009 when they were last here and this is merely a continuation of that, so I do not propose to say it again because I said it to them already as part of this process.  I understand there is not an opening statement because it is a continuation of a previous meeting.  That is completely logical.  I thank the witnesses for the information provided.  We had a useful exchange this morning for the benefit of the committee and for the public watching to get an understanding of this area.  We all know that we never stray into the tax affairs of any individual company or such.</p><p>That goes without saying for all sides of the House.  We will proceed with the first speaker, Deputy Marc MacSharry, who has 20 minutes.  People will follow with ten minute slots thereafter.</p></speech>

I will not be using my 20 minutes and I will be happy to cede time to my colleagues.  I thank the deputation for coming in.  Following our queries last week, the Revenue Commissioners sent a detailed note to us and I thank them for that.  It is an example for other Departments and State agencies in terms of how they could to respond to and respect this committee in the work it is trying to do.  I have some queries following from the last day.  It is okay to talk about Apple?</p></speech>

I will start with a basic question.  We often hear the term "aggressive tax planning" in media and from commentators.  Is that a term used by the Revenue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#KK00700"><p>We regularly use the term "aggressive tax planning".  We see that.  The Oireachtas lays down the legislation and the intention of the legislation.  There is tax planning and tax avoidance.  It is a grey area and there is no clear line.  We see certain practices as aggressive tax planning or aggressive tax avoidance.  The practitioners involved in this area would not see it in that way at all.  Ultimately, when we form a view that there is unacceptable tax avoidance, we will challenge individual cases.  Ultimately, such cases will be a matter for the courts to decide.</p></speech>

The term is used by the Revenue Commissioners.  Is it fair to say, or otherwise, that it would tend to be used to denote non-compliance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#KK00900"><p>Non-compliance is essentially non-compliance with the law.</p></speech>

Tax avoidance is different.  Tax avoidance is using the law as set out but maybe not as intended.  It is a different line between tax evasion and tax avoidance.  If there is tax evasion, various things can result, up to and including prosecution.  If it is tax avoidance or tax planning that goes wrong, then it is not tax evasion.  Some of the practices span a line between avoidance and evasion.  We were before the committee last year and we discussed some aspects of the various projects we have done, including those relating to contractors and medical consultants.  Some of that strayed into tax evasion.  It was probably intended or started off as tax avoidance.  Committee members will see cases where we end up with audit settlements and there are penalties &ndash; that is not avoidance.  There are special rules around avoidance.</p></speech>

Let us suppose the company used the law as intended to avail of incentives and schemes that are laid down and intended by the Oireachtas and provided for in law.  If the company uses these to the nth degree, then that is perfectly acceptable.  It is different when a person misuses them.  If Deputy MacSharry had the same conversation this morning, he might have received a different answer.</p></speech>

It would be an interesting point for Mr. Cody to tease out for the viewers at home.  What is the understanding of brass plate companies?  I am not a tax consultant or anything like that.  To me a brass plate company is where someone puts up a brass plate inscribed with Joe Bloggs Limited, but that is it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#KK01700"><p>Essentially, in the simplest terms, in a brass plate company there is no substance.  Generally, with companies registered for corporation tax there is substance to them.  The Irish system is based on ensuring substance.  Foreign direct investment is all about increasing employment and having actual substance in Ireland.  There are special rules in respect of incorporating companies and changes in Irish residency rules going back to 1999.  The rules were introduced to try to prevent abuse of Irish companies by entities that have no presence or substance in Ireland.</p></speech>

As I recall, when we last met the committee it was towards the end of November.  At that stage I was trying to help the committee to understand the process behind what we had done to that point.  We had detailed discussions with the company to agree the framework for the escrow fund and its establishment.  I was trying to articulate, as best I could, the different procurement processes under way that would put in place the infrastructure by which we could collect and manage the funds.</p> <p>  In our subsequent letter I acknowledged the feedback from the Chairman and Deputy MacSharry to the responses we gave.  We were trying to be as clear as possible in terms of the timelines that we expected to meet over the first quarter of 2018 and in terms of when we would see the moneys begin to flow.</p> <p>  Our focus in recent months has been assisting and supporting the National Treasury Management Agency, which is managing the procurement process for us.  In parallel, agreement was reached shortly after we last met the company in terms of the framework.  That was approved by the company at board level and by Government in January.  Our minds have been concentrated in recent weeks in supporting the NTMA in terms of its procurement process.  We are at the stage now where we thought we would be, that is to say, the process for the appointment of the custodian agent to receive the funds is almost complete.  We have entered the standstill period, which runs for up to 14 days.  We expect to make an announcement shortly on the identification of the agent that will manage the moneys for us.</p> <p>  In parallel, there is a process of procuring the services of investment managers.  We expect this process, which is rather advanced, will be completed through the course of early March.  Once we have contracts signed, all of that will allow for the custodian to put the accounts in place to capture the money and for the investment managers to be active in managing the money.  Our best guess is that all of that will facilitate the flow of funds into the account through the course of quarter 2, as early as possible.  That is what we would hope for and anticipate.</p></speech>

Our responsibility in relation to the case is to finalise the calculations.  At that stage I indicated that we had completed about 90% of the figures and work has continued on that.  Now over 95% of the calculations are completed.  We have indicated to the Commission that by the end of April we will have sent all the calculations to the Commission.  It then has to get back to us.</p></speech>

They fall in sectors such as financial, insurance, manufacturing including pharmaceutical, and information and communications.  We also know the effective rate very much depends on what can be set aside against the 12.5%.  The frustration is that even though the 12.5% is generous, in some cases only a tiny proportion of that ends up being paid.</p> <p>  We are told that research and development is the main area against which tax can be set aside.  I imagine that there is a limited amount of research and development that can be put into financial and insurance activities.  However, one could lose a fortune in pharmaceutical manufacturing because there is ongoing development of new drugs which we are told is very expensive.  Is there a bit of a conundrum in that we are giving very generous research and development write-offs for, for example, the pharmaceutical sector, when we have some of the most expensive drugs in the world.  Does that get factored into the approach to research and development in that particular sector, for example?  I do not think it is possible to say it is the same with other sectors.  A computer costs largely the same here as it does elsewhere.  However, drugs fall into a different category.  Does that come into play at all?</p></speech>

We look at the research and development policy and, as the Deputy mentioned the last day, our research and development tax credit is one of the few credits we have in the corporate tax area.  I think it was evaluated in 2016.  I will confirm with Mr. Hession if that is correct.  From our assessment of the effect of the overall tax credit, we were seeing 60% additionality in terms of research and development activity in the State as a result of the availability of the credit.  When that is considered in terms of industrial policy, we are complementing where we would like to see our economy going, which is creating high value and well paid employment opportunities for young educated people who are coming from our universities and so on.</p><p> To draw the thread from the individual research and development tax credit right down to the pricing policy is quite difficult, however.  Even at that, its benefit is that it is a general measure available across the economy, depending on the level of research and development activity undertaken.  Compartmentalising it on the basis of particular factors then moves it into an area where it no longer is a general measure and is in the area of state aid, and we are into a completely different conversation then.</p></speech>

It is not like one is buying new machines and those machines will produce something for three or four years.  It is highly likely there will be a continuous demand for research in, and development of, drugs.  Is that not the case?  How does one audit it?  It is probably Revenue.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Hession if there was anything in terms of our analysis back in 2016 which broke it into the individual sectors that might help the Deputy.</p></speech>

In terms of the sectors, 42% of the credit was in manufacturing, 32% was in ICT and 15% was in professional, scientific and technical activities.  Some of the pharma sector could be in either manufacturing or the scientific category.  The credit works by giving &euro;1 back for every &euro;4 spent on qualifying research and development which can be offset against a company's corporation tax bill.  It is not linked specifically to pricing with an objective of the research and development tax credit being to make drugs more affordable at the other end.  The area of drugs pricing is obviously complex and they are sourced and developed all over the world.</p></speech>

We are being very generous on one end because most of the tax collected from these companies will be collected from the people employed in the companies rather than the companies themselves.  It is a big set aside.  Yet, at the same time, on the other end, we do not get any advantage.</p> <p>  I will move on to another area that we explored.  It relates to real estate investment trusts, REITs.  Last week we explored this with the tax consultant who has been assisting us.  For example, in the case of a real estate investment trust, we are told the only real tax that is paid is paid by the company that is managing it, although it is not the only tax.  Most of the tax liability will be on the shareholders, that is, the people who own the shares.  If they are 90% in France, they pay 20% withholding tax here and are liable for the tax, with the 20% discounted, in France.  I use that as an example.</p> <p>  We are now moving into a situation where property has become mobile whereas it had been a thing one could guarantee was fixed.  How does that relate to people who own property here and would be liable to pay tax on it here, for example?  Is the way this is handled encouraging a different type of ownership?  Many of these might have bought assets cheaply and may well be competing in an entirely different way with people who are, say, accidental landlords in terms of their tax treatment.  Is there an evaluation or a modelling of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#MM00600"><p>The logic behind the tax treatment of REITs and other investment vehicles is that one wants to put the investor in the same position as someone who, say, just bought a house and rented it out.  With funds taxation, we are saying that there will be a double layer of tax law without some adjustment to the tax law.  This is because the fund will pay tax and then the individual will pay income tax on his or her drawdown.  In general, funds taxation in OECD countries is about stripping out what would otherwise be a double layer of taxation.  REITs are generally new builds and they have to adopt a particular model.  For example, 85% of their profit has to be paid out.  It cannot retain the profit in the fund and avoid taxation.  It has to be pumped out of the fund.  The Deputy is right that there is a 20% withholding tax and the investor will then pay income tax in the same way as the Deputy or I would pay tax on rental income from a house we had bought.</p> <p>  A couple of years ago a problem was brought to our attention by our colleagues in Revenue.  The use of funds in the area of property was creating a risk to the Irish tax base.  In the Irish tax system and international tax system, one always retains the taxing right to property in one's jurisdiction.  One should not let that leak out of one's base.  There was a concern that structures were available to some of the property developments and those buying distressed loans - the Deputy referred to those who were in the so-called section 110 companies - where Ireland was at risk that the tax rights to property was leaking out of our base, with consequent unfairness to other types of investors.  There was a general sense that the tax system was not designed to allow that type of leakage.</p> <p>  Therefore, a number of changes were made two Finance Bills ago to ensure, first, that section 110 companies could not avoid tax.  They were not allowed to sweep the profits out.  They are subject to a 25% tax rate.   They pay the investor rate rather than the lower 12.5% rate.  When it came to property, that got taxed at 25%.  In terms of other types of funds, where they had investors overseas, we took the 20% withholding tax that was on REITs and applied it to those types of funds.  They are Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  These funds have a reasonable component, that is, a 25% component, of Irish property.</p> <p>  The issue the Deputy raised is very germane to the tax policy debate in the last number of Finance Bills.  It is an area in which changes have been made.  We will start to see what difference it has made to the figures this year as the tax returns come in.  Given what we understand from their public information, we expect that some of them will move out of funds structures and perhaps incorporate as regular companies, which is as it should be.</p></speech>

This was because it is able to write off its losses, which are our losses, against its own balance sheet.  If I find at home a medical receipt from five years ago, as an individual taxpayer I would not be able to seek to write that off against my tax liability.  I can well understand that companies will write off debt over time, but then there is the idea that this can be indeterminate, particularly for a sector which had the benefit of the public bailing it out.  What modelling or consideration has been given to limiting sectors such as that one?  Can that kind of sector be divided up in terms of the avoidance of paying tax?</p><p>They may well end up being sold and it would be a different entity that would own them.  Does that come into play?</p></speech>

We have seen the analysis Revenue published last year of the level of losses in the system.  Overall, it is declining somewhat, but it is still very high, both in the banking sector and the corporate sector more widely.  The banks obviously are carrying massive losses.  Previously, the way that issue was approached was they were limited to only being able to offset them against half of their profits every year, but that became a problem a number of years ago when new European regulatory requirements under the capital requirements directive were introduced.  That would have meant it would have required an injection of capital from the State into the banks to correct it.  I think the policy change was made in 2014 to remove the restriction which at that stage was unique to the banking sector; other corporate sectors were not subject to it.  Instead, the banking levy was introduced.  I have to be careful not to stray into commenting on the merits of policy; I will just try to explain how the system works and why it is the way it is.  The restriction on banks' ability to offset losses against profits was removed at the time, but in order to ensure revenue was still collected from the banking sector, the banking levy was introduced.  It was due to expire in 2016 but was extended to 2020 or 2021.</p></speech>

There is another more esoteric argument, which is an honours level point and probably beyond my expertise.  The banks have a deferred tax asset which obviously plays into their value.  When shares are being sold in a bank, there is an argument that it brings forward the benefit of the deferred tax assets for the State.  In other words, rather than wait for the tax revenue, the banks have a valuable deferred tax asset for which investors are prepared to pay now.  That is really a point on which banking experts are more qualified to speak, but it is relevant in considering the balance between the public interest and the policy choice.</p></speech>

One of the reasons we have ended up over time in a position of controversy with the funds is they are esoteric from a tax and a regulatory point of view and have thrived in that blind spot.  Certainly, when I mention section 110 companies - the SPVs of most interest - that section of the tax Act was intended to be used for a genuine securitisation of the financial services industry, but it became primarily a vehicle for property and the acquisition of loans as opposed to a vehicle for property development.  One of the changes made in the Finance Bill when we were addressing the tax problems was aimed at improving the level of information Revenue would receive from these funds because up until then there was a delay in the reporting of information and the detail was somewhat wanting.  There should be better information available.</p></speech>

The controversy about section 110 companies was heightened at one point and changes were made.  Is Mr. Cody satisfied that they went far enough?  Is he satisfied that there are no other special purpose vehicles being used?</p></speech>

Our large cases division has responsibility for the financial services sector in its entirety.  One of its jobs is dealing with section 110 companies.  As Mr. Hession stated, when they were put in place, it really had to do with international securitisation; there was no risk to Irish taxation.  We would keep an eye on what was happening and would have a very close relationship with the Central Bank on an operational level, subject to the legislation in place on the exchange of information.  It was in that context that in 2015 we identified the issue of property transactions within section 110 companies.  We started a process to look at their use for Irish property transactions.  That process continued through 2015 and 2016 and led to changes in the legislation to target the amount mentioned.  As Mr. Hession stated, some of the issues are related to the level of information we receive.  Our powers in that regard were increased to ensure we had greater sight of what was going on.  That work is continuing.  It is the ongoing job of a tax administration system to constantly look at what is going on.  Sometimes it will take us a while to get our heads around what we are seeing.  It comes back to companies, advisers and practitioners looking at the legislation, as laid down, and what is happening in other countries and applying the provisions.</p></speech>

It seems to be a matter of ensuring the resources are available to close loopholes as quickly as possible.  Are the available resources adequate?</p></speech>

Every time I attend a committee we have a discussion about the resources available to Revenue.  In the simplest of terms, we could always do with more, but there is a process to be followed for how one takes people in, how one develops and trains them.  We are going through massive change and a churn in numbers.  I am conscious that in another committee room this morning the Minister was having a discussion about the Finance group of  Estimates.  I was talking to my colleagues and the Vote for Revenue was approved.  That is really important.  In the past four budgets we have put the case to the Minister for the allocation of additional resources.</p></speech>

It was really important to bring the number back up.  At the same time, because of the demographics in the Civil Service - this is common across the service - 35% of the staff have over 35 years' service.  We recruited over 550 staff last year and will do the same this year.  We will probably do more the following year.  In an organisation the size of ours, that is a massive churn.</p></speech>

The support that we have received from the Minister in resource cases has been exactly what we required but the solution is not just additional people.  We have to get them in, develop them and then there is capability and culture.  There is a challenge around that which I could talk about for a number of hours but I hope not to.</p></speech>

I wish it was the multinationals we had before us but Revenue is the second best in this regard.  The context was set during this morning's session and in the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter, which Revenue knows well, regarding the variation in the collection of corporation tax, with the effective rate ranging from 12.5% to 0%.  I am sure Mr. Cody watched this morning's proceedings.  Colleagues have mentioned the legitimate ways to avoid paying tax using research and development credits.

Some companies reappear and they have different claims in respect of different types of research and development while others are once-off.  We discussed our large cases division earlier.  One of the reasons we have such a division is to have a deep understanding of what goes in large companies that pay most of the tax.  The division has a rolling programme.  Approximately 80% of the companies that claim the research and development credit are smaller but probably only claim less than 40% of the total amount.  The large companies carry out the largest element of research and development.  They have make fewer claims but for more money.</p></speech>

There are two issues with research and development where yield can occur.  One is if it fails what is called the science test.  The other is if it fails the accounting test.  Probably the biggest proportion has to do with accounting rather than science.  We have issued very detailed guidance for the research and development credit which has been in place since 2004.  That is 14 years of guidance and advance notice on research and development and what a company is entitled to claim.  Our experts will examine certain aspects.  I have seen some of the expert reports.  They are comprehensive, detailed analyses of the science.  If we have an expert in the field, the company probably has three experts for that process and there is considerable engagement on those aspects.</p></speech>

I tabled two parliamentary questions on the issue in the past week or so.  I tabled one last night and one on 13 February.  I asked for a breakdown of the tax credit based on different bands of tax payment by various companies.  I got some information in one reply and more in another on the number of people involved.  It was 1,535 companies for 2015 and 1,486 companies were able to claim R&amp;D tax credit in 2016.  The range of credit available by way of reduction in tax for those between &euro;1 and &euro;50,000 was 797 people.  They were the small guys.  I have information on the companies ranging from &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000.  The one people will be interested in is that Revenue said 13 companies were able to claim the R&amp;D tax credit where the reduction of tax was in excess of &euro;5 million in each of the 13 cases.  I asked for the figures over &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million but, understandably, Mr. Cody said he would not give that information as it might identify the taxpayer and he aggregated the numbers over &euro;5 million and that came to a total of 13 companies.</p> <p>  The first question related to the number of companies and the second question dealt with the amount of money.  The Minister for Finance gave me the information but I am sure Revenue had an input into the reply.  On the amount of corporation tax in respect of amounts payable over &euro;5 million, which was 13 companies, the amount involved in 2016 was &euro;440 million, which represented 65% of the total.  I think I am correct in saying that.  In total, 13 companies out 1,486, less than 1% of the companies, were able to claim research and development tax credit in the amount of &euro;450 million out of a total of &euro;674 million in 2016, which was 65% of the total.  Mr. Cody gave the figures of 80% and 40% but in reality when I look at the figures less than 1% of the companies have claimed 65% of the research tax credit on the basis that they are doing the most research.  There is a logic to it, but I still want to put the figures out there.  Part of our remit is to provide information to the public so that they can understand the corporation tax situation a little bit better.</p> <p>  Those companies between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million had R&amp;D tax credit available to them of more than &euro;100 million and there were only 49 companies in that group.  Understandably, when I look at those two groups and all of the companies that were able to avail of the tax credits I work out that there are 188 companies over the four years, which gives an average of 50 companies per annum, that were able to claim &euro;1.816 billion out of a total of &euro;2.356 billion, namely 81%.  The figures I was given relate to 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  An average of 40 companies has claimed more than 80% of the credit over the four years.  That is a quite a lot in those particular areas and I wish to highlight that.</p> <p>  On the top 13 companies that I mentioned that were able to get 65% of the amount in 2016, it was an average of &euro;34 million per company.  Some of them might have been just over it and others were way over it.  I estimated the average for those companies was &euro;34 million in 2016 and &euro;36 million in 2015.  I think I am correct in my interpretation of those replies to my parliamentary questions.  If that is Mr. Cody's general understanding we will not quibble over it.  I want to put that on the record because we all talk about the 1,400, the majority of which are small companies but they are getting peanuts in terms of the value of the tax credit.  I do not dispute the value I just want people to have a good understanding of those tax credits.</p> <p>  We wrote to Mr. Cody last weekend and we appreciate that we gave him short notice to provide a reply.  He was good, as I think he has replied to each of the six questions we asked last week.  We have the briefing note in front of us since yesterday.  Some of the replies were easy to come by as they were taken from the annual reports and others probably required a bit of extra work.  I wish to hone in on one which we have touched on already, namely, corporation tax and carrying losses forward.  Losses forward are covered in Appendix No. 7 in the documentation supplied.  The information is on screen now.  That is where companies that had incurred losses in previous years can carry the losses forward against profits in a future year to reduce their tax liability.  We have mentioned the banks already in our general discussion on this issue.  The total amount on the schedule that I have been given for companies and corporations in Ireland carrying forward losses against future tax liabilities &ndash; I ask people to wait for this figure &ndash; I think I am right when I say it - is &euro;218 billion, not million.  That is losses forward by the corporate sector to be offset against profits in future years.  We are told &euro;40 billion relates to losses that are not expected to be used because those companies might be in liquidation but they had losses forward going into liquidation.  That still leaves &euro;178 billion of losses forward in the corporate sector to be offset against future corporation tax receipts.  Mr. Cody can understand why the PAC is concerned about the receipts and potential risk to the taxpayer of that big overhang.  Obviously the biggest sector of that is the financial and insurance activities which involves &euro;124 billion, and that is the majority of the amount.</p> <p>  For the record, my reading of that is a fair representation.  It is important that when we are drafting a report our facts are correct.  I was staggered by the scale of the amounts involved.  It is probably not news to some of the witnesses but it is a phenomenal figure that has not perhaps been discussed in the public arena.</p><p>We do not expect it to be carried forward next year, with no corporation tax received.  In my letter to the witnesses, I was really asking for an age analysis of this.  How far back does this go?  Is it recent or does it go back over five, ten, 15 or 20 years?  Did the witnesses say they could not provide an age analysis and that the data is not collected in that manner?  Some of this could conceivably be very old and there might not be much prospect of recovery.  However, I would have thought that an age analysis would be available.  How much of that &euro;218 billion is from last year or from the year before?  I know some comes forward each year and is utilised each year.  I am surprised and a bit disappointed that the witnesses have not been able to provide an age analysis.  It would have helped to inform public debate on corporation tax.  I also feel it is important in light of the facts we mentioned with regard to some of the key banks in terms of the rule changes involving ECB issues and capital ratios.  The banks may not be paying corporation tax for many a year to come if there is that level of losses forward in the system.</p><p> Has the Department of Finance considered a sunset clause on the losses forward?  Most people have a period of time to draw down money, but the idea that these losses can be carried forward indefinitely is probably not fair to the taxpayer into the future.  It has the potential to have a significant impact. </p></speech>

I want to ask about that consultation as well.  Are the witnesses saying that nobody looked at the issue of losses forward as part of the consultation?  Do the witnesses accept the scale of the figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018022200002#RR00500"><p>The figures are published and they are as the Chairman has said.  The corporation tax code was reviewed by Seamus Coffey last year; he provided his report in September and it was published.  The Minister then launched a consultation process on implementing that report, and the deadline has just passed, as the Chairman has pointed out.  That report did not make any recommendation in terms of change in the treatment of losses.  It does not surprise us that it was not a feature of the submissions that have since come in.</p> <p>  The issue of losses arises, of course.  It is an enormous amount.  In the analysis of the 2015 corporation tax receipts was published by Revenue, which has since been updated to show the picture for 2016, we see that there are some 8,000 companies which have worked through losses and are starting to pay corporation tax.  It is one of the factors driving the sustained increase in corporation tax receipts.  To some extent the hangover from the financial and economic crisis is starting to work its way out of the system.  We have not looked at a sunset clause in terms of the use of losses.  As Mr. Hogan said, it is not a feature of international systems, but of course it is a valid debating point for legislators in terms of our tax code.</p></speech>

To an extent, it could not be done because Revenue does not have an age analysis available, even if the Department wanted to look at it.  The first thing the Department would have to do would be to carry out an age analysis itself.  Such an analysis might have informed that level of debate.  I am surprised that the review the Minister commissioned was solely based on the recommendations of the Coffey report and that it was so restricted, it seems, because one person did not make a recommendation on it.  I am surprised that the review conducted did not go there.  The fact that it was not in the published consultation documents probably explains why so few submissions were received.  Do the witnesses accept that there is a valid issue there?  It seems to me there is a lack of information available from the Department of Finance and from Revenue in terms of how far back this goes.  The issue has been relevant in recent debates, with the banks being allowed to carry losses forward.  It has always been there but the scale and significance of it is far more relevant in people's minds than it was previously.</p></speech>

One of the issues around losses forward and the age analysis is that changes were made to the corporation tax return around 2012 to capture the losses carried forward.  Before that the losses used were the only item itemised on the return form.  That was changed, partially to identify the losses forward.  The timing concerned the collapse of the economy, and there was a massive increase in losses, so we had to capture that risk to the corporation tax base.  We have figures going back.  When it comes to looking at individual companies we can actually trawl back through time.  The challenge is to pull out that information in a statistical format.  Since 2012 those figures have been captured in our systems.</p> <p>  Losses forward are made up of two component parts, which are the actual losses and unused capital allowances.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession mentioned our report on the analysis of the 2015 corporation tax returns and the 2016 payments.  At the end of April, we will publish our analysis of the 2016 corporation tax returns and the 2017 payments.  We were asked on the last occasion about some of the employment breakdown by companies, and we are trying to address that as one of the issues when the figures are a little bit more stable.  We will try to update some of the information.  We have been keen, since the big spike in corporation tax receipts, to put as much information as we can into the public domain to allow informed discussion around the issue.</p></speech>

We published a chapter in 2012 on this subject, so I have a couple of observations on the issue.  At the time, the losses forward at the end of 2011 were approximately &euro;183 billion.  There has been an increase in the total amount.  Some of those losses were used in the intervening period and some allowances were carried forward.  An age analysis was not available at that stage.  A point we made in the report is that analysis of the balances showed at that stage that 24 cases accounted for 57% of the total.  From an age------</p></speech>

A key finding of the Coffey report is that corporation tax is heavily concentrated on a small number of companies.  Dr. Keith Walsh and his team were looking at increasing the amount of information on losses, which is a big part of the process.  In our April 2018 report we will try to give as much detail as we can while protecting confidentiality in terms of individual companies and our approach.</p></speech>

Have any of the witnesses from the Department heard of that?  The inclusion of a ceiling and a sunset clause should be examined.  The witnesses will say the European Union would not like that, and members are aware of that, but do the witnesses appreciate my point in that regard?  It is extraordinary to hear of the concentration in a small number of companies of much of the &euro;200 billion in losses carried forward.  It is not good for a country the size of Ireland to have that level of losses carried forward in the hands of a small number of companies because, as has been pointed out, it would give such companies a higher takeover value.  For a company with a big corporation tax liability seeking to take over another company, a loss of hundreds of millions carried forward would probably be a more valuable asset than the takeover company itself.  Ireland is in an odd position in that regard.  We are here to discuss the level of risk this poses to the Exchequer because that is the essence of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Has any thought been given to a ceiling or a sunset clause?  "Not really" is the answer.</p></speech>

We expect companies to burn through their losses rather than retain them for future use.  Even the banks are fully using them now, which works down a deferred tax asset over time.  I do not want to improvise on this issue but I understand a number of changes were made to the UK system in its projected move to a 17% tax rate and several base broadening measures were implemented.  I will ask my team to look into that further.  There were some changes in terms of interest deductibility and there may have been changes in the area of losses but I would rather come back to the committee with the facts-------</p></speech>

We also look at nominal GDP growth and the effect that will have.  We then liaise very closely with Revenue to get information only it would have, such as whether some of the base from last year was a one-off, whether it is expecting large refunds and any other specific information it has which we can take into account in the forecast.  As regards the concentration, the next information in that regard will be in the report referred to by Mr. Cody, which Revenue produces in April.  That will indicate the concentration in respect of 2017.  However, we do not forecast at a firm-specific level because we do not have the information to do so and can only work on the aggregate.</p></speech>

The changes brought in by the Department of Finance with effect from 1 January 2015 regarding tax residency of companies incorporated in Ireland prior to January 2015 do not take effect until 1 January 2021, which is a six year period.  How did the Department decide on that six year opportunity?  Why not three, four or eight years?  What analysis led to deciding upon a six year period?

I wish to put on the record, because people are watching these proceedings, that we have been told that approximately 175,000 companies are registered for corporation tax in Ireland but this document also states that 116,000 of those are close companies.</p><p>As such, the vast majority of the companies involved are very small.  The witness estimated that the liability paid in PAYE by the subscribers to those companies was approximately &euro;134 million.  Appendix 5 states, "The number of returns for these companies for the tax year 2015 is 116,000 companies, and the estimated corporation tax liability is &euro;632 million".  At a of 12.5%, I calculate that there is approximately &euro;5 billion worth of profits in those small companies.  Am I right in saying that?  That is right.  The briefing we received this morning held that the majority of tax connected with a close company is paid by way of salaries when the owners of the company withdraw it.  From what Mr. Cody is saying, however, it seems that the vast majority of tax is paid by the companies directly.</p><p> I asked Mr. Cody about the surcharge he said that it amounts to &euro;20 million, so quite a lot is retained that way.  Why would companies let money sit there and pay a surcharge on it?  Maybe Mr. Cody is not the one to answer that.  The Revenue Commissioners are happy to get the surcharge.  Is it clever tax planning for a firm to allow itself to be liable for a surcharge in a close company?  Mr. Cody said that 4,600 companies returned surcharges of &euro;21.4 million in 2015.  Has he any observations on that?  I know that he cannot speak for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

We carry out a regular compliance programme on the close company surcharge.  Various bodies have checked in different ways as to whether the close company surcharge has been applied properly.  We have some yield from that process.  However, I presume that sometimes things happen, money is sitting there and the company's directors are happy enough to be making money.</p></speech>

In the earlier exchanges, Mr. Cody referred to tax avoidance.  He explained the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion.  There are phrases littered throughout the report to the committee from the Chartered Accountants Ireland representative, as well as in statements made by others.  Reference is made to "tax efficiency" and "tax planning".  Is there a fine line between tax avoidance, tax efficiency and tax planning?  What is the difference between them?</p></speech>

Depending on who is sitting in this chair answering the question, there will probably be different interpretations.  We actively look at cases whereby, as we see it, people have stepped over the line between tax planning and tax avoidance.  In many cases it is ultimately determined by the courts.  The courts probably find in our favour more often than not.  However, that verdict comes in the aftermath of a very long process.  I have spoken to this committee before about tax avoidance and our approach to it.  I know my predecessors have all had that position . Various practitioners are of the view that we are obsessed with tax avoidance and that tax avoidance does not happen at all.</p></speech>

Tax avoidance is often seen as something similar to tax efficiency.  One maximises advantage through the tax code.  One might use it to one's own advantage in a way that was not intended, but it is not illegal.  Is Mr. Cody saying that there are instances where the Revenue Commissioners looks at patterns or individual instances of what it sees as tax avoidance and then takes a case to allow the court to decide whether there were intentional breaches of the tax code?</p></speech>

I raise it again this morning because I struggle to understand how it works, and why the system is the way it is.  I refer to very high earners who set up companies rather than receive a salary.  In other words, what would constitute a salary is paid to the company and then corporation tax is paid on most of this income and a salary is drawn down.  This phenomenon was investigated in the context of a special report on hospital consultants compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That report was more to do with the expenses claims, if my memory is correct.  What is the purpose of that?  Why would a person set up a company for that purpose?  What is the incentive to do it?</p></speech>

For the past several years, we have had programmes addressing contractors and medical consultants which looked at aspects of those types of structures.  Last year, we discussed the medical consultants.  The Deputy is right, some of the issues related to abuse of expenses.  However there were also issues with planning around the use of goodwill, and the transfer thereof between the company structure and the individual involved.  We recovered some significant moneys there.</p> <p>  There are a number of reasons to take the approach the Deputy describes.  One such reason concerns employers'  PRSI.  Some of this activity has to do with enhanced pension rules.  In a way, one of the things-----</p></speech>

This morning, I gave the example of a lot of the very senior broadcasters in RT&Eacute;.  It has been reported on several occasions that many of them set up these companies.  They are on six-figure salaries and they pay corporation tax rather than income tax on a lot of the money they earn.  We were told this morning that this is not being done to avoid paying tax.  I am trying to understand why it is being done.  Given what I have seen in other areas, it strikes me that this is a mechanism by means of which one can avoid paying tax.  Is it the case that different rules apply in terms of how much of the profits made by such companies can be used to pay pension contributions?  I am trying to understand the incentive involved.</p></speech>

I must respect taxpayer confidentiality.  I must speak in generalities.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Companies are set up, sometimes by high earners and sometimes by low earners, for different reasons in different cases.  The use of intermediary structures can give rise to potential losses under a number of headings.  There are different outcomes for employers' and employees' PRSI.  I refer also to indefinite deferral of the payment of part or all of the remuneration with a consequent deferral of payment of the associated tax or USC.  There are also issues around the payment of unwarranted tax-free expenses.  Generally, if an employee is getting expenses from a company, the company has a vested interest in ensuring that everything is proper there.  Different pension opportunities and contributions can also be arranged.  Those are some of the issues that arose in our work on contractors.</p></speech>

What I have quoted about opportunity is in the consultation document, so I am not saying anything that is not on the public record.  The Ministers have published the report and have undertaken to look at the policy issues it addresses.  That issue is a policy matter.  I know that there has been commentary about developments in the UK and what Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has done in this area, but legislation is different in that jurisdiction.  Particular provisions have been implemented in the UK which allow corporate structures to be looked through in certain circumstances.

I misunderstood.  The Directorate General for Competition made a finding in respect of state aid.  It found that the full incomes of the companies were properly taxable in Ireland.

If all state aid which was given to those two Apple companies is being calculated, I would imagine that similar state aid was given to other companies, was it not?  I am trying to establish what exactly the Department is looking at to arrive at whatever figure it will arrive at.  I am sure it will be greater than &euro;13 billion.  Is it looking at state aid that was made available to Apple which was not made available to other companies or all state aid made available to Apple, or what was perceived to be state aid?</p></speech>

It is not a payment.  There are different forms of state aid.  There can be benefits such as grants or payments, or there can be tax exemptions and so on.  The Commission is looking at this not as a direct payment, but as the absence of payment of tax which the Commission has adjudicated should have been paid.  That is the Commission's interpretation.</p></speech>

I put this question to Mr. Cody.  The judgment is that the State did not collect enough tax from Apple.  That judgment was because of what the Commission saw as favourable state aid rules being applied to Apple, a special arrangement or whatever way one chooses to phrase it.  That was the substance of its judgment, which the State is appealing.  If Revenue were to apply to other companies the same formula which it is using to arrive at a figure in respect of Apple, could it arrive at a figure that would mean that such companies would also have a liability under those same criteria?</p></speech>

There is a quote which has been dealt with but on which I have some questions, "eight of the 100 companies with the highest taxable income had an effective tax rate of zero, including some who had negative rates", which are cases in which rebates were paid, "A further five had an effective rate of less than 1%."  Mr. Palmer said earlier that corporation tax is highly concentrated, which it is, and that a small number of companies pay more than 30% of the total corporation tax take, which is also true.  However, there are also a small number of companies that pay very little corporation tax.  That is the other side of it which we are seeing this report.  Perhaps this was already done, but can Mr. Cody help me to understand how those companies can end up with an effective corporation tax of zero or 1%?  How would that be the case?  These were companies with high taxable incomes.</p></speech>

We went through the 13 companies and the reason they have a low effective tax rate.  There are essentially two reasons.  The first is that they are in receipt of large amounts of foreign dividends in effect of which double tax relief was available to offset Irish tax payable.  The second reason, which we spoke about earlier, was that they may have claimed research and development tax credits.</p><p>On the foreign dividends, Ireland applies a credit system to ensure that foreign source income, including foreign dividends, is not doubly taxed.  This means that an Irish resident company in receipt of foreign dividends is chargeable to Irish tax on that income at 12.5% or 25% depending on the country from which it is paid and whether the dividends are paid out of trading profits.  Where certain criteria are met, however, a credit will be available against Irish tax in respect of any foreign withholding tax applied in the country of payment, as well as in respect of foreign tax suffered and the profits out of which the dividend has been paid.</p><p> We have provided a table to show what the effective rate would be if they were not entitled to the foreign tax credit.  They have paid a higher rate of tax in the country in which the dividend comes from.  Their effective rate is actually higher than 12.5%</p></speech>

It is not that they are not taxed on that income.</p> <p>  The second aspect is the research and development tax credit.  This measure is a credit that allows for research and development investment.  Again, if one was to take out the foreign tax credit, which is tax paid elsewhere, or the spending on research and development, then all those companies would have had an effective tax rate of around 12%.  Of the 100 companies, if we discount the foreign tax credit and the research and development credit, only one company was below the 12% rate.</p></speech>

The scheme provided for in section 291A:</p><blockquote>applies to a broad range on intangible assets (e.g. patents, copyright, trademarks, know-how) [and the goodwill to the extent linked with these] which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are listed as &quot;specific intangible assets&quot; in section 291A.  ... Specified intangible assets are treated as machinery and plant for the purposes of allowances provided [under the scheme]. ... Allowances available under section 291A are based on the amount charged to a company's Profit and Loss account or Income Statement for the accounting period in respect of the amortisation or impairment of the specified intangible asset.  However, companies can opt instead for a fixed write-down period of 15 years at an annual rate of 7% of qualifying expenditure for 14 years and 2% in the final year. ...<br /><br />A company must be trading to qualify for capital allowances (although pre-trading expenditure is eligible for allowances) and the specified intangible asset(s) on which capital expenditure is incurred must be used for the purposes of its trading activity.  The expenditure must be incurred for bona fide commercial reasons and not as part of any tax avoidance scheme.</blockquote> <p>Claims must be made within 12 months of the end of the accounting period in which the capital expenditure has been incurred</p></speech>

They are two sides of the coin.  The research and development credit is about expenditure on research and development and the knowledge development box is for the tax rate on income arising out of the exploitation and commercialisation of a company's patents.  One flows through the other and if some research and development will not result in any income, then it will not succeed by its very nature.</p></speech>

Companies utilising this rate is in the just recently-filed returns.  There is a very small number, which I believe we have given in reply to parliamentary questions.  The current cost of the knowledge development box for 2017 is in the region of &euro;5 million.  There is a very small number of claimants for this rate but they have two years in which to claim.  It will be a while before we can be definitive on the 2017 process.  Ultimately, the knowledge development box is a new scheme.  It is heavily modified and is the first patent box that is fully in accordance with the OECD rules.  There are significant conditions attached to it and it will be interesting see how it evolves over time.  My colleagues may want to contribute comments from the policy perspective.</p></speech>

It is a new incentive.  It is quite limited in its availability.  When it was introduced, we thought it might cost up to &euro;50 million in a full year.  It is probably more attractive to smaller start-up companies.  A company will really only get the benefit if it has developed the patent or the copyrighted software here in Ireland.  With some of the bigger companies, these aspects happen overseas in Silicon Valley and so on.

The rules, as Mr. Cody has said, are OECD standard rules and everybody is following these rules internationally.  I believe that Ireland was the first to introduce the OECD-compliant rules.  The research and development tax credit is more for the expenditure and what the company spends.  The company might not necessarily spend that on creating the patent.  The KDB will only apply when the company creates an intellectual property asset.  Not all research and development is about creating an intellectual property asset.</p></speech>

We did not discuss the dividend withholding tax, which is referenced in Appendix 4 of the documentation supplied.  I ask Mr. Cody to explain the figure listed for 2014, which is the amount of withholding tax on Irish companies paying dividends.  Is most of that money paid to Irish people?  How much of that sum is paid to foreign entities?  I know that Revenue has details on the recipients of the withholding tax.  How much of the withholding tax is paid to people who are resident in Ireland?  How much of those dividends is paid to people from outside of this State?</p></speech>

There was probably what would be seen as a number of companies having significant dividend payments in 2015.  Sometimes it has to do with a restructuring of their whole shareholder base.  That resulted in an increase in dividend withholding taxes.  Obviously a lot of the commentators will criticise the accuracy of forecasting.  There are certain things that we cannot forecast because we do not know they are going to happen.</p></speech>

We certainly look to see if there is anything that indicates whether it is going to be continuing or sustaining.  Interestingly, if one ignores the outliers or special payments, since 2014 there has been an 18% increase in the ordinary - if one wants to call it that - dividend withholding tax on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

The letter reads:</p><blockquote>It should also be noted that determinations in relation to charitable tax status are entirely a matter for the Revenue Commissioners ... the Revenue Commissioners are not bound by any determination of the Authority as to whether a purpose is of public benefit or not.</blockquote> <p>The term &quot;Authority&quot; means the Charities Regulator.  We seem to have a parallel system.  The Charities Regulator can register charities and the Revenue Commissioners can grant a tax status with no regard to the Charities Regulator.

The sector only started off last year and Revenue has said there was possibly only &euro;5 million of taxable income or tax liability involved.  In terms of companies that are entitled to half the corporation tax rate - 12.5% rate - such companies are entitled to the 6.25% tax rate.  Those companies can also take a deduction worth 12.5% for revenue-type research and development expenditure.  Also, they can get a credit that equates to 25% of the qualifying research and development expenditure, which is 37.5%.  The top rate of tax for a company that earns income in that situation is 6.25%.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, that is correct.  What the knowledge development box, KDB, is really about is that one spends money creating an intellectual property asset and the income that that asset creates is taxed at an effective rate of 6.25%.  That will not necessarily apply to all at all-----</p></speech>

I mentioned the research and development tax credit.  To give the figures for the research and development tax credit, the amount offset against the corporation tax liability in 2013 was &euro;185 million; in 2014, &euro;227 million; in 2015, &euro;349 million, and in 2016, &euro;434 million, giving a total of &euro;1.195 billion.  On the other side, there is the research and development repayable credit, or what I call a cashback.  In 2013 Revenue wrote cheques to a value of &euro;236 million; in 2014, &euro;326 million; in 2015, &euro;359 million, and 2016, &euro;240 million, amounting to a cashback of &euro;1.161 billion.  The two figures add up to the sum of &euro;2.356 billion mentioned for the four years in question, approximately half of which is a reduction in corporation tax liabilities, while the other half represents an electronic funds transfer in the other direction. </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming back a second time to discuss the issue of corporation tax which we believed was important.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for being with us.  I thank Mr. Cody and his staff and the officials from the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  Our next meeting will be held on Thursday, 1 March, when we will meet officials from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss chapter 15 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the grant funding of the arthouse cinema in Galway and Vote 33 of the Appropriation Accounts for the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p></speech>

The group comprises a significant number of Votes as follows: the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform andseveral offices under its aegis, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of the Ombudsman.  It includes the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances and the secret service.  The remaining Vote in the group, the Vote for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by the sub-committee.</p> <p>  The committee has been supplied with a very detailed briefing document by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes.  Further detailed material is contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2018 which was prepared by my Department and published on 14 December 2017.  It is worth noting that the total net allocation for the 2018 Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group of Votes which comprises eight distinct Votes shows a very modest increase of 2% on the 2017 allocation.  The 2018 overall net figure of &euro;520.9 million compares to a figure of &euro;510.2 million in 2017.  A difference of &euro;6.2 million is reflected in the superannuation Vote for 2018.</p> <p>  The structure of the Vote remains unchanged in 2018, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  The requested resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in Part III of the Estimate.  In 2018 we are seeking a 6% increase in the gross spend under the Vote, bringing the total gross allocation to &euro;59.531 million.  The increase is required primarily for the second programme - public service management and reform - as my Department continues to roll out a comprehensive programme of reform.  It is largely related to the provision for investment in a resilient and robust technical platform from which to deliver build-to-share applications as part of the remit of the Office of Government Chief Information Officer; the provision for the funding of the Civil Service learning and development shared services project; an additional provision for the design of an administrative system to support the implementation of the single public service pension scheme and the funding of the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p> <p>  On Programme B of the Vote, public service management and reform, members will recall that I had the opportunity to discuss the next phase with the committee during my appearance last week.  Nevertheless, I once again draw members&rsquo; attention to the main points of the new framework which I launched last December.  There has been progress since the first reform programme was started in 2011 in areas which include procurement, shared services and Civil Service renewal, as well as public service reform, all of which continue to play a key role.  The key pillars are, first, delivering for the public; second, innovating for the future; and, third, developing people and the organisation.</p> <p>  Work continues to implement the actions included in the Civil Service renewal programme.  I published the third annual progress report last June which showed that much had been achieved under the programme of change since the plan had been initiated.  While the renewal plan was envisaged as a three-year programme of work and is being delivered on a phased basis, I see Civil Service renewal as an ongoing process.  We will continue to embed the changes across Departments and offices this year.</p> <p>  In addition to progress in implementing public service reform, we continue to pursue a wide-ranging reform programme aimed at delivering an open, accountable and ethical Government approach underpinned by a transparent and effective public service.  Key areas of focus are the data sharing and governance Bill; the open data strategy; and a statutory review of the operation of the Protected Disclosures Act of 2014 which will be published in the first half of 2018.</p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the issue of public service pay.  Last year when I briefed the committee, we were addressing the aftermath of the Labour Court's ruling on Garda pay and the undermining effect it had had on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I outlined a two-phase process designed, first, to stabilise the Lansdowne Road agreement and then to negotiate a successor.  We have had success in following this approach.  The Government has negotiated the new agreement which is a significant achievement that will deliver the full dismantling of the financial emergency legislation in way that is affordable and that I believe is fair, but challenges remain.  The Public Service Pay Commission is examining recruitment and retention issues in the health sector.  Legacy issues associated with new entrant grades are also being examined and a report will be submitted to the Oireachtas by March.  Both issues are likely to prompt difficult discussions later in the year, but the current environment is largely stable.</p> <p>  As Minister with responsibility for the public service and public service reform, I am committed to ensuring we will continue to use digitisation to deliver more efficient and effective services.  Our own surveys have shown that people want to use more public services online.  We have seen a positive approach to using the digital services gateway and the public services card and MyGovID, demonstrating that the public understands the importance of having a reliable, authenticated and secure means of online verification.  We will continue this work when making services available throughout the year.  However, we also want to make sure no one who wants to transact business electronically will be left behind.  In that regard, we hope to announce some assisted digital initiatives later in the year.</p><p> In 2018 my Department will lead the second phase of the three-year spending review process which will take place in advance of the 2019 Estimates process.  It will build on the successful spending review in 2017 which culminated in the publication of more than 20 technical papers.  While moderate expenditure growth is planned, there continues to be many public service demands.  We must have a continual focus on the totality of spending to ensure public funds will have the maximum effect.  The intention is that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options in the budgetary process and assist in funding new policy measures.</p><p> As members will be aware, last Friday my Department published the national development plan.  The plan demonstrates the Government's commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructural and investment needs.  It reflects an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the sustainable capacity of the economy and the need to adhere to responsible spending.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to present the Estimates.  I will be pleased to answer questions members may have.</p></speech>

On the PEACE and INTERREG programmes, the Minister indicated that the possibility of providing support for the programmes post-2020 would be examined favourably.  Much will depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  Is the Department engaged in planning in this area?  I presume a lead-in time is required in identifying programmes.  Will the Minister elaborate on the issue?</p> <p>  While I do not expect an answer to my next question, I will ask it in any case.  What exactly is the secret service?</p></speech>

I never expected to utter those words.  On the question related to Brexit and cross-Border funding, I assure the Deputy that it is a major focus for me and my Department.  I will comment on the current position and what we would like to achieve in the future.  In the immediate aftermath of the referendum in the United Kingdom on leaving the European Union, my Department engaged with the British Treasury and I engaged extensively with the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  Our first priority has been to secure existing programmes which are worth more than &euro;500 million and will continue until 2020.  In the aftermath of the referendum on Brexit, concerns were expressed that difficulties could arise in the roll-out of the next phase of the funding plan.  We have addressed these concerns.</p><p>We have committed 73% of the funding available under the PEACE programme and 79 projects valued at &euro;176 million have been approved.  With regard to the INTERREG programme, the second major funding stream, we have committed 78% of the funding available under it and approved 27 projects valued at &euro;208 million.  My short-term priority was to ensure existing commitments were realised.  I am confident that the programmes in place until 2020 will be completed.  Beyond 2020, I am committed to implementing programmes to succeed the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes.  The Department is examining the legal basis for EU programmes that operate in Third Countries, in other words, those operating in non-EU countries in which the European Union has a strong interest.  I am committed to developing a means of maintaining this work.</p><p>The December statement on the Brexit negotiations included the following:</p><blockquote>Both parties will honour their commitments to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes under the current multi-annual financial framework.  Possibilities for future support will be examined favourably.</blockquote> <p>To respond to the Deputy's question on the secret service, it has been the custom and practice for the D&aacute;il to waive its right to ascertain the purposes for which this allocation is used.  I hope that practice will continue.  I must supply all related documentation to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General which audits the use of the money.  I ask that the current arrangement continue and expect that it will.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that he is committed to trying to secure funding for the programmes after 2020.  In that regard, it is welcome that he is examining the legal basis for EU programmes involving third party countries.  When will decisions be made on these matters?  I presume they must be made before 2020, given that preparations need to be made for these programmes well in advance of their commencement as they cannot be implemented at the last minute.  Yesterday the Committee on Budgetary Oversight met to discuss the equality budgeting process, which falls within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I could not find any reference to equality budgeting in the Estimates.  Where can I find the budget for the roll-out and continuation of the equality budgeting process?</p></speech>

The first will be in May, when we expect a communication from the European Council on its proposals for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework, MFF.  This is important because most of the funding used to underpin the programmes comes from the EU budget which will be determined by the new Multi-Annual Financial Framework which will have to be negotiated.  As to what we will do before and after that, my officials and I regularly engage with the Commission on what will be the precedent for implementing replacement programmes.  I have visited areas where a number of the programmes are in operation.  Some months ago, for example, I visited Derry where I observed the programmes in action.  While I was aware of some of the projects being undertaken under the PEACE and INTERREG programmes in counties Cavan and Monaghan, my support for this work was reaffirmed when I witnessed the tangible effects of the investments in addressing many of the difficulties still experienced by communities.</p> <p>  Funding for the equality proofing initiative is located across a variety of expenditure lines in the Department.  I do not have a single budget line for it because it happens under a number of Votes, namely, education and skills; business, enterprise and innovation; transport, tourism and sport; culture; health; and children and youth affairs.</p><p>For each of those Votes within my Department, work is under way on equality budgeting, all of which has been acknowledged by me a number of times and by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  This is also a commitment in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.</p></speech>

I have complained to the Minister previously about the absence of women in the room when his Department has been present, so I am delighted to welcome two women to the top table this morning and to acknowledge that there are other female officials in the audience as well.  There is a great deal of talent among women in the public service, but having that recognised fully in the Department of Finance has been difficult.</p> <p>  My second point affects both of our constituencies.  We all know that there are large numbers of young people who are either in college or have finished it and who are from ethnic minorities or have come from countries around the world to live in my constituency, which is the Minister's home area, and in his constituency, which is in many ways my home area.  I hope that the Department has a policy, through its influence on the recruitment process, to ensure that those young people, many of whom have done excellently in school and college, have a share of the opportunity to be recruited into the public service.  Some 30% of the people in various parts of Dublin are not originally from Ireland.  They or their parents came to live here.  In this light, it is time that we saw the fantastic diversity that exists in Dublin reflected in recruitment policy.  Just as it is odd not to see women present at the top table, it is equally odd not to see the diversity of Ireland.  It would be a reflection of our success story.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about public service pay and section 39 organisations.  I am concerned about the hospice movement.  There are hospices in all of our major cities and right around the country, with several in Dublin.  There is a major hospice in Cork.  Since hospice staff members are employees of organisations governed by section 39 rules, they have been unable to access the increases that the Minister referred to in the context of the public pay restoration programme.  That programme has been long overdue and I was a part of the Government that introduced it, but I am disappointed that it does not cover the people who work in section 39 organisations, including organisations that provide vital services to persons in the broader health sector like Rehab, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Irish Hospice Association.  Unless the Minister finds a solution, at the end of the two-year period, which will be soon, there will be a 3% negative differential between the pay of a nurse who works in a hospice and one who has stayed working in a hospital, perhaps one that is close by or even on the same campus.  The same will hold true across sectors where there are health professionals, allied professions and others.  They are waiting.</p> <p>  There were moves to establish a process, but the Department has stated that it is unsure about who took the cuts.  Almost every nurse or doctor in those institutions took the cuts in a spirit of helping the country in its darkest hour when the finances had collapsed.  Now they find that they are being told that they cannot have the cuts reinstated.  It will pose a major difficulty to recruitment and retention.  There is a worldwide shortage of health professionals, teachers and so on.  They are getting plenty of offers from a range of countries around the world, some of which are aggressively recruiting them.  If there is a hard crash-out Brexit by the UK, the UK will recruit aggressively for almost all categories of public service staff.  Currently, those are being recruited from the wider European Union.</p> <p>  Has the Minister a solution to this unfair situation?  People in vital, publicly funded health and other services are not getting pay restoration.  In a relatively short time, they will have a 3% minus differential compared with other people working in the hospital next door.</p></speech>

She raised the question with me previously, but I was not in a position to answer it fully then.  She asked about where we were in terms of diversity in our appointees, particularly through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  In 2017, the proportion of female appointees through PAS was 52% of all appointments.  Since discussing the matter with the Deputy, I recently spoke at an event at the Institute of Directors in Ireland where I said that this was a pace of change that I wanted to see continue.  From what I see in my Departments, we are making progress on a number of levels - by levels, I mean tiers within Departments - but when we reach certain strata, the degree of progress is not what I want.  I want to ensure that we continue making progress on this year after year.</p> <p>  Regarding what we are doing to respond to the new Ireland that is growing up in our primary and secondary schools, the PAS is working with NGOs that represent the range of nationalities to which the Deputy referred.  Within that, we are particularly focused on the country's Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Latvian and Brazilian communities.  To promote public service job opportunities across Ireland, we are moving into a space where the PAS will be targeting the awareness of jobs in those communities via social media.  We will also ensure that the same work is done to focus on our Traveller, LGBTI and disabilities communities and Irish language groups.  This important piece of work will continue within the PAS.</p> <p>  At a practical level, we have redesigned the various websites that our citizens may use to become aware of job opportunities to incorporate new technology to support candidates who have disabilities or use English as a foreign language.  The main reason for doing this is that the citizens who depend on these services are changing in front of our eyes.  As families grow up and kids leave school, we need public services that reflect the make-up of modern Ireland.  The community that the Deputy and I live in reflects how we can do that well.  We are going to keep at it.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on section 39 organisations directly, we are further advanced in dealing with this matter than we were earlier in the year.  We have put together a process, which has been acknowledged by the representatives of employees in the section 39 organisations, to better understand and penetrate what has happened.</p><p>Even from the initial work we have done, it is showing different things happened in different organisations.  I acknowledge that it is the case that wage differentials are developing in some organisations.  We will have to reflect on what that means.  It is not the case for all organisations, however, and different organisations responded in different ways.</p><p> We are now on the third round of wage change in the public service.  The previous two rounds of public service wage change happened in a way that did not cause the difficulties the Deputies raised now.  We will need to get a better picture of what has happened in the section 39 organisations in their entirety.  I hope we will make progress in getting to that understanding in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is positive that information should be given to people from these communities who are interested in coming into the public service.  I did not hear the Minister refer to African or Asian non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  Obviously, there is a large African population in Ireland, as well as significant populations from different countries in Asia.</p><p>The previous Government moved the quota for employing people with a disability in the public service from 4% to 6%.  How much progress has been made in that regard?  I welcome overall the Minister's comments on that.</p><p>I have not read the recently published national plan in great detail, so I am open to correction.  My understanding is that the Department has essentially removed the 10% cap, agreed by the previous Government, on public private partnerships, PPPs.  The reliance on PPPs arose in the context of the country not being able to borrow money.  People are aware that many PPPs are ultimately more expensive than direct State borrowing, particularly when interest rates are low.  We have also moved into a different stage of the economy.  Will the Minister confirm that the cap on investment in PPPs for the national plan has been removed?  If so, why?  What is the Minister's targeted percentage for PPP finance?</p><p>I tabled a series of parliamentary questions to all Departments on the amounts committed to PPPs.  I am still waiting for an answer on discount rates and interest rates.  Working out the financial cost of a PPP is extremely difficult.  The two companies which feature largely in PPPs are Capita and Carillion.  The latter is in a state of collapse.  From reading a recent commentary in the <i>Financial Times</i>as to how Capita runs its own business, it is far from organised and is run in an appalling way.  In the context of the Carillion collapse and Capita's enormous difficulties, why would the Minister outsource internal audit services in a variety of Departments to Capita?  Why do that when one could use public service recruitment for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office?  The contracts are not large.  Why do particular services such as internal audit need to be outsourced?  I would have thought many people would be willing to work in the public service.  Is it the case that there is now a difficulty with recruiting people into the public service?</p><p>There is a slick putting together of the information and maps in the national development plan.  Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford, however, are not on the main map for national development.  That surprised me and I am sure it surprised the Chairman even more.  Kerry is also not on the main map.  The south east and south west are significant places.  The maps are glitzy and look fantastic.  I welcome that Waterford is included.  Why are the other counties in the south east blacked out, as well as Kerry?  Will the Minister give us a more detailed explanation as to why that is the case?</p><p>I was the Minister for Social Protection when the public services card was initiated.  One of the reasons for developing the card was to provide a decent, respectful and humane service to people like pensioners who use public transport.  In recent times, there has been much criticism of the public services card.  However, for pensioners who use public transport, they can get on the bus with an identity card which they can use like a Leap card and with dignity and privacy.  In terms of public service delivery, that is a big gain.</p><p>When dealing with many people in retirement or in their 80s or 90s, one has to allow flexibility.  If they have a difficulty with some kind of a request from some unknown bureaucracy, they may find it difficult to respond.  Departments must be quite flexible in acknowledging that, as we do this transition, it is necessary to recognise people's human rights, individuality and where they are at.</p></speech>

The answer I gave to the Deputy referred to new groups we are now targeting.  That is new work under way in recent times on top of the work we have regarding Asian and African communities.</p> <p>  There is a 3% target in place across all Departments for the employment of citizens with disabilities.  My Department has exceeded that target.</p> <p>  I have recommended in the national development plan that the current limit of 10% on the exposure of annual Exchequer allocations for PPPs should be replaced.  I will be publishing further policy on this in the coming months.</p><p>I adopt a very careful attitude to the use of PPPs.  I operate on a case-by-case basis.  Any Department proposing to use PPPs to fund infrastructure has to be able to demonstrate to me and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, that doing so would result in better value than having the Exchequer borrow the money directly.  Therefore, the context in which PPPs are now being used has changed by comparison with a number of years ago.  There are clear criteria that Departments have to meet.  I will be supporting and implementing PPPs only on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> With regard to what the Deputy said about the outsourcing of audit services, I am not familiar with the specific service referred to but I will obtain more information on it.  I would imagine from having dealt with such matters in the past that an audit service of the kind in question would proceed to public procurement only if it related to an area of specialised auditing that was felt could best be done by an outside company or body, or if we did not have the capacity to do the work.  From my experience of dealing with this across a variety of Departments, I am aware that all Departments, including mine, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have very significant audit facilities in place.</p><p> I will have to get a copy of the particular map the Deputy is referring to.  Maps I have seen, particularly in respect of transport projects that are identified, refer to both the south east and south west.</p><p> With regard to the public services card, I take the Deputy's point.  It is true that the use of the card to help senior citizens to gain access to their free travel entitlements has been a real success.  As I said on a number of occasions, I expect that as the card is rolled out for new services, Departments will exercise the right amount of flexibility in making it work for individual citizens.  Later in the year, we will be announcing a number of assist initiatives to try to help in this regard.  I do not want the rolling out of the card to create a new digital divide.</p></speech>

The legal fees for the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, have increased.  The increase this year will be in the order of 50%.  Is there a common thread in the cases being taken?  Is that why there is an increase of 50%?  Is it a consequence of the implementation of new lobbying regulations?</p></speech>

Expenditure and legal fees vary from year to year.  With regard to the reason for the change to which the Deputy referred, there were five court appeals concluded in 2017.  At the beginning of 2018, there were 11 active cases before the High Court.  With regard to the ongoing cases, I am not aware of any common thread.</p></speech>

I have a question on the process from here on.  I raise this because there is some confusion over it and the &euro;2 billion fund that has been earmarked or ring-fenced for the major urban areas, plus some other urban areas identified in the national development plan.  I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that it was expected in Waterford - I can speak only about my own constituency - that there would be a specific allocation announced last week for particular projects in the city.  There was genuine disappointment when this did not occur.  Since last week, people have been asking what the process is.  This question has been asked by the city and county manager and other officials in terms of how we are to deal with this from now on.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on the process we can expect from now on.  The levels of anticipation and expectation were very high.  It was expected that the figures would be specific to Waterford under the national development plan.  When they were not, there was some surprise.</p></speech>

Regarding what we are going to do to take its place, I will be agreeing with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government the access criteria for the fund.  It is a very significant fund.  The access criteria will be completely predicated on the policy objectives of the national planning framework.  My objective is to have the work concluded with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the next six to eight weeks and to have the fund open for applications by or during the summer.</p></speech>

People understand how Government works.  In some cases, it works more slowly than one would like.  In this case, we are dealing with investors who in some cases might have expected more clarity on the figures involved.  I take the Minister's point on why he and his Department proceeded as they did, but some effort needs to be made in some cases to reassure the investors that what is coming down the line is real and that the figures bandied about and discussed, and expected in some cases, can be followed through on by the Department.  Certainty is important at this point.  It is necessary for the Department to relate the figures to the individuals and groups involved.</p></speech>

I accept what the Deputy is saying and I appreciate his acknowledging what would have happened if I had done the opposite as well.  If I had said in the plan that a particular city or project was going to get X, I would be asked here why another city did not get Y.  I have a great deal of experience now with the roll-out of the local infrastructure housing activation fund which was a bid-based process and is in the process of allocating approximately &euro;200 million across the country in a way that requires co-funding.  That structure has allowed us to meet the governance requirements of how we grant aid significant amounts of public money.  The way I will deal with the concern, and I understand why it is being raised, is by meeting the timelines I have identified there.  I have been asked about two issues, whether by a local authority or a private investor working with a local authority.  One is whether there is a budget line available to do projects that investors or local authorities are not in a position to do by themselves.  As I said last Friday, there will be.  On the second issue, I will outline publicly what the criteria will be.  We will aim to open applications for that fund as soon as the summer because we need to be able to demonstrate how this is going to work to enable some projects to move forward.</p></speech>

Perhaps the chief executive of Waterford City and County Council could contact the Minister's office to start to discuss the process, at least, and outline what the council can expect with regard to what the Minister just said, specifically as it relates to Waterford.  That would be helpful.</p></speech>

We have identified a project in Waterford as potentially meeting those criteria.  The same is true for Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We have already met the chief executives of all the local authorities.  That happened at the end of last week and my Department will extend an invitation to meet anybody who has questions about the work that is under way because I want to see this fund realise certain projects.</p></speech>

The chief executive in Waterford was quoted this week as saying that the council was not jumping up and down with regard to the announcements made last week.  That leads to an air of uncertainty.  Politically and investor-wise it is worrying when one hears something like that after what we have gone through with the process.  Some clarity in respect of the Department and the local authority would be useful.  I did not like what was said and it would be useful if clarity is brought to the process at this juncture.  I appreciate the Minister's response.</p></speech>

It is an issue the Minister raised in his opening statement when he said he wanted open, accountable and ethical Government underpinned by a transparent and effective public system.  Everybody in the committee subscribes to that aspiration.  The Minister has direct responsibility for holding up 27 legislative measures that have been passed by the D&aacute;il or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some of them were passed by the D&aacute;il with the Government's support.  However, it is clear at this stage that there is now a Government policy not to provide money messages to legislative measures, including measures before this committee.  One measure, for example, is legislation I sponsored.  It was drafted by the Law Reform Commission, which knocks on the head the Taoiseach's argument that these are drafted overnight.  It is legislation the Government supports and which the Minister's predecessor in the junior capacity of that Department asked me not to bring before the committee until the summer of last year because of the Department's workload.  I agreed to do that on the basis that it would proceed.  The legislation is still not allowed to proceed because no money message has been provided.</p> <p>  I will outline what this legislation provides for, and this is just one example from 27 legislative measures awaiting money messages.  The Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill provides for an update of our insurance laws.  Those laws were drafted on the basis of court rulings in Britain arising from the 1630s and 1640s in terms of merchant shipping.  The Bill ensures that when one's house is struck by lightning and burns to the ground the insurance company cannot refuse to pay out as a result of it declaring that one's burglar alarm, which had nothing to do with the lightning strike on the house, was faulty or was not the type that was identified in the insurance contract.  The legislation is very sensible.  It is about balancing the scales of justice for the consumer as opposed to the large insurance company.  It also puts an onus on the insurance company to ask for information instead of being able to nullify insurance contracts because the consumer did not know what information should have been given freely and voluntarily without being requested.</p> <p>  There are many other measures.  The D&aacute;il has just passed what is known by the public as the jail the bankers Bill.  It will allow bankers to face up to five years in jail if they lie to the Central Bank.  That legislation was drafted by the legal division of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It was written by legal professionals on my instruction and guidance, yet it will not get a money message.  Why is the Minister's Department holding up allowing these Bills to be scrutinised on Committee Stage, which the democratic wish of the D&aacute;il?</p> <p>  I wish to make another point.  There would be a logical argument if some of these legislative measures caused a charge on the public purse, but the measures I mentioned do not cause a charge.  They change the law but the Department does not have to create a new budget line to implement them.  They are not about changing tax bands or introducing new motorways or the like.  They are about changing the laws to ensure better rights for consumers.  It is not a draw on the public purse.  It might be a draw on the purse of the insurance companies as perhaps they might not make as much profit.  Will the Minister explain why we are in this position two years later?  There is also a question which the committee has discussed in private session.  Why should this committee continue to facilitate Government legislation when the Minister is refusing to accept any legislation from the Opposition despite those measures being agreed by the D&aacute;il, sometimes unanimously?</p></speech>

If a commitment was given to the Deputy that the Government will facilitate a particular legislative measure I will follow up on that commitment and refer back to the Deputy by the end of next week on where that stands.  Regarding the Bill that passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, when replying to the debate on my behalf said that there were a number of areas in the Bill which we agreed should be implemented.  We believe there are ways, particularly when we receive the feedback from the Central Bank on banking culture in the summer, that are likely to converge with what is included in the Deputy's Bill.</p> <p>  On the question about why the committee facilitates passing legislation from the Government, the answer to that varies on a case-by-case basis.  I do not have a majority in the committee and if the committee decides to facilitate Government legislation it is because the committee believes the policy objectives included in the Bill are worth making happen.</p></speech>

However, it is not about an individual piece of legislation.  It is relevant to this.   The reason I say it is relevant is because the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in his opening statement, talked about political reform, accountability and ethical Government.  He has introduced this topic.  There is an issue here because the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday said that unless parties sign up to the capacity review of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Dunning report, then the money messages will not be forthcoming.  He is taking a blanket approach in relation to this.</p> <p>  He is not looking at legislation on a one-to-one basis.  We have two years now of legislation before the committee, and it is not just this committee, because the Minister and his Department make the calls in respect of all of the other items of legislation.  Some of those items are very important, well drafted and should be in law.  I am probably one of the lucky ones.  I have had legislation pass both Houses of the Oireachtas and be signed into law by the President.  </p> <p>  I would argue that if I were to present the same Bill now, it would have been blocked by a money message.  We got in at the very start before the Government decided to use this as a way to frustrate the democratic wishes of the D&aacute;il.  Can the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, give us any hope there will be a change in attitude from the Government and indeed from the Minister himself?  He is the line Minister in the Department which is responsible for deciding if money messages are presented or not in respect of outstanding items of legislation.  Are we supposed to just plod on through with legislation that has been passed by members, sometimes with the Minister's own support, but that is going to be killed off on Committee Stage because we cannot get the money message to take it to the next stage?  I refer to debate and scrutiny.  If members at that time want to vote it down, so be it.  That is democracy.  We are here as legislators.  Our primary role is to legislate.  That is what we try to do.  In some cases we have been successful in that.  However, the Minister is frustrating the ability of the majority of people in this House, which is the Opposition, to actually do their job as legislators.</p></speech>

I know it has been discussed at political level within parties.  That anger and frustration is there in the context of the work we do.  It is not just a personal opinion of Deputy Doherty.  It is one that has been expressed by the members of this committee.</p></speech>

It is not an Estimates matter.  It does not involve the use of taxpayers' money for this year in the way all the other matters being raised with me do.  If there are there are concerns about individual items of legislation or indeed many pieces of legislation being held on Committee Stage, we will look at each of them in turn and revert back to the committee with an answer.</p></speech>

As a starting point, the Minister could review those items of legislation and give us a detailed response as to why he has decided not to allow those to proceed.  We hear so much about "new politics" yet this is old style politics.  This is abusing power.  Only the Government can issue a money message.  It is frustrating the will of the D&aacute;il.  At the end of the day, we are either democrats or we are not.  If those elected to represent the people of this State decide they want an item of law to progress to the next stage, then it is incumbent on the Government to facilitate that.</p></speech>

A specific and unique power that sits only with Government is the ability to grant money messages on clear criteria.  A Government deciding to issue or not to issue a money message is doing so in a way that reflects the status we have in the Constitution and to do so it not anti-democratic.  It is to fulfil a duty we have.  As was said a moment ago, and I will repeat it again, in respect of the specific item of legislation the Deputy raised with me, which predates my time in this Department, I will come back to him on that next week.  In respect of what the Chair has said, if there are a number of items of legislation, beyond what Deputy Doherty has said, the committee feels are not being progressed in the way they should be, I will respond to each of them if the committee identifies them to me.</p></speech>

Will the Minister make available departmental officials who make the calls in relation to money messages so committee members, who wish to engage, can get a better understanding of the strict criteria used to determine whether a money message is required or not?  It is deeply confusing.  Sometimes we try to introduce legislation that we cannot even present on the floor of the D&aacute;il because it would have a charge on the public purse.  Sometimes we are allowed.  Sometimes it passes on Second Stage and then we find on Committee Stage there is a money message required.  There seems to be a lack of consistency.  To better inform us all of the criteria used, it would be greatly appreciated if the Minister would make some of his officials available to whichever members of this committee wanted to engage with them.</p></speech>

Indeed, officials from both my Departments appear in front of this committee nearly as regularly as I do to answer questions on policy.  On this particular matter, it is a decision made by me and then by Government.  It is not made by officials.  I will supply the criteria that underpinned that decision.  However, decision-making sits at ministerial and Cabinet level alone.  It is best dialogue on this is confined to me.  However, if there is not clarity regarding what those criteria are, if members do not have that clarity, I will supply what the criteria are.  From a process point of view, the Deputy has named one Bill.  I will come back to him on that next week.  If the Chair will share with me other Bills that he or the committee are concerned about, I will respond.  As part of the communication I will articulate what the criteria are against which a money message is or is not granted.</p></speech>

I refer to the Office of Government Procurement.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am jumping between committees.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does various reports and we are finalising one today.  An example is the report where we found there were serious flaws in respect of &euro;3.8 billion going to section 38 companies and how procurement was carried out.  It is a huge amount of money.  It is 38% of funding of the HSE.</p> <p>  We are also hearing issues coming to the fore in respect of Garda contracts relating to IT.  Again, we are talking about huge amounts of money.  One contract that was not tendered was for &euro;26.5 million.  What is the consequence or the impact in respect of how Government procurement changes as a result of the reports that are generated and the items identified through this process?   </p></speech>

On Deputy Kelly's last question, each report that comes from this committee on a matter of concern, such as the example he gave, comes to me.</p><p>The key points of that report are given to me.

As part of the ongoing development of the framework process under which procurement works, the Office of Government Procurement takes account of all the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have served on the Committee of Public Accounts.  I know that procurement and governance is a perennial issue.  My Department works with the officials in the Office of Government Procurement and communicates on a regular basis with line Departments.  It is up to the Accounting Officers to work with the Office of Government Procurement.  We are engaged in an evolving process.  Every time a report comes out, we would love not to have issues with procurement and governance, but we have such issues, unfortunately.  The Office of Government Procurement is taking all of those issues on board and making the necessary changes as it sees fit.</p></speech>

I have a couple of other specific questions.  I was not going to mention the Vote of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, but I will do so as a side issue.  My personal view is that there needs to be a conversation about the capacity and resources of that office because it needs help with its humongous volume of work.  My colleague who has now left referred to the national development plan or planning framework - whatever the Government is now calling it - which will run up to 2040.  As it is not on a statutory basis, as far as I am concerned it is not even legal.  Anyway, that is beside the point.  I want to ask about how decisions on various components of the capital plan were made.  I will focus on a particular area - the various roads projects - to make it easier.  I understand that large changes were made to this plan, which is based on evidence, in recent weeks.  What was involved in the process of engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland in this regard?</p></speech>

In the case of transport, for example, there was a focus on projects that dealt with challenges like road safety or met the Department's preliminary criteria for projects to go to appraisal or to the pre-planning stage.  That was done by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

Fair enough.  Officials from that Department appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts a couple of months ago.  Officials from Transport Infrastructure Ireland appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport a few weeks ago.  I attended that meeting and I have been in correspondence with the officials as well.  I will meet them soon.  I will explain the issue.  Obviously, there is an evidence base here.  Did the prioritisation of any of the projects change between the publication of the draft plan and the production of the final plan?</p></speech>

He is aware of the need for evidence when decisions are being made.  He is familiar with the use of evidence in how we make decisions on these matters.  There was no draft version of the national capital plan.  The only draft version that went out to public consultation related to the national planning framework.  No version of the national capital plan was made available for public consultation because it is partially a budgetary document.</p></speech>

This was launched last Friday, 16 February 2018.  I presume all the evidence - the methodology and the weighting systems, etc. - will be produced when I meet those involved in the next week or so.

The chief executive officer was appointed without open competition.  Questions were asked about whether the tenders and contracts that were awarded met public procurement requirements.  Benefacts is not covered by the 2016 code of governance.  I will not take up the time of the committee by mentioning the other queries that were raised.  They are all on the record.  The Chairman of the joint committee is waiting for responses to questions asked at last week's meeting.  Is it the case that the Minister has no issues with the various matters that were raised, such as how Benefacts spends money, how people are appointed, how it is audited, how the audit works, its code of governance and its funding?</p><p>Are there no issues whatsoever?</p></speech>

Based on the evidence available to me and the facts shared on the operation of the organisation, I am satisfied that it meets the requirements it is meant to meet.  I know that a number of questions and matters were raised related to the operation.  I am sure and I expect that Benefacts will respond with answers.

Will he outline what that means?  </p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Joan Burton with respect to section 39 services.  In my constituency SOS and the St. Patrick's Centre which are undergoing a management review are awaiting sanction for different structures.  The section 39 argument and the case being made are valid.  Between now and the time a decision will be made in that regard, the Minister should encourage the Health Service Executive, HSE, which has responsibility in this area to ensure it will make the necessary decisions in an appropriate timeframe.  I asked the Minister before about the Garda financial reporting systems and the HSE reporting systems.  They are trying to achieve a single system and although it is not in these Estimates, it is within the remit of the Department to approve the systems.</p></speech>

There is a common thread which is driving the general increase in the Vote and there are three specific matters related to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  There has been an increase in the number of staff in the Department and we are now paying for the full year effects of recruitment that took place in 2017.  There are also, of course, changes in wage levels owing to implementation of the public service stability agreement.  There are three specific projects which are driving the larger increase in the Vote.  There is a build-to-share project that is on the way; we are developing the infrastructure to deal with particular matters such as the use of cloud services, for example, which we will then make available to all other Departments.  We also have costs related to the roll-out of the public services card and additional costs associated with the use of the digital services gateway.</p> <p>  The Chairman's second question was related to section 39 organisations.  I hear his support for Deputy Joan Burton's comments.  I will work with the HSE to ensure that piece of work is completed in the timings we have indicated.  As I said, from the initial work we have done, we can already see the complexity of the matter.  Information technology costs for the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are matters for their individual Votes rather than mine.</p></speech>

For example, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to support the ongoing work of the SME leadership group, which I chair, that covers the issue of procurement.  It is representative of all business and sectoral interests, including the Department and other bodies, in dealing with changes that can be made to how procurement contracts can be publicised and people can gain awareness of them.  It also seeks to ensure the maximum number of companies and small businesses have the opportunity to pitch for Government contracts.  The success rate is quite high, with over 50% of the money spent by the State through the Office of Government Procurement spent in the SME sector.  Over 90% of the money is spent in the State.</p></speech>

I am not normally parochial at committee meetings but I have to take the opportunity.  Deputy Deasy referred to the urban regeneration and development fund.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il earlier this week that it will be 2019 before actual allocations will be made.  That is the &euro;2 billion fund.  There is a lot of optimism in Cork city that the docklands area, which, as the Minister is aware, has huge potential for regeneration, will benefit, and it is specifically included in the national development plan.  The Minister might outline that process and the type of works or projects for which the fund can provide finance.  In the case of Cork, it may well be bridges, for example, in order to open up access to the docklands.  If possible, the Minister might provide more information on that.</p></speech>

The criteria will be based on the experience I had in managing the local housing infrastructure activation fund.  My objective is that the fund will be open for applications across the summer and that the criteria will be based on the approach used in the context of the national planning framework.  For example, regarding urban projects, it will be about how it can promote living space and commercial use in city centre settings.</p> <p>  On the kind of projects for which it can be used, it could be used for bridges but also, more generally, to co-fund infrastructure or land acquisition that is needed to enable particular projects to happen.  I am aware of a number of larger projects across the country that require local authority financial support.  Our local authorities are not currently in a position to directly provide that support.  There have been many calls for a budget line to try to make that happen, and that is what I am now doing.</p></speech>

The fund is &euro;2 billion through the lifetime of the plan up to 2027.  When will moneys start to be made available?  Will the Minister have money in the budget line for 2019 and 2020, and will it be one fifth or one tenth of the &euro;2 billion?  How will this be rolled out in practice?</p></speech>

Therefore, my objective is that funding will be available next year.  Exactly when that funding will become available next year will depend on the quality of the projects.  We will outline what the availability of funding will be per year but, across the next three years, it is my objective that there would be enough funding available for all four funds for them to make a credible and verifiable start in their work next year.</p></speech>

I do not have to hand what it is per fund because some of those decisions will have to be made by Cabinet and will form part of budget 2019.  However, it is my intention that they will start in a credible way for next year.  If I have indicated in last week's national capital plan what it is per budget, per fund line, I will come back to the Deputy on the matter but my recollection is that I gave a figure for all of the funds in their entirety.</p></speech>

My thinking to date is that it will be primarily led by the local authorities because in my experience they are best placed to know the projects that will meet the criteria we have laid down in the national planning framework.  I have not fully decided that yet.  The local authorities will be able to access it, but I want to consider that further.  For example, if there are projects that do not require local authority funding and the local authority is not involved in, say, a project that may already have planning permission and that might meet the criteria of the national planning framework, could there be a role for other bodies, for example, educational bodies, universities and so on?  I have not made a decision on that yet, but local authorities definitely will be able to access it.</p></speech>

The second issue is the Cork event centre, which is included in the national development plan.  Is that matter on the Minister's desk?  There is a request for additional funding.  There is a good deal of frustration locally and a real lack of clarity as to the status of this project, which is being brought forward by Live Nation and BAM.  Significant public funding has been committed but additional funding is required to make this happen.  The Minister will be aware of an infamous sod-turning on the eve of the general election two years ago and nothing happened subsequently.  People want to know if the event centre in Cork will happen, if the Government is committed to it and whether the Minister is about to make a decision to sanction the extra funding to make that project happen.</p></speech>

I do not expect the Minister to be aware of it but I want him to become aware of it.  It is included in the national development plan and it is a matter of public expenditure.  On page 49 of the national development plan, it is stated, "The following regional and local roads will be progressed over the course of the National Development Plan ... Carrigaline Western Distributor Road".  When I was on the county council over a decade ago, we passed the Part 8 planning for that particular project.  In 2010, the project was about to collapse completely.  I intervened directly with the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, to ensure that funding would be provided to complete the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process.  Mr. Dempsey gave a commitment to provide the funding.  The Department provided 50% of the funding.  The council came up with the rest.  The land has now been secured.  Later this year, the detailed design of that particular project will be completed.  Planning is in place.  The CPO has been completed.  Detailed design will be done later this year.  Carrigaline is a town of approximately 17,000 people.  It is choking with traffic.  There is a residential development under way across the road from where I live.  Three hundred houses with planning permission are being built.  Ultimately, there will be approximately 800 houses.  The T&aacute;naiste lives in the town.  He will be well aware of this issue.  I was glad to see the project included in the national development plan, but I got a parliamentary reply from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in which he states, "My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post 2021 period."  It is all very fine for this to be in the national development plan, but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is saying, "Come back to me in 2022 or beyond".  He is saying post-2021.  That is not good enough.  That project is shovel ready.  I do not expect a direct answer from the Minister.  The project is included in the national development plan.  I am asking him to examine it, discuss it with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and deliver it.</p></speech>

I would then be open to being drawn down the path down Deputy Alan Kelly tried to draw me down earlier in the hearing.

It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance.  It also builds relationships through Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network and ensures that both I and the Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments. </p> <p>  A dedicated Brexit unit within the EU and international division was established in July 2016 to manage Brexit work across the Department.  This includes co-ordination of the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the overall Government response to Brexit, including input to the EU-level negotiation process and domestic preparations to ensure that our country and economy is Brexit ready, and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies as appropriate.</p> <p>  Several proposals for the deepening of economic and monetary union, EMU, will be discussed at the European meetings in 2018.  These relate to delivery of banking union and capital markets union, convergence in a more integrated economic and fiscal union and promotion of structural reform. </p> <p>  The EU and international division also manages our relationship with the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the European Commission in the context for our former programme of financial support.  The division has responsibility for the management of membership of, and policy development relating to, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The European Commission is due to bring forward its proposals on the post-2020 multi-annual financial framework in May.  This will be a key challenge and priority for the Department.</p> <p>  During 2017 the funds, insurance, markets and pensions division made a positive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and European market infrastructure.  The revised prospectus regulation and the fifth anti-money laundering directive were concluded in 2017.</p> <p>  In the area of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, CFT, we had a favourable assessment in the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, mutual evaluation in 2016-2017.  The report, published in September 2017, acknowledges the strength of our CFT systems, but includes a series of recommendations.</p> <p>  The first report of the cost of insurance working group was published in January 2017.  Work commenced on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, culminating on the publication of the report in January 2018.</p> <p>  The international financial institutions division manages Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with a number of international financial institutions.  These include the IMF, the World Bank Group, the European Investment Bank, EIB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Our membership of these institutions provides Ireland with a voice at important fora on global economic and international development issues.  Most recently Ireland became a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The year 2017 also represented the largest ever annual financing by the European Investment Bank in Ireland.  More than &euro;1 billion of new financing was signed last year with new investments around the country. </p> <p>  The banking division is responsible for contributing to the development of a financial services system capable of supporting economic growth and job creation.  This involves policy areas such as the provision of credit, SME financing, consumer protection and addressing mortgage arrears.  That division focuses on supporting the needs of the SME sector.  Along with officials from that division, I have appeared before the committee to discuss matters such as the tracker mortgages.  Decisions I have made recently in that and other areas include doubling the level of compensation that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may award to a consumer who has been adversely affected by the action of a financial services provider.  I am now taking steps to appoint two new members to the Central Bank commission with a particular focus on consumer protection.  That process is under way.</p> <p>  The shareholding and financial advisory division is responsible for the management of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banking sector.  It responsible for the management of our shareholding in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and represents my interests regarding the oversight of the agency.  A key highlight here was the successful IPO of AIB.  That unit also works on many issues relating to credit unions </p> <p>  The tax division manages taxation and budgetary policy.  It is responsible for analysing, drafting and preparing legislation, including the Finance Bill and the completion of the annual budget process.  As I noted in my budget speech, a key part of its work programme in the coming year will be initiating a process to consider options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI.  I aim to have this work complete by the end of June.  I recently announced a review of the local property tax, on which the committee has been briefed.  The Finance Act 2017 provides for an exploration of other issues, such as the potential application of a tax on vacant residential property.  I consider that the objective to be met by such a tax would be to increase the supply of homes.</p> <p>  The economic division is responsible for developing a strategy for the Irish economy across all sectors and the economic analysis of departmental policies.</p> <p>  The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2018 totals &euro;407 million, which compares with a 2017 Vote group total of &euro;389 million.  This is an increase of &euro;17.9 million or 5%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;15.7 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I will touch on that in a moment.</p> <p>  The gross allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2018 is &euro;42 million, of which &euro;10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers, a further &euro;950,000 is provided to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, my Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;5.3 million to cover facilities and non-pay costs.  The remaining &euro;6.9 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department.</p> <p>  The allocation for Vote 8, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent of my Department and is a constitutional officer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible for controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations and reporting the results of the work to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p> <p>  The financial audit role covers 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  These bodies have financial transactions that total over &euro;200 billion.  The allocation for this Vote is &euro;7.927 million, which is an increase of 15%.</p> <p>  On Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has requested a budget allocation of &euro;357 million.  Three quarters of Revenue's budget relates to payroll.  Revenue plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  These receipts underpin Government&rsquo;s capacity to fund vital services and facilities.  In 2017, Revenue collected a record &euro;50.7 billion.  It continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations.  For example, 2.2 million payments were made through online Revenue services.  A key priority for Revenue is PAYE modernisation, on which work is well advanced.  The 2018 Estimates provide for an additional &euro;3 million in capital and current funding for IT developments required for the administration and smooth transition to PAYE modernisation.</p> <p>  Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever-present challenge.  In 2017, the Revenue yielded &euro;575 million though its audit and compliance interventions.  There were 24 criminal convictions, an increase of six on the previous year.  I have allocated an additional &euro;4 million in the 2018 Estimates for an additional 100 compliance staff.</p><p>Tackling tax evasion is always high on Revenue&rsquo;s agenda.  In 2017, 2,786 disclosures with a declared value of &euro;84 million.  Revenue has initiated a new inquiry to identify and pursue taxpayers engaged in offshore tax evasion and avoidance.</p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  It will support my Department in the review of the Coffey report.  In the context of Brexit, Revenue has been participating in the interdepartmental work co-ordinated by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p><p> On Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, has a budget of &euro;1.626 million in 2018, a 1% increase on the previous year.  The significant increase in the 2018 Estimate is to provide for the TAC with the resources needed to advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent Civil Service body.  Specifically, during 2018, as a result of the Revised Estimate, the commission hopes to recruit more staff, including tax-qualified case managers.   It will also move office during 2018 to premises which are fit for purpose, largely to allow for multiple hearings and meetings with appellants to take place in parallel.  Further expenditure by the TAC is in the area of ICT as it addresses the significant level of appeal cases.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1007" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  I only have a few minutes because I have to go to the D&aacute;il.  I would like to focus on the comments he made on the issue of mortgage arrears and the potential sale of 14,000 family homes and 4,000 rental accommodation units to a vulture fund by Permanent TSB.  When did the bank inform him of its decision in that regard?  Did the bank consult him on the decision?  Bank representatives have informed the committee that they have entered into confidentiality clauses with potential buyers.  Where stands the process?  Did they consult the Minister?  Does he accept that regulation is required to allow for administrative sanctions by the Central Bank if the buyer breaches the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or the Consumer Protection Code?  Does he further accept that regulation in itself is not the issue?  The issue is that the loans will be sold to entities that only have a short-term interest and more regulation will not provide additional protection to those borrowers than that which exists.  These vulture funds, which are ruthless, have no intention of renewing agreements that have been made or entering into accommodation such as split mortgages, arrears capitalisation or interest only payments and, therefore, it is likely that there will be mass evictions in some cases and repossessions in others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1008" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00300"><p>I have not yet been consulted formally by Permanent TSB representatives regarding their intentions, though as the process moves forward, they are required to formally consult with, and inform, me regarding the magnitude of what is under way and to ask for my views on certain matters.  The regulations we have in place have played an important role in dealing with mortgage arrears and in reducing the number of non-performing loans, NPLs, throughout the economy and within banks.  However, I have indicated that I will examine the 2015 Act with a fresh eye, conscious of the change that is coming up.</p> <p>  With regard to the role of vulture funds, as the Deputy will be aware, the process is only in its early stages.  I am limited at the moment in terms of what I can say because of the commercial sensitivity about some of this but I am aware of the human sensitivity in respect of how people will feel if they believe their homes will be affected by this.  The regulations we have in place have played a role in preventing even greater difficulty in the recent past but I will examine them again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1009" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00400"><p>I tabled an amendment in 2015 to regulate these funds and I introduced legislation last year in this regard.  I know what the 2015 Act does and does not do.  What additional protection will the regulation of these funds give to any of the 14,000 homeowners or the 4,000 renters whose loans will be sold to a vulture fund?  We all know that this is not the issue; the issue is selling long-term products to entities that have only a short-term interest.  That is  a serious issue and there is only one solution, which is not to sell these loans to vulture funds.  I do not deny the issue in respect of Permanent TSB's balance sheet, which has to be dealt with, but we cannot throw these families and renters to the wolves.  Regulation or not, the protections for them will not change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00500"><p>The regulations that are in place have played a role in dealing with the great human and economic trauma that we have gone through over the past number of years and that is why there has been progress in respect of mortgage arrears.  Anybody who loses a family home to repossession is one too many but we have avoided the worst projections that were made.  The number of repossessions that have occurred is low relative to expectations and to the experience in other countries.  I reiterate that I will engage in a fresh examination of the regulations.  The legal protections people enjoy in respect of their loan will not change depending on who owns the loan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1011" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00600"><p>The Minister knows the answer to my question but he may not want to say it.  What additional protections will be given to homeowners if their loans are sold to vulture funds by just regulating them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1012" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00700"><p>That will depend on the nature of the additional regulation that we may bring in.  If further legislation or regulatory change is needed, I will then have to justify to the Deputy what additional protection will be built in and delivered.  I am looking at that actively at the moment because I am conscious of the worry and apprehension people feel about this matter.  I want to do the right thing by all but an exceptional challenge that I face on the other side of the balance sheet is that 28% of the loans in third largest bank in the State, which has deposits of &euro;17 billion and more than 2,000 staff, are impaired.  It is vital in the upcoming period that a way be found to reduce the number of NPLs that bank and other banks have if we want a safe and secure banking system.  Many people now find themselves in a difficult position and I am trying to find a way for that work to happen without adding to the anxiety and worry they are experiencing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1013" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P00800"><p>There is only one solution to this.  Long-term products should never be sold to entities that only have a short-term interest.  We also have a responsibility to protect homeowners.</p></speech>

We all know the value of a strong, independent regulator with strong regulatory powers, given all that we have gone through, indicating clearly that the level of NPLs has to come down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1015" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P01000"><p>I wish to raise three issues.  The first relates to Brexit.  On the question of the relocation of financial services firms to Ireland arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU, has the Minister an estimate of the number of jobs that have been won so far, including jobs that have moved or that have been announced or pledged by firms?  Are more announcements in the pipeline?  Is he confident of more success in this regard?  Generally, many would have expected a greater dividend for the State and not just for Dublin.  The regions need to benefit as well from the spread of financial services following Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1016" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#P01100"><p>I will take that.  The story has gotten out that we have not secured our fair share of jobs but I am satisfied that we have.</p><p>There was much conversation.  The best example I have of this is with Lloyds Bank, which chose not to come to Ireland.  Lloyds Bank had 17 jobs.  The other insurance companies, XL Catlin, Shaw Insurance Agency, Legal and General, Beazley Insurance, Beazley Re, Royal London, Eversure Insurance and others have committed to coming to Ireland from the insurance side but they are never mentioned.  The only company that was mentioned was that Lloyds Bank did not come.  I am satisfied that we are doing well with financial services.  The conversation I had with the Central Bank of Ireland is that there are dozens, not ten or 20, but dozens of companies that are in a conversation with it.  Many of these companies have some form of products and licensing so they are not starting at zero.  They add to their licensing as required, depending on the services that they may bring here.</p><p> On the first part of the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that we are getting our fair share.  On the second part of the question, as the Deputy knows, the first thing I did when I became Minister of State with responsibility for financial services was to visit the regions.  I have travelled from Cork to Letterkenny and to just about everywhere in between.  The largest announcements I have been to include ones at YapStone in Drogheda, Pramerica in Letterkenny, Northern Trust in Limerick and MetLife in Galway.  The one of that scale in Dublin was Fidelity.  We are focusing on the regions.  Some 30% of the jobs in financial services are now outside of County Dublin and we are establishing really strong hubs around the country.  I use Letterkenny as the best example, with interaction between two very large companies, Pramerica and Optimus, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  Many people would not have believed that the skill sets and abilities were available in a small to medium-sized town.  Letterkenny's population is approximately 20,000.  The skill sets are there.  If there is a deficit, the institute of technology steps in.  It is very fluid and fleet of foot to try to ensure that there is not any failing with regard to skill sets or abilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1018" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#Q00200"><p>Is there an estimate of the number of jobs that have been confirmed?  I appreciate that it is not all about the number.  The quality of jobs is important and there are many different strands to the financial services sector.  Does the Minister of State have an estimate of what has been confirmed at this point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1019" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#Q00300"><p>I do not have the 2017 number.  Anything before 2017 would not have been the full year, with Brexit's effect, because there were many conversations that would be required that started and did not finish, and licensing would not be concluded.  As I said, we are pleased with where we are.  It is important for people, which I am glad the Deputy outlined.  It is no longer about the quantum of jobs but the standard and quality of the job.  We should move up the value chain.  An example of that is Kroll Bond Rating Agency, KBRA, which is the first rating agency to decide to base itself in Ireland.  We now have rating agencies coming here too.  We now have the largest exchange-traded funds, ETF, sector in Europe.  The Deputy knows that aviation is quite strong.  We intend to focus on other areas too.  The big area I outlined in the 2018 action plan was sustainable and green finance.  There is a deficit of expenditure in the area in Europe of approximately &euro;180 billion per annum.  That is the number we are short by to decarbonise Europe as we progress into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1020" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#Q00400"><p>I have two other issues.  One is the matter of a Single Market for financial services across Europe.  We recently had a vice president of the European Commission, Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, here and I raised this issue with him.  As the Minister of State knows, Irish borrowers continue to pay well over the European average in interest rates, including both mortgage holders and commercial borrowers.  While we have a Single Market for goods and services, we do not have a Single Market for financial services.  If we had a true Single Market, Irish customers could borrow from German banks, French banks and Italian banks and could avail of much lower interest rates.  The Commissioner indicated that the European Commission is working on the area.  It should be a priority, given that Irish borrowers are paying much more than the eurozone average.  Our Government should take a strong interest in this issue.  We would all welcome more competition in the Irish banking market but it seems unlikely that that will happen.  It is not seen as an attractive market and it is very small.  The best way to help consumers at a European level is to bring about a fully functioning Single Market for financial services.  Is that a priority for this Government and is it being actively raised, promoted and pushed at a European level?</p></speech>

Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis attended a European Financial Forum, EFF, a number of weeks ago.  I think he was in here the following day.  He outlined that it is something the Commission is progressing.  It is a slow burner.  Not everybody is in agreement - there is protectionism within the EU 27.  We would like it to progress.  We do not know where it will land.  We have to be careful on the basis that while there are some benefits, there might be other disadvantages.  We should ensure that we do what is best for the Irish jurisdiction, including domestic users.</p></speech>

There is a common standard of regulation across Europe in respect of the larger banks, at least.  There is really no reason, in a proper Single Market, Irish consumers should not be able to buy products from these banks.  It is an issue that we should be particularly strong on because of the high rates here.  We should be to the fore in pushing for that Single Market system to come into effect for financial services.  I take the Minister of State's point about potential downsides.  We have had Setanta Insurance and hopefully no more such incidents will occur because of the passporting in and the fact that firms only have to be regulated here for conduct of business purposes.  Where institutions are properly regulated at a European level by the SSM, there is no reason they should not be able to sell into Ireland.  Currently, they cannot.</p></speech>

I have a concern that one third of the financial services sector is unregulated.  Trillions of euro of products and services are traded worldwide, unregulated.  We - regulators and legislatures - are catching up with financial services.  Crypto-currencies are the best example of that.  It is a space that is not that simple to regulate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1024" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#Q00800"><p>They are currently trading here.  That is not the issue that I am referring to, but how banks regulated at a European level by the SSM cannot sell here or how a customer here cannot avail of their products.  It is wrong.  It is not a single market and it should be.  We can sell beef, butter and milk.  We can trade goods and services without barriers but we cannot buy financial services.  We are paying way over the odds to our own banks.  We should be leading the charge on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1025" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#Q00900"><p>I want to speak on the banking union.  It is an area which is ultimately the way in which the change Deputy Michael McGrath is referring to will be facilitated.  I expect that, at the June or July European Council and the meeting of finance Ministers across that period, we will make greater progress in putting in place the policy framework needed for the realisation of the banking union, which will ultimately lead to banks being more active outside current jurisdictions.  I will make two points in that context.  A long-term consequence of the banking crisis that we went through is the increased nationalisation of banks.  There has been a trend towards banks being refocused in their home market.  As the Deputy knows, even in an Irish setting, large banks were required in many cases to divest their presence in international markets, as was the case for Irish banks.</p><p>The prospects of that happening for Ireland in terms of new forms of established banks coming in are medium-term prospects.  I believe we will see change before then in the area of FinTech, where we will have organisations, which are not retail banks as we know them, playing a more active role in Ireland in providing financial products that are competitive versus our existing banks.</p><p> The second point is that the imminence of banking union and the associated regulatory consequences will be apparent soon.  The challenges we have with Permanent TSB and the level of non-performing loans are in that context.  The bedrock to that now is the existence of a European-wide regulator for banks of a certain scale </p></speech>

My objective is that as we deal with the challenging consequences, which we are in the middle of doing, the benefits will become more apparent than they are at the moment.  The first wave of offers will likely be from financial services and FinTech companies.</p></speech>

Currently, the Tax Appeals Commission is not fit for purpose.  The Minister provided details to me in a reply to a parliamentary question.  I have it before me on my telephone &ndash; I am on aeroplane mode, Chairman.  More than &euro;1.6 billion in outstanding tax is caught up in the appeals system.  Over 3,600 appeals remain to be resolved.  The issue is that the number is growing and the problem is getting worse.  In 2017, over 1,700 new appeals came in and 252 were resolved or concluded.  The net increase in 2017 alone of 1,500 appeals is staggering.  If that trend continues through this year, we will be looking at over 5,000 appeals stuck in the Tax Appeals Commission.</p> <p>  There are two permanent commissioners, one temporary commissioner and approximately 12 staff members.  There are over 1,000 appeals for each commissioner.  Without significant intervention this problem is not going to be resolved.  In fact, it will get far worse.  The Irish Tax Institute has raised significant concerns over this issue with the Minister and the Department.  The appeals system is an important part of our tax code and system, as the Minister is aware.  It is now open to abuse.  If a person wishes to kick an issue into the never-never, the best way to do it is to appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.</p> <p>  The Minister is giving a 1% increase in the budget in Vote 10 for 2018.  The Minister described this in his opening statement as a significant increase.  It is 1%.  That is not terribly significant, to say the least.  What, specifically, will be done to beef up the resources of the commission in order that it can get a handle on what is coming in and start to make inroads into the level of cases?</p> <p>  I appreciate that it is a relatively new system.  There may well be teething issues and so on.  However, given the increase last year of over 1,500 cases, there is clearly a serious problem and it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The first relates to the level of resources I will make available.  Let us consider the trend and where we are at the moment.  In 2015, the allocation for the commission was &euro;0.511 million.  In 2016, the figure went to &euro;0.844 million.  The provisional out-turn for last year is &euro;1.07 million and for 2018 it will go to &euro;1.6 million.  Over the past three years, we will have tripled the resources going into it.</p> <p>  We have more than doubled the staff in the commission.  We now have 15 people working in the commission.  I have a round of appointments and recruitment under way.  We are looking to recruit more case managers to go into the organisation.  I aim to conclude the recruitment process soon and put additional people into the organisation this year.</p> <p>  Finally, in response to some of the disquiet Deputy Michael McGrath has touched on, we had a public consultation.  It was instigated in respect of the operation of the Tax Appeals Commission to hear the issues that the public and stakeholders have in that regard.  My Department has received and considered it.  We have now put in place a liaison group with the Tax Appeals Commission.  The group had its most recent meeting on 18 January this year.  We are engaging significantly with this issue.  We are making more resources available to the commission and we will continue with a recruitment process to ensure that we have the right numbers of people and the right kind of people to facilitate closure of the backlog that Deputy McGrath referenced.  I am committed to doing all I can to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

It is not simply a case of clearing the backlog because the backlog is growing.  The Minster referred to the budget being trebled in recent years.  The commission received 251 new appeals in January this year, and the number of appeals closed was one.  In one month alone this year, there was a net increase of 250 appeals.  The problem is growing and getting worse.</p> <p>  A key part of our taxation code is to have a properly functioning appeals system.  I can hear from the Minister's comments that this is very much on his radar.  It is on the agenda and it is important that it is dealt with.  I am keen to reaffirm that view with the Minister and to ask him to redouble the efforts being made.  The problem is getting worse despite the efforts made by the Department.</p></speech>

The first is to ensure that issues relating to the taxation status of individuals and companies are dealt with fairly.  The second is to facilitate the functioning of the entire system.  During the year, I will make as many resources available to that organisation as I can to deal with this.  That is why we have another round of recruitment under way.  My objective is that we will put together a panel of further case managers.  The idea is to keep making them available to make progress on this issue.</p></speech>

This morning, media reports indicate that banking analysts are saying that to do anything with legislation or regulation relating to the sale of Permanent TSB loans would make it less attractive for the vultures.  That gives us a sense of the type of market we are now into.  In commentary this morning, Davy stockbrokers pointed to political opportunism and said that the loans totalling &euro;2 billion were typically owned by people who will not pay and who do not want to pay and so on &ndash; the non-payers.  The firm is saying that typically those involved are homeowners whose mortgages are in arrears and who refuse to engage.  That is what is going on in the media and in the bubble of the bankers.</p> <p>  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that Permanent TSB has 14,000 homes.  AIB is lining up with some type of sale as well.  We know from the exchanges with the other banks at this committee that they too are lining up and that there will be issues for homeowners.  Permanent TSB said in its response to our initial informal approach that the bank would not be in a position to discuss the composition of the loan portfolios, criteria, levels of arrears information etc.</p><p>Permanent TSB has confirmed that it and prospective bidders have signed non-disclosure agreements as part of the sales process.  The point is that all of this information is in the public domain anyway, regardless of whether it is misinformation or is correct.  We intend to issue a formal invitation to Permanent TSB to appear before the committee next Tuesday.  We will discuss with the bank the make-up of these loans, the cohort of people who are in difficulties, the length of time they have been in difficulties, what they have done resolve these difficulties and so on.  This will give a greater understanding to the public, the Government and the Opposition of exactly what is going on within Permanent TSB.  Will the Minister encourage the State-owned banks to take up the invitations we are going to issue in the next short while to appear before the committee to deal with the fears people genuinely have in respect of their homes?</p></speech>

I would not agree with such an assessment.  If others want to use that language to describe the debate that is under way, that is their business.  The comments that Members of the Oireachtas are making are rooted in genuine anxiety that their constituents, loan owners and homeowners have.  I am responding in that vein to the debate.</p> <p>  My short answer to the Chairman's second question is yes, I believe the banks should be in front of the committee to answer questions its members may have.  I understand a number of banks may be producing results soon and, for legal reasons, they might not be able to comment publicly on matters in the period just before they publish their results.  I believe the banks should accept the committee's invitation and should explain and provide answers to the various questions the committee has.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-22a.1036" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018022200002#S00300"><p>That is clear.  In respect of the other banks and what is generally happening with the sale of SME loans, some of which involve good businesses attached to bad loans and so on, it is reported that agricultural land is now being examined by the banks relative to the loans they have issued to the farming community.  In the context of reviewing the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, will the Minister consider insisting that the banks at least hold off on their sales until such time as the legislation is actually reviewed?  When he is reviewing that legislation, particularly in respect of homeowners, will the Minister consider expanding the mortgage-to-rent scheme?  Will he consider reconfiguring Abhaile in order that its remit is extended to mortgage resolution?  Will he consider the credit union movement and the funds it has in this respect?  Will he insist on the banks working through each and every loan they have so that we know that at the end of the process, should they have to go to a general sale, every single customer has had the opportunity to engage with the bank on the full suite of resolution mechanisms that are currently available?  When I asked one of the banks at this committee if it engaged with customers on the basis of debt for equity, for example, it said no, it did not suit it to do so.  They have not been engaged with customers.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that the regulation currently in place will extend to the vulture funds.  In practice, that does not happen.  In the tracker mortgage issue, we have seen the type of aggressive culture in which the banks are engaged.  I can only say that it is 100 times worse for those who are engaged with vulture funds.  I represent customers when they go to these funds.  One customer, as is typical of quite a lot of cases, has tried to engage since last year and the fund has not responded to any of his information requests.  It has not offered any engagement or resolution.  Any offers that have been made in other cases come back with the same answer, that it is not good enough and it wants more money.  If they are getting the benefit of property at a knock-down price, surely to God the citizen - the homeowner -also has to be considered.</p></speech>

The Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is completely independent of me, has issued a direction that the bank is following.  I do not have the power available to me to intervene in the compliance with that regulation or its timing.  We are talking about a bank that has non-performing loans.  Going back to a comment I made earlier, I am very conscious of the worry that is encompassed in that figure of non-performing loans.  However, we need a stable, secure and successful Permanent TSB in Ireland.  On the one hand, we have a direction that has been issued from an independent central bank that is regulating this bank and whose regulation the bank is required to meet.  There is a level of bad loans that is five times the eurozone average, despite the progress the bank has made.  I am trying to ensure that we have the right legal framework in place to make sure this issue is resolved in the fairest way possible.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked if I would consider re-scoping and redesigning the work Abhaile is doing.  That body flows from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The caution I would have in making any change to its work is that I would need to ensure that it did not cut across or cause difficulty for the work of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  </p> <p>  On the mortgage-to-rent scheme, for this year alone I have made an additional &euro;5 million available through the Estimates process, bringing it up to &euro;22 million.  To date, 308 families or citizens have stayed in their homes due to that scheme and a further 619 applications are currently being progressed.  I keep it under review with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to see if any changes are needed to make the scheme even more successful.  The last review of the scheme took place in February 2017, which was not too long ago.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the credit union movement.  It is open to any organisation to decide if it wants to acquire any of these loans, if it feels doing so would benefit its balance sheet and fit in with its business model.  I know the credit union movement has other things that it is looking to do, and to which it believes it can add value, with the savings of its members.  </p> <p>  Of all of the banks with which I have engaged - those in which the taxpayer has a stake and those that are a key part of our banking sector - I and my Department have always communicated to them that they need to work through all arrears and debt difficulties with the citizens who have loans, and that they should make use of all of the options that are available.</p><p>We have always given that message.</p><p> On the funds which are operating in the State and which have acquired loans in the past, the Deputy and other members of the committee have asked me whether I have met or engaged with them.  The potential accusation has been that I have engaged with them directly.  I have not met them.  I have engaged with the banks which are registered here.  However, as part of the work I will do which I said I wanted to do in the passage of the Finance Bill, I will look at the regulations in place with a fresh eye.</p></speech>

The amount of money involved was &euro;60,000.  She gave her experience and on radio poured out her life story.  Her case is similar to many I have heard and the bank continues to pursue her.  I say this in the light of what Mr. Dombrovskis said when he appeared before the committee.  He said a country-specific recommendation made by the Commission was that, as part of the solution, the banks should write off the debt in order to correct their books and move on.  No one appears to be interested in dealing with the reality of these cases.  I again ask the Minister in relation to the regulation whether he thinks his review of the 2015 Act and the pending crisis for homeowners will be concluded and in place before a ptsb sale.  Is that his intention or is it something he will do in due course?  We have a report which was completed and agreed to this morning on vulture funds and and their refusal to participate by coming here.  Even the regulated entities have refused to come to discuss the issue with us.  We are laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas and asking for a debate on it.  We are responding to public concern about the crisis.  Will the Minister have the regulation in place before the sale of the ptsb loan book?</p></speech>

What I can do is influence what I can directly control.  If I believe there are changes which are needed which require legislative or regulatory change, my objective is to implement them as soon as possible.  I will do it against the background of saying the current legal framework in place and the institutions which have been in place to manage this very difficult issue for many years within the country have played an important role.  I cannot comment on any individual and it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  Of course, we are all aware of citizens who have reached resolutions with their banks and agreements which have led to a significant decrease in mortgage arrears on non-performing loans.  I have many colleagues, including Deputies Peter Burke and Bernard J. Durkan, who have been raising the matter with me and will look at further change if it is needed and how and when I can do it.  Of course, I want to do it as soon as I can, but I do not want to lose sight of the fact that the framework we have had in place has enabled a resolution for many citizens of banking difficulties which, a number of years ago, had looked nearly insurmountable.  Of course, when a family who have not been successful in finding a resolution talk about it in public, as the Chairman says, we get an insight into the anguish caused.  I have dealt with this issue on countless occasions, both as Minister and within my constituency.  However, I acknowledge that what has been in place to date has played an important role in facilitating thousands of agreements.</p></speech>

The families affected - indeed all of us - have seen the result of the intervention of the banks on the night of the crisis.  Exceptional circumstances dictated an exceptional response.  That happened and the banks were saved.  As our report shows, there were 125 meetings between the Department and the vulture funds between 2013 and 2016.  It appears from that circumstance that the scales are tilted in favour of the institutions and the vulture funds in this case.  What people are asking for is a little tilt in their favour and an acknowledgement of the crisis and social catastrophe that will emerge if there is no political response.  It is very much a political response that is required.</p> <p>  My second question is about community banking.  The committee will go to see the community bank in Germany to see how it operates.  We have had them here at the committee and will facilitate a meeting among the stakeholders with an interest in community banking in Ireland.  Can the Minister tell the committee when he and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, will be finished with the report on community banking?</p></speech>

It will probably be a couple of months before we come back to the committee on it as we still have work to do.  I am aware of its interest in the matter.

The Department invests in various projects and initiatives.  Will the Minister look at departmental investment in iCare, the project run by Mr. David Hall to assist people in difficulty with the banks to continue with their mortgages through his independent organisation?  It is funded by the banks and of benefit to homeowners in difficulty.  It might be an investment the Government should consider.</p></speech>

In the context of reform and the funding of the office, has the Department, with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, considered merging both audit operations to achieve greater efficiency, value for money, transparency and accountability?

Furthermore, the Committee of Public Accounts is restricted as to its examinations of local government funding.

The HSE is subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I sat in many meetings with the Chairman where the HSE was required to answer questions about its use of money.</p></speech>

People believe the Comptroller and Auditor General has the ability to carry out a forensic examination of accounts and always does so but he does not.  He does not always have the ability to do it.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked if I would support the merger of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General with the local authority audit organisation and I said I would be reluctant to do that because the Comptroller and Auditor General has a constitutional status, while the local government audit service feels it can best continue with its work in an independent way.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has not said he wants additional power but that is not to say we do not have work under way to look at how the office can do its work better and how its work can be reformed.  We are currently implementing a strategy up to 2020 which is looking to increase the number of special reports it does each year from four to ten.  We are asking the office to undertake an annual good practice event every year and the office has said it wants to do that.  We are looking at how the implementation of examination report recommendations can be followed up in a more public way.  At the moment, I am required to respond to any report the office publishes with a commitment to what my Department will do in respect of the issues identified.</p></speech>

There is now a focus on budgets and if we were to concentrate on the hole in public finances and the waste of public money uncovered by the Comptroller and Auditor General year in, year out, it might prevent a considerable amount of waste and inefficiency.  This would give the Minister more to allocate to Departments and projects.</p></speech>

There can be better ways of spending money and that is what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does.  I have Vote teams which work with every Government Department, which cannot go ahead with particular projects without my Department's consent.  One of the reasons I can have challenging relationships with other Departments is that my consent is required in certain cases.  To date, the Comptroller and Auditor General has not approached me to ask for additional powers, nor have I received an approach from the Local Government Audit Service but if either of these things were to change I would, of course, engage with them.  I think the work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General is of exceptional value.</p></speech>

Is progress being made on legislation for that purpose or is it just a matter of including Irish Water in the list of entities examined and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

We committed to quarterly meetings with the previous Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the new Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy and we have had some exchanges on the issue.  I read headlines recently commending the fact that insurance premiums had come down but that is not really true across the sector.  I still get complaints from taxi drivers and the Irish Road Haulage Association and one publican I met this week, who has a taxi licence, told me his insurance had gone from &euro;5,000 to &euro;17,250.  I am querying this with the regulator but there is unease in the market, not just in cases of road insurance but with public liability and employers' liability insurance.  Is the Minister satisfied with the progress that has been made or will the industry have to come up with more reform and more cuts?</p></speech>

On average, motor insurance premia are down by 16% year on year.  There has been an increase of 57% from the low point, but that was when there was a price war and the outcome of price wars never tends to be good.  We are not going to see decreases of 57%.  The employer liability and public liability reports were done, they went to Cabinet and they have been published.  A lot of work has been done, some of it following the recommendations of the motor insurance report of 12 months earlier.  The Personal Injuries Commission has been established and Mr. Justice Kearns has produced its first report.  He is working on a second part, which will be very telling as it will cross-reference payments in the Irish system with those in our nearest neighbour, and maybe some other jurisdictions.  It will compare what people get from similar claims in the UK to what they get in Ireland.</p> <p>  One line sticks out from the employer liability and public liability reports, which asserts that one cannot have low premia and high awards.  We have high awards and that is what we are trying to deal with.  We are trying to improve the insurance sector as a whole for everybody.</p><p>I understand that in some areas, if there is only a single pub or shop, the insurance premiums can sometimes double or triple if a claim is made and that it can have such an impact that the shop or pub will close.  There are a number of aspects to this.  The general data protection regulation is to start in May.  A recommendation on employers' land public liability insurance will be that, if somebody has a claim, that he or she must present it within 28 days, the period for which somebody can hold information.  If there is a video camera recording an event or potential accident, somebody has to present the claim to the individual within the period, otherwise the data have to be deleted.  A number of good things are happening.  If the Deputy wants, I will be quite happy to come with my insurance team to present the information.</p></speech>
