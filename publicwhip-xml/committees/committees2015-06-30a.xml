    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015063000002#L00300"><p>I wish the joint committee a good afternoon and thank the members for the invitation to update them on the progress of the implementation of the landing obligation and to discuss the submission from the fleet sub-segmentation lobby group on abolishing the sub-segmentation of tonnage and kilowatts for the Irish fleet.  I will begin by addressing the issue of fleet segmentation.</p> <p>  The management of fishing fleets using vessel capacity in terms of vessel volume, which is measured in gross tonnes, and engine power, which is measured in kilowatts, was introduced in the early 1990s and is a cornerstone of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>It was introduced in the early 1990s.  Capacity limits, known as fleet ceilings, are set at EU level for all member states.  To ensure the fleet ceiling is not exceeded, member states must manage their fleets in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is balanced by previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the entry-exit regime.</p><p> The Irish fishing fleet has been divided into segments since the early 1990s.  The fleet is divided into five segments, in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The five segments are refrigerated seawater, RSW, pelagic vessels, polyvalent, beam trawler, specific and aquaculture.  The specific segment is divided into two sub-segments, namely, scallop and general sub-segment.  The polyvalent segment is divided into four sub-segments, namely, potting, scallop, vessel under 18 m in length overall and vessels greater than or equal to 18 m in length overall.  The transfer of capacity between segments and sub-segments is not permitted.  For vessels to qualify for mackerel and-or herring authorisation, all of the capacity used to license the vessel must have the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies.</p><p> It is important to note fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded independently of the Department and the licensing authority for sea fishing boats.  The current fleet policy has been put in place over many years.  The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub-segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  Potentially, such changes could have impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  There are many diverse views in the fishing industry and these often conflict.  It is important, therefore, that views such as those proposed are debated widely in the industry.  The objective is to achieve the maximum possible level of agreement and support in the industry for any proposed changes sought.</p><p> The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 transferred the function of sea fishing boat licensing to the licensing authority for sea fishing boats and provides the licensing authority is independent from the Minister in the exercise of its functions.  As Minister, I have responsibility for policy on sea fishing boat licensing and may use policy directives in this regard.  However, under the 2003 Act I am precluded from getting involved in individual cases or a group of cases with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned.  For this reason, it is preferable that proposals for changes to licensing policy are made through the recognised representative structure of producer organisations.  In this way, a business case for change to the licensing policy would be fully examined, including positive and negative consequences for operators with divergent fishing activities and covering large and small operations.  I encourage the group of vessel owners in this instance to engage with the producer organisations so any proposed changes can be brought forward with a full understanding of the views throughout the industry.</p><p> Given the potential impact of changes to licensing policy, any amendments I might consider bringing forward would be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.  We are happy to look at changes but we want to ensure we have a full reflection of the industry perspective, as opposed to one group of stakeholders coming forward with a specific proposal about which many others may have concerns or comments or may decide to support.  Any change we make in what is a very sensitive area, because whenever one segment gains another segment tends to lose, needs to go through a process, and preferably needs to come through the producer organisations which are the official representative bodies of fishermen and boats.  We can answer any questions members may have on this.</p><p> With regard to the landing obligation, or the discard ban as many people call it, the recent regional agreement brokered by Ireland on extending the landing obligation to a number of important whitefish stocks brings us another step closer to eliminating the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding.</p><p>Everyone is against that, first and foremost, fishermen.</p><p> The reform introduced a practical and phased discards policy.  The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks, such as herring and mackerel, came into effect from 1 January 2015.  The landing obligation will be extended to certain demersal stocks - whitefish and prawns - from 1 January 2016 and will be fully phased in by 1 January 2019.  The phasing in period will allow fishermen time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of unwanted catches.</p><p> A major element of the new CFP is the introduction of regionalisation.  This gives member states in a region, working together, greater power to make decisions on the management of their own fish stocks and moves away from the former one-size-fits-all approach, which was dictated by the Commission.  It also underscores the importance of meaningful input from stakeholders, requiring that member states consult with the relevant advisory councils, comprising stakeholders from industry and environmental NGOs.  Ireland is a member of the North Western Waters Group along with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Spain.  The preparation of the discards ban for whitefish species was carried out during the period of Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the group and I thank my colleagues on both sides of me for doing a good job in getting an agreement across the line.  The member states worked closely with the North Western Waters Advisory Council, which involves representatives of the fishing industry and other stakeholders.  The council representatives attended and inputted into the meetings  of the North Western Waters Group.  The entire process was demanding, given the high bar of having to come to a unanimous agreement among six member states.  An agreement was finally reached in May on a discard plan for whitefish stocks to take effect from 1 January 2016.  The ban on discarding will apply to the prawn fisheries in all waters, the whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea, which is a complex, mixed fishery, the haddock fishery in the Irish Sea and in the north west area, the hake fishery in all areas and the sole fishery in the Celtic Sea from 1 January 2016. </p><p> The vessels, which will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016, will be identified on the basis of a combination of gear type and historic landing data.  For example, a vessel that had landings in 2013 and 2014 of more than 25% cod, haddock, whiting and saithe combined in its landings in the Celtic Sea will be obliged to land all whiting in 2016.  The other species will be phased in over the following three years.   Another important element is the inclusion of what are known as deminimis exemptions.  What this means is that, in the example I just gave, a vessel obliged to land whiting in the Celtic Sea will still be allowed to discard a small percentage. These deminimis exemptions are only allowed where it is difficult in the short term to dramatically improve selectivity without having an unduly onerous economic effect on the boat concerned.</p><p> With regard to setting TACs and quotas for 2016 in December, which is the positive news apart from rebuilding stocks, I will seek a quota uplift for the stocks subject to the landing obligation.  This is needed to take account of the situation whereby, in 2016, discarding of these stocks will not be permitted.  In other words, we are moving away from a quota allocated on the basis of a landed quota.  If somebody had five tonnes of quota and caught seven tonnes of the species, he can only land five tonnes.  Historically, he would always have been required to discard the other two tonnes at sea. There was nothing illegal about this because that is the way the policy worked.  From now on, fishermen will be given a catch quota, not a landed quota.  They will be required to land everything they catch within the flexibility of the rules that apply in respect of deminimis and so on.  That should mean that taking existing records relating to discards within specific fisheries into account, there should be an uplift when moving from a landed quota to a catch quota.  The Irish industry has been kept fully informed throughout this process through the discards implementation group, chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley.</p><p>I established this group to allow the Irish fishing industry to be fully prepared for and engaged in the implementation of the discards ban, which is going to be challenging but which, I believe, is doable.  Agreement on the discards plan for 2016 provides the discards implementation group with a clear blueprint to help prepare the industry for the forthcoming changes.  I am providing funding support for the fishing industry through the new EU fisheries operational programme, which I am currently progressing, for effective delivery of the new measures.  I have made &euro;450,000 available to BIM and the Marine Institute in order that they might undertake a project exploring the potential impact of the landing obligation on commercial fishing activity during the summer months.  This project will follow up on the discards simulation trials conducted last autumn.</p><p> I firmly believe that the biggest challenge will be to develop and implement improvements in selectivity and to develop other means to enable fishermen to avoid juvenile fish or unwanted catches.  The national discards implementation group is prioritising this work, as indeed are the producer organisations.  Our fishermen, working with BIM and the Marine Institute, are best placed to find better ways of fishing.  I will strongly support this work through the new fisheries operational programme and I am confident that we are moving forward into an era in which healthy fish stocks, fished sustainably, will be the norm.  The latter will give assurances of economic stability and profitability to our fishing industry and dependent coastal communities.</p><p> In the event that anyone is in any doubt as to the extent of the discards problem, it is important that I place some facts on the record in order to highlight the challenge we are facing and to explain why we are making the changes I have outlined.  Among the annual catch of 6,556 tonnes of Celtic Sea haddock, we are currently discarding 2,227 tonnes.  This represents a discard rate of 49%.  Of the average annual catch of 6,633 tonnes of Celtic Sea whiting, we are currently discarding 1,669 tonnes, or 25%.  The discard rate for Celtic Sea plaice is 57%.  In the context of Irish Sea haddock, it is 37%, for Irish Sea whiting, it is 81%, and for Irish Sea plaice it is 66%.  The discard rate for nephrops is 29%.  What we want to do is ensure that the fish we catch and kill are fish that will actually be sold, that fishermen will obtain a commercial return and that stocks will not be damaged as a result of fish being caught and killed at sea and then discarded, or thrown back into the water, because the fishermen involved do not have quotas to land them on the shore.  This is the biggest challenge in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We are moving towards the use of maximum sustainable yield, MSY, which is a more scientific calculation for maximising fish catches commercially while simultaneously protecting fish stocks.  We have obtained agreement in terms of regional decision making, which is extremely important, but the big change for both the public and the fishing industry as regards the changes in approach, gear, selectivity, targeting, etc., will be that which relates to the obligation to land.  We will invest a great deal of money, time, resources, effort and support into assisting the industry in this regard.</p><p> What I have outlined means that in five, ten or 15 years we will still have a very strong and growing fishing industry, because we will have healthier stocks and quotas that will hopefully be growing as a result.  I am not pretending that introducing an obligation to land or banning discards will not be challenging.  It will be, but we can do it in a way that makes commercial sense for fishermen as well as making environmental sense in the context of the sustainability of fish stocks.  That is the big challenge to be faced and the big ambition behind the new Common Fisheries Policy.  In broad terms, what is being done has been broadly welcomed by NGOs and also within the industry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015063000002#P00400"><p>I thank the Minister for appearing before the joint committee and giving members the exposition on sub-segmentation from his perspective.  The first point everyone must accept is because a thing is as it is or because there is an historic arrangement in place does not mean that it represents best policy either now or into the future.  I understand the nub of the issue here really relates to the pelagic and polyvalent sectors.  The nub issue is that in the whitefish sector, there is tonnage and kilowatts available but that in the polyvalent sector, there is not.  As the Minister appreciates fully, the world does not stand still and members raised an issue with him last year in respect of timber boats that required replacement with steel boats.  At the time, members suggested this be done with safety tonnage but that has now been eliminated.  Consequently, in the case of someone who is obliged to replace a boat with a slightly bigger boat or to replace a timber boat with a steel boat - even if the latter is not significantly bigger and of course the same quota will be allocated to it - or where modifications must be carried out to a boat on the recommendation of the marine safety office that increase its capacity, it is practically impossible to purchase polyvalent tonnage and kilowatts.  Although whitefish tonnage and kilowatts are available, because of the sub-segmentation policy, a person who tries to purchase that particular tonnage and kilowatts, even if it is a very small fraction of the total tonnage and kilowatts on one's boat, in other words, one is only topping it up to comply with the requirements of the size of a boat and the engine power, effectively is locked out of the market.  I understand, for example, that in some cases in which fishermen have been obliged to replace boats, they have wound up in a situation whereby if they inform the Department they intend to buy even a small amount of whitefish, they are being told they cannot fish either all or part of their polyvalent pelagic entitlements.  In other words, they are put out of business.  Consequently, this becomes a catch-22 situation and as the Minister is aware, many fishermen have signed the documentation sent to him outlining their concerns on this matter.</p><p>I understand that to every change, there will be people for whom it will not suit but ultimately, as Minister, Deputy Coveney must decide objectively, irrespective of what any group is saying, what is the best and fairest thing for all.  I will give the example of a boat up in County Donegal.  It is an 11.89 m timber vessel and its owner wishes to replace it with an 11.9 m fibreglass vessel but is short three tonnes of the requisite polyvalent pelagic tonnage, as well as being short 25 kW of the requisite associated kilowatts.  He has been offered a licence but basically he is being told he can have the licence but he will be denied his polyvalent pelagic entitlements and the gill-netting entitlements, which effectively would put that fisherman out of business.  The Minister is aware of the situation regarding the sinking of the <i>I&uacute;da Naofa</i>off the coast of Scotland and, thankfully, there were no casualties in that event.</p><p>Efforts had been made for a long time to replace the <i>I&uacute;da Naofa</i>, a timber boat, with a steel frame boat of more or less the same external dimensions.  However, the conditions applied in terms of whitefish tonnage and kilowatts were such that the fishermen in question were put out of business.  I have cited only two examples. <br/><br/>I believe the Minister recognises that this issue presents a challenge.  In 2011, modification of a polyvalent pelagic vessel and the use of whitefish tonnage was permitted in one case on safety grounds.  If that was possible then, surely it would not be a major step to make this option available to all fishermen.  I hope the Minister will indicate a willingness to examine the proposal put to him as a matter of urgency and on its own merits.  Having listened to the case made for the proposal, I believe it has merit on the basis that polyvalent fishermen are being locked out of the market and precluded from improving their position.<br/><br/>I understand sub-segmentation is not taking place in most other European countries.  If the Minister believes the case put to him has merit, I ask him to immediately commence a public consultation in order that we can advance this issue and ensure the producer organisations and all other individuals and groups are able to make a submission.  Ultimately, the Minister's decision must be based on achieving objective good and fairness for the fishing industry, rather than any view expressed by powerful vested interests.  One of the worries we must have is that a small number of dominant players - the fishing sector has a number of extremely large owners - will exercise inordinate control over the industry.  The Minister is under an obligation to make his decision based on the common good.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and his officials for appearing before the joint committee.  Based on the information provided by the fleet sub-segmentation lobby group, I get a sense that the Minister has not set out his position on this matter in any great detail.  The group made a highly compelling case and I concur with all of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in this regard.  The pelagic polyvalent fishing sector appears to be on its knees.  It strikes me that the issue is more closely related to health and safety than the viability of this segment of the fishing industry.  I understand that many of the vessels in question are not covered by the producer organisations through which the Minister suggests they should make representations.  A large section of the fleet is not represented by these organisations.</p> <p>  On the specific recommendations, the fleet sub-segmentation lobby group has indicated that in the event that the Minister does not adopt the policy changes it proposes, the Irish fleet would continue to fall behind other fleets in the European Union, the market value of Irish catch would continue to decline owing to fleet inadequacies, Ireland would lose its competitive position on the export market and the whitefish sector would continue to decline and eventually become unviable.  It calls for the introduction of a decommissioning scheme to help the whitefish sector, which would cost the Government and the European Union.  I trust the Minister and his officials are party to the issues raised by the group.   Where does the Minister stand on the specific points the group has raised and the requests it has made?  While I understand the Minister's point that a change in policy would require consultation with all relevant stakeholders, will he indicate whether he agrees or disagrees with the specific recommendations made by the group?</p><p>It strikes me that the system employed here is very rigid and cumbersome and more complicated than similar systems in other EU states.  It may well have worked for Ireland up to now, but it is surely time to review the policy with a view to maintaining the livelihood of the fishermen in the polyvalent sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015063000002#R00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for engaging with us on this issue.  The current fleet sub-segmentation policy is a ministerial policy and, as such, I assume the Minister can decide to review it on the basis of evidence he has heard and based on the comprehensive business case that was submitted by the vessel owners who are seeking a policy shift.  He can initiate a policy review if he so decides; it does not require a senior official to ask him to do so.  Will the Minister clarify whether he will give active consideration to such a review?</p> <p>  I understand the sub-segmentation issue is unique to Ireland among EU fleets.  Moreover, the problem in this regard is specific to one particular sub-segment, namely, the polyvalent pelagic sector.  My understanding is there is plenty of available tonnage in the refrigerated seawater, RSW, pelagic sector and surplus tonnage in the whitefish sector.  However, because of the way the policy works, operators in the polyvalent pelagic sector are not able to access that tonnage, which is all being used up by existing operators.</p> <p>  A number of fishermen find themselves in situations which are rightly classed as emergency cases, some of which were outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Another such case of which I am aware involves a vessel owner who is required by the Marine Survey Office, in accordance with a seaworthiness survey, to have a bulbous bow fitted on his craft.  In order to do so, however, he must purchase additional tonnage, which he cannot do because the only tonnage available is whitefish tonnage.  There is a risk, therefore, that he may not be able to get a licence to go back to sea.  Reference was made to another vessel owner who was granted the required tonnage and offered a licence but would, as a consequence, have to be taken out of the sector in which he is fishing.  The case to which I referred is a very pressing one and there are people in a similar situation across the fishing industry.  Even if the Minister does decide to initiate a review, those cases should be dealt with in the meantime, on a one-off basis, to allow people to continue to sustain themselves within the industry.</p> <p>  I do not see why the sub-segmentation system should be so rigid.  The policy was introduced in 2003, but sub-segmentation has been going on, as the Minister indicated, since the early 1990s.  Surely no policy should be cast in stone but instead should be subject to periodic review to ensure it continues to meet the requirements that were placed on it at the time it was introduced?  I urge the Minister to address this particular issue.  As other speakers pointed out, there is precedent here by way of the vessel owner who purchased whitefish tonnage in 2011 and was licensed subsequently to continue in the polyvalent pelagic sector.  Dealing with cases like that, at the same time a review is ongoing and a new policy is being drafted, would go a long way to satisfying the concerns of those operators who find themselves in a very difficult situation because of the current provisions.</p></speech>

My question might be somewhat outside the scope of today's discussion.  It relates to a person who operates a craft for leisure and tourism purposes and does not have any quota.  This person would like to sell the fish caught by his vessel, which are mainly mackerel.  Is there any means by which a quota might be granted to people who are fishing for tourism or leisure and wish to dispose of their catch?</p></speech>

My question relates to the producer organisations.</p><p>The Minister indicated in his presentation that he wants to engage with the producer organisations.  He also said that he would consider any change in policy following public consultation with stakeholders.  I take it he is not ruling out accepting submissions from or engaging with small vessel owners that are not tied to the larger producer organisations.</p><p> There is a strong case to be made around the safety aspect of sub-segmentation as against segmentation.  A number of weeks ago we heard a presentation on this issue in Buswell's Hotel during which concern was expressed by those giving the presentation about the safety aspect of this.  It was on this basis that they put forward the argument regarding the need for extra capacity from another sector - in other words, the need for people who have been involved in fishing all their lives and want to get out of it being able to trade the capacity in their vessels.  I would be very supportive of that proposal, particularly in the context of safety.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred earlier to the incident in Scotland, which the people concerned were very lucky to survive.  I would welcome the Minister's response on those issues.</p></speech>

Let me be clear that it was on the basis of a High Court order, following a court case.  Legally, we were required to act and we did.  That was not a voluntary intervention by the Minister for an individual case.  There was a High Court judgment, a court order, which was clear and we simply implemented it.</p></speech>

The court order was that there was a requirement on the State to put the person back into the position he was in back in 2007.  The only way we could do that was the way in which we did it.  I would caution against using that as a precedent.  There were specific circumstances involved, in respect of which we can provide members with the details, if they so wish.  That was not, as is being suggested by some, the Minister interfering and doing a particular job in respect of a particular vessel.  I have a clear record of not dealing with licensing issues in respect of individual vessels because I am not allowed to do so, legally.  That was put in place by a previous Government for good reason and because of the pressures that Ministers were coming under previously to do individual deals in respect of individual vessels.  We need to be careful of that.  I am not saying I do not have an open mind to suggestions because I do, as it happens.  However, I cannot do individual deals in respect of individual vessels; otherwise, I will spend all of my time doing so.  Also, I would need to change the legislation before I could do it.</p> <p>  Essentially, what we are talking about here is 18 boats.  What we are being asked is that we would allow people to essentially use whitefish tonnage in kilowatts in order to have bigger boats that are targeting pelagic fish.  Essentially, we are using whitefish capacity to increase the capacity per catch in the pelagic sector, accepting, of course, that the quota does not change.  We need to be careful before we do that.  It is not true to say that somebody cannot replace a wooden boat with a steel boat.  They can if it is the same size.  However, they cannot build a bigger boat without getting extra capacity.</p><p>It has been suggested that the pelagic and polyvalent sectors are on their knees but they are not.  Some boats are finding the going tough but some are making a very good living now.  The people who are looking to expand and buy or build bigger boats are in this category, by and large.  It certainly does not suggest a category on its knees if people are looking to build bigger boats.  Let us have an honest conversation.  I want to try to help the industry to make more money and have as many viable fishing boats as we can in the Irish fleet.  I want to get them as much fish to catch as we can.  I also have to balance the fact that we essentially have a whitefish and pelagic fishery, which are quite different, and the way we manage them is quite different.</p><p> We had a mackerel review in 2010 that was quite significant.  We had a herring review in 2011 and 2012.  It is not as if we have not had recent reviews in terms of the split and segmentation within different categories.  There was a change in terms of the percentage of mackerel that the refrigerated sea water fleet was catching versus the polyvalent sector.  In the future, we will probably have to review that again.  I would like to see proposals from the fishing industry as a whole so we can get a sense of what the fishing industry is looking for and I can make proposals on the back of that.  I understand what they are saying but there are consequences for many other people in making those changes.  If bigger boats in the polyvalent sector catching mackerel and herring are facilitated, we would be increasing the capacity for catch without increasing the quota available.  We must ask questions as to the likely outcome of somebody having the capacity to catch much more fish but not the quota to do it.</p></speech>

The record of this Government with respect to safety, particularly the money and resources put into it and the changes made, has been fairly strong.  I am glad to say we have had some positive results.  Although there have been some tragedies in the past two years, there has been a big improvement on previous years.  I take safety very seriously.  I have personal and professional experience of the consequences of not giving safety at sea full attention.  I will happily debate with anybody who wishes to question my bona fides around safety.  This issue should not be sold as simply a safety matter, as it is more than that.  If people are to build a bigger boat with the capacity to catch much more fish but people are not allowed to catch more fish, concerns will be raised about the temptation to catch more fish without having the quota to do so.  Essentially, capacity would be taken from the whitefish sector and given to the pelagics without the corresponding change in quota.  Maybe that is the right way to go but I would certainly like to have the views of others in the industry outside of those 18 boats before going ahead to make a proposal.  That is not an unreasonable approach.</p> <p>  If this is a slam dunk and the obvious action to take, why are no producer organisations asking for it?  Some of the members know them very well because of where they come from.  No major producer organisation is asking for this at the moment because they cannot get agreement on it.  The Killybegs Fisheries Organisation would certainly get no agreement and the Irish South and West Producers Organisation does not have agreement on it.  My understanding is the organisation in the south and east does not have agreement either.  Let us not paint this as something obvious to be done.  Instead, we can consider it, and I am happy to do so.</p><p>If, after there has been a discussion with all stakeholders in the industry, a majority of people say this is the right thing to do, then we will do it.  I do not accept the suggestion we are hearing here today that we should get on with this because it is an obvious thing to do for safety reasons.  I do not think it is as simple as that.  Most people who understand the fishing industry will accept that too.  I have read the letter.  I have it in front of me here.  The key paragraph proposes that permission be granted to use whitefish tonnage, of which there is currently surplus available, on polyvalent pelagic vessels.  Pelagic fishermen would then be enabled to purchase whitefish tonnage and kilowatts in order to effect the necessary modernisation of their pelagic catch.  All I am saying is that while this makes sense on the face of it for some boats, I cannot in all conscience ignore the knock-on consequences it would have for the industry in terms of the sustainability of catch, the availability of quota and all the rest of it.</p><p> As I have said, if even one producer organisation came out in support of this proposal along with the group that is here, we could start to build a consensus about what we should be doing.  It is wrong to paint this as the mainstream view of fishermen on the basis that some people are asking for it.  Some people want it for very good commercial and other reasons.  They might want to upgrade their boats or increase their capacity, safety and comfort, etc.  They are perfectly entitled to aspire to all of those things.  I need to make sure we make a decision that in the round is right for fish stocks and for the fishing industry as a whole.  That is all I am saying.  I am not ruling it out but I am not saying that, as Minister, I should pursue the proposal we have here as policy at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015063000002#U00200"><p>I would like to raise three issues.  On the court case, I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline for us in writing the circumstances of the decision made by the Department in this instance.  What did the court say?  I understand that if the court told the Minister to do something, he had to do it.  If the regulations as they were written at the time did not allow him to do so, he would have had to amend the regulations to make it happen.  In other words, if the court tells the Minister to do something, that does not give him dispensation from law in doing it.  He is obliged to change the law so that he can do what he is required to do legally.  I ask the Minister to give us a comprehensive explanation of how this was done.  If it was possible to do it without a change in the regulation in one case, it should be possible to do it in similar cases.  I am curious about it.  I am not asking for a detailed explanation today, but I would appreciate it if such an explanation could be forwarded to us and this particular issue could be addressed in it.</p> <p>  The second issue I would like to raise relates to wooden boats, which were mentioned by the Minister.  Does he agree it is time to take larger wooden boats out of the system for safety reasons?  Does he accept that if a wooden boat is replaced by a steel boat with the same external dimensions, extra tonnage and kilowatts will be needed?  As steel is much thinner than timber, its internal dimensions will be larger.  My understanding is that the measurement goes by the inside.  Basically, I understand that if a steel boat and a wooden boat are the same size, the steel boat requires more tonnage.</p> <p>  The third issue I wish to mention is that in many of these cases, the extra tonnage that is being added is not significant.  It is actually quite minuscule.  The least the Minister can do is deal with the three issues we have mentioned, namely, the replacement of tonnage, the purchase of boats that are more or less the same size but might be slightly larger and the question of the changes demanded by the Marine Survey Office to comply with safety requirements - in the old days, this would have been seen as safety tonnage - making the technical size of the boat bigger.  We need to be clear about the case that is being made.</p><p> I also do not follow the argument about the Minister creating the capacity.  The total capacity of the fishing fleet will stay the same, because the amount of tonnage and kilowatts in the fishing fleet in its totality will stay the same.</p></speech>

They are two totally different segments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015063000002#V00300"><p>That means there is less capacity in whitefish and more capacity in pelagic but presumably there are quotas for both pelagic and whitefish and that the quotas are there because the capacity of the fishing fleet, and most boats' capacity to catch fish, far exceeds the quota they have.  The reason for quotas is that the capacity to fish far exceeds the allowed quota, so I do not consider that to be a valid argument.</p> <p>  To move this forward, a proposal has been made.  When one looks at the MSO requirements, replacing timber boats with steel boats and so forth, there is a very valid case.  It is only a small segment but that is because most people moved to steel boats in the past.  Is the Minister willing to move this process forward by some means, and not wait for some PO to come forward with a proposal?  I do not believe he will get agreement among the producer organisations, POs.  I believe they are wishing for the Minister to take the initiative here, to be brave and say he will start the process.  Would the Minister consider writing to each PO to say that he has received this document, that he is anxious to find out from them what their response would be to the document submitted and whether they would, with or without conditions, support or object to the proposal involved, which basically is bringing tonnage and kilowatts from the whitefish fleet into the polyvalent segment?</p> <p>  As I said, this might be very limited; it might be 10% or 20% of a polyvalent boat.  It is not about bringing it in wholesale as it could be limited.  I believe there is an onus on the Minister to start a process that brings this issue forward and forces the POs to say "Yes", "No" or "Yes, with amendments", to this, so at least they do not have a knock-out blow on this process before it starts.</p></speech>

It might be helpful.  To be clear, in the light of the High Court opinion, the exceptional circumstances of the case and on receipt of legal advice, the Minister was agreeable to put the individual concerned back into his 2007 position in order to give his boat the mackerel and herring track record that would currently be associated with the vessel had it been licensed in 2007.  We did that on legal advice, which was sound.  I am sure I have answered a parliamentary question on this issue as well.</p> <p>  One of the reasons I was really slow to act, even in this case and even on a court order, was because of what we are experiencing here today, which is people using it as precedent.  I was warned in the Department, and correctly, that anything we do for an individual boat will be used as precedent, because this is an industry that talks.  Of course it does.  We only acted in this case because of a High Court opinion that required a person and his vessel to be put in a position as if they had got their licence back in 2007.  They did not, but the court determined that they should have.  That was the position.</p> <p>  I must also say that I am legally precluded from talking about individual cases and court cases.  I am not even mentioning people's names here.  We can get distracted by this particular case, but this only happened because of a High Court opinion.  This is not precedent.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there are 31 or 33 vessels in the polyvalent pelagic sector, which means a majority of vessels in the sector affected is requesting this.  That surely should carry some weight within the decision-making process.  I understand the Department's concerns that if a vessel is allowed to increase its stability at sea and its ability to go to sea in certain weather conditions, the next step would be that it would look for additional quota.  On that basis, one would never do anything and the Department would never allow anything to happen.  Fishermen will look for additional quota.  I do not see it as a valid reason not to do something.  If somebody puts a bulbous bow on their vessel, for example, that will not all of a sudden create the capacity to catch an extra 200 tonnes of mackerel a year.</p> <p>  I know of situations where boats were unable to go to sea because of weather conditions and were not able to catch their mackerel quota until very late in the season.  In order to make their quota, they had to steam for 17 or 18 hours from their home port.  Surely that is not a good situation for those boats.  It could lead to them going to sea in weather for which the vessels are not fit.  We have seen tragic cases like that in the past, unfortunately, when fishermen have gone to sea in bad weather because of the need to catch quota.  We should be able to find a mechanism that allows fishermen to improve the standard and accommodation of their vessels without increasing their quota demand.</p></speech>

What is essential here is that whatever submissions are made or whatever talks go on, they must be all-inclusive.  The Minister should enter negotiations with an open mind and should try to find an outcome that will have the safety aspects at its centre.</p> <p>  There are quite a number of vessels at sea that, in modern terms, are not seaworthy.  I see people going out every week.  If they lack in the tonnage or kilowatts necessary, it can be the difference between life and death.  It is not about extra quota; I have been assured of that in our deliberations.  It is about safety and having the ability to go to sea knowing that the vessel is safe and the lives of the crew are not being jeopardised.  </p></speech>

This is a proposal from 18 boat owners.  Let me pose one or two questions that have not been asked, which I am surprised about.  If we make more capacity available for the pelagic fleet, are we going to confine that capacity to people who are currently in the pelagic polyvalent fleet?  If we essentially say that capacity in the whitefish fleet will now be used to allow those in the polyvalent pelagic fleet to build big bigger boats and increase their capacity, what about someone from the whitefish fleet who wants to get into catching mackerel but cannot do so?  Do we exclude those people?</p></speech>

That is what the Chairman is saying.  People want to build bigger boats because they are saying they are safer, and they probably are safer, but on that basis we would be allowing the whitefish capacity to be bought up and used to build bigger boats for the pelagic segment.  We do not have more quota in the pelagic segment, so we would be doing it purely for safety reasons.

Probably, they are conflicted internally.  For the Minister to say he will move forward if a PO is brought in to make the case, the upshot is that he will wind up with a new PO being founded to get around an unnecessary condition.  I suggest a way to move this process forward, which it should be.  The Minister now has the submission from the group and the debate here today.  He should either have a consultation with the POs and ask for their response to the submission or come back to the joint committee to outline to us the issues he considers might arise if he were to go along with the proposal made.  The imposition of a condition that the Minister will not look at this unless a PO asks him to is unnecessary and might be counterproductive.  It is creating an unnecessarily high bar to moving forward with what is in issue.</p> <p>  Let us take the simplest case of all: that of the boat ordered by the Marine Survey Office to make a modification that increases the tonnage.  It cannot be bought in the polyvalent sector.  What is the boat owner meant to do?</p></speech>

There is more than one view here.  The Deputy is only representing one view, which I find extraordinary.  On the actual views within POs across the country which have concerns in relation to this and which will have some members that support it, no one seems to be willing to discuss others that may have concerns.  It is as if I am being told "This is obvious thing to do, why do you not just get on with it?".  Clearly, that is not the case.  If it were, we would have at least one of the three POs supporting it.  While I am saying we will look at this, there is also an onus on the group of boats looking to have it considered to create a bit more consensus within the industry that this is something worth looking at.  That is all I am saying.  It is not a pre-condition or anything like it.  It is just to say that if they have a proposal that makes sense, let us get a bit more consensus on it.  Otherwise, I am forcing the issue on all of the POs that are there to represent their members in consultation with me.  I would be forcing the issue whereas this is a proposal that is coming from the industry.  There is at least some onus on the industry not simply to lobby and put pressure on me but to get some consensus on the issues that should be considered in the sector that really matters here; the fishing sector.  By all means, we will then look at that and get people's feedback.  It is not too big an ask.</p> <p>  I apologise to Senator Comiskey for failing to respond to him earlier.  If somebody has a leisure craft and is looking to get into commercial fishing, he or she will have to get some quota.  He or she will need to take that step from being a leisure craft to a commercial fishing craft.</p><p>Obviously to do that involves buying into the system.  We can give the Senator the details on how somebody can make that transition.</p></speech>

One cannot have a situation where somebody comes to me and asks for more capacity because the Marine Survey Office, MSO, says he or she needs to make changes.  On that basis other people would be giving up capacity to facilitate changes for safety reasons.  That is an issue between a boat owner and the MSO.</p> <p>  I do not want to come across as totally inflexible because that does not reflect my views on the issue.  I am not closed but having spoken to many in the industry since the campaign for this change started, I have had mixed feedback as some people are very much opposed to it but others think we should look at it.  I do not think it is too much to ask the boat owners concerned to work on getting more consensus among the existing producer organisations, POs and representative bodies in fishing.  If we can get a consensus we will look to progress it.</p></speech>

I note that the producer organisations, POs, are not in favour of the proposals that have been agreed at the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council.  Why were the reference years 2013-2014 decided on in regard to how the discarding would operate in the future?  I know the POs had a proposal that they would be given advance notice of the areas in which they could fish in and they felt that would be a more manageable and workable solution in regard to discards and meeting the landing requirement.</p><p>Around the time the Common Fisheries Policy was being discussed, and as discussed by the committee, there was a great deal of talk around technical measures to ensure that juvenile fish could escape.  With the emphasis on technical measures, it seemed to me that time and space would be given to allow the technical measures to develop along parallel lines before the roll out of the landing requirement would be put in place.  That does not seem to have happened<b>.</b></p><p><b></b>The Minister referred to the 7% or 8% <i>de minimis </i>rules, depending on the area and the species one is catching.  As he outlined, according to his figures, some  81% of whiting that is caught in the Irish Sea is discarded and the landing obligation will be implemented from next year onwards.  Even with the <i>de minimis </i>rules, that will lead to significant additional landings of whiting.  I note that the POs have not faced the fact that additional quota will be required.  It was said that it would be a minimum requirement under the negotiations of the Common Fisheries Policy that boats would get additional quota to compensate for the fact that they had to land everything they caught.</p></speech>

There will be practical complexities.  I refer to the Celtic Sea, which is often used as an example because it is a good one, where fishermen are catching cod, haddock and whiting.  Whiting is separate as it is a slightly different shape from cod and haddock.  It will be complicated over the next three or four years to introduce an obligation to land for each of those species.  We are starting with whiting, which is the easiest one to start with.  There is a slightly cleaner whiting fishery in part of the Celtic Sea than for cod and haddock.  The feedback from the industry and stakeholders was that whiting is the easiest of the three species to start with.  That is what we are trying to do.  Given what we have learned from the scientific observation this year, we will work through next year to try to do as good a job as we can on the obligation to land for whiting.  We will learn lessons from that and then we will introduce another species.  We will do it step by step.  We will help fishermen with the cost of changing gear to become more selective.  Obviously, that will impact on mesh size, the shape of nets, escape hatches and so on.</p><p>It will be quite challenging to deal with the prawn fishery, but there are known mechanisms to create a cleaner fishery, such as the Swedish grid and a number of separation systems of cod and prawns that have been used in the Irish Sea quite successfully.  There are approaches that can make the problem easier to deal with.  In the Celtic Sea, we increased the mesh size and we introduced technical conservation measures, which actually reduced the discard of juvenile fish by 40% in the past two years.  This can be done.  As a result, the stock should be healthier the following year.  The whole point of this is to build up stocks.</p><p>Deputy Pringle said the <i>de minimis </i>rule is 7% to 8%, but to be clear, the rule is 7% at a maximum.</p></speech>

It was really important for the fishing industry that there was a <i>de minimis </i>figure because there needs to be a release valve.  When one uses all the management tools that are available in terms of cross-species quota management, inter annual quota management and all the options of technical conservation measures are exhausted, it is important that there is a<i>de minimis </i>rule that can allow fishermen operate in a practical sense and allow them to make a living.</p><p>Some 18 months ago a group, which Dr. Noel Cawley chairs, was set up to consider the national discards implementation.  Dr. Cawley is an experienced and wily operator in terms of finding solutions for awkward problems.  He is doing a good job.  It is really only now that it is getting serious and that fishermen realise that next year, they will have to change their approach to the species of cod, haddock and whiting.  With buy-in, good resources and supports coming through the seafood development programme, it is doable.  It will require change.  There should also be a good upside in terms of quota uplift.</p><p>It is my job to ensure we deliver it in December.  I do not want to be lining myself up for a fall.  We have had initial conversations on it and I think the Commission is very cautious towards a quota uplift but I think fishermen need to see this working for them.  If they land everything they catch, when previously they would have been dumping that fish back into the sea, that needs to be reflected within reason in the quotas they get.  That needs to be negotiated with the Commission.</p></speech>

We must not forget that fishermen go out week after week and catch quota that gradually gets wound down.  They get allocated all the time.  It is not as if they catch all of their quota in the last week of the year.  They will know how they are going.  Most will be experienced in terms of the expectations around catch, given where they are fishing and so on.  This should be managed and planned so that people can catch their full quota and any excess is predictable.  We should be able to deal with much of the excess through the inter-species and inter-annual transfer arrangements.  After that point, there is flexibility in respect of <i>de minimis</i>.<br/><br/>I am not in the business of trying to catch people out.  We are trying to be proactive in introducing a new system that can work for everyone.  If someone is deliberately breaching or trying to take advantage of the rules, we have an obligation to enforce them.  The point of having regional decision making on how to implement the obligation to land for next year was to devise a practical and workable plan.  The industry was involved in that plan.  This is not a case of politicians and policy makers deciding how the fishing industry will do something.  There has been a great deal of stakeholder involvement in the regional decision-making process.</p></speech>

The producer organisations are cautious about this because they know it will be difficult to implement.  They will have to push their members, which I hope they do.  The alternative is much worse.  The idea that we would not try to implement this directive and that it would become an enforcement issue for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority - that is not a route we want to take.  This is agreed policy at European level and we all have an obligation to make it work for the fishing industry as best we can.  That is what I am committed to doing, and it is why we have such a large grant aid package from the Exchequer and the European Commission, linked to the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is up to us all to make it work.</p></speech>

In recent days, stories have emerged of a Danish pelagic trawler to which the SFPA issued penalty points, but the Danish authorities refused to apply those points to the trawler's licence.  How will enforcement, including of landing obligations, be handled in such situations?  Trawlers from Spain, Belgium and other countries operate in Irish waters.  Will there be enforcement for Irish and foreign vessels even if foreign governments pass it off?</p></speech>

We will do everything we can to ensure that this is the case.  Some of the SFPA's activity in detaining large pelagic vessels this year has shown a willingness in this regard.

This is my first time before a parliamentary committee in Ireland and it is a real pleasure.  I have been a member of select committees in the UK Parliament for the past ten years but am here in my capacity as the chair of the cross-party Save the Pub Group, which I established with other Members from all political parties back in 2009.  We did that because we were concerned about the rate of pub closures in the United Kingdom and the reasons behind that.  A document I have to hand for circulation to members is the mission statement we published as an all-party group in 2009, which would provide members with a sense of our work on some issues on which we have been campaigning.  I have taken a real interest in this issue and have become something of a champion for these issues.  Clearly, the joint committee's particular interest is the economic impact of measures governments can take which are pub-friendly and that can have a direct effect on jobs and I will restrict my comments to those areas in the five minutes allotted to me.</p> <p>  It is important to state, before so doing, that while there are huge similarities between pubs in the United Kingdom and the Irish pub and the role it plays in the community and nation of Ireland, there also are highly significant differences between the pub sector in the two countries and it is important to bear that in mind.  When it comes to the issue of jobs and economic impact in particular, we are looking at the taxation policies and this has been a real focus for us as group in recent years.  I am well aware of the double whammy here in Ireland with the 23% VAT rate on alcoholic drinks, which is offset slightly by the 9% VAT rate on the hospitality industry.  Incidentally, that is something for which we are campaigning in the United Kingdom but for which we are not meeting with any success thus far.  As members are aware, we have been successful with regard to beer excise duty.  Until recent changes in the United Kingdom, the two countries have had among the very highest beer excise duties.  Moreover, through organisations like the British Beer and Pub Association and the Campaign for Real Ale, CAMRA, members should please follow up with me regarding any information they seek and I will provide factual information to them from the various surveys.  However, it was clear from surveys that the price of a pint in the on-trade in pubs was causing a decline because it was making it less attractive to go to the pubs.  Moreover, while the beer excise rises through the beer duty escalator, which we have had in place for a number of years, was also affecting the off-trade and supermarkets, the latter in particular were able to absorb them and often did not increase their prices at all.  Consequently, after a long-fought campaign, we managed to have the beer duty escalator abolished and since then, we have had two further cuts in beer duty.  We actually have achieved a cut in beer duty.  I will provide the joint committee with some research, as ultimately one must be able to back up one's facts, and research was carried out before the third and most recent cut in beer duty by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which I will happily share with members.  It is estimated that 26,000 jobs were created from the abolition of the beer duty escalator alone, which is highly significant.  A lot of those jobs are in brewing, as opposed to pubs because clearly, the tax is levied at the producer level but many medium-sized breweries, in particular, were unable to invest in their plants and staff.</p><p>The abolition of the duty escalator has also led to higher investment.  It is estimated that in 2014 investment was &pound;61 million higher than it would have been if the duty escalator had been maintained and the price of a pint was 16 pence lower before the third cut in beer duty than it would have been under a beer duty escalator.  This has led to 750 million more pints being sold in the on-trade and clearly this increase has had a significant effect.  These estimates were calculated before the third beer duty and further research will be done on the effects of the duty cuts which have provided further significant and good news. </p><p> The other issue directly related to pubs is the business rate relief which has been extended to pubs, although the Save the Pub Group would like it to be directly focused on pubs.  </p><p> There is clear, cold, hard evidence that the reduction in beer duty to a much more competitive level in the United Kingdom compared to European competitors has had a direct effect, not only on helping to restore confidence in the pub sector but also in terms of further investment and direct jobs.  </p></speech>

I note Senators Henry and Hayden are present in the Gallery.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the existence of a cross-party Save the Pub Group in Britain.  I assume this is an informal group.  Will Mr. Mulholland outline how it operates?</p> <p>  While we all agree with Mr. Mulholland on duty and excise, the position of the off-trade versus the on-trade is another important issue and one which Mr. Mulholland did not discuss in detail.  The position in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom in respect of the freedom available to the off-trade, particularly the multiple supermarkets, to use alcohol as a price leader, thereby undermining the supply chain that is the local pub and the responsibility that applies to premises selling alcohol. </p> <p>  The asset of community value, ACV, concept is an interesting one.  How long has this been in place and how many pubs have gone through that system?  What impact have changes to beer duty in the United Kingdom had on business levels in pubs?</p> <p>  Pubs in Britain are frequently tied to one supplier, which is not the case here.  Mr. Mulholland made a number of proposals in this regard. </p></speech>

Members should not worry as I do not propose to do so.  The Deputy asked about the Save the Pub Group.  I am visiting Ireland to share the group's experience and potentially make contacts.  I visited the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly to discuss the possibility of similar groups being formed and it is wonderful that the next place I am visiting is the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>  I am aware that Ireland does not have a system of all-party parliamentary groups.  We are a formal all-party parliamentary group which is constituted through the rules pertaining to all-party parliamentary groups, which have a certain number of Members of Parliament from the various parties.  We have officers selected along those lines.  Ultimately, we set ourselves up as a campaigning group with a specific set of aims.  I have our 2010 remit, which leads me nicely on.  I will read briefly from the purpose and mission statement of the group.  It states that the purpose of the Save the Pub Group is to "bring together Members of the House of Commons and House of Lords who want to add their voice to the efforts to preserve and protect the British pub".  The group shares a belief that "British pubs are important to the country's history and heritage and are hugely important to the communities they serve".</p> <p>  To pick up on another point the Deputy made, the Save the Pub Group also believes that the traditional public house provides a sociable and controlled drinking environment, which is important in encouraging responsible and sociable drinking.  We continue to push this message strongly as it is one that has been lost to a great extent to both nations.</p><p> We have not agreed a policy on supermarket pricing because there are different views on that thorny issue.  The price differential is very significant and surveys show people are opting to drink at home because of the very low prices available in supermarkets.  My own view is that below-cost selling of alcohol is entirely wrong.  I have pushed the Government in the UK and its predecessor to deal with the issue, and we have had some success in so far as legislation was passed.  However, that legislation does not really deal with the problem because it is effectively concerned only with taxation issues, without any reference to the cost of production and distribution of the product.  I am still pushing both Government and industry to come up with a workable below-cost selling ban.  We have considered minimum pricing, which I understand is also under consideration here, but that brings one into the realm of having to decide what level to choose and considerations such as whether it is an arbitrary level and whether what is being done is punitive.  While we all want to encourage responsible drinking, we do not want something that is deliberately punitive.  We will continue to push on that particular issue.</p><p> The assets of community value, ACV, scheme which was introduced in Britain by the last Parliament under the Localism Act is an interesting initiative that gives communities the ability to seek to list not only pubs but also local shops and other community facilities.  So far, the number of pubs listed is not huge, at between 600 and 700, although it has gone up in the past few months.  Communities must go through a listing submission process with the local authority and applications are sometimes turned down.  However, the opportunity is there to put a community bid together.  It is a fairly weak power in that the bid can be ignored, but it does present something of a roadblock to those situations where a local pub is lost without communities having a say.  One of the greatest problems in terms of pub closures in the UK is the situation where supermarket chains are buying pubs, including profitable pubs, simply because they want to impose a store on local communities.  We have absurd permitted development rights which allow that use class to go through without the need for planning permission and with communities having no say.  Where indebted property companies own pubs, it often suits their needs to sell them, even where they are profitable and viable concerns.  The ACV scheme was partly brought in to deal with that particular threat, but we are still campaigning for greater protection and an end to all permitted development rights.</p><p> Ireland is very lucky not to have this type of issue with property companies, which has proved a disastrous economic experiment in the UK.  It was essentially a scam and is, in fact, referred to by many campaigners as the "Great British Pubco Scam".  It came out of an attempt to facilitate more competition for consumers through the introduction of beer orders back in 1989, at a time when the six largest brewers had a stranglehold on the market.  The situation in Britain is very different from that in Ireland in that we have many smaller brewers, including very small brewers, who were struggling to access markets.  It was the right thing to do to try to tackle that but, unfortunately, there was no restriction on non-brewing companies.  As a consequence, large pub companies were set up which did not brew beer and which proceeded to buy up thousands of pubs.  The problem is that they then borrowed money against an overvalued estate, that is, an asset with an artificial value.  When the property market collapsed, it proved disastrous, with the two largest pub-owning companies now in billions of pounds of debt.  That is a significant problem which the sector in Ireland does not face, although there are, of course, different issues here.</p><p> The introduction of beer duty would not automatically result in lots of pubs being able to stay open.  However, it would send a strong signal that governments and parliamentarians value pubs.  It is easy to say how much we value pubs and the brewing industry's great products, including, in Ireland's case, the great Irish whiskeys and stouts.</p><p>Putting those things into practice is often something that Ministers are more reluctant to do.  The experience of beer duty in the UK is that it does restore confidence among businesspeople.  There were huge celebrations among licensees and trade representatives following the abolition of the beer duty escalator three years ago and the first cut in beer duty and a sense that this was, perhaps, doing a lot to stem the decline in the British pub sector.  One of the exciting things for Ireland is that because it has a much less complicated pub sector with, generally, freehold ownership, as long as producers commit to pass on any reduction in excise duty - I am sure they would do so because it is in their interests to do so - this will have a direct and predictable benefit for the producing-brewing sector.  I note, although this relates only to a small part of the market, that as in the case of the rest of the western world the craft beer market is now opening up in Ireland.</p><p> The only issue we had with the beer duty was that the property companies, because they were in huge debt, would pocket any reductions in beer duty.  We had to really push to ensure this did not happen.  Ireland does not have that problem and, as such, it will be able to ensure a more sensible and reasonable level of beer duty, which will have a much more positive economic effect on beer producers and will then be passed down directly through the chain to individual licensees and the customer, which is crucial.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulholland referred in his opening remarks to the many similarities between the UK and Irish pub trade, particularly the rural pub sector, although I am not too familiar with rural UK.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that the laws in relation to drink driving and so on have been tightened up over the past number of years.  Perhaps they would comment on how this has impacted on the UK trade in terms, in particular, of whether rural taxis or designated driver schemes have been introduced.  I am sure that as in the case of rural Ireland, this has had an impact on rural areas in the UK.</p><p>It was mentioned that the cut in beer duty has had the impact of increasing sales.  Is that reflected across all regions of the UK or is there a correlation between the improvements and the economy in particular regions<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other areas?  Has that analysis been undertaken?  Is there a genuine correlation between the reduction in duty and the increase in sales?</p></speech>

Rural pubs is a particular concern in Ireland, particularly in the context of the tourist appeal of the Irish pub in many areas.  We have not pursued the possibilities of taxi licences for pubs or schemes in terms of designated drivers and so on, although I think that is a measure it would be interesting to look at in relation to rural areas.  What has happened in the UK, and I think is worth looking at, is the Pub is the Hub scheme, which is not a Government initiative but it is supported by Government.  It is a charity supported by a number of organisations which works with communities, villages and licensees to enable them to diversify their business, adding new things such as shops and so on.  It is ironic that we are now moving towards the old Irish model of the grocer and pub being co-located, which is not something we did in the past in the UK.  We are trying to enable diversification, including in relation to post offices in the context of the recent threat to that sector.   I would suggest the committee look at the work of Pub is the Hub, in respect of which I am happy to facilitate links.</p> <p>  Also, there has been a presumption in planning law to seek to protect a last pub in a village.</p><p>Clearly, there are villages that may have had two, three or four pubs, and once it is down to one pub, it is in planning guidance in the UK that the pub should have greater protection than other pubs, and that is clearly sensible.  It is not an absolute and perhaps it could go further.</p><p> It is important to say, on the other side of that coin, that sometimes the so-called pub and beer industry in both countries must accept that pubs will not always be great direct income generators, and there are some areas where the pub may only provide a living for someone and their family.  It may not be at all appealing to a larger company or suppliers.  It is important to look at the community worth and the fact that pubs are still contributing very significantly and directly to local communities.  In the UK we have figures from the British Beer and Pub Association indicating that every pound spent in a pub provides twice the value to the local economy of a pound spent in a supermarket.  People who run bed and breakfasts and local shops tell us that if a pub closes, it makes a village less attractive and it is damaging to tourism, so more must be done to ensure there are ways, through some initiatives that we are implementing and that are being implemented here, to help pubs to survive.</p><p> We have seen a very exciting increase in community pubs, and that has not yet happened here.  The Plunkett Foundation helps communities to put a bid together and formulate various models to run a pub, including but not limited to co-operatives.  There are now some thriving community pubs, and some of these may not make more than a wage for the person behind the bar, although that may be enough for that person and their family.  It could become a viable public house for the future and, crucially, it will continue to help the wider economy; it will still encourage people to use the bed and breakfasts, hotels and other tourist attractions.  Without the pub, the place would suffer, and then we would be on a very dangerous downward spiral.  It would be useful to bring some of those ideas together.</p><p> On the beer duty question, the answer is, "I do not believe so."  The figures I have provided are national figures.  I can speak to the people in the Campaign for Real Ale, CAMRA, and the British Beer and Pub Association to see if any regional figures are being pulled together.  If they have been, I will certainly be happy to share them with the committee.</p></speech>

I must admit my own bias, as I have been in the supermarket business all my life.  I have listened to him being "anti-supermarket" in almost everything he said.  Britain and Ireland have the highest alcohol prices in Europe, to the best of my knowledge.  It seems to me that if we are going to encourage competition, we really should be encouraging supermarkets to sell alcohol rather than discouraging that.  Mr. Mulholland has advocated a campaign of saying "No," and is almost saying that those who run supermarkets are very nasty people who cut prices, sell below cost, etc.  I argue that this is in the interests of the community and the community needs an interest such as that.  Competition is very useful and should continue.  We love to have pubs, by all means, but they must adjust to compete with supermarkets.  The public wants the best value, and that does not just mean price; it is price plus spirit, choice and service.  I can go back 50 years to a time when there was not such choice.  Supermarkets have done a marvellous job in bringing in that choice.  We should encourage them to continue.</p></speech>

I am not anti-supermarket in the same way that I am not against pub companies.  I am against abusive practices, and we can see a host of abusive practices by pub companies.</p><p>Legislation is now in place to deal with some of those practices which are anti-competitive.  When any large company gets such a dominant position and has such resources that it can bully everyone else out of business, be they dairy farmers or communities, that is anti-competitive practice.  Supermarkets that open up in a market town and encourage the closure of village shops in order that there is no competition clearly represent anti-competitive practice.  I am not trying to put the genie back in the bottle.  There are those in the UK, and they are almost all licensees, who would say it would be great if we could turn the clock back to when supermarkets were not allowed to do this and we had off-licences and off-licences off-sales of alcohol but that is not going to happen.  We must be realistic.  It is a bit like the smoking ban, which most people think is a positive development, although it has damaged some pubs.  That ban will not be reversed either.  It is anti-competitive to sell alcohol below cost, to sell it at a cheaper price than bottled water.  That is irresponsible and immoral.  If people are playing fair and the price comes down to competition, that is great, but when that is not the case and such a strategy is deliberately used simply because people can afford to do so, that is not great.  It is not competitive and it is not proper business.  </p><p> Regarding my comments about supermarkets, particularly the imposition of supermarkets in a building that was a pub and often one that has been there for many years and was wanted by a community, one can say that is the supermarket's fault but it is not as it comes down to the weakness of the British planning system, which is what we have been saying.  Companies will exploit weaknesses in law and regulation, which is why we need to tighten up, improve and change the law and regulation.  I am happy to get a good priced, decent quality, bottle of wine at a supermarket, so that is not an issue.  The issue is that if instead of encouraging young people, as they are growing up, to go out with their father, mother or grandfather to enjoy a pint in a pub in a sociable responsible atmosphere, we go down the route of having very cut-price alcohol sales, which is simply seen as a means to get intoxicated and is not associated with sociable atmosphere, that can be dangerous.  That does not represent competition.  It is not what the supermarkets may intend.  The licensed trade in every country is always the most regulated sector of business, and it should be.  The supermarkets are not sufficiently considering the amount of alcohol that they retail.  We must be honest about that.  I do not want to stop them selling alcohol, nor do I support a high minimum price in the way that some of the health lobby do to have punitive pricing.  The evidence shows that does not make a big difference to problem drinkers.  That is not the way forward either.  However, we need to stop below-cost selling of alcohol and in the UK we certainly need to deal with the planning issues and those issues are related to planning rather than being anti-supermarket.  It will mean that people will get the chance to have a say if they want their pub to be turned into a supermarket without it being decided in two head offices of two giant companies both based hundreds of miles away.  Such strategies are anti-community and often anti-competitive.</p></speech>

I have some knowledge of this issue as I was close to setting up a craft brewery about 15 years ago and I have done considerable research on the sector although some of it is a little old at this stage.</p> <p>  With respect to a supplier power structure in Ireland, there is quite a degree of supplier power here in that there is a small number of suppliers in general and they exert considerable influence over their customers.  The position was worse a number of years ago, even to the point that many pubs were fearful of taking on taps from some of the craft breweries in that they would get less attractive contracts and deals from the larger breweries.  However, that has subsided somewhat at this stage.  </p> <p>  I agree with what Mr. Mulholland said.  Alcohol is a special type of product in that it has great social uses but it also has great social dangers, so it has to be treated slightly differently from other types of products.</p><p>My view is that the on-trade market is far more attractive for many reasons.  There is greater safety in the consumption of the products and there is added social value.  We have had major retrenchment in the last years, with thousands of jobs lost and hundreds of pubs closed.  </p><p> What has the British Government done to promote whiskey distilleries and craft breweries?  There has been a focus on tax, especially for the Scottish whisky sector.  Have any other steps been taken?  Are there any key performance indicators of the success of those steps, such as the number of jobs saved or created?  </p><p> Is there anything in British legislation that ties business rates to the profitability of the business, or that brings in an element of progressiveness?  In respect of the tied structure, I believe the healthiest market structure in this area would be perfect competition between the pubs themselves and perfect competition between the suppliers.  In other words, there would be a large number of independent suppliers and pubs.  That would be best for the consumer as it would create diversity, variety and good competition on price and quality.</p></speech>

The Deputy's last point is very interesting.  One could imagine a fantasy pub sector with the Irish pub ownership structure, which is nearly all freehold, and the British beer sector, which is booming and enjoying huge competition.  There are small breweries knocking on pub doors and new breweries opening every month, yet many of them cannot get into the large pub companies because they cannot afford to sell at the very low prices those pubs insist on.  Often, breweries cannot afford to sell even in their local village, if none of the pubs there is freehold.  It is a stark contrast.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear about the Deputy's experience of craft brewing; perhaps he was 15 years too early as it is all the rage now.  It was Gordon Brown who brought in the progressive beer duty - the small brewers rate relief - which started a resurgence at the bottom end of the British brewing industry.  The growth has been quite remarkable.  In September 2014, for which I have the figures here, there were 1,285 breweries in the UK, the vast majority of which were in Great Britain with more in England than anywhere else.  To plug my own area, west Yorkshire has the single largest concentration of breweries of any county in the country.</p> <p>  The range of beer being brewed now is extraordinary.  The majority of it is still cask ale, although there is a new trend for craft keg beer, which is more akin to the craft beer brewed over here or to American-style beer.  British brewing has been going through the most extraordinary resurgence in quality and quantity.</p><p>That type of beer nearly died out in the 1970s through the dominance of the large brewing companies at the time.  They decided to turn away from the traditional cask conditioned product for cheaper keg versions of the British bitters.  Lager also became a popular drink, as it did here.  At the same time we have seen the decline of the pubs.</p><p> It is not entirely popular, it must be said, because some of the medium sized brewers do not believe it is fair that they do not get any relief.  There are some calls to make it a sliding scale, so everybody gets relief on the first quantity of beer that they brew and one does not get this cliff edge, which can prove a disincentive for some brewers to expand from being a micro brewer to being a medium sized brewer.  Clearly, one does not wish to have anything in taxation that produces a disincentive to grow but it is important to have that so we will continue to have the quality and choice of beer.  Incidentally, it is now generally produced far closer to the pubs that serve it, which is more environmentally friendly.  Also, there is a trend among people both here and in the UK to want local produce of all types, and that is to be welcomed.</p><p> That is the significant thing that has been done.  There has not really been a promotion of craft beer.  Governments would say that they support brewing and the current and last governments would say that the biggest way they did that and showed confidence in British beer was through cuts in beer duty.  It was very significant in terms of the message it conveyed and the confidence it produced in the sector.</p><p> There is far less linkage with the lucrative scotch whisky industry and the on-trade, although it is clearly a big seller in the on-trade.  Most of the focus from the UK Government tends to be on exports rather than promoting it in the on-trade and, indeed, there are always efforts in supporting the Scottish whisky industry in that regard.</p><p> With regard to business rates, the small business rate relief being extended has certainly helped many pubs.  The Save the Pub Group would like to see, potentially through the assets of community value initiative, a specific rate relief given to community pubs where the community pub can show that it has that role in the community, as genuine community pubs do in that it supports charitable work, community organisations and sports teams.  It is necessary to find a way of doing that but we would like to see something specific in the rates system in the UK.</p><p> A campaign was launched recently to try to address the high business rates that many pubs are charged, and the Save the Pub Group has pledged to support it.  Clearly, business rates is a big issue for many UK publicans.  There is something of an irony here because it is being led by the British Beer and Pub Association, which is the representative body of the big players, the large pub companies and large breweries.  The irony is that it was the British Beer and Pub Association which put the current rates regime in place by proposing it in the first place.  At the time, it was a way of enabling the pub-owning companies to take a greater share of the income from the pub.  Now, it works very significantly against licensees.  That is one of the ironies from that debacle, but we are keen and we will work with that association and others to try to get a fairer system of rates which, as the member said, more directly reflects the income and the profit in the pub.  The current very complex system, on which I can share more information with the committee, does not do that.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Cribben the best of luck in his ongoing talks with the LVA.  The next time he appears before the committee there might be a joint body rather than two separate bodies.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a couple of points.</p><p>I have always been opposed to below-cost selling because the manner in which many below-cost sellers, including supermarkets, are taking advantage of the VAT rebate means that taxpayers are indirectly subsidising the drink.  I am delighted that we have introduced legislation to provide for a minimum cost for each unit of alcohol.  I am aware that a similar arrangement is in place in Scotland, but does Mr. Mulholland envisage that it will be extended to the entire UK as a means of controlling the sale of alcohol in supermarkets?</p><p> I must say that what is happening here on the craft beer side of things is really exciting.  Many micro-breweries are producing craft beer in various locations throughout the country.  In fairness to the Minister, in the last budget he increased the number of hectolitres that can be produced before additional excise duty needs to be paid.  That has been welcomed by the craft brewers that are found all over the country.</p><p> I travel to Mr. Mulholland's part of Yorkshire once a year for a race meeting in York.  I have noticed that for more and more pubs in the UK, the food business is as important as the drink business.  I see that happening here as well.  Perhaps, as part of a cultural shift, people are getting used to eating out rather than cooking.  Does Mr. Mulholland have any thoughts on how we can improve and increase that business?  As a certain skill set is needed, we need to consider how we can address the shortage of chefs in this country.  I am sure that problem is being encountered within the food-serving pub trade in the UK as well.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Mulholland that many pubs are merely surviving.  In many cases, the problem is where they are located.  I understand there was a time when there were more pubs than houses in Dunmore, County Galway.  That has changed dramatically in recent years.  There has been a rationalisation of the trade and a shift in the culture.  I see this in my own town of Naas as well.  There are just six or eight pubs there now, whereas there were 15 or 20 pubs in the town ten or 15 years ago.  Based on his experience in the UK, how does Mr. Mulholland believe we can address the problem of pubs closing down in certain areas?  How can we make a change so that pubs are more likely to operate on a vibrant community basis, in the manner to which he has alluded, rather than being lost to their communities?  If a post office is closing people will protest outside it, but very little notice is taken when a pub is closing, even though in most rural areas it is the link that enables people to communicate with one another.  We do not see that happening.  Does Mr. Mulholland agree we could be doing something on that to encourage more of them to stay open?  It may be possible to link in with other services as well.</p></speech>

I will be watching with interest to see what happens here with regard to below-cost selling.  The debate on that is still raging, including within the sector.  There are people within the so-called industry who are absolutely opposed to a prohibition on below-cost selling because potentially they could benefit from sales.  Some producers are less opposed to it because they object to supermarkets being able to sell their products at a price that they consider to be too low.  There is generally strong support for a ban from licensees.  The problem in this regard lies in how one picks the minimum price.  For that reason, I hope we will work towards a genuine definition of what it means to sell below cost.  I think the costs of production and distribution should be taken into account, as should taxation.  I believe that would help us to stamp out the very low-price sale of alcohol in supermarkets without necessarily picking an arbitrary figure.</p><p>Doctors would like it to be pitched at a very high level because they believe that would put people off drinking or they would drink less.  Not only does that not necessarily help some problem drinkers, even though it might reduce consumption, there is a danger that it could damage pubs if it is too high a figure.</p><p> I share the point on the VAT rebate.  It is a scandal and needs to be highlighted more.  In terms of craft beer, it was very interesting to hear that Ireland is going down the route of doing something similar to what we call the progressive beer duty for smaller producers.  I am interested in seeing what impact that has because there is a global move towards locally produced craft beers.  No one will threaten the dominance of Guinness in Ireland but people want choice, and there is no reason there cannot be a range of different types of beer.  That is to be encouraged.</p><p> The issue of food is interesting because food is much more important to many pubs than it used to be, in particular rural pubs in the UK which serve Sunday lunches and other meals.  That is to be welcomed and I am not aware that there is a shortage of chefs, but there is a crisis in curry houses in the UK because of changes to the immigration rules which mean we may not have enough qualified chefs for our curry houses.  If one goes to a pub in the UK that does not do food, one might go from the pub to a curry house.  </p><p> Deputy Lawlor referred to visiting York, which is a fascinating example of what is happening.  It is a very popular tourist destination.  Pubs are opening there in locations which were not formerly pubs, and the same is happening in Leeds and a number of other places.  There are various reasons for that.  A Leeds brewery opened a new pub in York in recent years.  People often find they cannot get their hands on pubs owned by large companies, even if they are not doing particularly well, and often buy a shop which they convert into a pub.  That is strange, at a time when other pubs are closing.  </p><p> There has been a large increase in micro pubs for that reason.  If one buys a shop, one pays significantly less in rates because of the size of the building.  One can have a fairly small bar, which is often more akin to a traditional Irish bar, with a counter and a limited offering that does not include food.  Such pubs are very successful.  In the UK debate is shifting.  It is not true to say that a pub cannot do well unless it serves food.  Certain pubs are reliant on food, but it is exciting that there are now many smaller pubs which do not serve food and do better for not doing so because they specialise in beer and people go to them for that reason.  There needs to be a balance and that depends on a particular pub.</p><p> On the question of pub closures, it is about giving a community the opportunity to seek to save a pub.  That means finding someone else to run it or running it themselves.  In Ireland the challenge, because of pubs being freehold, is that if a family decides they no longer wish to run a pub and want to turn it into a house that can be more problematic than a distant pub company which people may not like or know deciding to close a pub against the will of the community.  That is why the assets community value initiative is interesting.  It gives a community the right, not necessarily to buy a pub, but to have a say and to seek to put a community bid together.  </p><p> It is a very complex sector in the UK and there are many positive stories.  I mentioned a brewery in Leeds.  Many such small breweries are taking on pubs, and are actively seeking to do so because they are doing very well.  They are often prevented from doing so because of the ludicrous amounts property owning companies seek to sell them for, and that is why they are often sold to Tesco, Sainsbury's or the Co-op.</p><p>There are people, certainly in the UK, who are prepared to take on pubs that other companies have deemed non-viable.  All we are arguing for is that the process be seen through: if someone wants to take on a pub and can barter a fair and market price they should be allowed to do so.  That is something we are pushing for.  With those rural pubs, there is a need for some provision in the planning laws to prevent it from closing if it is the only pub in the village.  That is an issue that would have to be worked through within the realities of Irish planning law, an area in which I am not expert.  The pub is a hub initiative.  It should be possible to get more services into a pub - to combine it with a shop, a post office and so on - and to work together with other businesses and get support, mainly from local councils, with some government-backed schemes.  We need to ensure these pubs do not close in the first place because they are so important for the wider economy in rural areas.</p></speech>

We all want a vibrant pub trade in which families can continue to make a living.  Mr. Mulholland mentioned the food side of the business.  What percentage of UK pubs serve food?  Are the health and safety regulations on the provision of food strict?  Sometimes we get complaints that Ireland is possibly over-regulated in terms of food provision.  What are individual UK pubs doing to attract new customers to the local pub for a pint, thus discouraging people from consuming more alcohol at home?  What was the political reaction to the tax reduction for beer?  I imagine there might be an adverse reaction to reducing tax on beer, particularly as we are just emerging from a difficult economic climate.  If there was one element of the Irish pub that Mr. Mulholland would like to bring back to the UK, what would it be?  If he were to advise us to transport something from the UK to Ireland, what would it be?</p></speech>

As I have made clear, I am pleased that the pub has a future that is not necessarily in the form of a pub restaurant.  It is a little bit similar to how things are in Ireland: when we use the word "pub," this can cover some things that are substantially different.  Some of the figures that are bandied about include bars, which we in the pub sector group would not necessarily recognise as being pubs or having that intrinsic community value.  Food is important in pubs, but it is great that there are many pubs that are doing well without it, focusing on the beer side of things.  They may well have snacks and pork pies and so on but they are not food-led.</p> <p>  There are often grumbles about various elements of red tape and regulation.  I am probably not the best person to speak to from that point of view in the sense that I represent a campaigning organisation, not a licensee representative body.  I can certainly seek organisations that could give the committee that information.  I am not aware of a huge number of complaints about problems serving food in pubs.  It is certainly something that companies of all sizes that own pubs encourage their licensees to do.  With regard to individual pubs, ultimately, pubs are competing against each other, unless they are the last pub in the village, and even then they still need to attract people.  Clearly, they are businesses that need to attract people. The pubs that is getting it right is providing the customer with what he or she wants in terms of the range and quality of beer but also the ambience.</p><p>Often, if it is a food-led pub, it is the quality of the food, be it simple Sunday lunch fare or something more fancy.  There are some fantastic operators in the United Kingdom, as there are here.</p><p> It has been frustrating to see a real problem in the UK with the lease-tied system, which is operated in particular by large companies.  This is something Ireland does not have, and it goes back to the issue of competition.  I have seen many heartbreaking examples in which people have worked extremely hard, been very good operators and provided what the customers wanted but not got the support from the pub-owning company, and the price of success was to see their rent go up, so that however hard they worked, they could not make the pub sustainable on the terms under which they were being offered it.  We legislated in November last as a result of our big campaign and we hope that will start to become a practice of the past.  We want to see these great operators doing well and really making an effort to attract customers in so that they choose to go to the pubs rather than, as was stated here, choosing to sit at home and watch a DVD with a four-pack of lager.  There is work to be done by operators, by everyone in the trade and, to some extent, by governments, both national and local, to get the message out that well-run responsible pubs are important for tourism, for the economy and for communities and should be supported.</p></speech>

He asked what would I bring over to the United Kingdom from Irish bars.  I dare say we will visit at least a few Dublin pubs later on and I hope I will come back and visit some pubs in rural areas, as I did some years ago.  One of the wonderful aspects is the difference between the two countries, which is all about history in the end.  It is due to the very different ways in which pubs emerged.  The public house in the United Kingdom emerged from people literally opening up their front rooms to allow others to drink there to supplement their income.  One forgets that it was not a big industry; it was to supplement their income.  Then there is way the Irish pub developed, with the spirit grocers and so on.  There is nothing better than going into a traditional Irish bar where one has a group - generally, but I hope now not always, men - just sitting in conversation at the bar.  In previous times they would have been smoking, but not now.  It is the ambience created by that.  There are a few very basic pubs or bars in the United Kingdom and, certainly, that is the sort of thing I love.</p> <p>  One point I must make is that, despite my being the chairman of the Save the Pub group in the United Kingdom, there is no pub called the Mulholland Bar or the Mulholland Arms, whereas in Ireland there are quite a few.  I have not yet visited one.  Something I would certainly like to import is a pub called Mulholland.</p> <p>  With regard to the best aspects of the English pub, and the uniqueness of those I call "English" specifically, I particularly love mid-terrace locals.  One of my own locals is mid-terrace.  It is literally a terraced house between other terraced houses.  One would not get that anywhere else.  It has a certain quality.  Another is a beautiful pub garden in an English pub in one of the attractive rural areas.  That is something we do particularly well.  However, there are always things that we can learn.  We must make these linkages so that we learn the best things in the pub sector.  Those of us in Parliament who care about these matters are learning about the positive things each country is doing that can help support and preserve pubs.</p></speech>

It currently provides that the levy shall apply to residential land or regeneration land other than land owned by a housing authority.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 provides that this latter exemption will now no longer apply to such land by the removal of the text &ldquo;other than land owned by a housing authority&rdquo;.  This means that all residential or regeneration land, regardless of ownership, be it public or private, will be subject to the levy if it meets the criteria for a vacant site as provided for in section 5.  This will ensure that all owners of vacant sites will be treated equally.  For example, local authorities will have the same responsibilities under this legislation as private land owners.  Accordingly, it will also encourage local authorities that may be in possession of suitable sites for the provision of housing to develop those sites.</p><p>In this regard, I have considered the comments and contributions of Deputies.  Deputy Mulherin felt quite strongly about this on Second Stage debate.  This amendment will allow for the application of the vacant site levy in a fair and equitable manner to all owners of vacant sites, either public or private.</p></speech>

The myth is that local authorities are sitting on huge tracts of land they do not want to develop, as opposed to not having the means to develop.  The unused sites I have come across are not owned by local authorities or by housing associations.  I can think of one housing association that has a site that is unused and there are still cattle grazing on it.  It is not the end of the world and it is not a derelict site.  If there is a problem with a site owned by the local authority, if a local authority member, a community group or a Member of the Houses contacts the local authority, he or she will get a resolution to that straight away.  It is not fair to lump public bodies, which are already under serious pressure in terms of housing, which are dealing with homeless people walking through their doors every day of the week and which have huge pressure on their resources, in with developers who are sitting on pots of land waiting for it to go up in value.  If local authorities have land, they want to, and they do, use it.</p></speech>

The levy would be applied by, and paid to, the local authority, so it would have to go through a regime to do that.  Local authorities do not have huge independent means for the development of these sites.  Could the Minister of State envisage a situation in which the local authority is forced to develop one particular site in a county, as opposed to in a location where there is a greater housing need?  If that is the case, I am not sure how forcing its hand in that way is a good idea.  It may well also force local authorities to sell on sites at less than the potential market value at a better time.  I can see problems with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015063000002#B00400"><p>I welcome this amendment.  I spoke on this on Second Stage and I outlined my reasons but for the benefit of the committee, I will reiterate my views.  It is assumed that the vacant site levy will get at developers hoarding land.  That is all very well where there is a housing need, as we know there is.  However, this will impact on ordinary people who may have a site that is under-utilised.  In some cases, they may not be able to get a loan to do it up, or there may not be a market for the particular property, because a shortage of housing is not a problem in every part of the country.  In my constituency, the local authority has long-term voids that are almost derelict.</p> <p>  I agree with one sentiment expressed by previous speakers.  In some cases, the local authorities do not have money but equally there are ordinary individuals, private property owners, who have inherited properties.  It might be an old family home belonging to parents in the centre of town.  They might not have money to do it up and the market that prevails may mean they cannot sell it.  Why should they be penalised when the local authority will not be penalised?</p> <p>  The one great benefit of this will be that it will bring a certain sobriety to an overzealous county manager who has plans for housing or regeneration and might decide to slap vacant site levies on private property owners without the same measure applying to the local authority itself.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  There must be more sympathy for the ordinary individual who might be put in an unforeseen and unintentional predicament.  The sentiment of providing more housing and developing under-utilised land is good but there are people who could be caught out by this.  </p> <p>  This measure will bring more sobriety to any deliberations by a council which might think it can shove a major responsibility onto private property owners without considering the ramifications for that property owner.  It will consider it if it has to face the same ramifications.  The issue of local authorities not having the means to develop sites is an issue but it is also one which a private person might face, so this measure is welcome.  My only question is about who will levy the council.  The council has its own budget, so to whom will it pay the levy and how will that be implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015063000002#B00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We might pose the question as to why we have the vacant site levy at all.  This Bill is targeted at incentivising urban regeneration and the provision of housing in core areas of our cities and towns.  We must start where infrastructure already exists.  We all know cities and towns in this country that have sites in their centres which have public services on the footpaths outside them and which have been lying vacant for many years while pressure is coming on the suburbs of those same towns and cities for development.  Pressure is being put on the taxpayer to provide infrastructure and services when we should be focused on regenerating and redeveloping the cores of our cities and towns.</p> <p>  In general, this Bill is adopting a carrot and stick approach.  This is the stick element of it, where we are proposing, given due process, to introduce a vacant site levy to stimulate the development of these sites and to bring them back into beneficial use.  Nobody could disagree with that rationale in the first instance.  How do we go about it?  Why are we now applying it to public bodies and local authorities as well as private bodies?  If we look honestly at the property registers of many cities and towns, public bodies own substantial tracts of land there.  With that ownership comes responsibilities.  If a person who is proud of their community looks at a site, it should not matter to him or her who owns the site once it is put into use for the benefit of the citizens of that community.  Local authorities have a responsibility, like everyone else, in this regard.  For those reasons, they are being included.  </p> <p>  At the very least, the proposal that a vacant site, whether publicly or privately owned, will be designated as vacant will stimulate debate in the local authority chamber where the elected members are being given a new power to identify and designate such sites according to the needs of their areas.  Ultimately, the local authority will decide but it will be difficult for any local authority to target any particular site while neglecting sites in its ownership.  It will incentivise the development of those sites.  For that reason, we propose the amendment and I hope we will get support for it.</p></speech>

I agree that there are local authorities which have huge land banks but with money being so scarce in local authorities at present, how does the Minister of State propose to impose fines on these authorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015063000002#C00100"><p>I assume the local authority cannot levy itself.  Who will levy the local authority?</p> <p>  I know we have an opportunity to submit amendments up until tomorrow.  On Second Stage I raised a question on the considerable number of development sites that NAMA controls.  I wish to ensure that any property under the care and control of NAMA is treated in the same way as if NAMA owned the property.  We know that in many instances developers are restricted in what they can do.  NAMA is part of the key to addressing the housing shortage, and it can play a major role.  NAMA controls property and it should be working with developers and funding them to that end.  </p> <p>  NAMA has been in existence for seven years and does not really have much to show in terms of addressing the housing shortage.  What was envisaged by Government, in view of the report commissioned by the Department of Finance which showed that we need to build 30,000 houses per annum, was that NAMA would address that need.  NAMA is clapping itself on the back after announcing that 4,500 houses would be built in the greater Dublin area by 2016, with the possibility of an additional 20,000 houses around the country in the next five years or so.  This is a drop in the ocean when one considers the housing need.  It is important that NAMA comes within the definition of "owner" and that it is clarified that NAMA will be held liable when vacant site charges are placed on properties.</p></speech>

It is a good idea, if it is applied correctly.  Under the provisions of amendment No. 1, however, the local authority will be levying itself.  It is placing an administrative burden on one department to levy another department.  I understand it is a reserved function, so one could have a situation in which councillors decide that a particular area can be brought into play and a site might be sold rather than developed because the local authority does not have the funding.  That is what concerns me about this amendment.  I think there is a certain nonsensical aspect to a local authority levying itself.</p></speech>

I think it is a good idea.  However, I forgot to say in my Second Stage contribution that I have concerns about its practicality.  Will the Minister respond in that regard?  Are we depending on the local elected members to impose strictures on the staff of the council to ensure they do a deal on the vacant sites for which they are responsible?  As has been indicated, vacant derelict sites can be controlled by councils, and councils can often be slow to ensure they are occupied.</p></speech>

Let us be clear: where a housing authority has land, it will want to use it.  There is all this palaver about devolving powers to local authorities, but in this Bill we are cutting a stick and handing it to them to beat themselves with it.  The money to pay the levy will not drop out of the sky; it will come from rates in the administrative area of the local authority.  That is the last thing people in the community will want.  They will want a solution.  The 949 local councillors will respond to pressure from the people to bring the land into use.  Local councillors, regardless of political persuasion, are very responsive to local pressure and local needs</p> <p>  There are good things in the Bill, but some aspects of Part 5 needs to be revised.  The site levy is a good idea.  I brought forward a derelict sites Bill last year because of the urgent need to address the issue, but this Bill is taking the wrong direction.  There is no compelling case for it.  It is Big Brother handing a stick to a weak local authority.  Rather than trying to strengthen and empower the local authority, the Government is giving it a stick with which to beat itself.  It is the ratepayers in the area who will pay for the beating.  I think that is terrible.</p></speech>

The major problem is gaining access to capital to develop the site.  It owns the site.  With the numbers on the housing list increasing, the pressure is on public representatives to ensure the sites are developed.</p> <p>  I am aware that investors are willing to develop local authority land and lease back the resulting properties back to the local authority.  One thing that is causing a problem is that a local authority can only enter into a lease-back arrangement for a maximum of 20 years.  The legislation needs to be amended to increase this to 30 years.  I think it would act as an incentive for investors to come in to develop some of the local authority sites and lease them back to the local authority over a period of time.  It would address the problem by building houses rather than putting a levy and an administrative burden on local authorities.</p></speech>

This amendment might make sense if the Government gave us a commitment and a cast-iron guarantee that the capital will be provided by the Government when the local authorities come up with plans to develop sites that are suitable for social housing where there is a social housing need.</p><p><b></b>This pertains to something that I am very uncertain about in terms of the Government's whole approach to the social housing crisis.  The Government states that the money is available but it is up to the local authorities to provide the housing.  Is the money really there for the local authorities?  I can think of several sites owned by my local authority which are earmarked for social housing, but we have been told by the local authority that it does not have the money to develop the sites.  If the Minister of State is saying that all the local authorities have to do is to come up with a plan to put social housing on those sites and the Minster will give them the money, I might support this.</p></speech>

The only way the local authority will be able to come up with plans that it can finance, if the Government does not guarantee the local authority the money, is by handing the land over to private developers, who will take it and lease it back to the council at a further cost to the taxpayer and to the State, and this will ultimately result in a loss of public housing that might have been owned by the State.  If this were the case, I would be resolutely opposed to the Bill.  I am asking the Minister whether he is guaranteeing  money for local authorities that come forward with plans for land that they currently own.  I would be very happy but surprised if that were true.</p></speech>

Local authorities already apply rates to themselves.  That is a known fact under our current rating system and, therefore, any liabilities that would result from a designation are identified and shown on the local authority books.  It is my hope - this is the reason we are bringing in this legislation - that we would not get to that stage, because a strict set of criteria is set down and there is due process before any vacant site is designated.  Again, it affords the owner, whether public or private, the opportunity to set out clearly to the local authority what he or she intends to do to bring that site back to beneficial use.</p> <p>  If we are to learn from the past, we have to move away from urban sprawl, greenfield sites and a shortage of infrastructure.  The same Deputies who are complaining here now were the first Deputies to come to me with complaints about unfinished estates, protocols for unfinished estates, lack of infrastructure and half-finished infrastructure.  I am saying clearly that the intent of this Bill is to exploit and sweat existing public infrastructure that has already been paid for by the taxpayer.  We want to focus minds on local authorities, which are the authorities that will designate ultimately.  We are giving them that power.  They are also the same local authorities that prioritise their housing proposals.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a good question regarding local authorities that come forward with proposals for social housing on a vacant site.  I will give him an example of that in Fingal.  The Deputy said no capital funding was being provided.  The capital funding being provided to Fingal, for example, for the provision of housing has increased from &euro;6 million to &euro;81 million this year.  Whether it is Fingal or any other local authority, if a local authority comes forward with proposals to regenerate a site and provide social housing where public infrastructure already exists, if it is being prioritised by the local authority, it is logical to me that we in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should prioritise it as well.  Also, the figures stack up because the infrastructure is already paid for.  We do not have to go to enormous lengths and expense to install new public sewers, water facilities, electricity and so on.  </p> <p>  This is about urban regeneration and refocusing development back to the core of our towns and cities.  We may not like all that is in the Bill, but it is an attempt to focus the minds of local authorities and their members, who have a strong responsibility, on this issue.  I believe that all public bodies, even if they are owners of sites, have a responsibility also.  They need to make plans for those sites just as everybody else does.</p> <p>  The amendment stands.  I hope I have explained the rationale behind it.  There are strict criteria, there is due process and there is an appeals system.  It is not something that can be struck down overnight.  People will have sufficient time to set out their plans for sites, but these sites need to be brought back into beneficial use if we are to have sustainable development and planning in our cities and towns.</p></speech>

If we are to develop our facilities in towns and villages, and perhaps take some of the pressure off in terms of urban-generated housing in the countryside, they have to be attractive places to live.  This provision in the subsection is limited in that it confines the site to areas where there is a housing need.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 removes the requirement for the site to consist of regeneration land or to have an adverse effect on the amenities or character of an area in order to be eligible for a levy.  There may well be other circumstances such as the under-use of buildings that are lying vacant.  There could be several other scenarios in which this could be meaningfully applied and where the argument could equally be made in regard to bringing more vibrant uses to a town, village or city.  The intention of the amendments is to widen out the measure so that it is not so limited.</p></speech>

I made the point in the Chamber that land banking is one of the biggest problems in the industry, and we need to deal with it.  There are too many provisions in the Bill that allow developers to get out of this.  If someone has bought land for development and deems that there is no need for housing there at the time, I would point to the two categories we have in Ireland - namely, land banking and shadow land banking - and this one falls into the shadow land banking category.  It is land that did not cost as much as land that we would regard as being part of a land bank, and that will sell for a lower price, but fellows are hoarding it until, they estimate, the time comes when there is a need for housing on that land.  The Government should be catching those land hoarders in the net as well, even though the land might not be suitable for development currently.  There might not be a need for housing there right now, but the developer or investor bought it for a good reason.  That is what shadow land banking is.  All sites bought for development need to be caught in the Minister's site levy.</p></speech>

The reason is that we have a housing shortage, and we want to address that.  I have expressed my concerns about the issue of regeneration outside the context of the need for housing and the pressure that exists which requires us to take emergency action, but we have not had the full conversation on this.  Many people have one-off units in areas of towns that are derelict.  I will cite a case for the Minister of State.  An older retired woman came to see me.  The woman, who is on a non-contributory pension, has an old premises that she used to live in but that she had to leave.  It was half commercial, half residential.  It is an old building and she has priced what it would take to do up that building, which is &euro;250,000.  There is an old stone facade on it.  The property is not worth that.  We have to be careful that we are addressing a problem here and that we are not going overboard.  This retired woman will not get a loan.  There is no market there because there are several more properties up the street.</p> <p>  The story is not the same in every town and city, and I acknowledge the problem with housing and the needs in that regard, but in situations in which the market does not allow people to borrow or perhaps even sell in any reasonable fashion, we need to exercise more hesitancy in slapping vacant site levies on them.  We have the Derelict Sites Act if an issue arises regarding the facade of a building or the visual amenity, but these are the realities for ordinary people.  They are not developers or land holders and they would sell it.  I have cited that case, and I know other properties in respect of which people have not told me their stories but I would be reasonably familiar with the situation.  We have to protect such people.  That is why the provision is included.  It is not designed to get somebody who is a land hoarder out of the trap.  We know land has been developed in the past that should not have been developed, which is an issue to do with development plans and how the development took place.  Now we have areas of the country with empty houses.  That is the irony.  There are empty houses in my own town - new houses that are empty.</p> <p>  It is not a case of one size fits all.  There are people who will be put in dire straits as a result of this.  We should not cry over local authorities, who have much deeper pockets than the lady to whom I refer, who is on the non-contributory old age pension and would be caught out by an over-zealous plan.  It is welcome that we confine it in this regard.  I have reservations about the regeneration, but in some ways we have to leave that to councillors.</p><p>It will be tempered by the fact that anything we do here will also affect the local authority and its pockets.</p></speech>

There are several strict criteria that must be adhered to for any designation to happen.  This will be in the control of the local authority.  One of the criteria is that a project must be economically viable.  I assure the Deputy that no penal imposition will happen as a result of this Bill, as there are enough checks and balances within the Bill to address the issue and give councillors the flexibility to understand if there are economic viability issues.  I know it is a different section to what we are discussing but I draw the Deputy's attention to section 14(<i>b</i>), dealing with determination of zero market value, which states, &quot;the site is situated on contaminated lands and the estimated costs of remedial works necessary in order to use or develop the site exceed the market value of the site itself&quot;.  There are checks and balances to protect the people mentioned by the Deputy.  In short, we are targeting high-potential sites in highly serviced areas with much demand for housing.  There are strict criteria and strong processes before a site would be designated.  There is due process and time for owners of sites to provide reasons a site should or should not be developed.</p><p>We are opposing the amendment.  The criteria in section 5 set out the principles and policies underpinning the terms &quot;residential&quot; and &quot;regeneration land&quot;.  The proposed amendments remove essential elements of the criteria to be applied in determining what is and what is not a vacant site.  Without such criteria, there is no justification for designating which sites in residential and regeneration land should be targeted for the application of the levy.  These are important justifications underpinning the vacant site levy measure aimed at incentivising the development of high-potential vacant sites in central urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes.  The legislation would lack teeth without these criteria.  The purpose of the criteria outlined in the Bill in this regard is to focus on the appropriate range of sites to be potentially subject to the levy, with a view to strengthening the public interest and common good justification of the levy.</p></speech>

I accept Deputy Mulherin's point that it is not a one size fits all approach.  The local authorities will have the responsibility to designate, and that is not something that will be imposed.  I am quite sure people around the country will take different views, depending on the circumstances.  A place like D&uacute;n Laoghaire and my area could be worlds apart from places in the west of Ireland.  If we are going to have towns functioning in a vibrant way, with no unused buildings that could be brought into viable use, we need to examine the areas that may be falling into dereliction because somebody is hoarding property, perhaps even ahead of areas that are already very derelict.</p></speech>

If I bought a site zoned for development, it might not be economically viable to develop it or I might not be able to get the finance to do it.  I would be facing the prospect of paying a 3% levy on it and I would have to weigh up my options, which are to pay the levy or get rid of the land.  If I am not forced to make that decision, I could quite happily be a land banker and pay no tax on it.</p></speech>

Section 14, which takes in whether a market exists and if the works required would make a site unviable, is very important.

As we all know, there are shortcomings with the Derelict Sites Act and people may get frustrated within communities because of them.  Essentially, if there is window dressing in the form of paint or nice boarding on a site, the issue can be seen as resolved.  The criteria in this Bill go much further in a strengthened process to ensure a vacant site is one of high potential.  A key criterion to be aware of is that a site can only be designated where there is a deficit of housing in a particular area.  Where there is surplus housing or adequate provision in an area, this Bill would not allow a site in the area to be designated.  Section 6 deals with the register of vacant sites and section 6(4)(<i>d</i>) refers to &quot;whether the number of habitable houses available for purchase or rent was less than 5% of the total number of houses in the area.&quot;.  It is only where there is much pressure for housing that a site can be deemed vacant.  This cannot happen willy-nilly all over the country in towns and villages, and these strict criteria must be met.  These criteria give the Bill its teeth, and by interfering with that we would lessen its impact and its ability to deliver more housing, which is what we are all trying to achieve.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister in that we must differentiate between derelict and unused sites, as there is a clear difference.  The derelict sites legislation must be strengthened.  It is a good amendment and I will support it over Deputy Murphy's, which stipulates a bigger area.  It is a good move by the Government and it takes into consideration the real position on the ground in many towns, particularly in the centres, which can have many small sites.  They are important and problems can be caused if they are unused.</p></speech>

A few more of us have that also.  The Government listens as do I.  Deputy Wallace made a rational argument on Second Stage for a lesser plot size for sites and I agreed with the argument he made.  Subsequently, the Government brought forward an amendment to reduce it to 0.5 hectares on the plot size.  This is about targeting what we have been speaking about.  We know that sites in our towns and cities are causing urban blight and problems.  Sometimes there are ownership issues.  There is a variety of reasons that they are not being developed and we need to get to the crux of them.  The Bill will provide local authorities with the power to focus on these sites and regenerate them.  As such, I welcome the support for the amendment.</p><p> I am a bit confused as to Deputy Stanley's position.  He referred with regard to the last amendment to "other needs".  I am not sure what other needs he is speaking about.  We are trying to address the housing need and urban regeneration where there is a high demand for housing and a deficit of housing.  Strict criteria are there to address that.  As such, I am not sure what he means by "other needs".  He may want to explain.</p></speech>

The point was well made by Deputy Mulherin that many facilities and housing were pushed out to the edge of towns and we need to get them back in.  We agree fully with the Government on this.  The Minister of State referred to sweating these important sites.  It might not be the best term and I would probably prefer the word "consolidate".  We should be aiming to consolidate town cores.  While I do not want people living on top of each other, one sees that the heart of every town one drives through is derelict.  They are coming apart and the centre is not holding.  We need to look at this seriously.  While a great deal of what is being proposed is good in the general scheme of things, it could be about bringing in a primary care centre or other important facility.</p></speech>

I refer to section 5(2).  When we are talking about the definitions of "site" and "home" on page 7, we are excluding what are described as "homes".  Obviously, there is a very good reason to do that in most cases.  One does not want to be lashing levies on people who might have a house or what is defined as a "home" empty for a period for understandable and legitimate reasons.  However, there is an issue of which I am aware, albeit I have to do a bit more research.  In fact, the Minister of State may be in a position to enlighten us.  I understand that in London and other European cities if a house is empty for a very prolonged period without good reason, there are laws which provide that those sites can either be taken by local authorities or that levies will apply to them.  One might not be able to take them here, but levies might be possible.  I would like to hear the Minister of State on this.  While one would obviously have to be careful and there would have to be a great deal of consideration as to how it might be done, it is wrong if there are built houses just sitting there for long period, whether they are in public or private ownership, when there are people in need of places to live.  We need to consider whether a provision should be included in the Bill to address that issue.  It may be that we could look at how the issue is dealt with in other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, where legislation is in place to ensure that empty properties are used for housing for people who need it.</p></speech>

Essentially, he is right that we do not want to target a home where somebody is living.  The Deputy made some points regarding other jurisdictions where there are vacant houses in which no one is living.  I know where he is coming from and that he wants to get them back into use.  However, in the Irish situation, we would be in danger of contravening Article 43 of the Constitution which refers to property rights and the right of people to own property.  I am not sure that we could introduce here provisions applying in other jurisdictions without a change in the Constitution.  We would be happy to clarify it for the Deputy, but I think that is the position.</p></speech>

If the levy can apply to land, I do not see why it cannot apply to vacant properties.  It may be something we need to look at.  I have not thought it out fully or put down an amendment, but it is something we should look at and consider.  I am certainly going to do so.  If there is any way to have a measure to push buildings and houses which are not being used back into use for those who need them, we should consider including it in the Bill.</p></speech>

I have asked that a particular dwelling be taken over because we cannot find the owner of it.  From a conversation I had with Deputy Emmet Stagg on a previous occasion, I understand that the library on Main Street, Maynooth, was acquired that way because they could not find the owner.  Deputy Murphy might know about that.</p></speech>

In fact, there is a second part of it that refers to the common good.  It is not in the common good if there are a lot of vacant properties around the place while there are people without homes.  It is interesting to note that one of the locations where this is done is the USA where foreclosures have left a great deal of dereliction.  Use it or lose it was the rule and public authorities were able to take over those houses.  It is not something one might find in eastern Europe; it is actually in places one might not expect to find it.  It is how they have dealt with some of the dereliction in the USA.</p></speech>

I have already outlined the situation with regard to the Constitution.  Deputy Catherine Murphy makes a good point regarding the common good at which the Bill, in essence, is targeted.  It is aimed at the common good of providing houses where there is a high demand and where services exist.  Deputy Dowds referred to the CPO measure under the Derelict Sites Act.  If something is a blight on the landscape and goes on the register and there is due process, the local authority can CPO the site.  This Bill is not about taking property from people or grabbing land.</p><p>It is a targeted approach with a studied and deep analysis of urban areas by a local authority in a measured, fair and balanced fashion.  It will give due process to the owners of sites and the time for them to outline their plans for them.  If, at the end of all of this they cannot meet the criteria, then the local authority has the power to designate it as a vacant site and apply the levy.</p><p> We will take it one step at a time.  This provision is more than useful and it needs to be given a chance to see how it works.  I hope it will bring benefits for regeneration and the provision of housing in our urban centres.</p></speech>

The dates for the completion of this have been pushed out into the future, however.  Given the urgency of actually getting this up and running, I do not understand why the timeline has been pushed out as far as it has been.  Each of these amendments proposes to bring forward the dates for the setting up of the register, giving notice of inclusion on it and when the levy should be paid.  My amendment No. 17 proposes the date for when the levy should be paid should be 2018 rather than 2019, as suggested in the Bill.</p></speech>

One of the major weaknesses in the Derelict Sites Act 1990 is the amount of time it takes for its provisions to kick in.  Deputy Michelle Mulherin made a good point earlier about a pensioner who owns a derelict site and does not have the means to develop it.  There is a clause to cater for that.</p> <p>  However, some owners with the means can drag it out, leading the local authorities around in circles.  I have been engaged with the Derelict Sites Act over the years and it has been the bane of my life at times.  I do not want to see the same dragging out over time occur with this legislation.  To allow until January 2017 to establish a register or 2018 to given written notice or 2019 for the payment of arrears is just too long.  We have to tighten these up because some developers will drag it out forever and a day, making the legislation ineffectual.</p></speech>

The wheels of bureaucracy move slowly.  However, the timelines for registering and the levy should be brought forward by one year.  The onus should be put on the owner of a site to register rather than the local authority having to seek out the owner.  The same principle was used with the local property tax.  I cannot understand why it cannot be used for sites.  I can guarantee local authorities will struggle to find all vacant sites.  Accordingly, the onus should be on the owners to register.</p></speech>

In particular, measures such as the vacant site levy must be introduced in line with the principles of fair procedures and administration.  In this regard, the Bill provides the timeframe for key actions by the planning authority in the implementation of the levy.</p> <p>  Adequate time needs to be given for lead-in for such legislation and for due process.  Realistically, the local authorities need time to study their respective urban areas.  It should be noted once this Bill is passed, they can commence with identifying candidate sites.  That in itself will send a strong signal to the owners of these sites that they need to get their houses in order and need to start preparing plans.  There are already positive signs of what is in the pipeline.  For the first quarter of this year, planning applications are up 30% on last year.  We need to see more of that, preferably in our towns and cities and urban sites.  We need to exploit the public services that already exist.  Deputy Catherine Murphy explained this about transport, public sewerage and water systems, broadband and so forth.  We have sites that can be brought back into beneficial use.  The whole thrust of the vacant site levy is to stimulate that.</p></speech>

What is a vacant site?  If I put a car park on more than half a site, does that mean it is no longer vacant?  It is a dangerous path to go down.  If I buy a development site with the intention of putting housing on it at some point but put it to an alternative use in the meantime, that does not escape the fact that I am land-banking and should be paying tax on it.</p></speech>

These are the criteria that give teeth to the whole Bill.  It would be a mistake to delete them.</p> <p>  In any process, Deputies will agree, we should have an appeals mechanism.  Otherwise, we are opening ourselves up to the risk of legal challenge.  This section in the Bill is intended to further elaborate and strengthen the definition of a vacant site consisting of residential land in section 5.  It provides clarity and justification for the identification of vacant sites and the provision of housing on such sites in areas where there is a housing need.  The removal of this provision, as proposed in this amendment, would diminish the legislation.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace also mentioned this earlier.  Such a proposal would be in contravention of the principle of fair procedures and administration for such measures, which I have already referred to.  The provisions of the Bill were drafted taking account of these principles, particularly the timeframes and procedures involved, to ensure that they are fair and proportionate.</p> <p>  The Bill provides that the planning authority is responsible for administering the levy provisions in their functional areas by establishing and maintaining the vacant site register and identifying vacant sites consisting of residential or regeneration land on the basis of the criteria outlined in sections 5 and 6, and applying the levy charge as appropriate.  It could not be expected, nor is it likely, that individual site owners would be able to undertake the consideration of their own sites and determine whether or not they are vacant in accordance with the criteria set out in the Bill.  It is the planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, that is in the best position to make this determination.</p> <p>  On that basis, we oppose amendment No. 10.</p></speech>

It is important in a measure such as this that clear and fair appeals mechanisms are in place.  In this case, the proposed amendment removes, in summary, the following provisions: the burden of proof on the owner to show that the site was not vacant; the power of the board to determine that a site is not vacant and direct that it be removed from the register; and that the entry of a site on the register will not take place until an appeal is determined.  These are fundamental provisions of the appeals process against the entry of a site on the register.  It elaborates on how the appeal mechanism will work in practice, and without them it would not function.</p></speech>

Buying development land with hard cash is unusual.  It does not really happen.  Most sites that are bought for land-banking will be mortgaged.  This legislation gives them a way out by saying they only have to pay half of the levy if there is a 50% mortgage on it, or three quarters if 75% of it is mortgaged.  That is a ridiculous idea.  All this stuff is mortgaged to the hilt.  No one in their right mind would buy a site with cash.</p></speech>

It ring-fences the proceeds to be solely used for the provision of housing on the residential land on which the vacant site is situated or for the development and renewal of the regeneration land on which the site is situated.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 provide for an amendment to subsections (1)(<i>a</i>) and (1)(<i>b</i>) to provide greater clarity on how the planning authority may use the proceeds of the levy.  The current wording of the provision stipulates that the levy proceeds may only be used on the vacant site on which the levy is being applied.  On further consideration and rereading of the provision, this would be an overly restrictive and impractical approach for a local authority.  Accordingly, the amendments revise the wording of these subsections to provide that the proceeds may be used for the provision of housing on residential land in the vicinity of the site or the development and renewal of regeneration land in the vicinity of the site.  This gives the planning authority wider scope in the use of the levy proceeds, thereby providing greater benefit to the overall local area in which vacant sites are located.  These amendments are a necessary revision to the text of the Bill so as to enable the planning authority to use the levy proceeds in a more appropriate and beneficial way.</p></speech>

There is a link between this amendment and some of the others that I have tabled.  My problem with it is that there is too much reliance on the private sector generally in the Government's approach to dealing with the housing crisis.  This Bill is the working out of that logic, in that it asserts that the only way we will get the social and affordable housing that we need is by constantly incentivising, getting down on our knees and begging private developers to provide it for us.  I do not agree with this approach.  It will not deliver the volume of social and affordable housing that we need.</p> <p>  My concerns in this regard are increased by the fact that the Government is going to provide a further large get-out clause on the 10%, in that developers can lease property back to local authorities, which is a matter that subsequent amendments will address.  The combined effect of these two provisions is to let developers off the hook completely, leaving local authorities with nothing.  They will not get 20% or even 10%, but 10% leased back, which means that they will get nothing.  I do not agree with the logic behind these provisions.</p></speech>

If the State ring-fenced 10% of property as social and affordable housing and there was zero chance of a developer getting out of that obligation, I would agree with the 10% level.  Currently, one cannot get financing from a bank if one owns a site but has to cough up 20% of it.</p> <p>  Part V was a failure because we let it be so.  Ghettoisation has continued unabated because we have allowed it to happen.  If the Government cut the level from 20% to 10%, I would agree so long as no site could escape the social and affordable housing requirement.  Last summer, Kennedy Wilson received planning permission for more than 160 units at Clancy Barracks.  It told the council that it did not believe that the development was suitable for social housing.  It paid &euro;850,000 instead of providing property.  At 10%, that would have been 16 units.  The Government is doing away with allowing people to buy out of the obligation, but it will still allow them to debate how to sort out Part V.  Developers will have the opportunity to move the obligation off site and deliver the units elsewhere.  Doing away with the cash payment is a good idea, but the Government should not allow the units to be moved off site.  Be the site in Ballsbridge or Darndale, Part V must be applied.  If the site was in Darndale, we would be discussing affordable housing.  If it was in Ballsbridge, it should be social housing.  I would live with the 10% level provided that it was written in stone and there was no opportunity for developers to get out of it.</p> <p>  I do not know whether my next point relates to this section, but the Government is changing a rule.  There was a time when a builder had X weeks to revert to a planning section and sort out Part V.  As the Minister of State knows, though, sites were being commenced without Part V having been sorted.  That the Government is changing this situation is a plus, as builders will not be allowed to start until Part V has been sorted.  If the Government wrote the 10% figure in stone and made it part of the planning conditions, there would be no need for a debate after permission had been granted and the builder could not start until he or she had agreed to fulfil these conditions.  There would be no need for a further meeting.  It would do away with this problem.</p></speech>

This will be important.</p><p>Due to the lack of supply, there is a need to build public housing on a large scale, as I do not see how we will provide houses if we do not build them.<br/><br/>I completely agree that a get out clause will always be problematic.  Developers are always looking to find a way out of their obligation to provide social and affordable housing.  It tends to be in areas such as the Ailesbury Road area that they will seek to do that.<br/><br/><b></b>Some local authorities agreed prices in advance of the obligations under Part V commencing while others agreed prices afterwards.  The State got very badly burned when the price was agreed in a rising market.  That aspect has to be fully nailed down because it gives rise to a very costly problem and reduces the number of units the local authority will get.</p></speech>

We cannot meet the housing demand by direct build only, as put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I can guarantee that should he be appointed Minister in the morning, and with the best of intentions which I know he has, he would not deliver the number of houses we need to meet the current demand with direct build on local authority lands.  We are already greenlighting and approving shovel ready projects that local authorities are proposing but there is a time lag in delivering on them.  We must take a multifaceted approach to delivering housing.  In the first instance, we have turned around many vacant houses, by providing extra funding to local authorities.  We were rightly criticised for allowing these houses to remain vacant.  In the past year, we have brought back into beneficial use more than 2,300 houses that were lying vacant and boarded up.  Families are now in those houses.  We have also provided additional funding this year for an additional 1,000 vacant houses in our existing stock to be brought into use.  This has been our priority.  We have also, as Deputies know, allocated funds for the first phase of direct build of local authority houses and there will be a second phase announced in the coming month or so.  We will also be announcing additional funds for the approved housing bodies.  These are for new capital build projects that are in the pipeline.  </p> <p>  I do not believe in throwing the baby out with the bath water.  By saying there is an over-reliance on the private sector providing houses, we are doing a disservice to the people on the housing list because we need the private sector to provide houses to meet the demand.  That is not an ideological position but the reality of the position we find ourselves in.  We are using all resources and all abilities to deliver houses.  Part V is an important element of that delivery in the private sector.  </p> <p>  I can understand the reasons Deputies oppose reducing the obligation from 20% to 10%.  As was stated, 20% of zero is zero.  There has been very little construction and we need to ask why that is the case.  There is a question mark on the economic viability of building again because, to be quite candid, it is cheaper to buy houses than to build them in some areas.  Deputy Wallace knows that as do I and Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Until the market normalises to some degree and until we address viability, we will not get the type of housing construction that we want.</p> <p>  We must try to incentivise construction by assisting the economic viability of building.  We have agreed to reduce the 20% obligation to 10% but it is not all one way traffic for the developer.  We have removed, as some Deputies have said, the flexibility that existed in the past to pay cash in lieu of houses.  We want housing units and that has been clearly stated in this Bill.  We have gone a step further.  We are strengthening the process because we are front-loading the agreement and the negotiation on Part V.  As Deputy Wallace has said, there now can be no commencement notice unless that agreement is in place as part of the planning conditions.  We are strengthening the Part V process to ensure that we deliver more units for the people who need them.  This is a critical element of the social housing strategy.  It is a multifaceted approach and this is just one element of it.  We need to see housing units being developed and construction projects starting.  We believe the Government's approach is reasonable and will assist in that area. We will oppose the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

We are pushed into the hands of PPPs where the money costs about 15%.  That is just lunacy.  I think the Government would have more of an appetite for building more State housing on land that is available if one were allowed to borrow money to invest in infrastructure at a market rate rather than being pushed into the hands of PPPs.</p></speech>

I put this amendment forward out of genuine concern and desire to have a serious debate on the issue.  I remain open to hearing the arguments but I wanted to put it down because this is a central component of the Bill and I will consider it as we go along.  Essentially, I want to reserve the right to re-enter it on Report Stage, depending on what I hear in the discussions that I might have with people who are concerned about this issue between now and then.</p> <p>  On the question of how much can we directly deliver, which, as the Minister of State indicated, is my favourite approach, I accept that some has to come from the private sector as well but we are not exploring fully the potential for direct build.  I was at a briefing by TASC recently and it was pointed out that apparently - I cannot give the exact title, but I can get it - there is some provision for about &euro;1 billion which one can get off balance sheet in the European Union for infrastructural projects where one can show it is infrastructural expenditure.  Such expenditure will not be put on the balance sheet.  I also believe from discussions we had on this subject with the Fiscal Advisory Council a week or two ago that a serious debate is opening up about structural deficits, what should be included in them and the degree to which capital expenditure should be included in them.  There is much debate on what should be considered a structural deficit and there are different interpretations of it.  However, there is a debate opening up in the European Union that endorses the view that capital expenditure of this sort should not be included in the structural deficit.  We need to wade in big time behind that argument.  It follows what Deputy Wallace has just said.  This is a no-brainer.  It is guaranteed saving of money that is currently being wasted on rent allowance and so on.</p><p>One needs upfront capital but in the long term, there is a guaranteed saving and benefit to the State.  We need to strongly make that case and to proceed in that direction and be much more ambitious in doing so.</p><p> I will now deal with the provisions under Part V for social and affordable housing.  There is a large site in my area, namely, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire golf club.  As Deputy Murphy said, prior to the boom, some developers were burned by the Part V provisions because they had done the deal and paid extortionate prices to meet their 20% obligation.  However, should this Bill be enacted, the developer who was bailed out by NAMA, and is probably still in NAMA, will be required to deliver 10% of the land for social and affordable housing in the second phase of this development.  I consider that completely unacceptable, particularly when the developer was bailed out by NAMA.  </p><p> At this point, things are on the floor in terms of the number of houses being constructed but let us remember that we will head upwards, although never to the mad levels of building 80,000 to 90,000 houses a year.  When the market normalises, with the construction of between 30,000 to 50,000 houses per annum, and the hope is that the sector will head in that direction, I would hate to think that when more houses are being built, we will not get the necessary social and affordable housing to ensure we have a social mix.</p></speech>

There is a myth among the general public that local authorities were given up to 20% of the land zoned for residential use.  I know that it was quite common for it to range from 17% to 18% but the local authorities had to buy the houses.  In some cases, the developers and builders used low grade material in the social and affordable houses, with some of them leaving a lot to be desired.  However, other developers built houses that ranged from okay to very good.</p> <p>  I am at a loss to understand the reason we are reducing it from 20% to 10%.  There is a growing need for affordable housing, particularly in the cities and larger towns.  The previous Government has been criticised, and it may have deserved criticism for some things, but the figures as set out show what was built under the social and affordable housing scheme each year.  Many people who otherwise would not be able to buy a home were able to buy a home under this scheme.  I think it is a retrograde step to halve it to 10%.</p> <p>  The provision in this Bill is that the development has to be a minimum of ten houses - in other words, the local authority will be able to buy one in ten whereas in the past, the local authority had the option to buy one house in five and often had the same option when four houses were built.  I think the reduction to 10% is a retrograde step.  I am at a loss to know the reason for this.  Has the need for affordable evaporated?  </p> <p>  I am aware there are parts of the country where one can buy a house cheaper than any local authority could provide a house, especially in more rural areas, where there is no demand for housing and the ghosts estates are lying idle.  Even in County Laois, I can see parts of the county where it would be hard to give houses away but in other parts of the county, there is a high demand and prices are starting to outstrip what people who are earning reasonably good wages in steady jobs can borrow.  We must look again at the provision of affordable housing and bring it up to 20% in the first instance</p></speech>

There was a major flaw in the old system.  If a builder bought a site to build 50 units and paid &euro;100,000 a unit, under the current Part V provisions, he had to provide 20% of the site for social and affordable housing and accept a payment for the site at the agricultural value of the land and a payment of his costs plus 15% for the house.  Paying a builder &euro;1,000 for a site that he had paid &euro;100,000 for made the scheme unbankable for many developers.  It did not work.</p> <p>  I do not know how the Minister of State proposes to handle the site value.  However, for the system to work, a reasonable system has to be put in place to deal with the site value or it will be impossible for developers to deliver on it.</p></speech>

Ten years ago, nobody could have foreseen the extent of the collapse in the economy and in the property sector.  We are looking into the future and looking at this provision in a very fixed way.  I looked for a sunset clause so there would be at the very least the prospect of a review.  We do not know what things will be like in two or three  years time.  I do not think we should have to come back to amend the legislation.  A review should be built into the legislation. </p></speech>

We are also sacrificing the sort of balance, in terms of social mix, we should get.  I want to signal a point that we will come to later.  A very substantial get out clause is the lease back alternative.  Deputy Wallace mentioned the cost of the land but the lease back arrangement is a significant get out clause.   </p></speech>

Let me assure Deputies that we share their ambition to deliver as many houses as possible to address the housing need.  We might not agree on how we will do it but the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly and I are adamant that we focus our attention on trying to find ways to leverage more houses to meet the needs of society.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the genuine concerns of members but we have to come up with solutions on the best way that we can deliver houses as early as possible.  The Part V provision is one way of doing that and we feel our approach is balanced, strengthens and ring-fences the 10% and ensures there is no payment of cash in lieu of houses, as was previously possible.  We are making serious interventions to strengthen the Part V process to ensure that we get units and not cash or other alternatives.  </p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett remarked about funding of &euro;1 billion being available off-balance sheet.  I am not aware of that, but I am aware that the approved housing bodies, for which we want to see an enhanced role, have the capability and the capacity to raise funds off-balance sheet.  We want to see them coming forward with proposals to the Department so that we can work with them and the local authorities to deliver more units.  That is another mechanism of delivering housing distinct from Part V.  </p> <p>  We are also considering alternative proposals as part of our social housing strategy.  We want to find ways to leverage off-balance sheet funding to put it into capital projects.  Ultimately, the delivery of a house from the concept through the planning, tendering and construction stages is an equation.</p><p>It is an equation, which must take into account the viability of a construction project.  Unfortunately, the market has not normalised just yet because there are still properties for sale out there for prices far below what it would cost to build them.  They are working through the system.  Deputy Stanley raised the idea of local authorities purchasing them.  We are approving local authorities to purchase houses directly where there is value for money and where there is a strong housing demand.  They are being approved all over the country as we speak.  However, we need to be careful that we are not soaking up all the houses that are available to young couples who require houses.  There is a balance to be struck in how we approach that.</p><p> The Part V we are now proposing to the committee can deliver the units we require in a more advantageous way than the 20%, with its loose ends and all that went with it, achieved previously.  We will be opposing this amendment on that basis.  I will discuss the leasing and the other rental agreements in the next phase of discussion.  I think we will be coming to those in the amendments.</p></speech>

They understand there is a permanency about those units being delivered, but they are not going to be long-leased.  Some elements of the housing programme are about long-leasing existing properties in the private rental sector.  The concern relates to some of the Part V requirement being satisfied by a long-leasing arrangement, as opposed to permanent ownership of the housing by the local authorities.  At the moment local authorities are out looking to purchase homes for people.  The problem is that we could end up doing exactly the same thing in 20 years time to replace houses that have been occupied by people under this scheme.  That is a serious concern.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the housing associations.  I know of some very good examples and some very poor examples of housing associations, but the bigger housing associations tend to be the better ones.  When we had Dr. Michelle Norris in here talking to us about that, she said there was money available from the European Investment Bank<font color="#FF0000"> </font>for housing associations, but there was one proviso that she and others made, namely, that they are set up as charities and are precluded by law from undertaking a project that would ensure they ended up with a loss.  They require some level of co-responsibility in terms of leveraging that fund from the investment bank.  We cannot criticise or blame them if we do not give them the wherewithal to do that, and I have not seen any legislation to change that scenario since they were in here.  We were told there was no shortage of money to be leveraged from the European Investment Bank, within reason, for that purpose.  It is important that the Minister of State respond to that and say that is out there and they could do something.  They can only do something if they are given the ability to do it by a change in the Government's approach to co-responsibility.</p><p>Deputies Wallace and Boyd Barrett have put forward some of these amendments in my name.</p></speech>

In other words, firms, companies and voluntary housing agencies or groups around the country that embark on such projects are exempt from the 10% requirement because they face difficulties in acquiring sites and in providing this accommodation.  They free up a great deal of housing because older people like to trade down and move into sheltered housing or housing that provides medical or care facilities.  I am just giving notice that I will introduce this amendment on Report Stage.  That would be one part of the amendment.  The second part would be to clearly indicate or identify what we mean by "integrated retirement scheme", that they would be developments located within a range of communal services and where nursing or medical care would be provided.  In that instance, we would be asking the Minister to drop the requirement for 10% to be social housing.</p></speech>

Whether it is one house in four or five or one in nine or ten will depend on whether the requirement is for 20% or 10% social housing.  As I said already, if I were guaranteed that the 10% requirement was ring-fenced and could never be got out of by anybody, I would agree to the ability of the local authority to acquire one house in nine or ten being reduced to one house in four or five because one cannot take half of a house.</p> <p>  Second, I agree with Deputy Murphy.  The ask of the housing bodies is very big.  The Government is probably expecting a bit much from them.</p></speech>

We do not get permanent social housing, we get property that is being leased by the developer.  In effect, this is a way out of even the 10% requirement.  They get 90% at full-market profitability for themselves and then they can lease the other 10% at market rates.  Given market rates at the moment, that is a recipe for sucking local authorities dry.  The money continues to pour out from the public sector to the private sector, but we do not even get something permanent to call our own social housing.  I consider this an unacceptable, major get-out clause, which could store up significant costs for the public and the taxpayer, where the public coffers get sucked dry.  It would be like rent allowance, but on a massive scale, sucking the local authorities dry.</p> <p>  The other one in this series of amendments relates to the idea that the price paid by the local authority for the 10% social housing should include a profit on the normal construction and development costs calculated at open market rates.  I have a big problem with that.  We are even including profit on the 10%.</p><p>They are making profit on the 90%.  Is that not enough for them?  We should get the 10% at cost price.</p></speech>

It completely stands the original intention on its head.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that the previous Part V was not everything it could have been.  It was not wild and wonderful.  There were flaws in the system.  However, the leasing arrangement will cause many problems, including in estate management.  If the number of rented houses in a development is too high, in particular if they are leased privately, then the chemistry is different than if one is renting from a local authority in the sense that the local authority owns the house, which leads to a sense of permanency.  People see it as their house.</p> <p>  Last week I spoke about the fact that I live in an estate that has Part V housing, both affordable and social housing, mixed in with private housing.  People on one side of me are council tenants and people on the other side own their house.  There is no difference.  It is all the one, in the sense that everyone looks after the house in the very same way.  The housing mix can work when it is done right and social and affordable houses are dispersed properly.  The problem with leasing is that one will get a glut of apartments or low-grade housing in one corner.  When prices begin to rise again unscrupulous developers will shove social housing into one corner.  Some day when the Minister of State is in Portlaoise I will show him some bad examples of where that has happened already.  It will be possible to develop a low standard of apartment or houses of the minimum size and to lease them to local authorities that do not have any other way of getting housing and they will put people into them.  That will create another ghetto situation.</p> <p>  In the long term the approach will provide very poor value.  I accept that a balancing act is required and that all the housing that is required cannot be pulled out of the air tomorrow morning.  Leasing for a long period will ensue and tenants will pay the differential rent.  I understand there will be a gap in that regard.  When a house is owned by a local authority the rent goes directly into its coffers.  That adds up very well on the balance sheet in the local authorities with which I am familiar in terms of what comes in in rent and what is spent on maintenance and paying off the capital.  It is a good investment in the long term which works out reasonably well for local authorities.  At the end of ten, 20 or 30 years if a tenant decides to buy the property then the local authority will get another pot of money following the purchase.  Such an approach is better in the long term and it creates better, more stable communities.  There is an inherent problem with leasing.  I read in the newspapers about what the Tories are doing in England.  They are paying people in local authority houses in London to move out to private rented accommodation in the shires.  Their intention is to sell off local authority housing.  I accept that is not what the Government is doing but it is a slippery slope.  An income stream is not being created for local authorities.  A noose is being put around their necks.  Local authorities will pick up the bill for the situation in years to come, as well as the communities where stability is lacking.</p> <p>  The Minister is not going in the right direction.  The previous Part V arrangement dispersed social and affordable housing in the community and provided for permanency for local authority tenants and people buying their homes under the affordable housing schemes.  Such an approach consolidated the community and it worked very well.</p></speech>

I accept the grouping of amendments covers a range of areas.  I will try to address some of the issues raised.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy inquired about how the European Investment Bank could assist and fund social housing.  Some approved housing bodies already have the structures and capacity in place.  They have proven they can raise funds via the European Investment Bank through the Housing Finance Agency.  We have examples of that where some projects in this country have been funded for the first time this year through the European Investment Bank.  It is our ambition to see many more follow that.  Deputy Murphy is correct in one regard, namely, that we need some level of regulation of the approved housing bodies in order that they can prove they have the structure and capacity to raise funds in this way.  In order to address the matter, the Government intends to introduce an approved housing body regulation Bill in the autumn.  That will provide an opportunity to bring the stakeholders together and to hear all their views and to advance the cause and need for housing bodies in order that they can access funding to deliver more houses.</p> <p>  If I understood him correctly, Deputy Coonan inquired about exempting retirement housing schemes from Part V and other such schemes.  It is not the intention at the moment to exempt them.  That is not being considered at this stage.  I could give the Deputy some more information on the plan in that regard if he so wishes.</p> <p>  On the concerns expressed about leasing and rental agreements, the intention is that leasing and rental agreements would give options to local authorities in negotiating Part V agreements.  They offer a number of advantages which I will try to spell out for the committee.  The overarching policy objectives set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 place a considerable emphasis on a tenure mix and the use of the private rental sector as a means of meeting the social housing needs of society.  I have already explained that there is no one solution to the demand that exists.  The private sector has a strong role to play in meeting the urgent demand we face at the moment.  Therefore, the strategy envisages a stronger partnership approach between local authorities, approved housing bodies and the private sector, which the concept of long-term leasing supports.  Furthermore, the strategy envisages a front-loading of capital investment in the early stages of implementation with a greater shift to current funding over the longer term.  The intention is essentially to front-load funding into the early delivery of housing.</p> <p>  Local authorities do require flexible options for the delivery of social housing and to be able to respond to the local need and local context.  This flexibility must be balanced with the need to ensure that as many permanent social housing units as possible are achieved with the financial resources that are available.  To reassure Deputies, in order to achieve such a balance, it is my intention to issue a ministerial policy directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 directing local authorities to the effect that where capital funding is available they should enter Part V agreements for the acquisition of social housing units, as the Deputy stated, rather than entering into a leasing arrangement.  Furthermore, where leases are being agreed they should be for a specified minimum period.  That will ensure the potential of Part V to deliver completed social housing units into the ownership and social housing stock of local authorities is maximised.  I hope Deputies will understand the intent of having flexibility for local authorities to negotiate in accordance with the resources available to them.  The Deputy can rest assured that the directive we will issue will prioritise the acquisition of such units over leasing, but we must have a realistic approach and that where we can get more units in addition to direct acquisition we will use the leasing and long-term rental process to achieve those extra units.  Essentially, we are not ruling out any mechanism that is available to us to secure more units.  That should be welcomed in general.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution on amendment No. 28 and Part V, in terms of profit, we will not accept the amendment for the following reasons.  It is accepted that there has been much difficulty with Part V agreements in the past.  Deputies have already spoken about the complexity of the legislation, which has been reflected in the number of court actions taken in the past.  We need to learn from that.  The proposed amendments to Part V are an opportunity to provide some clarity in the operation of the legislation and could ultimately save millions of euro while reducing time spent on negotiations, the engagement of professionals such as quantity surveyors and legal advisers in court proceedings.  We believe that by bringing certainty and streamlining the process, as proposed, we will eradicate much of the lost revenues and costs associated with difficult Part V negotiations in the past.</p> <p>  Section 33(1)(c) substitutes section 96(3)(d) of the principal Act and provides that where houses are to be transferred as part of an agreement, the price of the houses shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of the land and the costs which would be incurred by a planning authority had it retained an independent builder to undertake the work on its behalf.</p><p>The price an independent builder would command in the marketplace would ordinarily include provision for profits.  Section 33(1)(<i>c</i>) should bring clarity on the costs to be considered as a basis for calculating the price of housing units to be transferred under Part V.  The amendment takes account of relevant court judgments and practical difficulties reported in the operation of Part V.  The inclusion of &quot;profit&quot; on these costs is consistent with the existing provision, and there is no change in the policy proposed.  Court judgments do not appear to point to any deficiencies in this regard.</p></speech>

Many local authorities have lost some of the staff that would have been on temporary contracts and so on.  When developers are coming in and negotiating, there is a particular skillset that is not always available at local authority level.  The Minister might give us some assurances that there would be a beefing up of that expertise, particularly when it comes to negotiating rental agreements.  I am not at all happy that the Part V mechanism will not be indefinitely in the ownership of the local authority; I do not want to give the wrong impression in that regard.  However, should the Minister find a local authority in that position, where it is dealing with an experienced negotiator, and the construction industry is not short of an ability to lobby to ensure its own interests are properly served, it will be critically important in terms of the delivery mechanism that there is both expertise and an adequate number of staff to deal with that in an efficient way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-30a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015063000002#O00300"><p>The Minister is saying that, in general, where the capital is available local authorities will be encouraged to acquire rather than lease, but that creates a major slippery slope.  I suspect this provision will mean that the bulk of the 10% will end up being leased, and the Minister has not convinced me so far that this will not be the case.</p> <p>  On the profit issue, we know there has been a major problem in terms of negotiating about the price.  I do not understand why it is not sufficient that they make profit on the 90%.  It does not cost them anything but there is an obligation to give us cost price on the 10%.  That is an entirely reasonable question to ask.</p> <p>  I raise a somewhat related matter so that I can raise it on Report Stage.  Has the Minister thought about including a reference in the Bill to the local authorities having the money to buy existing property of individual units when it goes on the market?  A case arose recently in my area where a landlord is having to sell and evict their tenant.  However, the landlord does not want to evict the tenant and has asked the local authority to buy the house and allow the tenant to stay, and the local authority said it does not have the money.  In those instances, and there may be quite a few of them - we know this is happening - there should be some way that we can tell the local authority to buy the house.  This particular landlord is saying they will sell it to the local authority at a discount rate because they do not want to see this person on the street.  That is an acquisition area where we could get permanent social housing and save people being made homeless if local authorities are given the approval and the money to do so.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that, in the past, there were very difficult negotiations and complex court cases.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that, to be fair, local authorities have been denuded of many experienced staff in recent years.  In terms of addressing that, where local authorities are making proposals they can stand over, we are allocating resources to both housing and planning departments.  I can report to the Deputy that over 300 additional staff have been allocated throughout the country in recent months to the very departments she mentioned.</p> <p>  To support the local authorities and the staff, we will be issuing strong revised Part V guidelines on negotiating agreements.  Also, this Bill, in its own right, will ensure that we have closer collaboration and co-ordination between housing departments and planning departments in local authorities because from a planning point of view this Bill demands that a housing assessment is done in an area before vacant sites, for example, are designated.  There has to be close co-ordination, and that is the way it should be because the Deputy and I, and anyone who has been in public life, knows that sometimes housing departments did not make good decisions in terms of where they built houses.  They did not look at sustainable planning, and we did not have that close co-operation that was needed.  This Bill in itself will ensure that we have closer collaboration.  I put the challenge to local authorities that their strategic policy committees, SPCs, which will have an enhanced role, the housing SPCs and the planning SPCs, should make a joint effort in terms of how they will respond to the housing and regeneration challenge we face.  There are opportunities for local authorities in this Bill because it brings a new focus, resource and direction in terms of the way we will respond to the challenge we all agree exists.</p> <p>  I do not have much to add in terms of the profits scenario referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I have outlined the position and it is on the record.  We need to protect the options available to local authorities to ensure they deliver as many units as possible.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the Department is open to proposals for single units.  We are already doing that.  Where local authorities have identified single units and put them on their priority list, and if there is value for money in it and it meets their housing needs, they are being approved for that throughout the country.  As the year goes on, we will be able to give the Deputy more detail on that by way of parliamentary questions and so on.  We are open to that, but it must come from the local authority as a priority.  Essentially, it is the housing authority that is responsible.  </p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I have an open mind on various mechanisms that can deliver houses, be they private or public, to meet the current need and this Bill is targeted at that in terms of the approach.</p></speech>

I presume that, in order to accommodate that, the number of units will have to be reduced from nine to four.

Section 36 provides that the exemption from the Part V provisions shall henceforth apply only to developments of nine units or fewer.

This ensures, for example, that one social housing unit in a development of ten units - 10% of the total number of units - must be provided for social housing.  Section 36 amends section 97 of the Principal Act to provide for greater exemption from the Part V provisions.  This amendment aims to ensure that small or less dense housing developments are not excessively burdened.  We all agree that more housing units need to be delivered.</p></speech>

The amendment confirms that section 31 applies to dwellings that are the subject of financial support under the new housing assistance payment, otherwise known as the HAP scheme, as well as to dwellings owned by a housing authority and dwellings leased or contracted by a housing authority, including rental accommodation scheme dwellings.</p><p>Subsection 2 of section 31 already provides that a reference to rent in section 31 includes a reference to the rent contribution payable to a housing authority by a housing assistance payment beneficiary.  Furthermore, under subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) of section 31, the Minister may prescribe the rent contribution payable by a HAP beneficiary during the limited transitional period for local authority rents that follows the introduction of rent charging under section 31.  The amendment is proposed to remove any possible doubt that section 31 of the 2009 Act applies to dwellings in respect of which HAP is being provided.</p><p>Amendment No. 38 is a technical amendment, consequential on amendment No. 32, which amends the Long Title of the Bill.</p></speech>

If 12 months is too short I could accept that, but there needs to be an ongoing review because in two or three years' time we could see quite a difference.  Who is to know?  It will encourage people to engage at an earlier stage if there is a question over whether the 10% provision under Part V is permanent and whether there is a prospect of its increasing after four or five years.

I believe Deputies sometimes put forward these review clauses just for the sake of tabling an amendment, so that they can say they said something about a Bill, but in this case there is a real argument for it because the housing market is completely fluid, volatile and subject to constant change.  We have debated and disputed the arguments here but we do not know what is actually going to happen.  The Minister of State could be right or he could be wrong, and that is a very good reason to review the provision on a regular basis.  We need to get the result we want from this legislation and to look regularly at the changes to the percentage, from 10% to 20% or even to 15%, as has been suggested as a compromise.  We cannot fail in the spectacular and disastrous way we failed in the past, with multiple, awful consequences.  This amendment would force us to come back and review the provisions after a relatively short period.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that we cannot fail this time and we need to learn from the mistakes of the past.  That is why we need to refocus our resources and our attention on urban regeneration, where the need is and where services are available.  We are introducing legislative changes, including those in this Bill, to reform the planning sector for the better, so that we do not have urban sprawl and unsustainable development of greenfield sites.  We are developing new planning legislation for the autumn so that we have a proper alignment of planning policies, from local to regional to national.  We will be introducing a planning regulator and a lot of things to streamline the process and ensure we have sustainable planning in the future, so that we do not go back to the problems of the past.</p><p>In addition, and for the first time, the Housing Agency is conducting detailed research and analysis to inform public policy.  We are not letting it happen <i>ad hoc </i>as happened in the past.  We are utilising real data, demographics, populations, where the demand is to inform us as to where infrastructure should be prioritised in order that we do not fail as in the past.  Many things are being done on those fronts.  <br/><br/>Returning to Part V and the need for review, I agree those provisions should be kept under constant review.  However, I do not believe there is a need for a sunset clause defined in the legislation.  The amendments to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, being introduced by the Bill, represent concrete Government action to implement the changes required on foot of the published findings of a comprehensive review that has already taken place involving an extensive public consultation process on the operation of Part V.  We have already had a detailed review initiated by this Government, undertaken by the Housing Agency and informed by public consultation, which Deputies should welcome.  I will not rule out similar reviews being conducted in the future.  The points made by Deputies are well made.  If further reviews are required they will take place.  I wish to inform Deputies that my Department routinely collects, monitors and publishes data provided by local authorities in connection with Part V and will continue to review and evaluate its success and, if necessary, we can come back for further debate.  However, it is not considered necessary at this stage to introduce a sunset clause to the legislation and, therefore, the amendment is not being accepted.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Michael Moynihan, Patrick O'Donovan and Se&aacute;n Kenny and Senator Ned O'Sullivan.</p> <p>  Today's agenda is a meeting with Mr. Gary Delaney of Loc8 regarding Eircode.  The purpose this afternoon's meeting is to engage with Mr. Delaney who is anxious that the committee would hear his views on certain elements of the new postcode system.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Gary Delaney of Loc8 Code.  Committee members have already received his presentation.</p><p>As we have to conclude our meeting by 2 p.m., I ask that Mr. Delaney confines his presentation to a maximum of ten minutes to allow time for engagement with the committee members.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any statements witnesses have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Mr. Delaney to make his presentation.</p></speech>

What I have to say is of particular relevance to the matter of the national postcodes, particularly the chosen system, Eircode.  I have spent many years in the positioning and navigation industries.  I worked for 35 years as a navigator and land surveyor, have relevant experience and qualifications in the field and am a fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation.  The whole idea of a postcode and how it may be used is, in effect, a navigation technology exercise.  The conduct of a service, product or person from A to B is about navigation.</p> <p>  Way back in 1997 and 1998, I developed a specific interest and completed a master's degree in co-ordinates systems and geo-coding systems.  I went on to consider how those could be applied to mapping and navigation systems in Ireland and abroad and, in 2005, began developing what I believed was an address code system for Ireland, Loc8Code.  I did not necessarily view it as a national postcode as that had never been delivered.  Since Loc8Code was delivered to the market in 2010, I have amassed a lot of experience in a coding system for addresses in Ireland.  This experience is also relevant to the committee's deliberations today.</p> <p>  I have prepared a very detailed analysis of Eircode, which members have in soft copy and which is also available to them in hard copy format.  It is a very technical document.  The subject merits this level of technicality; we are not just introducing a series of characters to define or identify properties, but are introducing a piece of national infrastructure, which needs careful attention.</p> <p>  Much has been made of the fact that An Post may use Eircode.  It is my opinion that An Post will not use it much, although it may tolerate it, because Eircode does not fit with An Post's operations.  If that is the case, we must focus on the other users, namely, the transport and logistics industries, emergency services and, particularly, the ordinary people, who have not been mentioned much.  If the people in the street do not use this coding system, it is not a postcode and will be relegated to history along with other technical projects with which Ireland has been involved over the years.</p> <p>  As it stands, Eircode gives the user no intelligence about the location of the property to be travelled to.  In fact, it has less capability than latitude and longitude, which have been around for hundreds of years and with which most people are now getting familiar.  </p> <p>  People migh</p> <p>t suggest that I am coming to this issue with a vested interest.</p><p>It is important that I draw the committee's attention to a report by the Global Address Data Association, GADA, in the US, which was circulated to members during the week.  I will not go into its detail but, effectively, it says that Eircode is not a postcode.  The detail of the discussion is an indictment of Eircode in terms of what it is supposed to do and can do, and the fact that it is not the technical new generation solution for a postcode that people have claimed it to be.</p><p> We must not forget that when we talk about the history of a national postcode, it dates back many years.  Essentially, the national postcode was about levelling the playing field in Ireland with postal liberalisation.  The postal market should not be referred to or thought of as just mail, because the front line in the postal market nowadays is parcels and other companies, including couriers, deliver parcels.  If it is the case that the postal market is liberalised, everybody should be able to equally and easily find addresses in Ireland.  Eircode was supposed to be about that.  If it is the case that people from various industries have stated, before this committee or in other interviews, that it does not do that, perhaps the field is not levelled.  In my opinion, if we have spent 13 years talking about this, there must be significant reasons that it did not happen.  It is quoted that, perhaps, An Post did not want it to happen.  That is on the public record.  A postcode has not been designed for 13 years; it has been designed only since January 2014 when the winning bidder, Capita, engaged directly with An Post to design the code.  The document which covers that is in the public domain.  It is the postcode design document which runs from January 2014 to May 2014, when it was published.  That consists of a consultation only with An Post.  There is no record in that document of consultation with other people.</p><p> That is the basis.  I will deal first with the issue of whether Eircode has legitimacy.  I will not go into all of the detail.  I have raised some topics in the analysis as to why Eircode might not have legitimacy, but one of the most significant is that Eircode does not conform with, or deliver, the definition of a postcode that is in the legislation, the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  I realise the Oireachtas is dealing with an amendment to that legislation at present, but we already have an Act which defines what a postcode in Ireland should be and Eircode does not fulfil that.  The definition requires the postcode to define a locality.  In other words, if I look at the code and I wish to go somewhere, that code automatically delivers to me the idea of where I am going.  When we are going somewhere, none of us visualises the exact destination.  We always visualise how we are going to get there and the areas we will pass through to get there.  That is navigation and it is how people operate.  That is the reason the definition says that the postcode should define a locality.  The design document for Eircode states very specifically that it will not define a locality.  An Post has requested that it would not define a locality because there would be unreasonable expectations about where people live and so forth.</p><p> I have documented in the analysis other reasons that Eircode may not have the legitimacy it should have, but in that regard alone it does not.  In fact, if one reads the definition, it becomes very clear that the method An Post uses for sorting at present, which is the post town model and which the High Court gave sanction for An Post to operate and use in 2012, better conforms with the legislation and the requirement.  In fact, if we go ahead with Eircode there might well be the possibility of two postcodes operating in Ireland, one which has legitimacy and High Court sanction and another that has no legitimacy.  If Eircode is to be used as a property identifier for property related taxes and so forth, it could easily be challenged.</p><p> Effectively, Eircode does not comply with the legislation, nor does it comply with all of the recommendations of the last national postcode board since 2006.</p><p>It does not conform with the tender documents.  It does not deliver something required by the ordinary Joe Soap user.  Citizens of Ireland and visitors to Ireland need to be able to look at a postcode and use it in a useful way.  Eircode has ignored all the prior knowledge about postcodes that existed in the world.  If I was going to design something, as I have done, the first thing I would do is look at what is there, take what is good from it and enhance it as necessary.  Any designer or anyone in business globally would do likewise.</p><p> In the document I have furnished to the joint committee, I refer specifically to the Northern Ireland postcode, which is part of the UK postcode.  If one looks at the two examples I have included in my submission - BT4 1PW and BT4 1PY - one might not know exactly where those locations are, but one will see immediately that they are close together.  One cannot make the same judgment when one looks at an Eircode because there is no indication of whether two postcode locations are close together.  This is a critical issue for ordinary users.  It is important that there is some intelligence in the code that tells us we were there before, or we will not have to go far from where we were previously.  Above all else, one should be able to use the free Excel spreadsheet software that is readily available to order postcodes in a rational sequence for delivery.</p></speech>

As I have said, Eircode does not deliver intuitive capability for ordinary people in Ireland.  It has been suggested that Eircode is a core requirement for mail.  I would argue that a national postcode should be about the widest breadth of national requirement.  There was a suggestion that the Eircode app would do for non-core matters.  It is well recognised that anything that depends totally on technology must have a fail-safe backup that can be used in a manual way, especially if it is being delivered by a state which has a responsibility to its people.  Eircode cannot be used in any manual way.</p> <p>  I will make one more point before I conclude, if the Chairman does not mind.  Much has been made of the fact that Ireland has non-unique addresses.  This is a concern mainly for people who operate address database lists.  The real problem in Ireland is ambiguous addresses.  It is a different problem and a much bigger one.  Everyone here has experienced the simple issue of standing in a busy street and not knowing which door is the right one.  There might not be numbers on the doors, or an upstairs apartment over a shop might not be identified.  The emergency services might be trying to reach someone who has collapsed and activated an alarm button.  Eircode does not resolve the big problem of ambiguous addresses.  It tries to rely on technology, including GPS, to resolve it.  As a GPS expert, I can tell the committee that in my world, we would not rely entirely on GPS because it has many limitations.  For example, it cannot and will not resolve the problems encountered in a busy city or town street or urban area, where there are upstairs and downstairs apartments and back and side entrances</p></speech>

I have been asking questions because I have concerns about a number of aspects of Eircode.  I have concerns about the cost of it and the value for money associated with it.  I believe the solution offered by Mr. Delaney was free.</p></speech>

It is arguable that Eircode does not satisfy any of them.  I refer to two in particular.  One is that national postcodes should be based on small spatial areas.  Loc8Code does this, but Eircode does not.  I referred to localities and the definition of a postcode in the Act.  In the design document, Eircode does not do that.</p> <p>  From my navigation background, I am conscious that a person travelling anywhere first visualises the localities through which he or she must drive to get there.  Those recommendations were picked up by the board and brought forward.  We knew we could address that.  We also knew we could address the idea that the code must be future-proofed and based on technology, while also being easy to use and not hidden.  The UK postcode system has survived for 50 years.  It has problems, and I am not recommending it, but I am taking ideas that work from it.  It has many features that work, such as the fact that anybody can look at it and intuitively guess that something is closer or further away.  </p> <p>  These are all things we build into Loc8Code, not just because they were recommended by the national postcode project board but because we, as navigation experts, recognised that humans needed to know them.  They also need to know such things when GPS or the mobile phone network is not working.  We have SOS phones on the side of motorways because it is recognised that phones do not always work when there is a disaster and the emergency services need to locate people.  </p> <p>  When the tender for the postcode started, it used the 2006 national postcode project board recommendations as the reference.  The recommendation to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resource from PA Consulting in the months before that were that it was to comply exactly with that.</p></speech>

Loc8Code designed a code that was intended to fulfil all those requirements and did so.  The difference between Loc8Code and Eircode is that Loc8Code is intuitive.</p><p>There are localities in it.  It certainly depends on GPS - that is my business and my background - but it does not require GPS to actually interpret it.  It can be iterated in the same way as the Northern Ireland postcode that I have given.  Eircode cannot.</p><p> The other issue about Eircode is that it is totally dependent on a database which must be kept up to date.  I have supported sat-navs in this market for nearly 15 years, so I know GPS and I know sat-navs very well.  I know also that people do not keep them up to date.  I dare say, if there are sat-nav owners in the committee, I could count, probably on one finger, the number of people who have ever taken the time to update them.  If one builds a postcode that is totally dependent on a database and in that database there are coding systems that can change and need to be updated on a regular basis, then if the sat-nav is not up to date or the GPS is not up to date, one cannot use it.  If over-the-air communications, Internet, or mobile phone networks are required to access that database, we know that a piece of national infrastructure has the potential to fall over in the event of a major emergency or disaster.  The major emergency could be just a major pile-up or a crash on a motorway where emergency services need to get to the right location and the right access points.</p><p> In terms of a deliverable, Loc8Code has much more to offer.  To be honest, I did not come here today to try to sell Loc8Code to the committee.  That was not my intention.</p></speech>

I want to conform with that request, although I hope that some other day we can talk about it, because there are particular issues with it, but that is not what I am here to do.

None of my expertise or the expertise of people in the addressing business or in navigation or technology were used in the design of Eircode.

We quizzed the Department and other companies on this issue.  Two of points made as to why the Eircode system should be used were that it was more suitable for a country with a more rural base - that was my reading of it - and that the British system was not suitable because the way in which houses are clustered is different here.  I am not here to contradict anything because I do not have sufficient knowledge to do so.</p></speech>

The non-unique address issue is an issue for a database - for navigating or finding a way around the database.

That makes absolutely no sense.  Nobody but Capita, in the design document, looked for a sequential code in the first place.  In the design document in which Capita engages with An Post, it asks specifically whether the code should be sequential.</p><p>The reply from An Post was that it did not need it to be sequential because it delivers by local knowledge.  We now have a code that is random because An Post said it should not be sequential and the reasoning for that is that a house built in between two other houses would put the sequence out.  We deal with imperfect sequences every day of our lives.  It is a mild inconvenience.  To say that we would make something random, by which is meant it has no visual intelligence, purely because a sequence might be mildly out of sequence and a mild inconvenience makes a nonsense of the code.  It also means, incidentally, that we do not have localities, which should be in the code according to the legislation.</p></speech>

Like the Chairman, I have listened to all the evidence and I thank Mr. Delaney for the documents he sent us.  My concerns about this project grow every time I hear more detail at these meetings.  Supposing we do nothing - I know this has been through the tendering process and so on - the taxpayer saves &euro;27 million and An Post continues to deliver 98% of the post the next day.  Mr. Tom Carr, on behalf of his people, stated they do not want it and the safety sector stated it can find places where there are accidents, etc.  We have never had a proper cost-benefit analysis.  The national post code document that the Department sent us on 19 November last is not adequate.</p> <p>  All I can say at this stage is that there is a Government economics and evaluation service - the head of the oversight committee is Professor Frances Ruane whom we all know - and there should be an independent cost-benefit analysis done on the project.  I am worried that we are not getting independent advice in regard to issues raised with us, such as the Aer Lingus sale and whether electricity wires should be overhead or underground.  The advocates come in here and are all gung-ho to do the project.</p></speech>

We will definitely be using every element of the Eircode system in sorting letters, packages and parcels.

I could say to the committee right now that I will use Eircode because someone is giving it to me.  That is a use but it is not a meaningful use.  To put it into practice, in its hubs An Post sorts to delivery office level.  To sort manually to delivery office level, one would use the first three characters of Eircode, what they call the routing key.  There are 139 routing keys.  By the way, this information is only coming out.  It is not something that was delivered to everybody or to the committee.  This information is just being extracted.  There will be 139 routing keys, which are undefined areas.  They do not have actual boundaries.  They are decided by An Post on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis in the sense that if a postman is underworked in one area, he will operate an other area and that will get the routing key from the first area.</p><p>The Chairman just quoted the figure of 350 delivery offices.  How could we manually fix 139 routing keys to 350 delivery offices?</p></speech>

An Post, and the Minister in announcing this, were very quick to say that people would not have to use Eircode, and that is the reason.  It will continue to sort manually to the delivery offices based on the post towns.</p> <p>  To finish the point, once we get to the delivery office area, what is relevant is the last four characters.  Much has been made of the fact that those four characters are random.  How could any human interact with four random characters without reference to a computer?  Delivery offices are not automated.  To implement Eircode in those delivery offices, the sorting procedure would have to be automated, which would result in many closures and many job losses.</p></speech>

Even if this were a perfect system, it would achieve an improvement of only two percentage points, although no organisation operates at 100%.</p> <p>  In the context of the Chairman's earlier comment that we all recognised in 2011 that there had to be reform of the way we look at public expenditure, even though one of the referendums did not achieve the result we would have liked, it must be kept on the agenda.  If I am returned to the Oireachtas, I will certainly want a much stricter appraisal.  Projects should not get this far without one page of costs and one page of benefits being produced.</p> <p>  For what it is worth, I have heard that the real aim of this is to identify people claiming the dole under two names, but that has nothing to do with postcodes.  If the Minister for Social Protection wants to do that, she will go to a different committee of the Oireachtas.  It is reduced to that level, Chairman.  I cannot get any postal benefits.  We have heard from Tom Carr, the ambulance service people and so on, all of whom are iffy about it.  If it was free and somebody else paid the &euro;28 million, they might use it.</p></speech>

I know where a man lives in Clones, but I will be asking what the seven-digit code for Newtownbutler is, when it is only six or seven miles down the road.</p> <p>  The problem with the post is that the volumes are falling so rapidly.  I understand that the technology knows perfectly well, without numbers, that Belmullet is in Mayo and Bandon is in Cork.  It is doing that job already without the addition of the seven digits.  The people I admire are the postmen, who achieve the figure of 98% delivery every day they are at work.  What is this supposed to be doing, and what do we get for the &euro;27 million?  I cannot see that, after all the evidence to which the Chairman referred.</p></speech>

Senator Barrett mentioned Nightline.  When the Nightline representative presented here, he made a strong point about his concerns about implementation and also mentioned the idea of a pilot.  Every country in the world implementing a postcode system - Uganda, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates and so on - will do a pilot test first to ensure it has value.  John Tuohy of Nightline said that should happen.  No pilot is planned, so that is very worrying.  He also said in a separate interview that if it does not work out he can tweak it.  Tweaking a postcode is like tweaking the Luas red and green lines, with huge cost and inconvenience to many people afterwards, and will only result in Eircode not being used for any purpose.</p> <p>  There is a danger that we just accept this because it has got so far.  There is a history of documentation, and there are many statements.</p><p>At the end of the day one must look at Eircode.  We have very little information on it, but we can all look at an eircode and see that one gets no information from it.  I have provided a reference in annex A of my document.  It is of no use to anybody, including a postman.</p></speech>

If we tell every household in the country that their address has now changed to have seven characters of mixed digits and letters, it may be the last straw.  People will say, "What is this?  It is more madness."  I am afraid of that.  I certainly hope it is kicked to touch until after the election for that very reason.  There have to be benefits.  Of course all the guys who sat down with Mr. Delaney think it is wonderful, but I see none of the proof in the documents.  A lot of people do not think it is wonderful.  While the proponents have come in and made the case, I am not convinced and neither is the public.</p></speech>

Mr. Delaney mentioned GPS, which cannot be reliable at all times.  I was in the south west of Ireland last month looking for a particular location, but GPS was sending me in the wrong direction.  I met a young man who works for An Post in Clifden and we were talking about the new Eircode system coming in.  He said they will be depending on the postmen to clearly identify homes.  I asked him what he meant and he gave the example that in a small area in Clifden on the same street, we have John and Mary Quinns at four separate addresses.  I asked him how he knew which piece of mail was for a particular address and he said "Sure, after a while you kind of get to know their business and know which mail is for which address."  I asked him how he knew which of four ESB bills was for each address.  He said he did not but at least they go through.</p> <p>  Senator Barrett appears to be most concerned about the cost-benefit analysis and the &euro;27 million or so that is going in.  That is one particular issue.  This particular issue is about trying to identify whether this is the best code.  Mr. Delaney says it is not the best code.  Capita says it is.  The matter is with the Department.  It has been passed and is going through the various stages of procurement.  Addresses are not going to change.  I will still live, to use my parents' address, at 110 Cooley Road, Drimnagh, Dublin 12.  The Dublin 12 reference will not change and it might be D12XYZ.  The next door neighbour might be 112 Cooley Road, D12XYB.  Capita is telling us that this unique identifier in the last four digits is unique to each house.  As far as I am concerned, this is fantastic as it will eliminate the Mary and John Quinn times four issue in one area.  They will know that a particular Mary and John Quinn's unique identifier identifies their house.  The emergency services are saying this will be good for them.  An Post has said it will use it and there will be a cultural change in people's thinking about not using the address if they do not want to.  In the United States of America, where I used to live, the Zip code in Rye, New York, was 10580.  Philadelphia, 19085 is a locality that might have been three miles by three miles, but that code still does not identify an actual address on a particular street.  Capita tells us that this unique code will.  It is saying this is the first code in the world that will give us a unique identification.  The reason the codes are not going to be sequential is that it might be 400 to 500 yards from one house to another today but someone might build a house between them once the system is in place.  Therefore, they will have a unique four digit code at the end of it.  If Capita is telling us this will work, why does Mr. Delaney say it will not and that it is not future proof?</p></speech>

I respect what the Senator is saying because we all want to believe the people who have been awarded the contract to deliver this on our behalf.</p><p>We all want to believe the people who have been awarded a contract will deliver this on our behalf.  If it is the best, it would have been established.  Everywhere else in the world where a postcode is being introduced, the idea is tested and piloted.  This has not happened here.  The fact that it is the first of its type in the world would suggest that we should test it before we go to the bother of rolling it out and wasting not only &euro;27 million, but all the costs to all of the businesses, including An Post, and everyone else who wants to use it.  Potentially, this could be &euro;100 million out of the economy.  It is quite substantial.  I am in business and I am also in professional navigation.  If somebody tells me something is the best, the first thing I will do is test it.</p><p> Emergency services were mentioned.  In one of the annexes to the documentation I provided to the committee is a document from the director of the National Ambulance Service.  When people were sitting here stating they were behind it and supporting it, he wrote a letter to a private citizen, not me but an individual, stating he had never said it would do all that is required for rapid access to patients.  This is the direct opposite of what he was quoted as saying.  He also went on to say that he does not know enough about it to be able to talk about it in depth.  One would imagine if the director of a national agency supported something he would first investigate, test and analyse it and check its suitability for his or her purposes and for the public, because it is all about public safety.  If the director of the National Ambulance Service is saying he cannot speak about it in depth, perhaps he never had the chance.  I can tell the committee from other sources that neither the National Ambulance Service nor the fire service has ever tested or looked at Eircode in reality, as in a real-life scenario tested all the way through, which is what anybody would do if money was being spent on technology.</p><p> I accept if a business process outsourcing company such as Capita states it has the best in the world, we should believe it.  One would suspect the people who say this would have some technical knowledge but this is not the case.  There is no expertise on this in the organisation.  One would also ask the company to show where it has been tested.  An oversight contract was awarded to PA Consulting in April last year, and one of the requirements was that it would make a decision and assess whether Eircode was fit for purpose.  We have not heard this.  To do this, it would have to test and analyse it, but this never happened.  What is of concern is that we might roll it out and find it is not useful.  This should happen before we roll it out.</p></speech>

Surely with Eircode, if I put in D21 US4 as the unique identifier, the system will have to be built into GPS for GPS to accept it.

If they did at some point in the future, then the user would have to load a database.  That would be facilitated but, as I said earlier, loading a database and keeping it up to date is not something we are good at.  Garmin has locate code working, which can be used free in Ireland right now.  It is on the device.  It has been there for five years and it is tried, tested and proven.  I accept what the Senator said because that is what people expect but, unfortunately, with Eircode, that is not happening, and I could <i>in camera</i>tell the committee about the conversations I have had about Eircode, because I deal directly with Garmin and TomTom.<br/><br/>I was asked about the downsides.  In annex D, I have listed a selection of thousands of locations in Ireland that will have no Eircode.  They extend from farms, where there are many accidents nowadays that emergency services need to attend; forests, the entrances to which fire services need to access; outdoor sporting events; outdoor leisure activities, including festivals; and, for example, on a campus such as UCD, all of its properties except the one to which the mail is delivered.  The downside of Eircode is it will not address all the requirements of this economy.  Logistics companies are not interested in going directly to properties.  They want to know where the entrance is so this system does not address that eitherIt will not address all the needs of a modern economy.  If we introduce a postcode that is worse than a traditional postcode and it does not address modern requirements, then we will have a code that within a small number of months will not be used at all.  We also have a legal problem because it will not comply with the legislation.</p></speech>
