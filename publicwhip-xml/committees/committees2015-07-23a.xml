The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  We begin today, which is our session one, which is a public hearing with An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny T.D. and Mr. Richard Bruton TD.</p> <p>  I would like to welcome everyone to today's public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Our witnesses today are An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny TD, and Mr. Richard Bruton TD.  Gentlemen, you're both welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p> <p>  Today, the inquiry will focus upon the roles of the Oireachtas and the effectiveness of the Oireachtas oversight of the Government in the build-up to the crisis and in responding to the crisis.  In particular, our focus will be on three lines of inquiry.  The effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and the economy, the analysis of the key drivers for budget policy and the appropriateness of the relationships between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.  </p> <p>  The Taoiseach and Minister Bruton are, therefore, appearing before the inquiry today in the context of their respective roles as leader of Fine Gael, while in opposition, and as the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, while in opposition.</p> <p>  In normal proceedings when a witness comes before the inquiry, I read out privilege to the witness but as both our  witnesses today are actually Members of the House, they effectively are and categorically are already covered by witness, so I don't have to extend that right as I usually would.  But I would say that you are directed by the  chairperson this morning and you are directed to only give evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings, and as to be given.</p> <p>  I would remind members and those present that are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p> <p>  The witnesses has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  And if I could now ask the clerk to administer the oath to both of you, please.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och d&iacute;ot as ucht an cuireadh teacht anseo agus t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta a bheith ag freastal ar an ... ag an chomhcoiste.  I am pleased to appear before the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis following the direction, which was given pursuant to section 67 of the House of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, by you as Chairman.  We would hope that the inquiry can generate new insights into the cause of the banking crash and related collapse, that help policy-makers ensure that a mistake and mistakes made at that time are never again repeated.  </p> <p>  I've been asked to appear here in my capacity as leader of Fine Gael, between 2002 and 2007, specifically in relation to the areas that you've mentioned, the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and on the economy.  Secondly, analysis of the main drivers for budgetary policy and thirdly, the appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking and the property sector, as you've outlined, Chairman.</p> <p>  Prior to my election as leader of Fine Gael in 2002, Fine Gael had been in government previous to that, between 1994 and 1997, during which time I served as Minister for Tourism and Trade.</p><p>As a Government ... that Government, comprised of three parties, secured modest public expenditure growth, budgeted for the first Government surplus in a generation and delivered a rapid reduction in Government debt, from 84% of GNP in 1994 down 20% to 64% of GNP in 1997.  Obviously, at that time the Government secured Ireland's entry into economic and monetary union and the adoption of the euro as our currency.  Economic growth averaged over 7% per year, driven primarily by a very strong performance in exports, which rose to 73% of our GDP - which was an exceptionally high proportion by any international standards.  That Government maintained a focus on manufacturing, on exports and on cost control in all areas and between '93 and '97, inflation averaged approximately 2%, which was consistent with the maintenance of international competitiveness - which is so important.  In the 1990s, this country doubled its share of the world export market and foreign direct investment flows into Ireland increased significantly.</p><p> When the Government changed in 1997, we passed on an economy in which rapid growth had been underpinned by sound public finances, strong productivity, employment growth and a vibrant export-orientated industrial base and unemployment had dropped to below 9%.  We met all those necessary economic conditions to adopt the euro, which was a new, strong currency ... a stable currency, with low interest rates to be used by ... eventually by over 500 million people.  Ireland looked forward to building a more competitive, inclusive, innovative economy as a platform for long-term prosperity, stability and, as a consequence, social cohesion.</p><p> So following the completion of the EMU and the formal circulation of the euro in 2001, the underlying dynamics of the Irish economy shifted dramatically ... dramatically in the following decade.  Particularly in the period 2002 to 2007 and particularly with regard to the changed contribution to Irish economic growth from exports and domestic spending.  Very important in that was the significant tax incentives that were introduced and subsequently extended beyond the lifespan originally agreed for property investment, things like multi-story car parks, student accommodation, buildings used for third level education, hotels, holiday camps, holiday cottages, rural-urban renewal park-and-ride facilities, living over the shop, nursing homes, private hospitals, convalescent facilities, sports injuries clinics and child care facilities and so on.  All of these diluted the previous policy bias in favour of manufacturing and exporting activities.  Public spending became a major driver of economic growth, increasing by an astonishing &euro;23 billion between 2002 and 2007.  The rate of growth that averaged 10% per year and credit conditions, particularly for mortgages ... they also eased as banks began to borrow more cheaply from abroad under EMU rules.  And there were no measures taken either by the national European authorities to impose appropriate lending rules to protect economic stability generally and young families buying their first homes in particular.  Household borrowing, as the inquiry will be aware, more than doubled between 2003 and 2007, with this country, Ireland, becoming the second most indebted country in the eurozone by 2007.</p><p> Ireland's current account balance - the difference between foreign earnings and foreign expenditure - went from a surplus of &euro;1.9 billion to a deficit of &euro;10.1 billion by 2007 as Irish households began to spend far more than they were earning.  Our share of world trade began to decline significantly from 2002 as domestic cost inflation accelerated, with the loss of market share most acute in the manufacturing sector.  And from 2000 onwards, most new Irish jobs came from domestic as opposed to exporting sectors, particularly the public sector and construction.  Manufacturing and agriculture lost almost 50,000 jobs between 2000 and 2006.</p><p>And by 2004 the numbers of people working in the construction sector overtook for the first time the numbers of people working in the manufacturing sector, and by 2006 the percentage of the workforce working in the construction sector was actually higher than any other industrialised country.  So by 2007 you had an uncompetitive, bloated, over-borrowed and distorted Irish economy had been left at the mercy of subsequent international events, without the safeguards, institutions and mindset that were needed to survive and to prosper as a small, open economy within a changed euro area.  By this point, the economic costs of the banking and wider collapse had already been incurred, even if the true scale of that economic disaster would take several more years to fully reveal itself. </p><p> So as is evident from the key speeches and policy documents dating from this period, under my own Ieadership, our party, the Fine Gael party, which was the main opposition party June 2002 to 2007, opposed the main strands of Government economic policy mentioned already, and our D&aacute;il members voted against the passage of every budget as a consequence.  Notable components of our economic policy evidenced from this period were: our opposition as a party to the Government's changes to the structures for financial regulation introduced in 2002; our warnings to the then Government regarding the deterioration in the country's international competitiveness, and, in particular, the rapid price and rapid cost escalation taking place in the closed sectors of our economy; our campaign which we called, "Rip Off Ireland", at the time highlighted the growing divergence in price and cost levels for consumers and businesses between Ireland and our trading partners; we had regular demands for proper cost-benefit analysis to be applied to the proliferation of tax shelters and incentives, particularly for the property sector; and our campaigns to highlight the scale of Government waste of taxpayers' money as public expenditure escalated very rapidly, most notably in our opposition to the Government's decentralisation plan.  The "Buck Stops Here" campaign set out by Fine Gael's proposals for securing better value for the taxpayer in the delivery of public services and infrastructure spoke for itself; our critique of the entire budgetary process, and the lack of opportunity for the Oireachtas to properly scrutinise and assess the tax and spending options available to the Government were a very sore point with us; our opposition to the Government's public sector benchmarking pay deals, reflecting the lack of transparency and the failure to link the deals to genuine changes in work practices and improvements in productivity.  </p><p> So a generalised critique of economic policy by our party during this period was that the then Government was abandoning the competitive, export-oriented, flexible economic model needed to prosper inside the Economic and Monetary Union, and that had been bequeathed to it by the previous Fine Gael-led Government.  And that was an economic model built on sound public finances, high productivity, strong policy support for foreign direct investment and the traded sectors of the economy.  </p><p> The ability of the Oireachtas to scrutinise all of these things was hampered by the bypassing of public representatives as a result of the dominance of social partnership, where all these decisions were made away from the Oireachtas.  Government choices in all key policy areas were removed from any kind of scrutiny.  The absence at that time of a clear, national, statutory fiscal framework and expenditure rule to ensure sustainable management of the public finances, and the absence of an independent watchdog to police management of the public finances and to highlight any risks that were there.  The absence of any requirement at that time to conduct and publish cost benefit analysis of tax shelters and major infrastructure projects, and to subject all major expenditure programmes to regular review; we had overruns on a regular basis.  </p><p> Restrictions that were introduced in the Freedom of Information Act.  So total public spending during the 2002-2007 period increased by &euro;23 billion.  The average annual growth rat, at just under 10% per year, was roughly twice the underlying potential growth rate of the economy.  And, therefore, the disastrous impact on the underlying health of the public finances was camouflaged by the temporary and unsustainable surge in transaction tax receipts from the credit fuelled construction and property bubbles.  For the main, social, political and economic drivers of the growth in Government expenditure were the genuine need to increase investment level in physical infrastructure to address capacity constraints in the Irish economy - we've mentioned some of these - and to support regional development to keep the economy moving throughout the entire country, though it was even clear then that much of the investment was being wasted because of the absence of public sector procurement and project management expertise.</p><p>Secondly, the need for public sector salaries to chase the rising cost of living, which in turn reflected the uncompetitive and the closed nature of many sectors of the Irish economy, as well as the rising cost of public services.  And those rising costs of the public service should of course have been mitigated by a much stronger drive to secure public sector efficiencies, particularly in the health service and the amalgamation of the health boards into the HSE.  That opportunity was lost as a result of the Government's public sector pay benchmarking deals.  The doubling of the social welfare budget during 2001 and 2007, at a time of rapidly rising employment, and while there was a genuine need to reduce poverty among vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, the disabled and so on, the rapid rise in payments to working age adults reflected the complete absence of activation reforms that were needed to lower the exceptional rate of jobless households in Ireland, even at a time when the country was allegedly enjoying full employment.  The absence at that time of a clear national strategy fiscal framework and expenditure rules to ensure sustainable management of the public finances and the absence of an independent watchdog to police management of the public finances and highlight risks.  If the expenditure rule enacted by the current Government, which caps expenditure growth of the underlying potential growth rate of the economy had been adhered to in that period, then spending growth would have been less than half of the 130% increase actually incurred.</p><p> Then there was the political cycle unconstrained by any independently-policed set of credible fiscal rules.  Budgetary policy during that period was as a result driven by the needs of the electoral rather than the economic cycle.  Public spending without any reform increased rapidly up to the 2002 election.  Voted spending was up by 21% in 2001, 14% in 2002 and the lead into the 2007 election, up by 13% in 2007.  So not only would tighter management of public spending during this period have helped moderate economic overheating at a time of growing risk, it would also have helped to leave the public finances in a much stronger position to protect living standards and the economy from the effects of the property bust and collapse in the construction sector.  It has of course been documented that the Fine Gael Party in the 2007 election adopted broadly similar assumptions as the then Government about economic growth, about tax receipts, about public spending over the subsequent five-year D&aacute;il term.  These assumptions were drawn from the contemporaneous projections by the Department of Finance and by the Economic and Social Research Institute and our assessment at the time was that these projections were credible on the basis of a steady managed transition back to the competitive export-orientated economic model that drove Ireland's strong and sustainable recovery during the 1990s.</p><p> It has been alleged, Chairman, that a relatively small clique of bankers and property owners were able to bring influence on policy-making at that time to secure taxpayer support to favoured sectors and to favoured institutions.  This is a matter of public interest for the inquiry to pursue and obviously you will make your own findings.  Whatever the truth of the allegations, it is clear that there were features of Irish politics and Irish policy-making system at that time that left it vulnerable to such perceptions.  Things like the ability of the Ministers for Finance to introduce or extend tax breaks for favourite sectors of the economy, particularly the property and construction sectors, without published detailed assessments by the Department of Finance or scrutiny indeed by the Oireachtas.</p><p> The excessively close relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance at that time and between the Financial Regulator and the institutions that it was charged with regulating.  The ambiguity between the relative roles of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, when it came to policing the stability of the banking system and protecting consumers and depositors, the corporate funding of political parties to varying degrees during this period, the dilution by the then-Government of the Freedom of Information Act, the absence of clear and forcible rules regarding the jobs that could be taken up in the private sector by former Ministers, advisers and civil servants and the absence of any institution to police the resulting conflicts of interest that arose.  The lack of transparency and rules regarding the lobbying of public officials by special interest groups, the absence of effective planning regulation at that time and the absence of structured institutionalised national risk assessment processes.  So in conclusion, by meeting all of the economic conditions needed in 1997 to adopt a new strong and stable currency with the low interest rates used by the people of the European Union, the Irish people dreamed of building a more competitive, globalised and innovative economy as a platform for long-term prosperity, for stability and for social cohesion.</p><p>For hundreds of thousands of families in this country, their dreams turned into a complete nightmare as boom and bust and a stability was replaced by a policy of recklessness and regulatory failures.  </p><p> To be sure, design flaws that existed in the euro architecture as a whole contributed to this crisis, both here and in the eurozone, and these flaws are gradually being repaired, but there are still serious challenges up ahead.  But the lion's share of the damage, Chairman, was done to the Irish economy was the fault of domestic economic and financial mismanagement.  </p><p> We have learned the hard way that being part of the euro presents, not just opportunities but huge domestic challenges.  The need for more effective regulation of the financial system, for greater budgetary discipline, for more responsible and transparent politics, and for relentless pursuit of cost reductions, innovation and product and labour market flexibility so as to maintain our competitiveness in the absence of any control over our exchange rate.  So having failed these challenges in the first 15 years of our euro membership, our economic and political institutions are now being renewed and being reformed so that the euro can once become a source of stability, of prosperity, and, indeed, of hope, for the Irish people.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

And, first of all, can I just thank you for the invitation, and thank your members for, I mean, what is a truly enormous amount of work, which your members on the committee and you and their Chair are putting into this.  I suppose just a few high level things.  I think it's always been Fine Gael's view that to deliver enduring growth and living standards in a small, open economy like ours, it has to be built on two basic foundations.  One is the foundation of enterprise, innovation and exports; that's the essence of a small trading economy, and the second is a smart state, that is alert, efficient, that's strategic in the way it delivers.  And that became even more important when we joined the single currency because we were committing to a hard currency regime.  We were going shoulder to shoulder with, you know, really strong economies like Germany.</p> <p>  It's my belief, very strongly, that, you know ... and, indeed, Fine Gael's belief, that the Irish economic crash, it wasn't a result of a tsunami way out in the ocean that swept away a whole bunch of very sustainable and clever economic policies, that the fault lines that made Ireland so vulnerable in those years had developed from bad policy over an extended period of time, and that far from building on enterprise, innovation and exports, economic success had come from speculation, property and debt.  That was the contrast.  That was the flaw, in the ... if you like, in the underlying, real economy.  It was also was undermined, in my belief, by, you know, a State that had become sluggish, wasteful, self-indulgent, in the way it approached its spending and its delivery, and the challenge of public service reform.  </p> <p>  I think if you look at the history of this period.  I mean, Fine Gael's approach when we were in government with Labour in '94 to 97 was very clear.  We had that strong export-driven growth.  It was very solid management of the public finances, and that was continued, in my belief, between 1997 and 2000.  But as the general election of ... approached, 2001 and 2002 saw the abandonment of a lot of that prudence.  And the ... we, in Fine Gael, you know, consistently opposed the bad policy decisions that was building up those fault lines in the economy.  And they were ... I'll just isolate four areas where I think it's, you know ... the biggest mistakes were made.  One was around sound budgets.  You know, as I say, it was abandoned in 2001 and 2002.  Spending growth in those two years was something like 35% - extraordinary - way out of line with the growth and the underlying growth in the economy.  And we warned Government of that consistently.  We warned of the growing and precarious reliance on the construction sector.  Towards the latter part of that period, 2006-2007, 25% of Government revenue was coming from construction, so 25% of the cost of running our hospitals, our schools, our garda&iacute;, and so on was coming from the construction sector.  That just wasn't a sustainable approach.  And we demanded consistently reform in the way budgets were put together, the, sort of, way  in which budgets were put together, where there was no proper scrutiny.</p><p>The best example, in my view, is to be seen in the lack of scrutiny of tax breaks .. that were ... billions of euros of tax breaks were given out without any scrutiny.  A big, massive decision like decentralisation was introduced without the proposal even circulating among Government Departments where it could have been scrutinised.  You know, the approach to budgeting was wholly wrong and it produced some very bad, imbalanced outputs.</p><p> The strong export performance is the second thing I would single out.  That was consistently undermined and we warned consistently of the inflation, the erosion of the competitiveness of our economy by inflation in what economists would call the sheltered sector of the economy, areas regulated by Government or that weren't open to competition, at a time when exporters were facing really tough conditions in the eurozone markets.  You know, export prices were generally falling, while this huge growth in domestic prices was undermining our competitiveness.  And I think most ... it was most vividly illustrated, and I repeatedly drew that illustration, the growth in agency-supported employment, which is the ... you know, supported by IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they're the heart of our exporting strategy.  In those early years, '94 to 2000, they grew by over 17,000 per year, extra people working in the export-oriented sector.  That collapsed by 90% in the second period, between 2001 and 2007, so you ... it dropped back to just ... under 2,000.  That was the imbalance that was growing.  Those are the core of a small, open, trading economy, these companies that are out there winning you new markets and, you know, that was a really damaging element.</p><p> The other element was smart spending and, you know, we, in Fine Gael, published numerous reports, like Who Cares?, The Buck Stops Here, focusing in on the massive growth, which I think it had been 133% growth in spending in those short five or six years, just wasn't delivering value for money and you saw poor delivery on fancy plans, you know, plans, like decentralisation ... announced.  At the end of its period, it delivered 10% of what it was supposed to.  You know, fancy plans on health not delivering.  You know, big spending increases but no one held accountable for the delivery and we very strongly, you know, drove for the need for public service reform and that was ... there's no doubt that the drive for public service reform was held back by the then social partnership arrangements, which prevented, you know, delivery of reform.</p><p> The fourth area I'd point out is robust regulation and we, back in 2002, when the regulatory structure was being put in place, we opposed that, and it's worth checking the record and going back, we opposed that at second stage for the very ... and we set out the reasons: because there had not been an examination of whether our regulatory system was fit for purpose.  We had come through a period when you'd seen the Enrons and various breakdowns in financial oversight and we were putting in place a structure that was just simply putting a big bulldog clip around everything that was being done, no scrutiny of the underlying systems, and that was being rammed through and that was a wholly wrong approach.  And, I think, right through that period I think we continued to pursue this inadequate oversight of banking.  We also pursued this ... the failure to implement the recommendations of the Competition Authority, which was another area of smart regulation that was not being delivered.  </p><p> I think the sad part of this was that the property boom papered over the vulnerabilities that were building up in our economy.  You know, they provided employment that masked the loss of jobs in the export centres ... sectors.  They provided tax revenue that masked the fact that they were unsustainable.  Those tax revenues were built by young people taking out large mortgages, paying high elements of tax on housing and that's where the funding for a lot of the growth in spending was occurring.  It was never a sustainable basis and I think, you know, Fine Gael had always a different approach to the then Government and, you know, the challenge for us then was how to manage those vulnerabilities and the core of our approach, as we approached the 2007 election, was to deliver on that ... this strategy of reverting to one built on enterprise, on innovation, on exports, on sound spending, and that has been a consistent hallmark of the approach we've taken.  You can see it in '94 to '97, the critique of policy that we outlined all through those years and again in Government in 2011 to 2015.  Those, you know, sound bases of growing the basis of a sustainable, small economy that can grow living standards for everyone has been at the heart of our approach.</p><p>And, you know, I think we have to get back and that's what we have done in the last number of years, to build enduring growth in living standards by continually reinventing our competitive edge, by disciplining public policy, by evaluation and accountability in what we do.  And that, I think, has been characterised, the approach we took throughout this period. </p></speech>

Mr. Kenny, can I start with you in relation to ... one of the key criticisms of Government policy during the years 2002 to 2007 which has a emerged during this inquiry, was the narrowing of the tax base and increasing dependence on transitional taxes.  The Fine Gael manifesto in 2007 also commits to, "Cutting income taxes for all taxpayers and keep the low rates of corporation tax and capital gains tax".  So, with that in mind, would these commitments not have further eroded the tax base?  And what policies, if any, did Fine Gael have to broaden the tax base to provide a more stable revenues for government?  And the manifesto is on the screen for your assistance.</p></speech>

Obviously, I've read it.  Well, your question is about the stability of the public finances and I think it's a very relevant question.  I make the point that we've always believed in sound public finances together with an unrelenting focus on national competitiveness, that these are the conditions that would apply for, you know, lower interest rates, high level of investment and, as a consequence, strong economic and employment growth.  So, back in the period when my party was in government in '94-'97, I recall that was my first senior Ministry in trade and tourism.  And the emphasis, really, was on being lean and competitive and, as a consequence, there were up to 1,000 jobs a week being created in terms of foreign direct investment-----</p></speech>

In the 2007 election, Fine Gael actually adopted a joint economic and fiscal programme with the Labour Party, and that meant that we'd keep our 12.5% corporation tax rate, that we'd reduce the standard rate of income tax from 20% to 18%, as well as other tax reforms to support one income families and to improve the design of the stamp duty regime with particular reference for first-time buyers.  That was because we believe that keeping taxes low on work and investment, combined with proper regulation and a competition reforms to improve the country's cost competitiveness, was a core plank of our plan to transition the economy back towards the export-led model that we passed on in 1997.</p> <p>  Obviously, we also committed in 2007 to keeping the public finances in surplus in general government terms and, specifically, we made it clear that all our commitments on both the spending and on the tax side were subject to the overall riding commitment to adhere to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  So those commitments, Deputy, on tax and spending were consistent on the basis of the growth forecasts that were available at the time, both from the ESRI and from the Department of Finance, which were forecasting growth average of about 4%, between the period 2008 to 2012.  Obviously, we understood quite clearly that level of growth couldn't be achieved unless the competitiveness of the economy was restored.  So, like the huge loss of competitiveness in there during 2002 to 2007, together with Government waste on public spending, was a central theme of our critique.  So-----</p></speech>

And those tax positions, to retain the corporation tax of 12.5%, to reduce the standard rate from 20% to 18%, as well as a number of other reforms that I've mentioned - stamp duty and one-parent families - were entirely consistent with that model and, obviously, Fine Gael and Labour put together a joint fiscal document in that regard.</p></speech>

Can you just hold the clock a second there?  I just need to come in for a moment here, Taoiseach.  The question the Deputy is answering is a micro exercise of the political manifesto of the Fine Gael Party at that time and the question that is being put is the specific measures as opposed to the macro general issues.  So ideas such as 18% ... reductions in taxation means a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  That has to be met with compensation in public expenditure and addresses like that.  So if I could assist the member in his questioning to you, it would be specifics with regard to micro policy measures as opposed to the macro general intent of the manifesto.

I think I had ... I think it was 30 Deputies I had at the time.  Obviously, to rebuild a party nationally takes a great deal of time and effort.  So in the presentation and the preparation of programmes or proposals or issues for the D&aacute;il and for the Oireachtas, no more than any other party, Fine Gael would consult with different groups and organisations and people around the country to canvassed ... you know, canvass views from far and wide.  But, obviously, the political test whether those ... whether interest groups that meet with the political process had any sway in their individual interests are something that interested me in the sense of the greater good.  I have to say that while you come across occasionally people who've a very specific focused interest group from their own agenda, it played no part in Fine Gael's wider interest.  So our ... our ... you know, we had a critique year after year about what was happening in terms of the housing sector, what was happening in terms of the whole social partnership area, where year after year, the Oireachtas was completely bypassed and decisions were made away from the Oireachtas in terms of the social partnership decisions that were made by Ministers and no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the Houses of the Oireachtas.

Can I ask you, Mr. Bruton, why did you table an amendment in the Finance Bill in February 2004 looking for an extension of the tax reliefs to allow for, not full planning permission to be required, but outline planning permission - and your colleague Jimmy Deenihan argued that a specific case in relation to a hotel in his constituency would not be able to avail of the scheme which was the foundation of the amendment - given what you tell the committee in terms of your party's opposition to these tax reliefs and their extension?</p></speech>

I mean, I don't have the document to which you're referring but from what you describe of it, it would appear that there was some projects coming to the end of a period and there were some projects who were in planning and there was an issue of could they, you know, complete their planning within the terms of the scheme?  And naturally that is something that, you know, is worthy of consideration if a lot of effort had been put into an individual project under ... if you like, with the reasonable expectation that they would get support.</p> <p>  But you know, across the board we were not supportive of tax breaks and I can, you know, cite numerous examples.  This debate raged ... it was around 2002 when the Government identified that some of the tax breaks were not fit for purpose and I recall an Indecon report showing that the benefits were less than half of the costs and there was clearly evidence that the construction sector was becoming stronger and stronger.  The house building programme, as you know, built to extraordinary levels.  It was not a time to continue those reliefs.  And we consistently opposed the extension of those reliefs as a policy tool.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton will expand on the reasons that he led Fine Gael's opposition to that legislation in the D&aacute;il, and for very good reason.  We expressed concerns about the direction of the economy more generally up to 2007, including a credit growth which I pointed out in my opening statement there.  But the ... My concerns focused mainly on the total loss of competitiveness of the Irish economy and the shift away from that export-orientated model that we had which was very successful.  As far back as 2002 and 2003, in my position as leader of the Opposition in the Oireachtas, we gave prominent notice to the warnings issues by the National Competitiveness Council.  In 2002, for example, I said, you know, Ireland has crashed down to the bottom of the competitiveness league.  2003 we launched the rip-off campaign that-----</p></speech>

In 2003, 2005, 2006 I pointed these out in budget contributions in the House to the Government of the day in respect of the dangers that were applying here.

Those concerns continued right through 2004, 2005.  You had a number of cases where the banks were not compliant with their obligations.  The banks were seen to be having excessive profits compared to other states, we challenged that as to whether the regulatory system was addressing adequately the growth in the banks.</p></speech>

The Central Bank itself, as you know, in their stability reports of 2005 and 2006, they highlighted the vulnerabilities that were there, the excessive growth in credit, the excessive reliance on property, the excessive reliance on overseas funds.  But none the less, they concluded, the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, that none the less the system was robust.</p><p>And in 2006 they actually said that it was more robust than it had been in 2005, which was, was probably hard to understand, and, you know, we did have the Governor of the Central Bank in before committees and, you know, the picture was one that, yes there was high growth but the, you know, look at the value of the assets on the other side of the balance sheet.  So I think there was an inadequate probing of, of this issue by those who were the regulators.  From our point of views, I suppose, we saw the vulnerabilities but, we highlighted, I suppose, particularly what was happening in, in the public sector, where an alarming dependence on construction was emerging as a base of public spending, as well as, if you like, individual credit decisions.</p></speech>

You referenced the ESRI and Department of Finance but feeding into account that you had concerns about construction, and within the, the manifesto, the budget proposal, what did ye ... what were the measures ye put in place to, to deal with the imbalance of construction taxes making up 25% of tax revenues in terms of ... and potentially, did you see that there would be ... what contingents did you put in place for maybe a fall in tax revenues from construction, did ye anticipate a fall?  So, two questions: were your due diligence in terms of the assumptions robust enough, in hindsight?  And secondly, what measures did ye put in place to deal with, did ye see a reduction coming in construction taxes and what measures did ye put in place to rebalance the economy in that regard?</p></speech>

So, we relied on the Department of Finance and ESRI forecasts.  Clearly, in retrospect those forecasts were wildly optimistic but we, we relied on those.  We built into our manifesto, and you'll see it there, the ... a provision that within the public finances, a contingency would have to be built into the public finances for the expectations, you know, for what might go wrong because of vulnerabilities.  We also very clearly, I mean, the previous four years had been characterised by a growth in the rate of public spending from about 6% up to 13%, a progressive growth in spending as the election approached.  We did the very opposite, we said "we must now grade back our growth" and we did that in line with what had been our traditional view, that it should be kept related to the, the growth in GDP of 2%-----</p></speech>

So, we, we projected in line with the policy that we had pursued back in 2002 and was consistent that growth should ... that growth in public spending could be somewhat higher but have to be within the pattern with growth of the economy.  What had been going ... in the years prior to that, was huge surges in spending, totally unrelated, and the reason why that was possible was that the stamp duty and the property taxes and so on were, were coming in.  So, we very clearly said, you know, we need stamp duty as, as stamp duty as you probably will recall, was an extraordinary tax.

In 2005, I made the point to ... the Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, at the time, about the, the construction sector had been boosted to 250,000 employees, heading towards 90,000 units.  Ten or 15 years before that we were on ... based on exports and competitiveness.  In 2006, I made those warnings much more pointed, pointed out that the share of world trade peaked in 2002 and had been in decline subsequent to that ... our, our trade grew, grew very strongly.  I finished off that contribution by saying that if anything, the budget they were introducing threatened to further undermine the competitiveness of small businesses and exporters and the relentless and uncontrolled increases in current spending was very dangerous.  What Deputy Bruton pointed out there in respect of the stamp duty was absolutely clear.  House prices back in the decade of 1997-2007 had risen by over 300%, from &euro;102,000 to &euro;323,000 and even higher for second-hand houses and we brought in a series of propositions to, to make that much more appropriate; no stamp duty for the first-time buyers up to &euro;450,000, 9% in excess, for non-first-time buyers, nought to &euro;100,000, zero tax and the next &euro;350,000, 5% tax, and above &euro;450,000, 9%.  And that was, that was designed to, to sort of have a more appropriate tax regime but make it possible for first time, first-time buyers to get into the, into the market in a way, and that was compatible, if you like, with a slowing house, house market.  House prices were falling in 2007, with the new housing starts and it led to ... it led to an increase in liability.</p></speech>

Can I ... in your witness statement, Taoiseach, on page 6, you make reference to the excessively close relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance at the time, and between the Financial Regulator and the institutions it was charged with regulating.  My colleague, Joe Higgins, referred to it, affectionately as "Siamese twins".  And can you clarify in what way you regard the relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that have been excessively close?  Would this have not been a normal situation to manage the economy and regulate the economy properly?  And similarly with the Financial Regulator and the banks, how should such relationships be managed and how should they be objectively measured?  So, you speak about this excessively close relationship between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank and then between the Financial Regulator and the institutions they were regulating.  So, you might expand on that Taoiseach, what you mean.</p></speech>

I believe that was a serious mistake.  I think it's clear that this led to the absence of any, sort of, constructive tension, if you like, between the, between the two or dissonant viewpoints between the two institutions regarding the direction of the economy and the risks that we faced.  Clearly, with regard to the relationship between the Financial Regulator and the banks, I note that the ... the former Financial Regulator, Mr. Neary, acknowledged in his testimony to your inquiry here that having the Irish Banking Federation organise a retirement party for the chairperson of the Financial Regulator was utterly inappropriate.  This was, if you like, systematic of a relationship that lacked, sort of, the necessary, you know, bite in authority and ... wasn't, wasn't appropriate.</p><p>I know that Ms Burke from ... of both IFSRA and formerly from the Central Bank, spoke to the inquiry of this excessively close relationship, she said:<blockquote><br /><br />Senior banking executives had direct contact with senior executives in IFSRA, often without the knowledge of, not to say engagement with supervisory staff.  Staff were regularly requested by senior IFSRA executives to review decisions or issues based on these decisions or were told by contacts in banks that the issues had been or would be discussed with our senior executives </blockquote>To me she said, &quot;At its most benign it indicated a disconnect between BSD and the senior IFSRA executives.&quot;  She said it also signalled a &quot;manifest lack of support for staff, undermining them in their dealings with banks and-----&quot;</p></speech>

Those remarks that I mentioned there were followed through by others to the inquiry here and you have all those on record.  But this is an important change that the Government have brought about here where there is, you know, an application process, an examination-interview process and a scrutinising process of the capacity of people to fill these positions.  Some are from abroad and some are from at home.  It's a big change from what applied before where the vast majority of Central Bank Governors came from within the Department of Finance in a seamless transfer and, therefore, there couldn't be the, sort of, you know ... shall I say, appropriate relationship between two important entities.</p></speech>

You told the D&aacute;il on 25 June, 2013 and I want to quote you directly.  You said:<blockquote><br /><br />I had the doubtful privilege of calling into Anglo Irish Bank with Deputy Bruton, when he was the party's spokesman on finance, a couple of weeks after the guarantee went through.  We met all of the principals in the bank's building on St. Stephen's Green.</blockquote>Firstly, who sought the meeting?

And the purpose of the meeting was to have a discussion about the general economic situation and to enquire about the healthy state, or otherwise, of the banks.  And that's why I said that, in the case of Anglo Irish, a presentation was given that was to the point that Anglo was a model of a bank that would emerge from the recession as the strongest of any bank, that all of the loans approved - both in America, in Ireland and in Great Britain - were approved by the people who sat at the other side of the table.  I recall Mr. Drumm being there; I recall Mr. McAteer being there; I recall Mr. Moran being there; I think, to be honest with you, that there were seven or eight on that side.  I don't recall the other names.  I can have them sent into the Chairman, if you wish.</p></speech>

I was actually out in, I think, it was the TV3 station in the morning.  I had a call from the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan.  I was actually just about to start an interview.  I think at that stage that he may have spoken to Deputy Bruton as our spokesman on finance, and the question that he asked me was like, "What would Fine Gael's position be if a guarantee were given in respect of the banks?"  And I recall saying to him, "Look, I'm doing an interview here but we have to have a banking system because it's the lifeblood of the economy but I'd need to know the conditions that you're talking about."</p></speech>

I mean, I think rumours were coming through the night before that there was going ... there was pressure, that the banks were in serious difficulty and that something might happen and so I think the following morning Brian Lenihan phoned to say the Government was making this decision and, obviously, there was ... he was setting up briefing and debates and so on.  So, you know, I think at that stage, clearly, one of the things we'd seen with Northern Rock, the fear of a run on the bank where, you know, even if you have a sound bank and there's a run on the bank and people want to take out their deposits, it can bring down even a sound bank, let alone banks that were, as subsequently proven, not sound.  So, clearly, you know, the ...a run on the bank would have been a very serious issue and I think that was the context within which it was presented as a-----</p></speech>

I'm sorry for interrupting but there's only ten seconds left and I have to ask you.  During your time in opposition do you feel that you were able to make effective use of decision-making processes within the Oireachtas to strengthen legislation, particularly financial and banking sector legislation?  Minister Bruton, maybe, first.</p></speech>

I mean, repeatedly there wasn't.  I mean, at the very first time when the Central Bank and IFSRA legislation came in, I sought that there should be a proper study of the adequacy of our oversight mechanisms, that we should, you know, in light of then financial breakdowns like Enron and so on, that we needed to stress test our approach.  There was no such provision.  That Second Sage amendment, which sought to defer the legislation until such a review had taken place, was not accepted by Government.  There was then no provision for hearings to be held by the committee.  We had, obviously, amendments but, ultimately, the Bill was put through at the end without our amendments, but, you know, I think that was a serious mistake.  And I think repeatedly ... and I did outline it on the piece that I said on Oireachtas supervision ... you know, the intention, even back to the Public Service Management Act of 1997 when, you know, there was supposed to be a certain approach to spending strategies and outcomes and evaluations, rolling evaluations, that had just rusted over in that period.  There was no evaluation.  The way in which the budget itself was put together allowed no scrutiny, particularly no scrutiny of tax expenditure.  But even spending wasn't properly scrutinised.</p></speech>

I suppose my biggest regret politically is that we didn't win the '97 election, that this might never have happened, but it did.  And just on a point, I noted from one of my notes here, Mr. Chairman, just for your information.  I think that meeting with Anglo was after the guarantee was given.

In the Fine Gael manifesto of 2007, it called for tax cuts and additional public expenditure in many areas.  An example is the extension of medical cards.  Can you explain how your expenditure policies would have been less pro-cyclical than the Government's?  Let's start with Mr. Bruton.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#R00500"><p>Yes, I suppose at that time, the key issue for us was, as I said, two things.  One was restoring enterprise, innovation and exports, that was the model.  That had been severely undermined, and we believed that part of that was a tax policy that would be more supportive of enterprise.  So we did, with the economy forecast as it was then, to be on a reasonable growth phase, we believed that what we needed to do was to wind back the rate of growth of public spending, and introduce taxes and other measures that would drive economic recovery and enterprise recovery and if you look at our ... I don't have the time ... but if you look at our, our manifesto, you'll see numerous areas which we've subsequently done in government, of how we would rebuild an enterprise base and look at reforms right across the whole system to deliver better access to finance, easier to start a business and so on.  So the issue really was, was getting value out of the system, and a lot of our focus was on, you know, restructuring the economy, not on the cyclical dimension.  That was the ... it was about how do you restructure an economy to deal with the vulnerabilities that were growing up.</p></speech>

A decade, 11 years later, it was &euro;63 billion.  Again, a similar question to the 2007 Fine Gael manifesto: what were the specific policies that you were advocating, that Fine Gael were advocating, to lower expenditure in a period, in that decade, where it had gone from &euro;18.8 billion spend to &euro;63 billion spend.</p></speech>

We called for a renegotiation of the principle of the way decentralisation was being promoted and consistency in respect of both of the lowering of income tax and the retention of corporation tax, of the tax rate.  So ... where we tried to focus, from our Opposition perspective, was to get back to being a lean, export-oriented, growth economy, which was based on manufacturing and on exports, which were proven in the ... in '94-'97, and continued for a year or two after that, until you had an extraordinary explosion in the construction sector, where you had a lot of credit and a lot of activity, which, sort of focused, I suppose, the minds of Government then, on their assumption that you could run all the services from the taxes that were coming in from a fuelled property, property section.</p></speech>

What I'm asking you were, in terms of the '07 Fine Gael manifesto, were there specific policies that you were advocating to lower expenditure?  An example in that same decade or period, the public sector pay bill went from &euro;8 billion to &euro;18 billion.  Were you, or did you advocate policies to reduce those figures or what were your specific policies to reduce expenditure?</p></speech>

But we were consistent in our criticism of the lack of scrutiny from social partnership, in the directions that were given by, for instance, Finance in respect of benchmarking, the lack of scrutiny in terms of major infrastructure projects which overran seriously, and the wastage in public expenditure.  So we wanted our tax position to be well focused but to get back to a point where you were going to have growth in your economy, which would create jobs and as a consequence, allow for services to be spread throughout the country, particularly to the most vulnerable.  And we've mentioned issues like the disabled or the medical cards or those who were in vulnerable positions.</p></speech>

You were the Minister for Tourism and Trade when a pilot programme was introduced, it became known as the seaside resort.  Can I ask, during your period in ministerial office, was there analysis done in relation to why that tax break was introduced, and if there was analysis done, was it done by your Department or was it done by the Department of Finance on the basis of introducing a pilot scheme of this nature?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#R01100"><p>Yes, when I was Minister for Tourism, obviously, we sort of looked at a jaded tourism sector which had so much more potential than it was actually achieving.  In the course of, you know, travelling throughout the country, you came across particular areas that were clearly in need of some sort of infrastructure investment.  And people from all over the country, from particularly the coastal areas, said "Look, we're out here on a limb.  This place is falling asunder.  You've got to do something to stimulate investment so that we can have a product that people will want to come and enjoy and therefore, you know, be able to contribute to the economy."  And we discussed that at some length, as to what might happen, and the decision was that there should be a pilot scheme introduced in a small number of areas.  That was expanded to include 15.  It was done on the basis of the district electoral divisions as determined by the local authorities.  It was different now than the, you know, the urban sort of renewal scheme, which was a much smaller scale.  I have to say that the response was one that was assessed.  I think it generated about &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million worth of work in terms of infrastructure, construction and so on.  I would say that some of the towns which were designated, Senator, took this in a far broader way than others.  Some, where their hotels went after the scheme and provided facilities for, you know, a much broader range of tourist coming in, whether it be pools or whatever else, some areas did better than others.  But I think it generated about &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million and ended, I think, then in 1999.  And no more than the case that was raised earlier, there were planning problems with some of these, so where people entered into the scheme that if they had gone beyond a certain point of, you know, a contract being signed or building under way, it was allowed to finish its course.  But the reason for the case in the first instance was because many of these communities said "Look, we are really stranded here, we have a jaded product, there's a clear need for some infrastructure investment", and so that kind of pilot scheme was designed and put in place.  And so, you know, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment and Local Government, Finance, Bord F&aacute;ilte, Shannon Development, they all put the details together and obviously there were meetings held in the locations that were chosen, from financial people about how they, how the scheme would actually work.  So it was assessed and I suppose there was a qualifying relief and the tax foregone in that scheme, I think, was about &euro;250 million altogether.</p></speech>

However, the report also stated ... the scheme did not contribute, in any significant way to the achievement of a key tourism objective [for] &ldquo;the attraction of overseas tourists&rdquo; but probably assisted in the achievement of regional spread in domestic tourism terms.</blockquote></p><p>Mr. Kenny, the figures that the Minister for Finance, at that stage, gave was a tax foregone, a tax break of &euro;319 million and if you read that ... the analysis of that response is quite clear, that there wasn't an assessment subsequent to the scheme.  The scheme didn't contribute towards the expectation of improving tourist facilities, giving the people the reason to go beyond an extension of 5,000 to 6,000 units.  And I suppose, what I'm trying to come at, Mr... Taoiseach, is how we got to a stage where pilot scheme moves-----</p></speech>

And the same was true of many other tax expenditures.  So, our view was that you did need to introduce such scrutiny and evaluation in the same way as you would ... well, you needed scrutiny and evaluation on the spending side and the ... you know, one of the problems in those years that the mechanisms that were in place for evaluation, which were sanctioned by the 1997 Act, were simply not implemented by Government in those years.  So, you know, the evaluative machinery wasn't in place to do the work that ought to have been done on tax expenditures as well as many of the other areas of waste.</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny, the Fianna F&aacute;il party has been heavily criticised for hosting an annual fundraising initiative in a marquee in ... during Galway Race week, and it was said that many developers, including some of the biggest debtors in NAMA, were said to be there making contributions.  Now, on 6 February 2011, Michael O'Farrell, correspondent with the Irish <i>Mail on Sunday</i>, under a heading revealed &quot;Fine Gael secret cash from developers&quot; said the following, and I quote, &quot;An investigation by this paper has established that the party [that's Fine Gael] has been able to bring in up to &euro;150,000 a time by hosting business men to lavish golf days at luxurious British and Irish courses.&quot;  And Mr. O'Farrell goes on to mention the K Club and also to mention some of the biggest debtors in NAMA as being contributors, including major ... as well as major accountancy firms and a banker.  Mr. Kenny, was the Fine Gael party as close to sectors of the property industry and developers as Fianna Fail allegedly was.  </p></speech>

The vast majority of Fine Gael's fundraising came from our national draw, and still does, from ordinary members of the party and supporters around the country.  Any occasions of a social nature were certainly not in the terms that you described them there as and obviously would have had to comply with all of the regulations of SIPO.  But let me repeat for you that Fine Gael's fundraising is, in the vast majority, came from the national draw and as you'll realise, we put an end to corporate donations entirely.</p></speech>

I suppose, in any democracy, people are entitled to support who they wish but let me assure you that in so far as the Fine Gael party was concerned, the relationships that you referred to did not apply and anybody who participated in a golf match or whatever, I'm not sure how they played.</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny, in the last few days when representatives of the Fianna Fail former Government and, indeed, developers were questioned, they answered, if I may so in more or less the same terms that you did now.

I'd remind you that the Fine Gael party was an opposition party, struggling in opposition.   That the vast majority of our fundraising came from our national draw and that anything else was in ... was strictly in accordance with the SIPO regulations.

Mr. Bruton, in budget delivered by the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrat Government in December 1997, the Government reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  In the subsequent ten years, during the property bubble, massive profits were made by land speculators and developers.  There was ... it was said at this tribunal when Mr. Derek Quinlan was here that one syndicate of wealthy people that he organised made &euro;53 million on a land deal and that particular tax reduction reduced their tax liability from &euro;21 million to &euro;10 million, making a gain of &euro;10 million ... &euro;10.5 for wealthy individuals.  In the 2007 Fine Gael manifesto, you very specifically opted to keep that tax break.  In view of the major speculation and profit-taking that had occurred previously, why did you maintain that position?</p></speech>

The difficulty, I think, what happened in those years is that property had taken over ... speculation had taken over from, if you like, a genuine enterprise sector and you see the figures yourself.  I mean, there was an explosion, not only in, you know, capital gains tax but stamp duty receipts, VAT from housing.  All of these property-based taxes became the heart of Government spending programmes.  25% of the cost for running hospitals was coming from these property-based structures.</p><p>That was unsustainable and, you know, what needed to be done was to sustain ... to have a credible approach to the whole building sector and to regrow your enterprise sector.  So, consistent with that, we saw a capital gains tax at 20% ... is a reasonable approach for the ... for the enterprise sector.  I mean, as you know, in government we have ... when more pressure came on, increased that tax by 65% in the last, you know ... in this ... in the present Government.</p></speech>

Did you think that it was correct that individuals who buy land, sit on it for a few years, then get planning permission - therefore, the benefit of that land has hugely increased - and they sell it on, that they should be rewarded by halving the capital gains tax as the Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government did?</p></speech>

And we were encouraging a structure, as you say, of people going to more and more remote areas, getting land rezoned, putting people on impossible treadmills ... that we didn't have a proper planning system and it was part of our wider critique of ... of, if you like, strategic planning that stretched to the way public spending was managed, the way tax expenditures were scrutinised, the way public service was reformed.  You know, we needed to have more effective sectoral policies and planning was one of the areas ... we particularly needed reforms.  But as far as the tax regime, we supported a 20% tax regime as reasonable, on capital gains.  If you set up a business and it is successful at ... you know, it's reasonable to expect that such an entrepreneur from a genuine business would get a ... you know, would get the rewards of his success and that's ... that's what a capital gains tax is about.</p></speech>

The changes that we sought to develop were the ones that you can see in practice in the Action Plan for Jobs, which is about making it easier to create employment, you know, creating the incentives to rebuild an enterprise sector, which had been demolished by the construction ... as I say, the growth in export-oriented job growth had fallen by 90% between that earlier period and the latter period.  That was the key fault-line in the economy.  We were a small trading economy; you had to rebuild that sector and you ... that was what we put our focus on.  How would that be done?  And we ... the approach we ... we wanted to take in that manifesto is the very same one as ... that we have worked on in government to get that whole of Government approach to build ... to rebuild a strong enterprise culture, strong exporting base, go further afield, build up your trade missions, build up your capacities and that was the approach we took.</p></speech>

I couldn't give you a count, but, clearly, we were throughout this period, obviously, as legislators challenging them in committees.  There were a number of instances, as you know, through that period where bank overcharging, proper, you know, weaknesses in supervision, and, you know, we scrutinised all of those as they developed, and towards the end the, you know, the precarious growth in lending was an issue.  And we scrutinised the stability reports and so on.  So I kept very much abreast of the issues developing within the sector.</p></speech>

I mean, there would be occasional meetings around an issue.  If I thought it warranted it, I'd look for a meeting about some specific issue.  But it was, you know, that was the nature of it.  I think, you know, we were fairly trenchant critics of the banks in those ... in that period in terms of the excessive profitability, the charging regime, the ... our belief that there was rip-off, or dissatisfaction with the level of consumer protection being pursued at the time within the regulatory system.

And I am wondering are there any other property developers that you are aware of, that you can name, that would have made any donations to you?  And did you ask property developers because I think he said he gave money when he was asked.  If somebody came and said, "We're doing a fundraiser", he would look and see whether he would give it.  He didn't, I think, say that he got out of bed and gave the money, so to speak.  So are you aware of any other property developers that would have given money to Fine Gael in that time?

I did not go on a campaign of asking developers or anybody else to say, "Please give me money."  If they wanted to participate in a golf classic, well, then fine.  All those things would have to be in accordance with the regulations of SIPO.  But because of all of that perception and everything else, it put an end to all of that.  If a Deputy wishes to hold a golf classic now, they're of a very minor nature and they have to be authorised by Fine Gael at national level.  So if somebody wanted to hold a competition in Sligo or Donegal or Kerry or wherever, they would have to have an express authorisation to do that.</p></speech>

But that and the general, sort of, looseness about public expenditure, without any, sort of, analysis of performance or delivery was an economy running out of control and it clearly went over the edge.</p></speech>

Now I have had a look back over Leaders' Questions, Private Members' motions from the Opposition and, for example, in 2005, 2006 and 2007, Fine Gael had 43 different Private Members' slots.  You used them on a wide range of issues from accident and emergency, liquor licensing, animal remedies, health, greyhound doping, waste management, road safety - all important issues.  But not once do I see a Private Member's motion, for example, on the issue of the system of regulating banks, on the increase in lending to property and construction or on what you might have regarded as excessive public spending.  You had an opportunity to set the agenda and to challenge Government and to hold Government to account on these key areas, which were subsequently exposed, but you didn't use that platform, I submit to you during Private Members' or Leaders' Questions on a regular or consistent basis to pick up those issues.</p></speech>

I am not sure where the greyhound doping business came into the Private Members' but it is of interest to some.</p></speech>

If you look at, I think, about 184 press releases from Minister Bruton, they were all about competitiveness, about effective spending, about analysis of that based on getting back to where we were at the end of 1997, export-led growth so that you could create jobs and people, obviously, could benefit from that.  So I mean, you know, the Private Members' business is an opportunity for parties and, obviously, backbench deputies and frontbench deputies want to raise issues that might be of more local than national importance.  So from our point of view you've had the opportunity and different operations and a specific focus through the spokesman on finance on dealing with the issues of regulation.  Minister Bruton met with the banks on occasion to discuss that and pointed these things out consistently in budgetary contributions about the growth in public spending, the focus on the housing and the property construction sector and where that was going to lead us to.  I did the same myself, in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 in terms of budgetary contributions.</p></speech>

For example, the promises on 2,300 more hospital beds; free health insurance for every child under 16; 100,000 more medical cards; 2,000 more garda&iacute; on our streets; increase the old age pension to &euro;300; effectively abolish stamp duty; cutting income tax; an increase in current spending projected over the five years of &euro;17.4 billion; a tax package of &euro;2.4 billion.  So not only did you accept the broad macroeconomic forecast but you were actually competing on the same ground of cutting taxes, raising public spending and investing in public services and in capital expenditure.  Was it not broadly the same message?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#V02200"><p>I wouldn't paint the Fine Gael Party in the same box here as the noble party to which you belong yourself.  We did point out and took a very principled stand on benchmarking and on decentralisation, at some political cost I might say, because populism was as rampant then as it is now and people seeing 53 locations for decentralisation on the back of an envelope said, "This is great."</p><p>But actually, obviously, it was never delivered because, as you know, there were only 2,000 of the 10,000 jobs actually delivered through a system that hadn't even be thought out properly.</p><p> You make the point that, you know, we were advocating even for more public spending.  Well, far from that, because a central focus of our opposition to Government was the massive waste and the inefficiency at Government level.  Public spending, as I said, being increased without the ... any reforms in the public service and the budget process to which you were delivering for the people.</p><p> Back in 2002, I warned, in my response to the budget to the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, that expenditure grew by 50% in two years, while revenue grew by 4%, no corresponding increase in public service over the same period.  Pay costs up 11%, social welfare up 8%, rest of spending is up just 1%.  These are stark figures, as you know.</p><p> In 2004, I said that taxation and spending have more than doubled in recent years. So, in 2005, I said that what happened yesterday was the injection of an unusually large amount of money in the economy - this, coupled with the money that would come from the SSIAs, will fuel a massive consumer spend which will inevitably lead to increases in costs and prices, as the spending Government spending follows political and election cycles, not economic cycles.  And six months before the election, I said the budget continues the reckless expansion of Government taxation and spending without the necessary public sector reforms.   </p><p> So while we did accept the figures from the Department of Finance and from the ESRI, obviously those growth figures that were projected could only apply if you had a focus in an economy that was competitive and lean, and focused on that.</p></speech>

I just want to raise the issue of how open to scrutiny was the Government decision-making process.  For example, was the Oireachtas sufficiently aware of the stakeholders with whom Government Ministers might have consulted in the pre-legislative stage?  How was this information made available?  And, in your opinion, were opposition parties adequately consulted by Government, in particular, on issues which may have been deemed to be of national importance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#W00300"><p>No.  You see, we now have a situation where you have pre-legislative scrutiny for members of parties and none on all of these issues.  The fact of the matter was, you went into the Dail as an opposition party.  The Government had already done its deals with benchmarking, the process completely secretive, utterly removed from all of the scrutiny that would apply in the Oireachtas, and all of that paper was actually shredded, gone forever, never to be seen again.  And the same applied through the social partnerships works.  It's very different now, where you have public affirmation, public comment, public analysis and public scrutiny.  So, in my view, an opposition party was certainly labouring against a situation here where Government held all of the aces, held all of the opportunities to make its decisions removed from scrutiny of the Oireachtas in a way that's very different from what it is now.</p></speech>

I would be maybe concerned that there wasn't the level of engagement, you know, driven from the top between the Departments and, therefore, the necessary ... the appropriate senior civil servants.  I'd like to have seen more of that because you have that now.  If there's something going on, people are always engaged to, kind of, deal with the challenge, or whatever the issue might be.</p></speech>

And the top of your page 5, in your introductory remarks, you said, "the absence of any requirement at that time to conduct and publish cost benefit analyses on tax shelters and major infrastructure projects and to subject all major expenditure programmes to regular review;".  And indeed Mr. Bruton says, "questionable project selection".  Can we bring forward the Government economic evaluation service and have it feeding into Parliament and informing the decisions?  And, particular, could this inform the capital expenditure programme that's imminent, I think, in a matter of months, that it should be soundly evaluated rather than based on, you know, historical documents left around Departments, or people pushing their own pet projects?</p></speech>

We ... the spring economic statement, which is introduced now by the Government, sets out the parameters of the budget, and we're not going beyond that, and that's a 1.2 to 1.5 billion range divided on a  50:50 basis between both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for expenditure, and Government obviously will reflect on that.</p> <p>  The national economic discourse down in Dublin Castle recently, not only allowed for people to engage in public, but also for them to send in their propositions in respect of the forthcoming budget in October, and that will include, I assume, their, you know, propositions in respect of capital expenditure and so on.  So the capital programme will go out ahead for a number of years.  It will involve considerable expenditure, and clearly there are some issues that must be dealt with.  For instance, you know, the ... in this major city here, the situation regarding transport has got to be addressed.</p> <p>  So, we've had the opportunity to discuss the spring statement; you have regular sessions in the Dail, be it on housing or other areas of the economy, and when the Government do publish its capital programme, Senator, that will be available and obviously will be discussed and debated as well.</p></speech>

Obviously, you have to have an election next year, and that facility is already, I assume, being used by different parties.  I'd like to think that we can continue to reform the system, Senator, so that when the opportunity presents itself that there can be far ... you know, to the best extent possible, openness and transparency about the issues of the day that are going through in a way that has never been done before.</p></speech>

A lot of the areas I wanted to discuss have already been raised, so if I'm repeating myself please just let me know.  Minister Bruton, in relation to regulation, in your opening statement, on page 4, you talk about a new structure for the Financial Regulator introduced in 2002.  Is it true to say that you didn't feel it was a good structure for regulation, and for overseeing financial sector in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#W02400"><p>Yes, I think ... well first of all, I think the biggest objection I had was that we hadn't stress tested the actual powers, the capabilities, the method of overseeing the financial institutions.  There was a bigger debate about whether it should be ... the regulator should be independent, stand alone, or be part of the Central Bank, and that dominated, if you like ... that institutional debate dominated the conversation, where I thought, personally, that the more important thing was were they fit for purpose, were they capable of overseeing the sort of financial problems that were already evident.  But, again, we would have favoured a single ... a stand alone regulator, an independent regulator.</p><p>But I think that was less central than the issue of their capabilities and were they robust.</p></speech>

I mean, the period after that was a sustained issue of ... a period of calling into question as to whether they were up to scratch and we saw a period when, you know, a number of practices were revealed - of overcharging and so on in the banks - and it always appeared to me that the regulatory system arrived breathless and late, as they say, rather ... and they responded to whistleblowers or some revelation in the ... in the press that led to the issue.  So that continued to leave a question mark as to whether the system was sufficiently forensic to do the job.</p></speech>

When it comes to the 2007 election manifesto, I can't find anything in it relating to prudential regulation ... the need to improve our prudential regulation of the banks or really anything about the banking sector at all, in terms of substance.  So, why not, if you had these concerns from 2002?</p></speech>

I suppose we didn't have a detailed, if you like, alternative scrutiny mechanism for overseeing banks and our policy at the time, in 2002, was we needed a robust evaluation of how fit for purpose it was.  So, that was a question of doing a detailed assessment.  It wasn't a sort of a policy change.  Personally, I'm not sure that the structures were at the source of the problem; it was the lack of forensic investigation, the rather cosy relationships that were there and so on.  Those were the weaknesses.</p></speech>

How confident was he that there were no such vulnerabilities in our system?  Had we the proper powers and capabilities in place?  So, those questions were asked and they were, indeed, also asked of the Central Bank and the regulator.  The assurances were given that they were.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton - as he was then - pointed out consistently of the bubble that was forming around the ... around the housing, property and construction sector and he had consistently questioned Minister Cowen in respect of bank lending, the stress testing that should be carried out here.  But let me go back to the dangers that we were pointing out consistently of benchmarking, of social partnership, of overruns, of inefficiency, of a situation where you were not getting the value for money that people, you know, actually needed in respect of what they were spending.  I pointed that out consistently.</p></speech>

I'm talking, though, about 2007 and the Opposition ... and Fine Gael, as the main Opposition party, going to the people.

So, our thread, right through from 1997, was you had a functioning economy, competent management of that economy and, therefore, the opportunity to spread the fruits of that economy to where they were needed most - to the vulnerable people.  And, in opposition, it continued for a while until the focus became on the property sector in particular.  So, in '03, '04, '05, '06 and as we prepared for '07, Fine Gael had consistently pointed out the dangers of where we were.</p></speech>

We have the liquidity problems in the banks then coming to light in '07.  We come then into September 2008 and, looking at the D&aacute;il records immediately after the night of the guarantee, we see Michael Noonan, in the D&aacute;il, questioning the solvency ... the potential risk to solvency of the banks.  Why didn't Fine Gael, as a party, put that position forward?  And why did Fine Gael come to support the decision, the guarantee?  Did you consult with Labour and what did you make of their decision not to support the guarantee?</p></speech>

Obviously, Fine Gael took a view here that we would support the banking guarantee for that reason - that the economy and business and trade is where you need to be - and obviously the issue was argued in the D&aacute;il.  I remember the question that Deputy Noonan asked in respect of liquidity ... liquidity or solvency.  We supported the business so that we'd be able to ... that banks would be able to open the following morning, that there were three substantial buffers totalling &euro;80 billion that would be called upon before there would be any exposure to the taxpayer - that was, shareholder's funds, ECB funds and a future levy on the banks similar to the insurance levy, which, in the words of the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il, he said would pay for the difference through a levy over time, rather than expecting the taxpayer to do so.  Obviously, the situation has changed now following the discussions with Europe.  And, secondly, that the Government would return within three days with details of the new regulatory scheme that would govern the banks in the post-guarantee world.  We also sought, from our point of view, through Mr. Bruton, amendments and assurances in relation to the ... that the regulatory system would be improved substantially, that there would be more detail on the powers granted to the Minister under the Act and how we plan to use them to create an improved regulatory situation, that the guarantee would cover deposits and bonds and not other obligations that were introduced into the D&aacute;il debate, that there would be restrictions on payment of dividends and on bonuses, that there would be improved oversight - with three people appointed, nominated by the public accounts committee - that there would be representation by the Government on the boards of the banks covered by the guarantee, that there would be codes of practice for risk committees and that there would be ... the importance of continuing to keep credit flowing into the economy.  So they were the reasons we took the view that you needed a banking system that functioned, therefore, you needed to-----</p></speech>

I think Labour wanted to see, I think, all of the details before they would make a decision on the guarantee and obviously Fine Gael took a view that this was a real emergency here, that you were in a really difficult position, that you needed a functioning banking guarantee system and banks to be open the following morning.

And if I can put a question to yourself, Minister Bruton.  Very simply, as Opposition spokesperson for finance, what level of contact did you have yourself with the banking sector during the growing crisis years, including that of the IFSC?  During that period of time, were you subjected to lobbying by interest groups or what meetings would you have had with those groups or sought from them and how did you devise what you considered to be appropriate policies for that sector?  And I've one or two supplementary questions on that and I'll take that as the general first, Mr. Bruton.</p></speech>

You know, I developed most of my policy from talking to independent economists, academics.  You know, that ... that was really the source, you know, to provide some outside insight into this system and that's where ... you know, a lot of our critique came from.  A lot of the evidence of excess, you know, profit taking within the banks came from outside independent studies.  So, no, it wasn't ... there wasn't a big lobbying campaign going on, and we introduced no ... no measures to favour financial institutions in respect of it.</p></speech>

Were you somebody who promoted, during your term in opposition as a finance spokesperson, that Ireland was a place to come to where you would get soft-touch regulation or light-touch regulation?</p></speech>

I mean, I was not part of any promotion of the IFSC - good, bad or indifferent.  I mean, I think, to be fair though, the regulatory failures were not in respect of the international financial institutions.  By and large, the regulatory failures were, you know ... bog standard domestic banks was the problem that ... that ... that prevailed.  I think, you know, principled regulation, without a credible threat of discovery and enforcement doesn't work, you know, so that's where the weakness was.  There wasn't a credible threat of discovery and enforcement and I think that's where things came ... came unstuck in terms of the model that, you know, you're ... you're talking about.</p></speech>

I had one or two other questions but Senator MacSharry actually took them for me, so I'll actually move on to the next ones.  The issue of ... finally, is the issue of the soft landing and the general political consensus that could be ... that could be proposed or suggested that everyone was very much in a groupthink, both Government and Opposition ... that everybody ... that, okay, there was going to be a turndown, but it was going to be a soft landing in ... and I know, as Minister for Finance, that you would have access to Finance ... to senior Finance officials. that would be a common practice in opposition during that time in ... and any Opposition spokesperson would have access to the general secretary of a given Department.  This committee has yet to establish whether there was any evidence of a soft landing within the Department of Finance.  Did you ever test that evidence - to go and see if that was there?</p></speech>

So our focus was, you know, we need to fix a number of things to sustain that progress.  We weren't forecasting a hard landing.

Mr. Kenny, when it was put to you by Deputy McGrath about that your Government advocated increase in expenditure, you replied saying "Far from that."  I would like you to refer to Vol. 2, page 78, and if you would indulge me, we'll actually look at some numbers, and I would ask you then to show me how you didn't advocate increased expenditure.  What I want you to look at in particular is ... this is your election manifesto of 2007, which shows clearly that, under Fine Gael, you planned to increase current expenditure by &euro;17.4 billion over the five-year term and capital expenditure by &euro;3.4 billion in excess of that, which is in excess of &euro;20 billion over the five-year term, which is very similar to the &euro;23 billion that you criticised the Government for spending over the previous five-year term.</p><p>Do you accept, first of all, that under the Fine Gael proposals you were going to increase current voted expenditure by &euro;17.4 billion from 2007 to 2012?  Just if we can get that confirmation, we can then move on to ... to give you the figures, it goes from &euro;37 billion up to &euro;54 billion.</p></speech>

Utter inefficiency.  You had systems that were neither scrutinised nor analysed and were done away from any accountability of the Oireachtas.  And these projections, based on the figures from the ESRI and the Department of Finance, were predicated on knowing that you couldn't achieve them unless you brought back your economy to being competitive and-----</p></speech>

If we go to the bottom of that, because you were very critical of the Government in terms of your statement where it says ... where you say on page 5 of your statement but I'll just quote it - so, if we can leave the figures up on the screen - you say that "The average annual growth rate - at just under 10% per year - was roughly twice the underlying potential growth ... of the economy."  If you see on this table down below in terms of what you were planning over the five years ahead, you were planning to increase expenditure by 8%, while the growth rate was 4.2%.  Would you agree that that was exactly what the Government had done the previous five years where the growth rate was 5% and they increased expenditure, on average, 9.8%?</p></speech>

So that's not in those figures, but that was the principle and the thread running through Fine Gael's economic policy since the 1990s and before.

The point I've made in looking at the figures, and let's talk about the figures, Taoiseach, what Fine Gael was advocating at that time was to spend twice of what the growth rate was in the economy.  The growth rate you were projecting was 4.2%, you were increasing net voted expenditure by 8%, which was what the previous Government had done for the five years previous, where the growth rate was an average of 5% and they increased net voted expenditure by 9.8%.

You're the Taoiseach and I want you to confirm, is the interpretation that I have of the document, is that the Fine Gael plan in terms of expenditure over the five years was to increase expenditure at a rate twice of what the growth rate was in the economy, which was in line with what Fianna F&aacute;il had done in the previous five years, where they increased expenditure twice in line of what the growth rate was in the economy.</p></speech>

Do you accept from the four numbers that is on your screen from the Fine Gael election manifesto, that Fine Gael were planning to increase expenditure at twice the rate of what the projected growth was in the economy, which was in line with what the previous Government had done in the previous five years, where they increased expenditure at twice the rate of what growth was in the economy?</p></speech>

And your comment that this was the same as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is just not consistent with reality because we had consistently, from 2002 onwards, pointed out the dangers to the economy, the necessity for having accountability, regulation, value for money, efficiency, competence in running a national economy and that was not in any way evident in what the Government of the day were at.</p></speech>

Clearly as I pointed out, Deputy O'Donnell, the situation where you had a seamless evolution from being in the Department of Finance to being in the governorship of the Central Bank without any, you know, difference of opinion or allowing for that, that's all changed.  And from 2002 right through to 2007, the warning signs were indicated by Fine Gael at every opportunity and particularly in respect of the budgetary contributions made by myself and by the spokesman at Finance but obviously, people made their choice in 2007 and despite the fact, despite the fact, Deputy O'Donnell, that people knew and were well warned about the cracks that were appearing in the Irish economy, they made their choice and almost gave the Government of the day an overall majority.  I suppose the situation, in so far as being populist is concerned, is still around.  But clearly we've learned lessons since then.  If Fine Gael had been elected in 2007 it would have tried to rectify that position.  I would have preferred if they had been re-elected back in 1997 and it wouldn't have arisen in the first place.</p></speech>

So we were right to call at that time for a detailed review and when it came back through the subsequent years, when enforcement powers came back for consideration again we raised that issue that there hadn't been a proper stress testing of the model and I think that was proven to be a serious vulnerability.  Obviously when the guarantee ... you know that bank collapse started, as we've outlined ... the Taoiseach has outlined in detail why we supported the guarantee.  You were at a point where, you know, you feared a run on the banks, you needed to protect depositors ... but we raised all of the right questions about whether, you know, was there an adequate buffer and could this impact?  I think as soon as it became clear that this wasn't just a liquidity issue, it was a solvency issue, we strongly advocated that within each bank, there should be the separation out of a bad bank, which would have left the shareholders and the bondholders holding, if you like, the, the assets that were questionable and they would have to recover from those assets as best they could ... to recover the value of their shareholding and their bond holding.  That was clearly the model we, we, advocated, the separation of good from bad.  That wasn't done, as you know, but that was the position we took and I think we were right in that.  We took the view that, you know, Anglo, there shouldn't be more recapitalisation of Anglo, that it was a, a bank that should be wound down in an orderly fashion at a time when we were being told that it should be kept open as a going concern.  So, we did take different views on those.  I think, by and large, at the time, based on the information we had available to us, those were, were sensible policy positions to, to take up.  So, you know, I think we, we have a very credible record in relation to how we handled this, this crisis, but clearly, no one has perfect foresight or perfect hindsight and, you know it ... this was an appalling disaster that no one anticipated in its scale or impact on people but I think the policy position and the scrutiny that we applied was the right ... scrutiny and, and policy positions.</p></speech>

Agreed.  We now proceed with our second hearing of today, that's the hearing with An T&aacute;naiste, Joan Burton TD, and Mr. Pat Rabbitte TD.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session, and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  Our next witnesses today are An T&aacute;naiste, Joan Burton TD, and Mr. Pat Rabbitte TD.  You're both very welcome before the inquiry and the committee this afternoon.</p> <p>  Today the inquiry is focusing upon the role of the Oireachtas and the effectiveness of the Oireachtas oversight of the Government in the build-up to the crisis and in responding to the crisis.  In particular, our focus will be on three lines of inquiry: the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector and the economy, analysis of the key drivers for budget policy and the appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Rabbitte TD are, therefore, appearing before the inquiry today in the context of their respective roles as the Labour Party's spokesperson in finance while in opposition and as the leader of the Labour Party while in opposition. </p> <p>  In normal circumstances - excuse me - when a witness appears before here, they don't have privilege and privilege is extended to them by virtue of this committee's powers.  In this regard, as both Members are current Members of the House, there is no requirement for me to extend privilege to the witnesses in that regard.  However, I would state that the witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subjects of these matters to these proceedings is to be given.</p> <p>  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right, and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p> <p>  The witness has, or the witnesses have been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  And now can I ask the clerk to administer the oath to both witnesses, please?</p></speech>

Mr. Chairman, you have directed that I attend before the inquiry to give evidence on three specified themes in the context of my role as leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007.  I have made a written submission, as directed.</p> <p>  I'm bound to say, Chairman, at the outset that it is my view that whoever and whatever was responsible for the banking crisis, it was not the Opposition.  As regards the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in scrutinising public policy on the banking sector, it is my view that the Oireachtas has been ill-equipped to scrutinise policy on the banking sector, that it has been the view for very many decades of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that scrutiny of the banking sector was safely reposed elsewhere, and that notwithstanding recent improvements, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann remains inadequately equipped to discharge this role, and few elected Members could perform such a role and at the same time perform their role as TDs as expected by the people.  The finance committee ought to be better resourced, not to second-guess the regulator or attempt to do his job, but to satisfy themselves that the regulatory mechanism is doing its job and to competently engage with the Minister.  </p> <p>  As regards the relationships to the property sector, this will always be a fraught area.  It is neither possible nor desirable to close off communication with the property sector but it is necessary to regulate that relationship.  That is why the enactment recently of legislation on the conduct of lobbying is welcome.  Any modern, functioning economy must have a certain level of construction activity but not one remotely near what we experienced during the property bubble, but a construction sector that could be up to twice what it is at the moment.  Public policy should seek to avoid developers using clandestine contacts to dictate policy.  </p> <p>  It would appear that some powerful individuals in the financial sector had been lobbying for some time for a bank guarantee.  The challenge is to know what's going on, and that if there are vested interests at stake, that they should be declared.  Enactment of the Regulation of Lobbying Bill of 2015 will help in respect of the relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector.  The belief abroad is that developers and builders have, on occasion, exerted considerable formative influence on public policy.  In addition to the lobbying Act of 2015, I believe that the package of reforms in the area of political funding will also have a positive impact.  Political parties, and especially those generously funded by the construction sector in the past, will now be less reliant on that source of funding.  There's nothing wrong with Government learning from outside expertise.  However, it is the task of Government to distinguish the public interest from vested interest.  </p> <p>  If Parliament is to be indicted for not adequately supervising the supervisors, then parliamentarians would have to be adequately resourced to do the job.</p><p>The typical TD is not - in respect of the detail of regulation - in a position to forensically second guess the regulator, nor can the typical TD reasonably be expected to discharge his or her usual functions and, at the same time, competently probe the entrails of banking.  Most TDs have believed that regulation of the banks was in competent, well-paid, safe hands and that the job of the Minister for Finance was to keep an eye on them.  On both scores, that belief has taken something of a bashing.  However the challenge is not to abandon that model but to reinforce it.<br/><br/>In my written submission, I have drawn the attention of the inquiry to the ... firstly, the report of the DIRT inquiry, of which I was a member, and, secondly, to a report that I prepared in 2005 for the public accounts committee entitled &quot;Proposals for alterations in the way that Estimates for expenditure are considered by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  Both reports, I think, are relevant when considering the effectiveness of Oireachtas oversight of the banking sector.  Indeed many of the changes introduced over recent years derived from the recommendations of the DIRT inquiry report, including the proposal for a stand-alone Oireachtas commission that enables parliamentarians themselves to take decisions concerning the effective conduct of parliament.  The primary concern of parliament and government should be to ensure that there is in place a banking regulatory system in line with best practice.  The tug of war between the two Government parties that gave birth to the hybrid regulatory structure in place at the time of the crisis did not help and has facilitated the buck-passing that we have seen at the inquiry.  The Minister for Finance ought to be satisfied that the Department of Finance has the skillset to professionally interrogate the regulator and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - especially the evolving network of parliamentary committees - should be equipped to engage professionally with the Minister and, where necessary, the Central Bank.<br/><br/>A great deal, Chairman, on your ... on your third theme, a great deal has been said and written about the causes of the worst crash that the State has ever experienced.  At the end of the day, the cause of our downfall was mainly a property bubble fuelled by tax incentives and over-lending for land and property investment and, indeed, reckless lending in the case of commercial property.  The Labour Party sought to address this issue over the years - that we were concerned with here - in a variety of ways.  In our view, speculation in building land was the root cause of the explosion in house prices.  Consequently, the party introduced the Planning and Development (Acquisition of Development Land) Bill of 2003 to combat speculation in building land.  The Bill would cap the price of building land at existing unzoned use value plus 25%.  At the time, the cost of the site could be 40% of the price of a home.  The Bill also sought to enable local authorities to intervene to cause hoarded building land to come into use.  The Bill went, in our view, to the heart of the problem.  The Government voted down the Bill.  Expert legal advice had assured us to the effect that the Labour Bill could be enacted within the existing constitutional framework.  Our experience had been that pressuring the Government to deal with land speculation only resulted in the then Taoiseach kicking the issue into the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  No action was taken, although the All-Party Committee on the Constitution did, in due course, report and endorsed our approach.  That committee was advised by Gerard Hogan, senior counsel, at the time, and joint editor of Kelly's <i>The Irish Constitution</i>.  He is now a judge of the Court of Appeal.<br/><br/>Labour consistently highlighted how the different property-based tax incentives and tax shelters hollowed out the tax base so that the average PAYE income taxpayer was required to pay the relevant rate but the wealthy or very high earners could mitigate their tax liability.  Meanwhile, these property-based tax incentives and shelters were driving the property bubble.  We travelled Labour policy wherever the opportunity arose, by way of parliamentary question, amendments to legislation, amendments to finance Bills, in particular, and in public discourse generally.  We challenged the pattern of Government delay in tackling these issues, which consisted of reviews of these schemes that postponed action, allowed deadlines to be extended or referred possible solutions to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, on whose recommendations no action was ever taken.  Sometimes our efforts were merely to persuade Government to stick to their own measures, such as demanding the re-introduction of 60% rate of capital gains tax on the sale of hoarded building land to encourage builders to release land.  This had been done, following the Bacon report, by the Government in 1998 but then dropped in a subsequent budget.  Like most public representatives, Labour became more alarmed at the constantly rising house prices that were putting ... making homes ... that were making homes unaffordable even for two persons on reasonable income.<br/><br/>I am bound to say, however, Chairman, that I did not make the connection between our alarm and what was happening in the housing market and a risk to the financial system.  I must admit that it never occurred to me that our banks might fail.  That fear did not surface in mainline debate until the autumn of 2008, despite Morgan Kelly's article.  There were no credible economic reports that I knew of suggesting that the banks might be at risk.  In fact, there were national and international reports suggesting that the Irish financial system was sound.  Even towards the end, the public commentary was mainly about a soft landing.  The conviction was that those charged with regulating and supervising the banks were doing their job.<br/><br/>In summary, then, and in conclusion, Chairman, it's not the job of a TD to regulate the financial system.  It is the job of Government to satisfy itself that the regulatory system is fit for purpose.  It is the job of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to hold the Government to account.  What distinguishes the Irish collapse from the experience of most other countries was the property bubble.  We live in a winner-takes-all, adversarial system of parliamentary democracy which has its defects but is probably better than the alternative.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

In brief, I agree with the assessment in the Regling and Watson report that while the crisis clearly had an international dimension, this was very much, unfortunately, a homemade crisis in many respects.  The economic crisis, of which the banking crisis was an integral part, I think, for the Irish people it can be viewed as a tragedy in three acts.  In act 1, the key decisions which led to the crisis were made by the Government, the banks and the Financial Regulator.  In act 2 came the unravelling of the solvency of the banking system.  This was also the point at which the then Government made the fateful decision to provide the bank guarantee.  This was the most damaging and expensive decision in terms of the cost of dealing with the crisis, which unfolded in act 3.</p> <p>  The decision to provide a blanket guarantee was made with effect from 30 September 2008.  It's a matter of record that at the end of the subsequent D&aacute;il debate, the Labour Party was the only party to oppose the guarantee.  We did so because we believed that the extent of the potential liability posed a real risk to the solvency of the State and I believe that this decision has been fully vindicated by subsequent events.  The banking guarantee locked the country into a cycle which led to the bailout of 2010 and everything that flowed from that date.  In looking at how the crisis arose, cheap credit became available in Ireland after the adoption of the euro.  As Regling and Watson identified, much of this lending was concentrated on the property sector and comprised loans to a limited number of developers.  This pattern of lending was reckless in the extreme and it should have prompted intervention by the Financial Regulator.  However, no such intervention occurred.  The practice of light-touch regulation prevailed and, with the benefit of hindsight, it's also clear - not least from the contributions made in this forum - that a measure of regulatory capture applied.</p><p>Put simply, the regulator, the regulation system and structure was too close to the banks.</p><p> During the D&aacute;il debate in 2003 on the Bill to establish the Irish Financial Regulator, I said, and I quote, "The Bill does not refer to the necessity for parameters and ethical criteria for responsible lending.  This is a major deficiency."  Tax based incentives put in place by Government spurred on the reckless lending.  I believe that tax-based incentives can play a legitimate and a very positive role in stimulating development in certain circumstances, such as to encourage necessary, social or economic development, particularly where the market has failed to do so.  Any such incentive, though, has to be proportionate, targeted and temporary.  However, by the time I became the finance spokesperson of the Labour Party, which was in late 2002, appointed by Deputy Rabbitte to the opposition and for some time before that, it was very clear many of these tax incentives had actually run their course.  It was also clear that their continued use was stroking ... stoking a construction industry which was already overheated and a bubble in land prices which itself, the bubble, was aided and abetted by grossly irresponsible rezoning decisions in some parts of the country.</p><p> In my Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill in February 2003, I said:  "The Minister for Finance is obviously a disciple of the Augustinian school.  He always announces his steadfast determination to dismantle the bewildering edifices of tax shelters but [he] is never quite ready to do [so]".   My prediction, I think, proved, you know, prescient, as year after year, the Minister constantly found reasons to delay their expiry.  I repeatedly stressed my view that the incentives were being used as a tax shelter rather than as a development tool and they were being used by wealthy individuals to shelter income from Revenue.  I pointed out in my 2006 reply to the budget, more than 1,000 of Ireland's wealthiest people paid ... these were people with incomes in excess of a million euros a year, paid an effective tax rate of between nought and 5%.</p><p> I believed that the Government of the day was, as I said at the time, addicted to tax shelters.  No doubt, this was, in part, a matter of political judgment and prejudice, but I believed then, and I still believe, that the reliance of the principal Government party on financial contributions from developers also played a part.  The culture of the Galway tent was unhealthy for politics and it contributed to pushing the building industry ultimately to disaster.  </p><p> Also during this time, I pointed to what I considered to be abuses of the stamp duty regime to reduce the liability of wealthy individuals.  Amongst those abuses was the practices of resting contracts, whereby the parties to a particular agreement delayed or avoided the execution of a stampable document so as to reduce or to avoid or to postpone almost indefinitely liability.  Another abuse was the use of contracts for difference, which I highlighted in 2006.  The committee will be aware that a proposal for a modest duty - 1% - on such contracts was withdrawn by the Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, following extensive lobbying from finance and other industry sources.</p><p> Contracts for difference were subsequently used by investors in Anglo Irish Bank, with disastrous consequences.  Had the duty been in place, it might have given - the 1% ... it might have given some of those involved pause for thought.  </p><p> The budget was in surplus in every year from '97 to 2007, with the exception of 2002.  And, in fact, when the previous rainbow Government handled over, there was a very small surplus on the budget.</p><p> Contemporary estimates of the structural balance by the EU Commission, the IMF, and the OECD did not identify a problem.  The large disparity between the apparently healthy headline figures and the underlying reality was accounted for by the over-reliance on construction related taxes that the committee members are well aware of - stamps, CAT, VAT, CGT, all elements of the bubble in tax revenues.  This over-reliance on construction-related taxes was the root cause of the collapse in the national finances, which occurred in 2008, and subsequently.  The problem was compounded by the fact that the budget policy was driven by the electoral cycle rather than by the needs of the economy.  It's no coincidence that the peaks in public spending occurred immediately before the 2002 and the 2007 general elections.  </p><p> I've been asked to comment specifically on the oversight role of the Oireachtas in the period under review and my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, has dealt with it in detail.  The primary role of the Opposition is to hold the Government to account.  I believe that the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have generally served us well but they're far from perfect.  Our system is adversarial - Government proposes and opposition usually opposes.  One of the reasons behind the establishment of the committee system was to provide a less adversarial setting for debate.  In recent years, it has become normal practice for independent regulators to be made accountable to the Oireachtas in the first instance and while this practice is right in principle, it's important that committees are sufficiently resourced to enable members to carry out their duties effectively.  The accountability of the Financial Regulator is a case in point.</p><p> It seems that in the run up to the banking crisis, everyone concerned, including the Taoiseach, Government Ministers, senior civil servants and the Oireachtas, presumed that the regulator was doing its job and that the assurances of banking stability did not warrant serious investigation.  This assumption proved to be fatefully wrong and Deputy Rabbitte has traced the evolution of the committee system after the DIRT inquiry.  The system now is better equipped to do its job than it was ten years ago.  Nevertheless, it's still debatable if a better resource system of Oireachtas oversight would or could have pointed up the potential dangers facing the banking system before the crisis hit.  Equally, I doubt if our current Oireachtas oversight could prevent a similar crisis happening again if those who are primarily responsible for preventing such crisis - the Government, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance - were blind to its very existence.  You know, I'm very conscious of raising through questions, through statements, through contributions to committees and to the Dail a whole series of issues, some of which I've referenced to there, but, you know, I was doing that as an opposition Deputy on behalf of the Labour Party.  </p><p> So, better resourcing of the committee system is important if we're to empower the Oireachtas in its dealings with the Executive.  And I would say, if your inquiry is minded to make such a recommendation, then I, as leader of the Labour Party, will give the recommendations, in that respect, very serious consideration.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Thank you very much Chair, and you're very welcome T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Rabbitte.  T&aacute;naiste, can I ask you, as the architect of the Labour Party's financial and economic policy leading into the 2007 general election, and if I can take you to the agreed budgetary platform with Fianna Gael, which will be put up on screen there now.  And essentially, the Labour Party was proposing going into that election that over the following five years that current expenditure would increase by 17.4 billion, capital expenditure by about 3.5 billion.  You were proposing a tax package of tax reductions of 2.4 billion.</p><p>So, in total, a package of about &euro;23 billion over the following five years.  And it was based on an assumption of economic growth from the Department of Finance and ESRI of in the region of 4% and you were recommending that current expenditure would grow at double the rate of economic growth over that period.  So, how can you claim - if you do claim - that the Labour Party's proposals going into that election were any less pro-cyclical than the outgoing Government at that time?</p></speech>

First of all, the Labour Party manifesto was very much prepared in conjunction with other Labour Party colleagues, including, obviously, the then leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte.  But in the documents that you sent me, I just want to highlight two quotes from the ESRI reports which, when I read, just brought me back to the atmosphere of that period.  In the ESRI report of December 2005, the ESRI actually spoke about the growing aura of invincibility about the Irish economy and then, in the very last paragraph, they introduced, as was common at the time, and the then Taoiseach of the time utilised it quite a lot, the notion of a "soft landing"; bit like a soft day in the west of Ireland; a little bit of rain, but it wouldn't do you any harm.  That's the way it was set out.  And, as late as May 2008, and I remember when I read this being really upset by it, the ESRI said there were difficulties but the Irish economy would rebound; it was resilient in face of adverse circumstances.  And again, one of the famous quotes of the era: "The fundamentals are sound".  Now, in that context, if you were to take the Labour Party manifesto of then, you would see that the Labour Party manifesto is, first of all, based on the growth estimates and figures provided by, and examined by, the Department of Finance, the ESRI figures-----</p></speech>

The issues you put on the record in your Second Stage speech and by the then ... and by Deputy Gilmore, as leader, were narrow in nature about the publication of the guarantee scheme, about remuneration that the bankers would enjoy, about how lending practices were going to be regulated, going forward.  You supported the Bill at Second Stage and opposed it, subsequently, but can you just outline to us how your alternative would have worked?

I think we're all wiser now that we know that when banks fail, the cost is very significant.  However, if the crisis which was evolving in relation to the two institutions that I was concerned about ... and, by the way, I was a member then of the finance committee and we had the various banking companies' representatives in on several occasions and the ... in the course of questioning, it was always to probe how they were actually dealing with, in effect, the bubble.

So the guarantee was a disaster for the Irish people because, in effect, what happened with the guarantee was the Irish taxpayer took sole responsibility for the debts of the banks when, in fact, in my view, the effort to save the banks should have been concentrated on the high street banks, the banks with which ordinary business, commercial, depositor life in Ireland is dependent.</p></speech>

I feel I must bring in Deputy Rabbitte.  And I want to just raise one issue with Deputy Rabbitte and that is the use of the platform that an Opposition party has through all the various mechanisms in the Oireachtas - the Private Members', Leader's Questions, ministerial questions.  And I have examined the record of Fine Gael and Labour during a number of years in Opposition - 2005, 2006, 2007.  And during that period, for example, 2005, '06, '07, Labour had 24 Private Members' motions and they dealt with a range of issues, all important, from bin charges to class sizes a number of times, civil union legislation, public transport in Dublin, Coroners Bill, health spending, etc., and I ... the Leader's Questions are similar and more.  Why is it that the key issues, when we look back now, of the regulation of the banking system, the growth in lending to construction and property, for example, and pro-cyclical fiscal policy didn't feature strongly enough during that period?  And does it ... does it go back to what you said in your witness statement, "In our adversarial system of parliamentary democracy, governments always want to do good things and oppositions always want government to do more good things."  Does that characterise the Labour Party's approach in Opposition?</p></speech>

That's the normal democratic impulse.  The implication, I think, behind your question, Deputy, is that before 7 o'clock on the fateful morning that the Labour Party somehow had known that this was going to happen.</p></speech>

It was the most extraordinary story in my lifetime that I woke up to that morning.  So, no, we didn't have a refined alternative.  We had to, there and then, react to the proposals being brought forward and all I can say to you is that I think - and it's very easy be wise in hindsight - I think that if I had been walking through the streets of Dublin and we had Irish citizens on the streets trying to withdraw their money from Northern Rock, I think I would have gone back to the Department and said, "What in the name of God is going on here?  Shouldn't we have a look under the bonnet of the other banks?"  And that was 11 months, almost 12 months, earlier.  So we might have had a refined alternative because I heard Mr. Cardiff say to you that there were prominent figures in the financial sector making representations about a guarantee and so on.  So I think you know very well, whether it's a good practice or not, Deputy McGrath, that Leader's Questions tend to be prompted by the issue of the day.  However, on construction, we did raise it, and we did raise it consistently in all of the particular instruments that were open to us from the Private Members' Bill in terms of trying to cap the price of development land-----</p></speech>

I would say that I became the finance spokesperson for the Labour Party in late-2003, just before ... in late-2002, just before the budget for 2003 - I think the week before the budget of 2003, which was in early December 2003 - and between then and 2007, I used my opportunities as finance spokesperson for the Labour Party to lay out a series of issues that I had around, in particular, the bubble that was developing in relation to land speculation and in relation to construction in Ireland.  Now, in any kind of examination of banking, one thing that bankers and those that regulate banks should always be on the lookout for, because it happens in banking all the time, is the development of bubbles.  I represent the constituency of Dublin West.

Secondly, then, as I've referenced in my statement, I became very concerned, as time went on, at the build-up of the bubble in relation to stamp duty where companies could rest contracts and not actually pay the stamp duty.  The one that I drew attention to particularly was a particular development at the Irish Glass Bottle site and the tax break incentives which underpinned the development of the bubble.</p><p>There were ... in successive budgets in those years, both Minister McCreevy and Minister Cowen brought forward a whole series of tax breaks for private hospitals, for private nursing homes, for a whole series of different activities, sports injury clinics.  There's a long list of them and that again certainly caused extreme apprehension to me that what was happening was a bit of a runaway train and I advocated that that should be brought to an end.</p></speech>

Putting it into context, on the night of the bank guarantee in question, Anglo Irish Bank, purely a monoline bank, 82% commercial real estate, 1% residential and while all the conversation to date has been upon residential, and then the remaining 17% was corporate lending attached to commercial real estate.  Mr. Rabbitte, had you knowledge of the commercial real estate sector and where it had gone to?  Try and exclude the portion that the T&aacute;naiste has discussed to date.  Had you information about the over-exuberance of the commercial real estate sector?</p></speech>

I didn't know it was as clustered as the figures subsequently bore out but I knew the type of client it had, I knew of the complaints of other banks that some of their high net worth individuals and corporates were complaining that they weren't getting a similar yield to what Anglo Irish was providing.

I became aware that for instance, developments like, say, multi-storey car parks were becoming vehicles not simply for development but they were becoming vehicles for tax avoidance by high net worth individuals and in this, there was just a very significant build-up of what I felt was activity, not for the purposes of the genuine development which the country needed, but development of activity for acquiring tax breaks and therefore shielding wealth from taxation.  And that contrasted, you know, very sharply with say, small businesses, or indeed individuals who couldn't have utilised those kind of breaks.  And in every budget there was a series of additional tax breaks built in, which were essentially designed to stimulate activity but became even more so a tax avoidance mechanism.  I actually campaigned around tax justice, that allowing somebody with a &euro;1 million income to pay tax of 0% to 5% was actually wrong and economically not proper.  And as time went by in the period 2002-2007, partly because, for instance, of ads in the paper, you saw that high net worth individuals were invited by various organisations to participate and invest into opportunities that were available.  And, Deputy, almost all of those opportunities were construction-related.  And, you know, that was my concern.</p></speech>

If I could move on, please.  The '07 Labour manifesto proposed a 2% cut in the basic rate of income tax.  One of the criticisms here had been the narrowing of the tax base.  Would the 2% on the basic rate ... would have cost a lot of money, I don't have a figure, but the fact that it was on the basic rate, it would have been billions.  Would this commitment not have further eroded the tax base?  And what policy did Labour Party have to broaden the tax base to provide more stable revenues for Government?  And that's for both please, I'll start with Mr. Rabbitte.</p></speech>

If I could just very quickly.  I'll just clarify.  From '97 to '07 the higher rate reduced from 48% back to 41%.  The basic rate reduced in a similar amount as well.

They could minimise their tax liability or mitigate it.  The small person trapped in PAYE and so on could not.  So, you know, it was a measure that I think in terms of trying to analyse what caused the banking crash, it might not, in your view, have been good fiscal policy but it was of piddling insignificance in terms of what caused the crash.</p></speech>

It had to be replaced with something else.  And the question is: did the Labour Party have plans in place to broaden the tax base or, subsequent to what Deputy Rabbitte has said, would that plan have had to be ignored if you had gone into government at that stage?</p></speech>

First of all, I spoke at length about the notion of a minimum effective tax rate.  In other words, no matter how many allowances are available to an individual, particularly a high-income individual, we would ensure, or the State would ensure, that that person had to pay a minimum effective rate of tax.  The second proposal was that some of the allowances I've spoken about should be capped and that in some cases they should be discontinued.  I also proposed, Deputy, that there would be a standing committee on taxation, having previously proposed a study, which ultimately Deputy Cowen did actually carry out but didn't implement the recommendations, a study of the actual cost of tax expenditures.  And I proposed that there be a standing commission committee on taxation which would continuously look at the costs of tax arrangements which had built up in the system because I believed that if there was more information available that it would have been possible to make better judgments and better decisions about how to manage the national finances responsibly.</p> <p>  In relation to the proposal about reducing-----</p></speech>

In relation to the proposal about reducing the lower rate of tax, remember, as you've just said, the upper rate of tax had come down by some seven points over the period and we were concerned that ordinary, you know, working families, people on modest incomes, particularly young people going into employment, that they, for instance, would enter the tax situation at a lower point.  Now it was a very modest proposal and all of our proposals were subject, obviously, to the budgetary process of when the resources would be available to do that.  But it was in the ... you see, there was the comparison that I think was in, particularly in Deputy Rabbitte's mind, was there had been this enormous reduction in taxes for people who had been very very well ... who were very well ... who were very wealthy-----</p></speech>

I mean, it is true that the environment for that election was immensely competitive.  You'll recall the address that the then Taoiseach gave to his Ard-Fheis, where he spelled out a range of issues, I have the list, but I don't want to put it on the record if it provokes anyone to unreasonable response.

I mean , you know, it wasn't any secret, every party was in possession of information about the property issue at that time and you know it got to such a stage ... I recall making a speech to the Association of European Journalists - I made a number of them at the time.  That was on 11 January 2007, or it's reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 11 January 2007, where I drew attention to the fact that our exports were beginning to dim in circumstances where more and more of our revenues were dependent on transactions related to the construction sector.  And it was attacked at the time, as I have it here, &quot;Rabbitte talks down the economy&quot; and you know some of the usual criticism.  The climate was not very receptive.  That was on 11 January 2007.  I gave a few interviews at the time to that affect.  Arguably, I should have the courage of my convictions and stayed with it, but it was not a winner.</p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte, as was referred to by Senator D'Arcy, the issue of the 2% cut to the basic rate of income tax was announced by you at the party conference just prior to the general election in 2007 when you announced it during the leader's speech that night.  Can I put it to you, that would ... I put the proposition to you that this was a tactical and deliberate decision to brand the Labour Party as a low income tax party in order to curry electoral support, and was a clear example of populist politics.</p></speech>

I wasn't minded to do that.  But in this particular one, as the speech shows I said very clearly, that if resources permitted, this is what we propose to do.  And we proposed to do it because we felt there was an inequity in terms of the cohort of people who got benefit each year, over the best part of ten years, from the tax system, disproportionately so, because they were high earners, and people on modest incomes didn't.  And you know it was designed to be a small contribution to alleviate the burden on people on modest incomes.</p></speech>

I'm asking specifically with regard to the soft landing theory, not to talk about kind of macro-forecasts and all the rest of it.  Can you give us documentation that shows us that there is something supporting a soft landing?</p></speech>

My contact with the Department of Finance was in those interactions.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance are actually saying it, do they have something in there that actually supports it?  I just need to get that answer, and I don't believe in "Yes" and "No", but I just need to get that pinned down.</p></speech>

But the Department of Finance, if I may say, made their presence available to Members of the Oireachtas via committees.  They were not, to my knowledge, available on other occasions, other than when they came in and they briefed the Opposition in relation to legislation - for example, annually on the Finance Bill.</p></speech>

Mr. Rabbitte, in your opening statement you say you were:<blockquote><br /><br />bound to say ... [you] did not make the connection between our alarm at what was happening in the housing market and the risk to the banking system.  I must admit ... it never occurred to me that our banks might fail.</blockquote>Why do you think it never occurred to ... and I think you mean &quot;you&quot; meaning all of you, or do you mean you yourself?</p></speech>

I'm talking about the property bubble, as it emerged and when it emerged and as it "growed and growed", like Topsy, and I'm saying that, no, frankly, I didn't - I regret - make the connection between the property bubble and the risk to the banking system.  I suppose partly because we were getting all these bouquets about the quality of our banks.  Anglo Irish won a competition somewhere, in Davos, as the best bank in the world, I think.  Bank of Ireland Private similarly, had some award, from memory, and we were being assured by the authorities, whose task it was to regulate the banks and make decisions about credit expansion and so on, that we had a very sound and robust banking system, and I bought it.</p></speech>

Were any of those documents, was any of that information, made available to you in your capacity as spokesperson or indeed, perhaps, to Mr. Rabbitte as leader ... or had you ...yes, or indeed to Mr. Gilmore as leader as it ... so would either of you ever have had access to those kind of documents?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.839" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#QQ00700"><p>No, no Senator, they weren't made available.  In fact any reference I've seen to those indicate that they were carried out in considerable secrecy because there was also a desire at the time, and in fact people often talked, particularly from the Government parties, talked about people wearing green jerseys.  There was also as there is now, but more so then, a great deal of inhibition in terms of Oireachtas rules of specific institutions being named.  There was one initiative which was undertaken by the finance committee partly at my suggestion.  The finance committee in those days made a visit to the United States every two years or so and it was due to be in the autumn of 2008, and I suggested to the Chair and to the members that with what was evolving, that perhaps we should try and go to the United States and see could we get some level of briefing and so on.  We did that, if I recall, in the week after Easter of 2008, and I have to say, I came back from that visit full of a certain amount of foreboding.  But, I want to reiterate again, my fears were very concentrated around the way Anglo Irish had developed, and Irish Nationwide, as a small building society.  There was an awful lot more information and commentary, and Deputy Rabbitte has referenced one significant piece of commentary, the Morgan Kelly articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which were suggesting increasingly that the Irish situation was fragile and at risk.  But as against that, I mean, the Department of Finance was very remote from mere Opposition Deputies, was very, it was entirely, if you like, related to in my experience, to the Government and the Government parties.</p></speech>

That would have been late April early May.</p></speech>

There was a lot of conversations, journalists were asking questions.  I was also using my position as an Opposition spokesperson to, as I said, talk about, for instance, reining in the tax-driven speculation in land because ... people often talk about the huge rise in construction prices but, Deputy Rabbitte referred to it earlier, the real rise in costs was actually in land costs.  Construction prices did rise, but it was the land values that rose, so that, say someone on a modest income who might have bought a house for &euro;250,000 or &euro;300,000, that kind of house was becoming priced at &euro;450,000 to &euro;500,000, and it was going out of the reach even of people who had employment in the public service.  It was all of those kind of happenings that were very concerning to anybody who was following what was happening in finance.</p></speech>

What were you thinking that action should or could be, given that we didn't see, if you like, any action until 30 September in a way and that was an emergency or a crisis driven action?

I was very disappointed when that Government went off in June or July of 2008 and then did not come back until September, when obviously the crisis literally exploded.</p></speech>

May I just say that I get the impression that the inquiry, as a result of hearing testimony to the fact that there were some big players in the financial sector advocating a guarantee and there were some senior officials considering the options and so on, I think it's important to say that the political system didn't know this at the time.  You know, we didn't go to bed on the night of 28 September knowing that the world would have changed on 29 September.  We didn't know.  I mean, this information in terms of did bankers approach us, did developers approach us ...  I mean ... this information was being kept under wraps prior to 28 September and after 28 September, the bankers felt they had got an insurance policy that insulated them.  So ... and in terms of the question about making the connection between the property bubble and the risk to the financial system, I think the record of the House will show for that night that two Deputies, Deputy Michael Noonan and myself, raised the question of solvency.  And as Deputy Burton has said, there was a great deal of caution around.  Banks weren't named by name and all the rest.  But we put in separate interventions, whether we were dealing purely with a liquidity crisis.  Now, the Minister for Finance of the day, the late Brian Lenihan, did not answer.  I wouldn't have expected him to answer.  I don't think the Minister for Finance could stand up and say, "Yes, I'm afraid, Deputy, it's wider than liquidity.  There is a solvency issue."  I don't think the Minister for Finance could say that.  But that's the first time and the record of the House will show it that question was raised.</p></speech>

The five-year construction of our plan was based on 4.5% growth per annum, which from memory, would have produced additional revenues to the Exchequer of in excess of &euro;11 billion.  So if you take the growth rate, provide for inflation, take the add on of what, 2%, it would be at least half that again.  So they were the revenues that we thought, based on the expert advice from agencies like the ESRI and the Department of Finance that were available to us.  There's always a reason to spend money.  I think we would have tried to spend it more wisely than what actually happened.</p></speech>

That was an exchange with Sean O'Rourke about a particular advertisement.  I was seeking to explain the issue of child benefit and why we pledged to hold it at what it was and why, in the circumstances, we had to make a modest cut in it.  And he said, ''You didn't explain any of that at the time, you just kept it simple'', and I said, ''Yes, isn't that what you tend to do at election time?''.  Especially if it's an ad, you have to keep it simple.  So, that's the first bit.</p></speech>

I mean, the revenues on the basis of the expert advice available to us suggested that we would have a cake that was large enough to do certain things that we wanted to do.  And we didn't resile, in any way, in the discussions with Fine Gael in respect of the things that we wanted to do, for example, in relation to pensions and property and other reliefs that were available.  We didn't resile from any of that.</p></speech>

What I said, Chairman, in the ... in my opening remarks ... what I said is that, in my view, the main cause of the disaster that befell our country was the out of control property bubble based ... spurred on by tax incentives and expansion real estate.  That was the cause of it and that was the specific thing I put in my statement.  Mr. ... Senator MacSharry is putting a different point to me and I am explaining to him why I don't agree with his characterisation of what I said.</p></speech>

If it were an appropriate benchmarking, I think it had a role to play at the time.  But, unfortunately, it became as so many things at that time a vehicle to dish out substantial amounts of money without discernment or discrimination.  But the notion of benchmarking in the public service or in the public sector is not a bad one at all.  It's the methodology and its implementation and all the rest, that matters.</p></speech>

I recall travelling to view a business park in Bristol when I was chairman of the county council, or when I was a member of Dublin County Council when we were designing what has now become Citywest Business Park, probably the most prestigious park in the country, and I presume it wasn't Dublin County Council who paid for us to travel.  I presume it were the developers who brought over six or eight or ten of us to view the park that we replicated at Citywest.  But I would regard that as part of my job and part of my duty rather than hospitality.  Yes, I've travelled to matches.  One friend of mine, in particular, is a small builder, or, maybe, more appropriately, to be truthful, I don't know how good he is at it, his father was the small builder, and I notice sometimes, Senator, that talent skips a generation.</p></speech>

I want to address, if I may, the role of Opposition and the ability, more actually, the ability of Opposition to hold the Government to account when it comes to big decisions like the guarantee.  So, T&aacute;naiste, when the guarantee was put on the table and put before the D&aacute;il, did you consult with Richard Bruton as to whether or not the Labour Party or Labour and Fine Gael would support the guarantee decision?</p></speech>

And I think people woke up to hear it being announced on RTE on the morning and there was considerable astonishment, shock, dismay.  I think all of the parties, and certainly in the Labour Party, we were invited to meet representatives of the Department of Finance, who were going to brief us, and that happened at intervals immediately after the guarantee on the day, and in several days afterwards.  I have to say, Deputy, that in the briefings that I received I asked a couple of questions in relation to two institutions, Anglo Irish-----</p></speech>

But there were very long periods in the House when there were conversations between Deputies from all sides of the House, because people were, obviously, extremely worried and exercised by what had befallen the country.  Now, at that time in terms of Fianna F&aacute;il and in terms of the Government's presentation, it was to be the cheapest bank guarantee in the world.</p></speech>

I happened purely by accident to meet my colleague Eamon Gilmore very early that morning and, you know, my mouth was open at the news I had just heard.  And I briefly discussed it with him.  Somebody had already been on to him about dated subordinated debt and he said that he had already decided that we should oppose it because he felt we were mortgaging the deeds of the country and there was no time to discuss with anybody else.  I mean, he got a phone call from Brian Lenihan at whatever time that morning and really everything happened very quickly.</p></speech>

You mentioned that Eamon Gilmore had already gotten phone calls about subordinated debt, so what did you know that others didn't that allowed you to vote against the guarantee decision?</p></speech>

This was just such an enormous insurance bet that we were wagering - literally the deeds of the country - on it never being called in and that was a pretty scary place to be.  Now I had advocated personally the nationalisation of Anglo privately and ... a date around this time, it's is on the record of the House, an intervention I made to that effect, following which the late Brian Lenihan came to me to say that I had a letter that morning published in <i>The Irish Times</i>concerning nationalisation of Anglo and concerning the fact that I read into what the Minister told the House that he too is in favour of nationalising Anglo.  He came to me to say that they had a two-hour meeting in the Department about replying to the letter that they decided in the event not to do so and that nationalising Anglo was not the way out that I might have thought it was.</p></speech>

I had stepped down a few months earlier as leader of the party.  Somebody in those circumstances does not intrude.

Well, if I might just take you back in a final question to when you were leader.  You spoke about it earlier, at the beginning of January 2007, prior to the election, talking about going out with some warning signs about the economy and you said you weren't onto a winner.  So did you deliberately decide not to campaign on fiscal ... prudent fiscal responsibility or to sound those warnings during the campaign in 2007?</p></speech>

In the environment in which we function, political party making its own forecasts has unfortunately little credibility.  You tend to fall back on the agencies, national and international, and they were all saying that the system was sound and the system was robust.</p></speech>

How do you make that transition?</p></speech>

We didn't resile from that in any way.</p></speech>

I have to honestly say that no, I didn't think that way Deputy.  In hindsight I probably should have but it just did not occur to me that in the context of almost 15 years of growth, an economy that wasn't shaken off course for very long by the dotcom bubble, that had bounced back that had a huge deficit in infrastructure and that was now able to access cheap money to build up that infrastructure, it didn't occur to me that it posed a risk to the financial system itself and maybe it should.</p></speech>

If you take the Leaders' Questions moment, which was introduced only latterly, you know, the Opposition take up the issue of the day, whatever party is in opposition, they take up ... whatever is the issue <i>du jour</i>is the issue that they run with, with an eye to the six o'clock news and the Government does its best to bat it back.  I don't think that is very effective in terms of accountability.  I think the evolution of the network of parliamentary committees offers an opportunity for the kind of minute accountability that you are referring to that is not provided for in the D&aacute;il Chamber so I think the answer to your question is, &quot;not very good&quot;.</p></speech>

And in your view in relation to, again this period and the financial crisis, do you believe that the Oireachtas ... was the Oireachtas sufficiently aware of the stakeholders with whom Government Ministers consulted in the pre-legislative stage of legislation around this period and how was that information made available, if it was?</p></speech>

I would disagree with the Chairman if his question to Deputy Burton implies that he believes there would have been close contact between the leadership of an Opposition party and, say, the senior officials in the Department of Finance.  That did not happen in my experience.  Yes, I personally had interaction with senior officials in the Department of Finance after the crash but I mean, the system operates on the basis that the senior officials serve Government and they are very wary and overly secretive about the Opposition and I think as well that this democracy business was never intended for the same people to be in government for 14 years.  When you look at it, it is not just the same party, it is almost the same people and I think that there is a danger in those circumstances, that there are some senior civil servants, if they don't become leveraged onto the side of what seems to be the permanent political Government, they at least are not as robust as they might be in advising Government that they have qualms about the direction of policy.</p></speech>

But, in terms of ... you know, Government - whatever Government - tends to keep its cards very close to its chest and it doesn't say in the House, you know, "There's a weak link here, and let's hope that Pearse Doherty doesn't hear about it".

Minister Lenihan himself went to the Attorney General and circumvented Cabinet because he was concerned about leaks.  If these issues, in terms of issues of national importance, can't be entrusted by a Minister to Cabinet, how could they be trusted to the Opposition where, more than likely, would be on their way out to RTE to try and get the slot on "Morning Ireland" the next morning to brief the public, you know.

I'm not so sure that in terms of the particular issue that we're talking about ... I wouldn't be that critical of the Minister of the day in terms of him not sharing the information that there were deep concerns in his Department about the future of the banking system and that options were being examined and being prepared.  I mean, if that information had come out it would have precipitated the day and would have rushed us into a situation where, you know, the situation could be worse.  Now, I would be critical of the Minister of the day in that I'm not sure, you know, what he was doing driving around south Dublin and eating garlic late after midnight shortly before the collapse.  I would have thought that, ever since Northern Rock, there was time there to sit down and say, "What's going on in our own banks and what measures can we take?"  And I presume he was being told that everything is hunky-dory.  And as far as I can see, there are some people - I don't think they were dishonest - I think there are some people at the top of the banks themselves who were behaving recklessly but who didn't even know the depth of the crisis themselves.  And I think to ask a Member of Dail Eireann whether he or she should have been able to divine what was going on ... I don't think is the way the real world operates.</p></speech>

No, that's clear.  Mr. Rabbitte, and finally on this here, you were a member of the DIRT inquiry committee.  And one of the findings was the undue close relationship between the State apparatus - in the form of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank - and the Irish financial institutions.  We have it from the DIRT report, it's on page 52, but I quote from it, just it says:<blockquote><br /><br />There was a particularly close and inappropriate relationship between banking and the State and its Agencies. The evidence suggests that the State and its Agencies were perhaps too mindful of the concerns of the banks, and too attentive to their pleas and lobbying.</blockquote>Now, I put that out there ... as a former member of the DIRT inquiry, which did, to a lot of people's minds, a lot of good work ... we're sitting here in another inquiry, the findings of the inquiry that you were at seems to be some of the things that we're investigating into just a number of years later.  So, in your opinion, did the establishment of the Financial Regulator's office in 2003 address the concerns raised by the DIRT inquiry in their recommendations and, if not, why do you think they were ignored?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#VV01800"><p>Well, I think that particular conclusion related to the concern that was there at the time that the consumer dimension was virtually ignored by the Central Bank; that the Central Bank saw its job as the prudential supervision of the banking sector and it was not concerned with consumer issues and there were a number of conflagrations about consumers being done down and it not having been policed and them not having redress.  So I think it was in that particular context.  Did 2003 resolve that?  I mean, a lot of messing went on with that right from the publication of the DIRT report until the Bill was brought into the House.  I think maybe three, four years might have elapsed, and a lot of messing went on in a row between the two parties in government - the PDs wanted a green field regulator, Fianna F&aacute;il, generally, wanted to retain it with the Central Bank,  And the compromise was a hybrid, which, I think, you know, was unfortunate because, you know, I have watched snatches of your extraordinary work on this committee when the opportunity has presented - and I don't have much else to do nowadays so I get my kicks watching you guys and so on - and I think, you know, you bring in one person responsibility ... who's responsible, you think, for regulation and he passes the buck to the Central Bank, you bring in the Central Bank and he says, "No, no, the legislation says that's the job of the regulator", and they sling the ball the ball out the wing.  I think the substantial conclusion that I would like to see this inquiry draw, if I may suggest, is that we have classic case here of regulatory capture.  I think we set up a regulator and I think, before you could say "Jack Robinson", he was doing the biddings of the banks rather than the other way around.  And I think that's the tragedy ... that's the genesis of the tragedy that has befallen us.</p></speech>

When we take the prevailing ethos of the period 2000 up to 2007, when, some would say, the entire establishment - from the financial markets to the media to the established political parties, or the majority of the Oireachtas, say - were saturated with an ethos that provided for maximisation of profit, maximisation of deregulation and privatisation, what, I think, <i>The New York Times</i>, in 2005, referred to Ireland as&quot; the Wild West&quot; of finance, would it have made a difference, really, no matter how skilled the Oireachtas ... or the Opposition was at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#WW01100"><p>Well, <i>The New York Times</i>article, which I always regarded as a bit of a wake-up call, because I was finance spokesperson then, basically related to the lack of regulation and oversight, particularly in relation to the IFSC because, as regulation developed in Ireland and after the Act that Deputy Rabbitte has referred to ... I think the McDowell report was 1999, it was discussed in the period up to 2002, and then the legislation began to be brought in after the 2002 general election.  But actually, Deputy, <i>The New York Times</i>comment was about the fact that the IFSC and certain types of insurance companies by then were not, as I understand it, regulated at all.  So, there was a move to regulation generally, but the development of regulation in Ireland was very slow and the publication of information and questioning of regulators, which is now, obviously, much more common, just ... it was in its absolute, bare infancy at that point in time.</p></speech>

That ... I understand that.  Let me return to 2003 and the Bill that Deputy Gilmore introduced into the D&aacute;il called the Planning and Development (Acquisition of Development Land) (Assessment of Compensation) Bill 2003 and it related to concern at the speculation and profiteering, perhaps, some would say, that was manifest in the area of building land.  Why didn't you introduce legislation since you went into government this time to control the type of abuses that were pointed up by the Labour Party at that stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#WW01300"><p>In relation to this specific Government?  Well, at that time, and I should have said this to Deputy Doherty, there was a very strong set of legal opinion, and we were given to understand right up to the Attorneys General, and, in fact, you will recall even on the old Dublin County Council, of which you and I were members, Deputy, that the advice was that, if this approach were followed, that it could result in very significant compensation claims.  And, if you like, that had a chilling effect on the support for such legislation, so the Labour Party put it forward but it didn't get any widespread support.  What Fianna F&aacute;il did - well, I think it was led by Fianna F&aacute;il but they were in coalition Governments at the time - was, later, they introduced the part V where developers would have to make certain contributions in relation to the supply of social housing, or make contributions, but I have to say, Deputy, that never worked particularly well either.  So, there has been a continuous debate around both the desirability, which I would think is highly desirable in order to prevent the build-up of bubbles, and the legal opinion that such a development would give rise to significant compensation costs-----</p></speech>

One of the tax shelters, or lessening of tax was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government in the 1997 December budget, reducing capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, which was enormously helpful to those who were speculating on building land and, as was seen in the media, making large amounts of money.  But, in 2007, why did your manifesto say specifically that you would remain with the low rate, rather than going back to 40%, or even 60%, which you had looked for?</p></speech>

You can have a nominal rate of tax, as happened in Ireland in income tax in the '80s, the '60s, '70s and '80s, but, in fact, if you have very, very high nominal rates, what happens is wealthy people can afford to employ tax advisers or put much of their activity offshore and, thus, end up avoiding all of the ... almost all of the taxation.  I would prefer to have a situation where you have real rates of tax, you have minimum effective rates of tax, which is what I proposed, Deputy.  And, therefore, everybody is a contributor and those contributions are progressive, but I'm not in favour of capital gains tax rates, for example, like you've suggested, of 60%.  That has never been my position.  I'm in favour-----</p></speech>

One instance was a &euro;53 million profit for a syndicate.  The effect of that capital gains reduction was, in round figures, a tax of &euro;20 million on those individuals to &euro;10 million.  Would you not consider it socially beneficial that, in relation to building land particularly, speculation, profiteering, some might say, in relation to that, that you should have stood, in 2007, for a much higher rate of tax on gains in speculation?</p></speech>

The people who ran those businesses, Deputy, based the appeal for funds on the fact that the investors who invested into those funds would find, through the use of appropriate tax mechanisms, that they would, in effect, be shielded from almost all taxation, the kind of tax breaks I referred to.  So, in literally hundreds of D&aacute;il questions and comments, I urge the then Government to significantly reduce those either by capping them, by the use of minimum effective tax rates, and by ending them because some of them, in my view, were entirely inappropriate.  There is a role of tax incentives but it has to be targeted, it has to be, in my view, temporary, and it has to be costed and that was my continuous position.</p></speech>

As Deputy Rabbitte is, you know, one of the most distinguished parliamentarians around here over the years and ... should the whole light-touch regulation just be kicked away down to the far field, in that we've never brought in legislation - I'm only here one term - that has no penalty and there's no legislation that says no penalty, you know, more than 5p shall be imposed on this particular legislation.</p><p>I mean, what we do is regulate and impose penalties and it's kind of an insult to a parliament, to say that it was practicing light-touch regulation.

We're operating nowadays in a global financial market and we can't afford not to have regard to that fact.  I mean, light touch ... light-touch regulation is ... or principles-based regulation is one thing but derelict regulation is a different thing and it seems to me that we've had derelict regulation.  You know, if you borrow from some of the countries whose banks didn't fail, you know, apply their system and enforce it, then it seems to me that in an international capitalist economy, that's probably as good as you're going to get.  You know, we're neighbours of the City of London, if we were to take dramatic radical decisions on our own, you know, what would be the implications, for example, for the IFSC?  You know, there's a lot of people employed there and, you know, it's of value to Ireland and so on.  So, I mean, I don't know enough about the question you ask me to give you a ... it's clear that under Governor Honohan, it is clear that he has tightened the situation up immensely.  Additional people, additional expertise, expertise from outside has been brought on board, and it's clear from some of the decisions that he has taken, that he has taken them irrespective of the political temperature of the day or irrespective of who's lobbying him and, you know, I would like to hope that that system can be made work.</p></speech>

That obviously has certain advantages but I think it also has disadvantages in the fact that one firm may be providing a whole range of services, and while firms have Chinese walls, whether in accounting or legal, that they don't share information, I certainly think that more diversity in terms of the functions that are carried out, perhaps by a bigger number of firms, would lead to perhaps more questioning.  But standard audits, Deputy, are designed to elicit certain information, whereas our banks faced a liquidity crisis.  And of course in the long run, and often in the very short run, a liquidity crisis turns into a solvency crisis.  Now, the audits of the banks and, you know, auditors, can ... there were internal auditors, but, you know, we have heard that internal auditors in certain circumstances did raise questions but they were contrarian views, very often were treated in that way, so they weren't well regarded.  I think the critical issue is that we have a more open society in terms of information, so that legitimate questions can be put.  I often found myself in a very contrarian position because I was questioning the orthodox explanation in relation to how the bubble was building up.  What surprises me, as I look back in the context for preparing for this, that in the history of commerce and banking and so on, bubbles are a constant problem.  And I'm just surprised that none of the institutions, as I look back, ever really seem to have queried or questioned the bubble.  The explanation then was a liquidity crisis and no one, as Deputy Rabbitte said earlier, seems to have then said, "But if a liquidity crisis is serious enough, it's actually going to bring the whole institution down."  And unfortunately, that's what happened.  But, auditors and people like that have their role to play.</p></speech>

But its not with regard to a particular committee, Senator.  It is my conviction that the network of committees that we have established are too onerous for a small House to bear.  I'm not talking about the quality or the membership of a particular committee, but if you have 650 Members in a Parliament, as does the neighbouring Parliament, it tends to develop specialisation.  It tends to bring people through as chairman of the foreign affairs committee, who is expert on foreign affairs, who has no expectation of being a Minister or who doesn't want to become a Minister, or whatever.  In our circumstances, in a very small House, if you strip out 30 Ministers and 30 Opposition Deputies to shadow them, it's a very small House.  I mean, our system is impeccably democratic.  Nobody can say that there's a point of view in the country that isn't represented here.  Some of them are strangers to legislating but they perform other very important roles.  And I think if you have too many committees or if you have circumstances where, for example, somebody has to rush down to room number three to get in three or four people to vote here, or people has to run off ... have to run off from this committee to another committee because there's a more important issue, their membership of ... they've dual membership of two committees, I don't think ... I don't think that that can work.  I mean Deputies, virtually all Deputies, there was one or two Deputies behind me earlier on that this doesn't apply to, but pretty much all Deputies have an extraordinary constituency workload.  And they have to do that as well.  And I think we need to be careful in a small House that we don't grow too many committees.</p></speech>

Good afternoon.  Firstly, Deputy Rabbitte, in relation to your opening statement on page 2, you said: "On the basis of evidence heard to date by this Inquiry it appears that a small number of influential individuals in the Financial Sector had more influence with government than did D&aacute;il Eireann".  Briefly, can you point to what evidence you're referring to, and indeed to the individuals or the types of individuals?</p></speech>

You know, and its a matter for the inquiry to establish whether that was purely a patriotic compulsion based on the fact that the people concerned have specialist knowledge that perhaps the rest of us wouldn't have, or otherwise, that's a matter for the committee.  I mean, personally I would like to know who were the owners of the subordinated debt.  I think that might be of some interest, that if we knew that, but that was the reference.</p></speech>

I want to turn to the T&aacute;naiste now, I only have about four minutes remaining.</p><p>T&aacute;naiste, in your witness statement, under the heading of "The policy failures that propagated the crisis", you were referring to the period following the adoption of the euro and up to mid-2007 and you stated that, "A more proactive regulator would have responded to these developments by taking action to slow [the] growth in credit and to prevent banks from lending beyond safe limits."  Did you, in your time as Labour finance spokesperson, request that any specific actions be taken along those lines?</p></speech>

Sweden and Finland had both had bank collapses but they responded in a different way to our blanket guarantee.  It still cost them a lot of money and it cost a lot of pain but it was a lot cheaper than the blanket bank guarantee in Ireland.  Essentially, they took out the bad banks, and they then sought to shore up the other banks so as to keep the domestic banking situation functioning.  So, you know, in terms of-----</p></speech>

In my own constituency, Deputy, there were people going door to door to local authority estates and they were landing outside a local authority house and saying to the householder "Well, I reckon this house is now worth &euro;150,000.  Do you have a mortgage on it?  Are you buying it?  What's the mortgage?"  "It's &euro;50,000."

That was what he mentioned in that particular column, and because it did not include a cap on bankers' pay.  What do you say to that view expressed by him and, indeed, some others?</p></speech>

Now, mind you, we will now recover most of what we lent to them through-----</p></speech>

I've gone through the record of the D&aacute;il from the debates that took place around the legislation surrounding the guarantee and you've referred earlier on to burning bondholders and insolvency issues.  I haven't - now, it was me trying to ... after the first question that was asked, I think, by Deputy McGrath - been able to find any reference of you commenting on that during those debates, but I've one particular quote that I just want to put to you.  "In the context of the Minister's failure to meet, in any way, legitimate requirements of the Opposition to protect the taxpayer [I think you were referencing the fact that he hadn't taken amendments on board] we are supporting him in bailing out some banks in order to protect the Irish financial system."  Now, that ... you have referenced in your previous response that some banks had to be bailed out but earlier you did infer, I think, in some of your evidence that you had concerns when you were ... when the guarantee issue arose about insolvency-----</p></speech>

But a comment was offered that they had a particular model, which I didn't appear to understand.  I have to say, that was a fairly seminal moment because my understanding of the position of those two banks was that they were, in fact, a serious contagion in the financial system in Ireland.  I was very anxious to see the main street banks in Ireland, particularly AIB and Bank of Ireland, actually salvaged as far as possible because they're just essential to doing business.  And the Labour Party didn't, in any way, approach, other than with a sense of deep tragedy and upset and concern, what had happened, because my fear was around what was going to happen to ordinary people in the fallout.</p></speech>

It broke this automatic entitlement that was there for Secretaries General of the Department of Finance to pass on to automatically ... it seems to me, automatically becoming Governors of the Central Bank.  I think that didn't help in terms of the incestuousness and so on.  I think the structural changes that he has made are far more effective than was the situation at the time of the crash.  I think the changes that have taken place in this House, for example, if you look at how the ... as you know, as a member of the committee, I'm struck even by coming back now to see how the present day finance committee structures its business and discharges its role as compared to what was there in the past and, of course, it's not long ago since there was not a finance committee in place at all.</p><p>I think in terms of the report referred to earlier that I prepared for the public accounts committee, you know, there may be an argument for further structural reform within the finance committee to put in place a specific budget committee, provided it were properly resourced.  It would have to be resourced because you can only ask Members of the House to do so much.  I mean, the variety of pressures that come on them and responses that they must make to their constituency is such that there is only so much they can ... and the expertise needs to be there.  So I think, you know, we've all learned, I hope, a great deal from this crash and one suspects that academia will be still writing books about it in 25 years' time.  So hopefully the fact that we all ... I shouldn't say all but if there are people who, unlike myself, knew that the financial system was at risk, we didn't hear from them at the time.  They kept it a well-guarded secret.</p></speech>

And I think that in the case of the Department of Finance, I think they had to have that suspicion or conviction, I don't know which.  I mean, I always thought in watching the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, before the committee, I always thought that the question that the committee should have asked him that they didn't asking him was that, if he didn't ask Mr. FitzPatrick when he was playing golf with him, why didn't he?  I mean, it seems to me that the whole purpose of the encounter was to ask FitzPatrick "What the hell is going on in your institution?"  And, you know, I say that without in any way imputing any dishonesty to the former Taoiseach because I believe he is an honest man and I believe that, you know, when the crash happened, he did his best by his lights to do right by the country.  But I can't for the life of me believe why there was a mediator running between himself and Anglo Irish Bank and he was playing golf with Anglo Irish Bank executives, that he didn't ask them what was going on.</p></speech>

What specifically would you have done differently in terms of when ... after June 2007, in dealing with the banks and in terms of a guarantee?  Specifically.

From the evidence I've heard, I think the Department of Finance, perhaps the politicians in government then, the people in finance were perhaps aware of it or alerted to a potential very serious risk.  Regulation which would have addressed some of the consumer protection issues, a bigger guarantee on deposits to prevent a run on the banks, that actually did happen.  I recommended that at that time.</p></speech>

I subsequently suggested that it would be &euro;75,000 and, in fact, Deputy, former Minister Brian Lenihan, the late Brian Lenihan ultimately raised it to &euro;100,000 and we supported that very strongly.  The second really big thing that was missing that would have been helpful was resolution, you know, in other words, it was almost impossible in the Irish legal structure to in fact have a bankruptcy or an insolvency in a bank.  We didn't have the legal mechanisms.  That's been subsequently addressed, it's a resolution mechanism that should have been there.  I certainly read Professor Honohan's articles around banking crisis as part of the background reading and that gave a lot of advice and presumably, subsequently that was why Deputy Lenihan actually appointed Patrick Honohan as the Governor of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  I've made my point about the contracts for difference, and can I just say this: the Dublin Stock Exchange is a small stock exchange.  Bank shares were one of the key elements of that Stock Exchange, and yet the Stock Exchange was allowed to become a kind of casino for contracts for difference.  The share by investors, the build-up of a stake in Anglo Irish Bank, which was ultimately potentially going to take over that bank, was key to the collapse of the bank subsequently.  Had that 1% ... had Brian Cowen implemented what he said he would do, the 1% stamp share tax on the CFDs, I believe again, it wouldn't have stopped everything that happened subsequently but I think it would have been ... it might have woken up the investors who were taking over their stake in Anglo through CFDs.  If those ... If they had to be recorded and paid tax, it might have just made some of the people who were gambling pause for thought.  Would it have prevented it?  I think it would have mitigated it.</p></speech>

Just if I can clear up one issue, Deputy Rabbitte.  You said that yourself and Deputy Noonan raised a question about solvency of the banks when the guarantee Bill was being discussed at the end of September 2008 and you went on to say you wouldn't expect the Minister of the day, Brian Lenihan, to come in and say that he believed the banks were insolvent.  I would just ask you to clarify, are you suggesting that the Minister had a belief that the banks were insolvent, if you could clarify that?  And secondly, you said a moment ago, and it's related, that the Department of Finance must have had a suspicion about solvency with Anglo Irish Bank and I would just put it to you, we've have many of those former officials in who've given testimony under oath and certainly there hasn't been any suggestion from any senior Department official that they had a suspicion, when the guarantee decision was being made, that the bank was actually insolvent.  And as you know, the Governor, Financial Regulator, gave advice at the time that the bank was solvent.  So can you just clarify, and just give me the opportunity to do so in relation to Brian Lenihan, are you making any inference or suggestion that he did actually believe there was a solvency issue with Anglo at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#ZZ01700"><p>I think, Deputy McGrath, we knew enough about banking to know the difference between liquidity and solvency.  And I can't speak for the present Finance Minister but I know what I was trying to find out was, well is it true that it's only a liquidity crisis?  And, quite honestly, I thought it was no more than just a liquidity crisis until immediately around that period when I began to have concerns.  Secondly, I think there was a distinction in the areas where this issue was being discussed at the time as between the two old banks and Anglo Irish.</p><p>You know, I mean, it was an open secret that people were puzzling with, "How is it that to banks that were, in one guise or another, older than the State itself could have got into such a reckless lending splurge?".  But, a distinction was drawn between that and Anglo Irish and, I must say, I had a doubt in my mind about Anglo Irish - I think that was widely shared.  I think the Minister for Finance - I had been opposite him for a year and a month, I think it was, in justice - and I think you could see the learning curve that he was on.  And I think ... let me put it this way, he was at least, at that stage, asking himself the same question.  Now, I would not have expected him to get up in the House and make a ... a statement because that would have obvious repercussions.  But I think he had reached the stage ... not, I think, in respect of what are now called the pillar banks but in terms of Anglo Irish, I think that he had reached the stage ... and I say that from ... in addition ... I say that from some discussions that I had with him before, during and after ... I think he himself was asking himself questions about whether Anglo was in fact rotten.</p></speech>

I think it's important because he's not here to answer for himself and you're ... you're ascribing a possible view that he might have held about the solvency of Anglo at the end of September '08, which we haven't heard from anybody else.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#AAA00700"><p>Final question, Chair, thank you.  And, T&aacute;naiste, it relates to the, the issue of stamp duty and the debate that was raging around stamp duty in 2007.  And, again, going into that election, all of the main parties competed on how they were going to help first-time buyers deal with the stamp duty issue.  And, as you know, up until then there was a threshold of &euro;317,500 and any purchase by a first-time buyer of a home up to that level was exempt and any purchase above that, stamp duty kicked in.  And the Labour Party proposed to extend that exemption up to I think it was &euro;450,000, so ... effectively exempting the vast majority of first-time buyers from stamp duty.  Like, what was the thinking at that time, given that prices had probably peaked in late 2006 and prices were beginning to fall in the early part of 2007?  Had you any concern that creating that incentive might actually push prices back up and put houses further out of reach for first-time buyers?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-23a.1274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072300002#AAA00900"><p>Yes, I mean, the purpose behind the Labour Party proposal - and, in fact, it was joined to Fine Gael ... it was a discussion which was held between both of the parties - was that the first time ... it was to try and tilt the regime in relation to stamp duty in favour of first-time buyers because the cost of a house, particularly in urban areas, had actually risen, from the figures you quoted, somewhere in the three hundred thousands up to over &euro;450,000.  And in more expensive parts of cities like Galway and Cork and Dublin, even far higher than that.  So, for instance, two civil servants on something like ... a HEO's salary or a nurse or someone like that, a teacher ... two teachers married to each other, were finding themselves priced out of being able to afford a house.  So the objective was to try and ensure that people on reasonable incomes could actually take part in home ownership, which, I think, had been agreed as being a desirable social policy by practically all parties in the House.  Now, what happened then was, as well, you had, in relation to second-hand properties, which had been traditionally somewhat cheaper, you know, particularly in less expensive areas, you had competition which the Bacon reports attempted to address.  You had competition from investors who got favourable tax treatment and again there was a disadvantage to the traditional buyer who was providing a residential home for themselves as they sought to establish a family for themselves and their ... their partner.  And there was a step ... there was a step system where once the value went over a certain amount, you jumped up into a much higher rate of stamp duty.  And the proposals by the Labour Party and Fine Gael were to try and iron out the anomalies, which were arising at that point, which were putting home ownership out of the reach of people who traditionally ... I think everybody - all parties - wanted to be involved.  Now, Fianna F&aacute;il, of course, subsequently abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers.</p></speech>

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to appear here today before the committee of inquiry into the banking crisis.  I have furnished the committee with a statement, which sets out of responses to the specific areas on which the committee has asked me to focus.  I won't repeat the detail of the statement in my opening submission but will confine myself instead to some specific points.  I'll concentrate on the time period of which the committee has asked me to address - the years between 2001 and 2008.</p> <p>  As my statement indicates, I've been involved in property and in property investment and development for the past 30 years.  I've a professional background in construction surveying but in the later years, my studies were in the area of project management.  Having worked with some of Ireland's leading property companies, I went on to form ... I went on to found Castlethorn Construction with my partners in 1989.  Over the time, the company gained a reputation for developing quality homes in areas that were connected and serviced by quality infrastructure.  These homes were built in locations where housing development was endorsed by local and national policy.</p> <p>  In the period between 2001 and 2008, Castlethorn Construction built approximately 3,000 homes.  Part V  social and affordable housing was included in these schemes.</p> <p>  In 2005, I formally established Chartered Land, which is the retail and office property division of the group.  This organisation owns and manages some of the most valuable and prestigious retail investments in Dublin, including Dundrum Town Centre.  The company has a 50% share in both the ILAC Shopping Centre off Henry Street and the Pavilion Shopping Centre in Swords.  With more than 500 tenants under management, these three centres support in excess of 11,000 retail and related jobs in the local economy.  The commercial office portfolio of Chartered Land includes 150,000 sq. ft. of modern office space in Dundrum and 400,000 sq. ft. of offices at Grand Canal Square in the so-called silicon docks.  Grand Canal Square, which has now been sold, is home to Facebook's European headquarters with a thousand employees and a host of other fast-growing and demanding large spaces users.</p> <p>  In addition to these investments, Chartered Land has secured planning permission to develop three co-located sites beside each of the retail investments.  While these proposed developments didn't proceed due to the recession, we're confident that they will be delivered at a point in the future.  In time, Dublin city centre proposal will make a significant contribution to the regeneration of the north inner city area.</p> <p>  Some of our other developments include the Bord G&aacute;is Energy theatre and a retail-led, mixed use, commercial scheme of Grafton Street in Dublin.</p> <p>  It might be helpful to the committee if I outline our approach to property opportunities as a group.  Firstly, it's important to recognise that large-scale property investment and development is a complex business.  Our approach to investment was driven by a clear long-term strategy to develop, or acquire, internationally attractive premium real estate in the retail, commercial and residential sectors.  These properties have to satisfy certain criteria.  For example, they had to be close to major transport nodes and had to appeal to the target catchment population.</p><p>Secondly, our focus was on prime areas in dense population in the greater Dublin area.  We didn't undertake development outside the greater area or outside of ... outside the greater Dublin area or outside of Ireland.  </p><p> Thirdly, our approach to development was very much guided by national, regional and local policy, whether in relation to housing, commercial or retail development.  </p><p> Fourthly, our approach reflected detailed and sound research of possible investment and development opportunities.  This was an exhaustive process, addressing both upside and downside risk.  It involved input from planning, design, construction, development, property and finance personnel.  Following initial appraisals, the assessment of each project moved to detailed in-house financial modelling considering different funding options, profitability and exit routes.  We undertook detailed market research, modelled project demand for each investment or development.  This involved engaging experienced property agents and international third-party experts.  For development, the planning and development framework work relevant to each site was extensively reviewed with the input of our planning consultants.</p><p> Finally, our approach to assessing new projects was based on utilising the best advice that we could secure for each relevant discipline.  We had ,and continue to have, a strong internal team, but we have supplemented this expertise with external advisers and consultants, where necessary.  This detailed process was key to the success of both Chartered Land and Castlethorn.  Our attention to detail ensured that any decisions we made to proceed with new investments or developments were well-grounded, thoroughly researched and based on sound, objective business assessments.</p><p> During the period under review, we had borrowed from a number of banks, including AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, KBC and Ulster Bank.  In financing our properties, bank debt was complemented with promoter equity.  Our approach to dealing with our lenders was based on formal engagement with each bank.  At all times, we followed the normal process that applied for the assessment of any loan application.  In my statement to the inquiry, I've outlined the approach that we employed, including our detailed engagement with the lenders to secure support for each proposal.  I can say that, at all times, from a corporate perspective, our engagement with lenders was formal, professional and based on the appropriate and documented procedures.  Loans were only sanctioned after ... or loans were only sanctioned following extensive engagement with the relevant lender and formal sanction by the bank's credit committee.  The type of information typically to be provided with each application included: investment or development rationale; financial appraisals; projected cash flows; external planning reports and risk analysis; an independent asset valuation report; a legal title report; the exit strategy, supported by robust market research.  Once a funder engaged, a term sheet was negotiated and solicitors were then appointed to draft the loan and security documents, while legal, technical due diligence was also conducted during the time ... during this time.  Preconditions were agreed for loan drawdowns over the term of each facility, while loans ... while loan advances were subject to comprehensive financial and asset management reporting.  In 2010, the economic downturn, our loans were acquired by NAMA.  We began to work with the agency to maximise the value of the assets.  For the past six years, we've enjoyed a professional relationship with NAMA and we worked hard to assist the agency to meet its objectives.</p><p>As the committee will be aware, our loans are currently being sold by the agency in a loan sale process called Project Jewel.  It's likely that the return to NAMA, when the loans are sold, will be a multiple of the figure that NAMA paid for these loans in 2010, and that the original capital borrowed, both personally and corporately, may be fully repaid. </p><p> I understand that the committee will be reaching some conclusions on the cause of the banking crisis, and, in this regard, you've heard from a wide range of witnesses with different views.  What seems apparent now is that at the time of the crisis there was too much debt available for borrowers from too many banks.  It's of note, for example, that there were 59 land transactions in Ireland in 2001, but this had risen to 260 by 2006. The problem was compounded by lending in respect of poor quality assets, where insufficient equity was invested.  While both Chartered Land and Castlethorn did borrow in the period between 2001 and 2008, these loans were advanced following a thorough and full assessment of each proposal.  Our debts were secured against prime assets, I believe this will be demonstrated with the Project Jewel, when Project Jewel completes.</p><p> In terms of the crash itself, there was a failure to predict and anticipate the sale of the banking and property crises.  On the property side, the talk of a soft landing was misplaced, particularly given that investment property values fell by 60%, with land values falling by as much as 90% in certain parts of the country.  On the banking side, the capital structure of certain lenders was inappropriate, for the nature of their exposure.  There was an over-reliance on property based lending by some of our institutions, including some international banks, some who had been operating in Ireland for a relatively short period of time.</p><p> From my personal perspective and for the benefit ... and with the benefit of hindsight, I do regret that I did not foresee the extent of the banking crisis and the property crash.  The severity of the crash took most property professionals by surprise, as it did the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, and many respected international agencies.  Looking to the future, we must ensure that the appropriate system of checks and balances is introduced to prevent a repeat of the failures in the period leading up to the crisis.  Property investment and development has a significant role to play in the regeneration of our economy.  The challenge is to implement policies which recognise the positive contribution that property companies make and which encourages, in a responsible way, the delivery of real estate, which contributes to employment, housing provision and a general economic growth.  I'm sure that the report of the committee will help to shape these policies. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to address the inquiry today.</p></speech>

There are a number of groupings.  There's the ... Property Industry Ireland and the CIF - and, within the CIF, is the IHBA, which specifically focuses on housing.  And one of our senior executives in Castlethorn is actually the chairperson of the IHBA so, he along with a number of other people, are absolutely looking at this and seeing how we can bring back ... and make houses more affordable.</p> <p>  I suppose, a bit like the point that you mentioned there, it was interesting just during ... you know, we've been in business from 1989.  I suppose, during ... from the early noughties, you know, there were ... well, first and foremost, back in the late '90s there was the same issues there as we have today.  There was a big demand ... or there was a big demand for housing and the supply issue was an issue.  We weren't able to build as many houses as was required.  That ... the Government at the time ... the Government at the time looked to get some external advice, it brought in Mr. ... Dr. Peter Bacon.  He issued various reports and the reports looked at how they could accelerate the housing provision and he made a number of ... he made a number of recommendations, including looking at the provision of infrastructure.  He brought in the whole, SDZ ... or SDZs was part of his proposal, which looked at accelerating the whole planning process.  I'm trying to think of the third item.  But, in any event ... oh, sorry, the other point was increasing densities and looking at a range of different house types and residential types.</p> <p>  But, I suppose, during that period, the other thing that happened was we brought in social and affordable ... Part V was brought in during that period.  But instead of the local authorities being able to increase the provision of infrastructure or finance infrastructure - that actually didn't happen - so what they did was they then levied ... there was more and more levies put on to ... they increased the levies during that period, with a view to trying to get that infrastructure and to have the resources to provide that infrastructure.  So it was a combination of them trying to collect more money from new homes and then a combination of them asking developers to put that infrastructure in as well.  And, you know, just ... there's a lot of issues there in relation to the provision of new homes.  Like, new homes covers ... like, the person who buys a new home, they're actually unfairly penalised because they have to pay for ... they contribute to ... to social and affordable housing.  The second-hand market, for instance, doesn't provide any income or any finance towards the provision of social and affordable.

We, we were building 90,000 houses at the peak; it's all a question of where we built our houses.  You know, Dublin, Dublin required, sort of, 15,000 to 20,000 houses.  We, we got there somewhere close to the, you know, 2005, 2006.  The problem was, on the housing side, that a lot of the houses weren't built were they were required and in the same way, it's the exact same thing, it's the, it's the identical situation in relation to shops.  So, we have built shops and, and shopping centres where the demand wasn't there, where people didn't do the proper research, the catchment, you have to ... when you're, when you're looking at a shopping centre, you have to understand what the catchment is, you have to understand what the potential spend is in that catchment.  And from that then, you analyse and you're able to determine the demand.  The demand then in turn helps you to, to identify what the turnover ... that turnover then helps you establish what the business model is and that all feeds back into, that all feeds back into what your business strategy and your proposal is likely to be.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has intervened in relation to the provision of housing and the, the level of mortgages that people can take.  And I think that's, I think there, there ... you know, there, I think that's well intentioned.

I think again there was a, there was a perception that building and development was easy and that it was quick, that there was quick money or quick bucks to be made on it and that was ill-founded.  So, I think you've asked me there in terms of ... how can the building and how can we ensure that standards and how can we ensure that we have a professional industry?  So, again through what is happening at the moment and, and the Department of the Environment are involved in this, is that there's an organisation or a grouping being set up at the moment, it's called CIRI, it's Construction Industry Register Ireland.  And that, that is a group that's been put in place, with an independent board, which every developer, every contractor, every builder will have to be registered with and there'll be certain governance around it.</p><p>So I believe that that's well advanced at the moment.  I'm not sure that it's totally there but I know that it's ... I know Castlethorn-Chartered Land are actually members of it and I know that it's being rolled out at the moment, so it's well advanced ... I'm not sure it's been officially ... in fact, I know it hasn't been officially adopted by Government but it is being advanced.</p></speech>

I was interested in your comments again to an earlier question that he asked where you said that you ... he posed the question: "Were you concerned about the huge increase in house prices from two and a half times income to 12 times?", and you said that that "was our concern".  We've had evidence from other people who were involved in development that they may have had similar concerns.  I'm just interested to know did you ever express those concerns or is that something that you're just looking at with hindsight now?</p></speech>

You know, what we did about it, I suppose, within the industry we spoke about it but, you know, did we have access to government, did we have access to the Finance Minister or whatever, Department of Environment and you know, we worked through the CIF or the through the IHBA or whatever and that's probably as far as it ... we went.</p></speech>

Ireland ... I suppose some of this was being justified by the fact that Ireland had fallen behind or it didn't, for instance, have the same ratio of houses per thousand population as other countries, so we were supposed to be on a catch-up.  So I suppose that was one of the justifications.  We were ... we had a lot of foreign direct investment in the country, which was creating demand for factories, for offices, etc.; we had a lot of migrants come in so they were looking ... they obviously had to be housed, so there was a big demand for rental accommodation.  During the period, salaries were increasing, there was social partnership.  There was a lot of issues there where, you know, wages were increasing and people had more disposable income and-----</p></speech>

You made the point fairly well.  I just ... I suppose, as somebody who is a businessman, you have said that you were concerned about the rate of house price increase.  Did you believe, like, that that was a sustainable rate to run a business into the future, that you could sustain those prices and that your business could survive long-term on the back of what was a really concentrated house price increase, you know, compared to where we had come from in the previous 20 years?</p></speech>

So, of course, anybody would have to have concerns about that.  And there was quite a debate about that, so you know, we're not in business for making a quick buck and disappearing.  We've been in it for the last 30 years.  I'm hoping that we'll have an opportunity to be in it for I don't know how many more years but certainly, certainly I'd like to think another ten, 20 years.  So, like, this is ... the idea of the market going up and down, and experiencing what we've experienced over the last six and a half years, or experiencing what the country, and the pain and the damage that has been done to the country, that's not what we want.  We want to be in a business that the curve is certainly on a gradual basis, not peaking and troughing.</p></speech>

When the crisis hit, obviously the ... or not obviously, but what happened was that ... that the level of discount in relation to our assets was quite severe.  But what is interesting is that as the Irish economy has got back on its feet and as the Irish economy has recovered, those assets have recovered as well and that's one of the main reasons why we'll be ... why we are in a strong position and will be in a strong position going forward in terms of the repayment of our debt.  In terms of just answering your question, where the weaker part of ... where the weaker part of our assets is sites at the moment.  So in terms of Chartered Land ... fortunately, Chartered Land is primarily an investment property company with prime assets.  The proportion of sites within Chartered Land is about 15% or 15% to 16% which, again, would be for major property companies and looking and comparing those to, sort of, to plc companies, that's probably close to where those plc companies operate.  So, the fact that our assets have ... have recovered is testimony to the strength of the assets and to, you know, the fact that the site element of it is a smaller proportion.  On the residential sites, the residential sites are recovering but they haven't recovered to the same degree as, say, for instance, investment assets.</p></speech>

In relation to your opening statement, again and I was trying to remember what page it was on, I was taking a note of it earlier.  You said that ... kind of herald as an achievement your expectations that the sale of the loans in NAMA will reach a value well in excess of what NAMA paid for them.  As somebody who, I mean, I don't know you from Adam, but you're a business man, how do you feel about the fact that effectively, taxpayers' money has had to have been invested into your business?  Some would argue maybe to keep it afloat, you might argue that it could have stayed afloat anyway but effectively, it has been put into that business to keep it afloat for the last six or seven years.  How do you feel about that?  Do you have anything to say to the taxpayers of the country who are hard-pressed enough and might have some reservations about that?</p></speech>

One is I suppose, we have worked for the last six and a half years and we have fully co-operated with NAMA in relation to the recovery of the value of those assets.  And I suppose again, coming back to it, the ... our business strategy and our ... the regime that we put in place and the quality of those assets is testimony to that business strategy and to the fact that we knew ... we knew what our market was, we understood the market.  We stuck to that strategy so we ... as of, you know, if you look at Dundrum at the moment, if you look at some of the characteristics in relation to Dundrum.  So for instance, if you look at the rent roll that has produced, if you look at even the consumer spending, so I reckon, give or take over the last ten years- Dundrum was open ten years last March - so I'd say within that ten years and sort of, give or take, it was about ... consumer spending it was about, in that period, it was about &euro;5 billion.  So if you take it ... so if you take the VAT that was collected in that period or the VAT that would have been paid out of that &euro;5 billion, probably the Irish Exchequer took about &euro;1 billion out of that in that period, in those ten years.  If you take it that there was about six, 5,500 people employed in Dundrum, that equates to about &euro;35 million PAYE PRSI tax being taken out or arising out of that employment.  So over the ten years, that's &euro;350 million.</p></speech>

Briefly then in relation to another point that was raised by Senator Barrett, where you spoke about inexperienced developers.  I think ... I can't remember what page it was.  You said that there clearly was too much debt, too freely available and too many borrowers that led to a glut of inexperienced developers, many of whom traded in a short term horizon.  You've answered what you thought, I think, inexperienced developers were, but do you believe then that inexperienced developers, if they hadn't been lent this money, that we may not have had the property crash and the banking crash that we've had?  Is that the implication of what you're saying?  Because we've heard a lot of evidence that really the crash, rather than from the small operators, was from the over-concentration of the big figures, like I've mentioned, in a few individuals and individual businesses?</p></speech>

But I think there was a view taken that because of the quality of the lending against inferior assets, secondary assets, tertiary assets, etc., and the locations in which some of this lending was done, what I mean is not prime, not lent onto prime assets-----</p></speech>

Can I ask ... I've a number of questions that I must put to you.  Based on your dealings with the Irish banks in the pre-crisis period, did you get the general impression that maintaining and growing market share was a dominant driver in lending practices?

Banks were under increasing pressure due to interbank competition to offer incentives such as - and we've mentioned a few of them before - non-recourse loans, interest only and roll-up ones as well.  In your experience, were such practices common among the banks in Ireland?  And did the situation differ greatly from practices in banks in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

Can I ask you, you refer in paragraphs 3 to 5, on page 5 of your statement, to a multi-bank loan agreement for the Dundrum Town Centre involving six banks, with Anglo as the agent for the other vive lenders.  How did this arrangement come about and, from a developer's viewpoint, what are the particular advantages and downside risks with this type of funding approach?</p></speech>

So it was ... there was a number of banks brought together, as you have mentioned, so that was called a syndicate of banks and it was headed by Anglo Irish Bank.  So there was a process there where Anglo would have informed all of the banks in relation to all of the governance issues in relation to the protection of that loan and working within the facility agreement, working within the ... while the loan was being drawn down, ensuring that we ... ensuring that all the milestones or whatever the criteria was and whatever the requirements were within that facility, that they were all adhered to.</p></speech>

In relation to Brendan McDonagh ... Brendan McDonagh was before the banking inquiry and he gave evidence in relation to dealing with developers and how NAMA was established.  And you talk about the efficiency in terms of NAMA.  Mr McDonagh talked about, and I'll quote him, he says, "Probably about &euro;300 million of that additional security, debtors decided that they would transfer them to third parties, friends, relatives, rather than hand them over to banks or NAMA."  And then he talked about additional assets that were ... that weren't declared to banks, or NAMA.  But in relation to ... and not breaching any confidentiality between yourself and NAMA, what's your view of that statement from ... NAMA developers that they would have transferred &euro;300 million of assets out of the hands of banks or NAMA?</p></speech>

I'll remind the Deputy that there was a planning permission in 2000 that actually demolished those four buildings so, when we came along, applied for planning permission, we acknowledged that those four buildings were to be kept.  We only actually took possession of those four buildings in ... I think it was approximately, and I'm not ... and this is approximate, Deputy, we took possession of those four buildings in 2008, approximately 2008, right?  So, when we took those ... when we took possession of those, the roofs were ... had caved in.

He gave evidence to this inquiry and in the course of the evidence, he played a statement that he had made in October 2003 on RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  And I'd like to quote it to you and ask you for a comment on it.  He said:<blockquote><br /><br />The Irish housing market is a scam. It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.<br /><br />Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale. Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.</blockquote>Would you agree with that statement? </p></speech>

This wasn't made with the benefit of hindsight when many people became wise.  So there was still four or five years to go of the property bubble.

That's each year.  Is that, apart from the sustainability or lack of sustainability, is it just that young, working people would be under that pressure?</p></speech>

I think, Deputy, you have to go into a lot of other macro factors in relation to what was driving the price of land, what was driving the price of houses, why banks were doing what they were doing, etc., etc.  So I mentioned earlier on, for instance, it was 100% mortgages.  That was clearly wrong.  We weren't in control of our own fiscal system.  You know, we had joined the EU, we didn't seem to have put into any play ... anything in place to put a brake ... or to put some brakes on how our economy was expanding.</p><p>So there was ... you know there was 101 pieces, there was 101 different factors, all combining to the market becoming inflated and overheated.</p></speech>

One was that in March 2009, the top 13 debtors owed Anglo &euro;14 billion and the total bailout cost, &euro;64 billion, by a few hundred people, and you would have been among the top people in that.  Is it right that a few private individuals and bankers or banks or companies in search of profit maximisation have that amount of power in society that can literally wreck an economy for millions of people?</p></speech>

So, you know, from that point of view, that's the answer to that question.  In relation to ... again, as I said, and I mentioned to ... to the ... a number of ... or to some of the other questions from the Deputies, from the other Deputies, I think from ... I can only speak from my point of view and only speak from our organisation's point of view, is that quality of the assets that we had supported ... the quality of the assets or the ... the ... or that the loans or the lending to ourselves and to our organisation was ... was secured against some of the best assets in the country.</p></speech>

You refer in page 8 of your statement that given the risks involved, lenders sometimes lay down key milestones where finance was issues for site acquisition, performance milestones, etc.  Can I just ask you in a general way if that was commonplace for the type of lend that you were involved in and if that was commonplace practice?  You've gone into it in some detail but just to elaborate.  And the last point I'm ... You were asked about the cost of a home and that and you gave a lot of information but I'm ... Could you give us ... you gave cost information of the site, etc.  Now I do appreciate there are a lot of different variations but, for example, the houses you were building in Blanchardstown in the mid-2000s, for example, where you had the land from years previously.  You said in your statement that in that case, the return would be quite large.  Could you give us an indication of, say, if you had an average three-bedroom home, what would the fundamental cost of the site be?  Well, let's leave the site out, of the construction be?  And then because you had the land from previously, what kind of a profit would you make per house?  Is there a typical figure you could give us?</p></speech>

That's sort of commercially sensitive, but what I can tell you is what's relevant today ... is what it costs to build a house today.  And to build a house today is somewhere in the region of a three-bedroom semi that you refer to is somewhere up to &euro;280,000 up to &euro;300,000.  And I have to say that, and again just to understand, that that's only the cost of building the house.  You have to put in the infrastructure and you have to ... People just think about, you know, what they see within the ... Just the house and the front garden, the back garden, if there's gardens, or the front area and the back garden.  They forget about the roads, they forget about the, you know, the surface water, sewer, the foul sewer.  They forget about the water.  All of those costs that have to be incurred.</p></speech>

Good evening, Mr. O'Reilly.  Can I start by asking you about the valuation process that the banks would've undertaken?  The Central Bank in a 2012 report, which I don't expect you to be familiar with, made the point that credit institutions were often negligent and imprudent in the manner in which they requested property valuations.  Can I ask you to comment on that, that as part of the loan application process, when valuations of security, for example, had to be undertaken, did you observe any difference in the rigour applied to valuations sought by the Irish banks, and I know you dealt with a number of non-Irish banks, like KBC and Ulster, which is ultimately owned by RBS.  Can you comment on that?</p></speech>

Again, we would have seen the same level of process and rigorous process.  So, from our point of view, we would have valued our own ... We would have put our own business plan together.</p><p>We would have then brought out ... we would have then brought in external advisors and, in some cases ... in most cases, in fact, they were valuers.  So they vetted what our assumptions were.  If the bank was interested in our proposal, they would issue a term sheet.  That term sheet then would move to a facility agreement.  Going from a term sheet to a facility agreement, usually the banks would have brought in an independent external valuer and that would have been the same with the foreign banks, with KBC or Ulster Bank, the exact same thing-----</p></speech>

In the pre-crisis period did you or management colleagues believe at any point that a property bubble was in the making, or did you generally rely on the soft landing theory?</p></speech>

We didn't ... I mean we just looked at what was happening and what had happened in previous adjustments.  And our view was that there was somewhere ... the adjustment would be somewhere between 20, 25, 30%, perhaps, but not at the scale that-----</p></speech>

Can I ask you about the establishment of NAMA?  And, as you know, it was announced first of all by the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, in April 2009, but the legislation was not signed into law until November of that year, so there was a delay because of the legislative process that had to be gone through.  So can I ask in the interim phase, can you describe the impact on the relationship that you would have had with your existing banks at that time, the impact on the impending establishment of NAMA, and the prospective transfer of your loans across to NAMA?  And did that time lag have any particular effects on your business during that time?  And, of course, it came at a time when property values were collapsing.</p></speech>

So ... and while there was certainly a lot of strains in the market, we continued to asset manage that portfolio and we continued to ... you know, I suppose that our focus changed from doing anything in terms of continuing on with the development to consolidating.  And that consolidating, as I say, in relation to our commercial side, we just continued to asset manage and drive the business from that point of view.  And we were very successful.  In relation to our residential, we set in track a process of trying to finish off everything we could, bearing in mind that money was tight then , and we wanted to ensure that our developments were left in a state that-----</p></speech>

So, certainly, we would have gleaned from them that they were positively disposed towards what we were ... what we were ... what our business strategy was but it was very much dependent on bringing in other banks.  So, I mean, at the end of the day the reality of it is, it only became a reality ... or it only became well ... again ... it only became a reality when all of the banks and all of the funding that we required was ... was available.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with one final question and then we'll start wrapping up with you Mr. O'Reilly and if ... that's if the leads are ... inviting to come back in ... I'll actually close in that case.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Reilly, the ... in the second last paragraph on page 3 of your witness statement you say that in future developers ... and I'll then revert to your quote, it's just a short line so ... it says that "in future [developers must] ask [sorry] act with greater prudence, responding to market demand with product that is economically sustainable."  What changes, if any, would you propose to make your business model to make more economically sustainable compared to the model in place during the pre-crisis period?</p></speech>

In the second last paragraph, on page 3 of your witness statement, you say that in future developers must ask  ... must act with greater prudence, responding to market demand, with product that is economically sustainable.  So what changes, if any, would you propose to make your business model to make it more economically sustainable compared to the model in place during the pre-crisis period?</p></speech>

What I'm referring to there is that any business is only as good as the ... understanding the market, and in order to understand the market, you have to have done your research.  And that research then forms the basis of what your business model will be.  So I think what I'm referring to there is that there's no point in building shopping centres where the demand isn't required.  There's no point in building houses where they're not required.  So you know ... I suppose I'm being a little bit arrogant there in the sense of saying, well listen, our business model has always been based in Dublin, it's where we .. where it's the largest population, and it's along that lines, yes.</p></speech>

I'm going to bring matters to a close, Mr. Reilly.  In doing so, I just propose that we will suspend for a few moments then just to go into a private session to attend to one single item after this.  In that regard, is there anything you'd like to say by means of closing comment or statement, or remarks, Mr. O'Reilly?</p></speech>

I think the only comment I would make is that, look it, there is going to be ... there is a requirement for change and I think this particular Government, and certain aspects that they're looking at, will hopefully help ensure that this doesn't happen going forward.  I think there is a big demand for housing going forward, there's a big demand for offices going forward.  The level of finance that's going to be required for them is enormous given the... given where we find our banks today.  So, for instance, if you look at, if you take it that I think the report at the moment is that we need about 30,000 houses.  If you take it just as a general figure, that's ... that requires .. say the building costs of a typical house is &euro;300,000, that's a requirement of &euro;9 billion.  And that's only for the financing, there's mortgages required for that, so even at, you know, an 80% LTV against that, it's just a phenomenal figure.  So, again, I think the issues surrounding how we resolve the ... where we find the industry today is not going to be easy to resolve.</p></speech>
