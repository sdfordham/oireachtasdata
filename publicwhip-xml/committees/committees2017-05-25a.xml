No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 11 and 18 May 2017.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  As there is nothing specific arising from them that will not come up in our discussion of items further down the agenda, we will move on straightaway to correspondence.</p> <p>  Category A is correspondence related to today's meeting.  As we have no witnesses this morning, there is nothing to be noted formally or published.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers as a follow-up to previous meetings.  The first item is No. 516B, dated 22 May, from Dr. Graham Love, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The correspondence includes the terms of reference for the HEA's analysis of intellectual property policy implementation across higher education institutions.  Dr. Love mentions that the HEA is putting together terms of reference for a review of the spin-out company FeedHenry in Waterford Institute of Technology and that they will be completed shortly.  This is a very welcome development.  Do members wish to make specific comments or will we simply note the correspondence?</p></speech>

I do not think they should be confined solely to FeedHenry because there are multiple companies that need to be examined.  There is also the wider policy on multiple conflicts of interest.  What I can do is communicate directly with it, but if we have a very limited, narrow focus, we will be missing the bigger issue.</p></speech>

We will inquire whether it is included in the terms of reference and formally write to it again on the issue.</p><p> The next items are Nos. 520B.1 and 2 from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, regarding Caranua's accommodation.  There was a debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday on this issue.</p></speech>

It gave us three letters.  The web of intricacy is becoming more apparent and I would like the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this instance.  I ask that we deal with Caranua, with other correspondence.  It has come back to us to clarify that it is paying rent.</p></speech>

In correspondence, item No. 517C, Ms Mary Higgins, CEO of Caranua, corrected a statement made at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 13 April 2017.  For the record, Caranua had rent-free accommodation from 2013 to May 2016, not 2017, as had been indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017052500002#B00500"><p>Most other Deputies and I raised this matter.  I asked whether Caranua was paying rent.  I checked the accounts with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to determine whether I had missed something and was told that no rent was being paid.  I asked on the day whether rent was being paid and the CEO said no but that it would be paying rent as it was about to move into the private market or words to that effect.  It subsequently transpired that rent had been paid and that there had been an extension of the lease from 2016 to 2017, involving a sum of over &euro;100,000, of which &euro;50,000 had been paid.  I find it difficult to believe it was an oversight, but I accept the correction.</p> <p>  The bigger issue is that neither the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of Public Works nor Caranua has explained why Caranua needed to move into expensive premises.  There was an extension of the lease and it is now moving.  The cost will be &euro;272,000 per year.  I will be guided by the Chairman on this, but we expressed an opinion that this was a very serious matter.  I have a point on which I want guidance.  The Office of Public Works appeared to lease the premises on Frederick Street.  I do not know from whom it leased it or the cost involved.  The Department of Education and Skills and Caranua were based there, among other organisations, and no rent was paid from 2013 to 2016.  If no rent was paid for that period of time, why, when the amount in the fund is decreasing and serious concerns have been expressed about it being reduced, would it enter into an expensive rent agreement?  We have asked it not to do so.  For four years no rent was paid, although it now appears that it was for three years because the figures were retrospective.  Why is the Office of Public Works or the Department of Education and Skills insisting on the payment of rent?  I do not know why that is happening.  Furthermore, the Minister has to give permission.  He has a clear legal responsibility to say "Yes" or "No" to a contract.  From all of the convoluted replies we have received, I understand no consent has been given.  Has Caranua entered into a contract?  It is an abdication of responsibility.  I would like to be guided by the Chairman.  It is an obscenity that Caranua will have to pay rent of &euro;272,000, including &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000 for three car parking spaces.  These are not things about which it should be concerned.  There are many other issues to which I would like to come back in the context of outstanding reports, but for the moment I am limiting myself to this issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might help me to clarify it.  </p> <p>  The Office of Public Works has a serious question to answer.  What policy was changed?  I understand it is leasing the premises to which Caranua will move and charging rent.  I do not know all of the facts, but I am trying to obtain the information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017052500002#B00600"><p>I do not want to be unfair to any witness who came before the Committee of Public Accounts.  At this stage, I do not want to say we were misled because we have to analyse the questions, the responses and the correction that has now been made fairly.  The questions asked by Deputy Catherine Connolly, other members and me were specific.  They concerned the rent being paid in the year to which we had referred.  It now seems that rent was being paid.  Very direct questions were asked and for the life of me, I cannot see how the responses given could have been given because the witnesses would have known that rent was being paid.  It was not a slip of the tongue.  If it was a question in passing, I could have understood the response.  However, the questions were continuous and we probed the responses we received.  The discussion did not involve just one question.  I am a little concerned about this.  At a time when the fund is being reduced, my understanding is any rent payment will have to come from the fund which inclues money that should be going to the survivors.  That is our real concern.  There are questions for the OPW, from which we need to hear.  We also seek clarification from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017052500002#B00700"><p>Almost all or most of what we will examine are historical circumstances about which we can do very little, except try to create consequences to change future behaviour.  This is a case in which we can avoid such future consequences.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Office of Public Works have a role to play in that regard, but it feels as if they are trying to bide their time to have it over and done with by the time the question is properly answered.  We, therefore, have to put our foot down.</p></speech>

From the correspondence received from Caranua and the Department, it is my understanding the situation changed in 2016.  The OPW was the leaseholder of the premises in which Caranua was accommodated.  Under the lease it paid rent to the landlord.  It obviously has a large portfolio management operation, but when the time comes, there is a review and break option.  It examines the accommodation and decides it is no longer suitable and that there is a need to move to a new premises.  It might have subletting agreements with public bodies.  As I understand it, Caranua's landlord is the OPW, but the OPW is passing on the cost it is incurring.  Caranua has not paid rent on its current premises.  There was a note in the financial statements pointing to the fact that the OPW was carrying the cost of its rent for the first number of years.</p></speech>

There was a note in the financial statements outlining the expenses charged to the fund.  There was also a note stating Caranua was occupying premises given to it by the OPW.  It did not pay rent in 2014 and 2015.  In 2016 the OPW decided that it would surrender the lease on the building, a much bigger building than the one occupied by Caranua.  As it did not have alternative accommodation, it negotiated with the landlord an extension of the lease for a further year.  At that point, it decided to ask Caranua to pay rent.  That is where the confusion arose.  The figures seem to refer to the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017.  There is a possibility that it will extend the lease further because it appears, from what has been written, the alternative accommodation and the new lease have not yet been put in place.  The agreement has not been finalised.</p><p>When it is finalised, the occupiers will pay the OPW the rental amount.  That will be the figure of &euro;270,000 or whatever it is for Caranua.</p></speech>

It was not charging rent in the earlier period and the OPW seemed to change its approach.</p></speech>

Why was there a policy change?</p></speech>

It seems to be the question that has not been answered.  At one time it was okay for the OPW to provide the accommodation without charging but now it has changed the policy.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General is right, in the sense that he is 99% of the time, but it has been confirmed to us in correspondence that rent totalling &euro;50,000 was paid over as part of the extension.  When the chief executive officer was in, we clearly asked if it was paying rent and she said it was not but it was going to.  She did not say it had been paying rent for a portion of 2016 and 2017 when it had done so.  Did the Minister for Education and Skills give his consent under the Acts to pay that money for rent?</p></speech>

As I understand it, it paid &euro;53,000 in 2016.  We have not done the audit of 2016 yet.  It paid &euro;53,000, which is half the rent, and it had a commitment to pay the other &euro;53,0000.  The whole &euro;106,000 should be recognised in 2016.  It is a 2016 audit issue.</p></speech>

We will ask the Department the same question.  Caranua is not in the new premises and the documentation has not gone in.

It seems all this correspondence has again been leaked to the media.  We have raised this several times.  As politicians, we all speak to the media, and it is part of our work.  We are carrying out an examination and a national media outlet should not be doing it.  We cannot have them setting the agenda for us and selectively deciding what are the key issues.  They examined this before we have had the opportunity to do so.  It is the reality.  The national broadcaster and media are examining this material before we have even had the chance to examine it.  That potentially undermines our work.  We can continue with it but it is not good practice for this committee.  We cannot do our job fairly if the substance of what is in the documents is already in the public domain, being examined or scrutinised by the media before the Committee of Public Accounts even gets a chance to read the stuff.  The stuff was sent on as soon as it came in.  My phone was hopping yesterday with journalists asking for the information.  When one person has it, they all want it, which is fair enough.</p> <p>  Given that we have agreed to do a focused examination and we will discuss in private session how we will proceed, how can we continue if there is a parallel process where the media is also doing an examination, even before we do?  I will put it to members and leave it at that.</p></speech>

We cannot work this way.  I do not know what the Chairman can do about it.  There are many people who are not yet here but I ask the Chairman to speak with everybody on the committee individually.  We will get more documentation that will be highly sensitive.  We are talking about very serious issues relating to the security of our State.  This constant stream of documentation will end up in the media and be analysed.  Deputy Madigan is right in that a spin or opinion will be put on it.  I do not know how journalists could have examined the documentation sent to us and joined it with others since we got it yesterday; we could not do it in that time.  There is a theme emerging that these are the real issues but there is much deeper stuff coming from this documentation.  We can join it with other matters.  This is like a big jigsaw and we will continue to work at it.</p> <p>  While in public session I should also say that the volume of documentation we have not yet received is, frankly incredible.  All the documentation I requested has not arrived.  It is very specific documentation, so that is deeply worrying.  Perhaps the Chairman could speak with members of the committee individually and ask them to ensure that all documentation is kept in house.</p></speech>

Should we write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to outline our concerns?  A member of the Committee of Public Accounts is responsible for this leak.  Should we ask that committee to write to each individual member?</p><p>I can ask people, but if the CPP would point out the responsibility of members separately it might help.  There are two concerns.  The first is that the slant of what is published and recorded by national media will be thought by the public to constitute our agenda for the day when there could be much broader issues.  The second worry I have is that someday a witness will say "I am not coming in because I have already been adjudicated on in the minds of the committee on radio, television and the newspapers".  That will potentially damage our ability to get full co-operation from witnesses when we see this.  We have had the opening statement from our private session in the newspapers already today.  I do not know what the source of that was but I worry some witnesses may take a jaundiced view of appearing here if they are not getting fair play as they see it.  We will write to the CPP and express our concern, asking it to consider the matter.  It is probably not the first time it has come across this issue and it may have some other view as to how this matter could be dealt with.</p></speech>

There is that correspondence which will be published and self-evidently is cleared for publication.  There is other material we will decide not to publish for whatever reason.  I am not even convinced it will work but I think the following is our best shot.  Can we decide that the clerk and our officials will circulate electronically all of those things which, in any event, will be published but that we take a different tack with other documents?  As we saw, that is a slightly different matter in terms of evidence, material or information.  At minimum, we could deliver it, which would at least give members pause to think "Actually, this documentation is different in its nature".  That may not be workable.  However, writing to the CPP to write to all of us is not going to make any difference.  If people were amenable to that logic, the leaking would not have happened.  It is very frustrating and annoying.  While we could get over that, the real danger is that somebody we want to appear and to assist us with our investigation might take the view, legitimately, that he or she is not going to get a fair crack at things and refuse to show up.  We need to be conscious of all of that.  Once we have the witnesses in the room, it is absolutely fair that we question and examine matters rigorously and fully.  That is how the committee operates.  However, no one should be doing anything that causes anyone to feel that not only will the questioning be rigorous and tough, but that it will not be fair.  That is a real problem for us.  That is the only suggestion I can come up with but I do not know if it is workable.</p></speech>

That in itself needs to be reflected on because it was produced on the day.  In fairness to the Commissioner and the rest of us, we did not have a copy of it and it was not in context.  That is just by way of example.  We could go on forever talking about leaks to the papers.  We should have as few private meetings as possible.  That was my practical suggestion for NAMA.

It was referred by the committee to the Minister seeking a response.  Indeed, the Government Chief Whip was also in correspondence with us.  Was there any response in relation to that?  It is a legitimate concern of this organisation.  The Chairman has met with its representatives and understands the issues involved.  We are talking about public money.  The former PAC wrote to the Department of the Taoiseach to ask for its analysis of this situation and I do not think it replied.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily mean this matter.  Some thought should be given to being quite public about what is and is not appropriate.  People are always looking for an outlet to get a remedy and, as such, understanding the remit of the committee is a public information issue.  That might be considered to alert people to the fact that the committee is not the location for remedies which are within the remit of Departments or other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

We will work on that document.</p></speech>

There have been arbitrators' reports all over the place on this.  We are not here to re-arbitrate on arbitrators' reports.  That is not our function.  As the Deputy has said, lots of correspondents have given us copies of arbitrators' reports over the years but that is not our function.  We will get the correspondence from the Taoiseach's office and make sure that the item is dealt with.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 501C, a document I received in connection with HSE spending in University Hospital Galway.  I do not know the executive's views on what is involved so I propose that we write to the HSE requesting a response to that item of correspondence.</p> <p>  Item No. 502C (i) and (ii) is a copy of correspondence sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by an individual regarding a waste of taxpayers' money.  This is a copy of correspondence and is not direct correspondence to this committee.  We will note this item.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 503C (i) to (vi) dated 17 May from an individual referred to as Person A in hearings in the University of Limerick.  The correspondence states that the evidence that was presented by the university to this committee was misleading and includes a report to that effect.  The details contained are quite personal.  I propose that we write to the individual and suggest that she may wish to bring this to the attention of the review board being led by Dr. Richard Thorn.  Confidential, personal medical information has been sent to this committee.  Dr. Thorn is examining this area and I believe we should ask the correspondent to send the information directly to him.

Is that agreed?  We are not publishing that particular item of correspondence.</p><p>Items Nos. 504C (i) and (ii) and No. 513 (i) to (iii) are duplicate items of correspondence from an individual attaching correspondence and communications with different members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on bonus provision.  We will note these items.  It is not clear that this issue is within our remit.  We have been included on a circulation list so this is not a matter specifically for this committee.  It has not been directed to us so we will just note the correspondence that we received.</p><p>Item No. 505C (i) and (ii) is correspondence received from an individual relating to alleged illegal dumping of unauthorised material in County Meath.  The committee is being kept in the loop on this matter and it has been raised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will note the item.  The issue is ongoing and we are just being kept up to date on it.</p><p>Item No. 506C (i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 18 May from the Department of Justice and Equality.  This is a follow-up to the criminal justice (fixed charge processing system) working group.  This is a matter that was brought to our attention by the PARC Road Safety Group, via Deputy Tommy Broughan.  I propose that we forward copies of this correspondence to the aforementioned group and to Deputy Broughan.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>Item No. 507C is correspondence from an individual alleging treason and betrayal by public servants.  We will note that item, but will take no further action.</p><p>Item No. 508C (i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 15 May from an accountancy firm attaching a report carried out on pension related deductions in respect of retained fire fighters with a dual mandate with a local authority.  This is a policy matter which is outside the terms of reference of this committee.  We will refer it to the relevant sectoral committee.  Some members may have encountered this issue at a local level.  This is definitely a matter for the Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  I propose that we write to the correspondent to advise that we are forwarding the correspondence to that committee.</p><p>Item No. 509C is correspondence from an individual containing allegations in respect of Naas General Hospital.  The secretariat has received a large amount of information as outlined in the email.  The clerk will examine this and revert to the committee in the coming weeks.  We may need to receive legal advice on whether this is a protected disclosure under the terms of the Act and I will ask the clerk to the liaise with the parliamentary legal adviser on that point.  When we get a clearer view on the documentation, we will come back to it at that stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item of correspondence, No. 510C, is from an individual regarding teachers' pay and accountability.  This was sent to a number of committees and the clerk has been informed that the Joint Committee on Education and Skills will be examining the matter further so we will just note it.  </p><p>The next item of correspondence, No. 511C, dated 19 May 2017, is from Deputy David Cullinane and includes an email from the chairman of Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation regarding comments made by the Chairman of Bord na gCon, Mr. Meaney, at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting last week.  As Mr. Meaney fully withdrew the comments he made later in the meeting, we will just note that matter.  The remark was fully withdrawn on the day.</p><p>The next item, No. 512C (i) to (ii) is correspondence dated 19 May 2017 from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, Director General, HSE, in reply to the issue of Console staff.  The letter reiterates the stance of the HSE, as previously advised to this committee.  I suggest that we publish this correspondence.  While we are not happy with the way the staff of Console were treated, we must be pragmatic about this.  A liquidator is involved and nobody can prejudge the outcome of the liquidation process.  The HSE has said that the staff are not its legal responsibility while the Department of Health is saying the same.  There is a view among members of this committee that we should propose that the Government, through the Minister, would make an <i>ex gratia</i>payment but that probably cannot be done during the course of the liquidation process and we do not know when that will end.  The view of the committee is that if the former staff of Console are left as unpaid, unsecured creditors at the end of the day then the Government should consider making an <i>ex gratia</i>payment in respect of their work but that cannot be done just yet.</p></speech>

On one level it is the case that the HSE and the Department do not have direct responsibility for these former employees.  Nonetheless, it was the failure of governance, for which they had a responsibility, which led to the whole debacle.  It is unthinkable that the workers would be left out of pocket and stranded.  I accept the Chairman's point about the duration of the liquidation process and the fact that there is a timing issue involved.  However, I believe we should set out very clearly our expectation regarding an <i>ex gratia</i>payment to the Minister and to the HSE, as the Chairman has described.  We should be saying that now.</p></speech>

On the other hand, it gets public funds.  He says the public funds are limited to certain services.  Then it is a charity.  We have a charity regulator and a charity authority that is not fully resourced.  Perhaps we could get an update on that.  We have been here for a year and three months - I know Deputy McDonald has been here for longer - and this comes before us all the time about governance, lack of resources for the authority that should be looking at it, over and over, and we are then left with this.  More important, people are left with no jobs.</p></speech>

It is a big policy issue that &euro;4 billion of the HSE budget is contracted out for work to be delivered by private companies.

That was from the HSE's internal audit.  That was not fully accepted by the director general, but it was what the internal audit said.  We still have not come back to it, because since we dealt with Console, we have had a number of other charities that have found themselves in similar situations.  We are really busy and it goes back to the resource issue, including the amount of time we have to spend on issues, the resources of the staff here and even the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are big issues in that area that we have not dealt with.</p></speech>

The individual raised matters with the committee in earlier correspondence, but has notified that he will now be engaging with the independent investigator, under Dr. Richard Thorn, mentioned earlier.  We note that.</p></speech>

The terms of reference for this new investigation into the University of Limerick, UL, have been set out.  I think that we, as a committee, should have the Department come before us to put it through its paces with regard to the investigation's terms of reference.  We should also ask Dr. Thorn to come in to speak to us about this process.  The reason I say that is that we have had a pattern not just with third level institutions, but other organisations, where we deal with things after the fact.</p> <p>  We have established that the information given to the committee from UL sources was incomplete and problematic.  I would not be happy for us to proceed with our work in this sector and for there to be a parallel process under way under Dr. Thorn that we have had no interaction with, no sense of it and no testing of it.  We would perhaps store up trouble for when we discover afterwards that there was an omission, flaw or something that might have been of concern.  I suggest that we ask the Department and that we invite Dr. Thorn to come in to speak to us and to explain the process that he is undertaking, the kind of timelines that are envisaged - because that is not clear - and how all of it will work out.</p></speech>

In the case of UL, there is now going to be a review and examination - set up by the Higher Education Authority, HEA - and the terms of reference are set out.  It is not precluded from giving us the information that we need.  What sometimes tends to happen is that these examinations are presented as almost legal and <i>sub judice</i>, but they are not.  We do our work, and whatever others do, they do.  Others should not try to hide behind the fact that they are doing their own examination when we seek information.  It is irrelevant.  Whatever they do is a matter for them.  We have our work to do.  This has happened a number of times.  We should be very clear that, whatever correspondence we need, whatever incomplete information we get which needs to be complete, we can seek and should get that, irrespective of what these terms of reference say and what this process in Limerick is about.  It is entirely a matter for those conducting that examination.</p></speech>

I also welcome the departmental officials who are in attendance.  Today's meeting gives members of the committee an opportunity to hear the Minister's report on matters considered at EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings and other matters relating to foreign affairs and trade.  We will hear the Minister's opening statement before going into a question and answer session with the members of the committee.</p><p>Before we begin I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they can cause interference, even in silent mode, with the recording equipment in this committee room.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement and advise members that we are under considerable time constraints this morning. </p></speech>

I wish to begin by expressing my sympathy and condolences to the victims of the appalling attack in Manchester on Monday last.  The words &quot;attack on the innocent&quot; are particularly resonant when one thinks of young children, young fans, their families and friends simply enjoying an evening out.  On Tuesday I spoke with the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Boris Johnson and told him that D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann were unified in expressing solidarity and recording our horror and disgust at this terrible act.  As of now, there are no Irish citizens confirmed among the victims.  I have received reports from our embassy in Jakarta of a suicide bombing there last night.  Again, I abhor such a cowardly attack.  It is an affront to the Government of Indonesia and its efforts to counter extremism and to promote tolerance and inclusion, which Ireland and the European Union support most vigorously.  I understand that there are no reports of foreign casualties.  Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected, both in Manchester and Jakarta.</p><p>Again, I thank the committee for the invitation to update members on developments at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  My Department has provided a detailed advance information note to the committee and in the interests of maximising the time available for questions and discussion, I propose to confine my opening remarks to a few of the major themes.  First, with regard to Syria, in terms of violence and displacement of civilians the conflict in Syria remains the most pressing problem in our neighbourhood and one of the most intractable and difficult to address.  The EU has remained actively engaged but there is also significant involvement by regional players and great powers.  The UN is playing an important leadership role and at the moment what might be called punctuated talks processes are going on in Geneva and latterly in Astana.  The conflict is extremely complex.  In EU discussions, Ireland has sought to stress the primacy of a political resolution over any drift into a purely military approach, the paramount objective of bringing the fighting and destruction to an end and the urgency, in the meantime, of humanitarian access and relief.  In April the Council adopted conclusions on an EU strategy for Syria, which reflected these priorities.  Ireland has backed up these views by contributing very substantial humanitarian assistance to help the victims of the conflict, amounting now to &euro;76.5 million.  Ireland supported the establishment of an international, impartial, and independent mechanism on Syria.  I have recently announced an initial contribution of &euro;100,000 towards the costs of that mechanism.</p><p>The Council also discussed the situation in Yemen in April.  Ireland&rsquo;s primary concern in Yemen is the humanitarian situation which is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.  I have discussed this with my counterparts in the Gulf region, calling on them to use their influence to encourage the warring parties to lay down arms.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joe McHugh, made a similar call at a recent conference on Yemen in Geneva.  I have made clear in this House and elsewhere my absolute condemnation of the reported deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure by both sides to the conflict.  When I met my counterparts from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, UAE, I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.  Ireland has been supportive of calls for an independent, international investigation into alleged violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen.  My Department will continue to support calls for all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law to be fully investigated and for those found guilty of violations to be held accountable.  I commend the efforts of UN Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, and his team, who continue to work tirelessly for peace.  I urge all parties to this conflict, as well as those with influence in the region, to accept the Special Envoy&rsquo;s invitation to return to the negotiating table for a peace settlement.</p><p>On the matter of the Middle East peace process, the EU Foreign Affairs Council considered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in March.  My strong support for the French initiative last year, which concluded in the Paris conference in January was based on my deep concern that the other crises in the region have distracted international attention away from this long-standing problem.  This is especially so now, as we reach the fiftieth anniversary of the Israeli occupation and negative actions on the ground increase tension and the risk of violence.  While the French initiative did refocus international attention to an extent and restated broad support for the two state solution, agreement on the way forward did not emerge.  The advent of a new US Administration is always something of a watershed in regard to the Middle East peace process.  The visit of President Trump to the region earlier this week showed his interest, at least, in bringing the parties together in renewed negotiations and he urged the parties to engage positively with each other<i>.</i></p><p>The visit of President Trump to the region earlier this week showed his interest, at least, in bringing the parties together in renewed negotiations, and he urged the parties to engage positively with each other<i>.</i>Any specific US plan to follow up on this will emerge over time.<br/><br/>On the matter of Ukraine, discussion on Ukraine at the February Foreign Affairs Council focusing on the country&rsquo;s reform process was overshadowed by the worrying security situation in eastern Ukraine, following a significant escalation in fighting at the end of January.  Ministers expressed concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Donbass region, underlying the need for full implementation of the Minsk Agreements.  At a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Klimkin in advance of the FAC last week, I expressed my concerns at the fragile security situation, the heavy costs being borne by the local civilian populations and the increasingly dangerous environment in which the OSCE special monitoring mission members are operating on a daily basis.<br/><br/>I joined others in commending the Government of Ukraine on the progress it has made so far and in strongly supporting continued reform efforts.  I also expressed the hope that the entry into force of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine and visa liberalisation for Ukrainian citizens in the Schengen area would soon be a reality.  I firmly believe that reaching these milestones will send an important signal to citizens in Ukraine that the national reform effort is delivering benefits of a positive nature.<br/><br/>While migration may have largely faded from the media headlines, the terrible drownings that we see in the Mediterranean are a stark reminder of the human costs of this crisis.  A range of measures adopted by the European Union have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of people risking their lives at sea on the eastern Mediterranean migration route from Turkey.  However, migration has increased on the central Mediterranean route from Libya across the Mediterranean to Italy.  The European Union has been helping Libya to deal with traffickers using Libya as a platform for irregular migration.  Ireland&rsquo;s Navy has been dealing with the consequences of those callous activities.  We have rescued over 15,600 people to date.  I wish to commend, as I know the committee has done, their ongoing brave work in this region.<br/><br/>Ireland continues to maintain that the European Union&rsquo;s approach to the migration crisis must be based on solidarity and must address the root causes as well as the humanitarian challenges that confront us.  That was one of the main reasons Ireland voluntarily opted into EU relocation and resettlement plans in 2015 and why we continue to support the EU&rsquo;s migration partnership framework agreed last year.  At its heart is working with countries of origin and transit in sub-Saharan Africa to help address their particular circumstances, which are considerable.<br/><br/>We have been working closely with Ethiopia, one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s partner countries.  Migration will continue to be a priority issue for the European Union and will likely be discussed at our June meeting, ahead of discussions at the June European Council.<br/><br/>On the matter of Turkey, following the attempted coup in Turkey last July, the constitutional referendum passed there on 16 April has kept an international focus on the ongoing negative developments in Turkey.  The amendments, once implemented, will invest considerable powers in the office of the President and may erode the checks and balances necessary in any democracy.  EU Ministers agreed that it is essential to keep the lines of communication with Turkey open; that our discussions must be frank, direct and open, but conducted with mutual respect; and that the door to the accession process should remain open, but that if there is to be progress along this path, Turkey will be held fully accountable for its commitment to act in accordance with European values on human rights, democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression, including media freedom.  The situation is complicated and difficult, and it will remain firmly on our agenda.<br/><br/>I had an opportunity to convey Ireland&rsquo;s concerns directly to the Turkish Minister of the Economy when he led a trade delegation to Ireland in April.  I expressed my serious concern about the direction of travel in Turkey and emphasised that while we do not underestimate the impact of both the attempted coup and the many terrorist attacks suffered by Turkey and its people, we remain deeply concerned at the ongoing detentions and dismissals, and other restrictions on human rights and basic freedoms, including freedom of expression and media freedom, democracy and the rule of law.  In that context, I reiterated that the introduction of the death penalty would be unacceptable.<br/><br/>I know that the committee met last week with representatives of the pro-Kurdish HDP, and I would like to repeat that I have consistently made clear in recent times that the rights of the Kurdish population in Turkey must be respected &ndash; a point I made again at the recent Gymnich informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Malta in April.  We have also made clear that we regret the breakdown of the ceasefire between the Turkish Government and the PKK in July 2015, and that we have repeatedly called for a return to political dialogue so that a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish issue can be reached.<br/><br/>On the matter of the EU global strategy, as well as the immediate issues, the Foreign Affairs Council has been considering how the European Union can redouble its efforts to promote a rules-based international order with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations at its core.  The EU global strategy sets out a vision for foreign and security policy.  It commits the Union to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  The strategy recognises the need to invest more in conflict resolution and tackle the root causes of instability, using a mix of policies coherently to support international peace, economic development and help build state and societal capacity on governance, rule of law and human rights.  Strengthening the EU&rsquo;s peacekeeping capacity in support of the United Nations will be an integral part of this effort.  This will be done through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDF, as defined in the treaties of the European Union.<br/><br/>Civilian CSDP missions promote stability.  They build resilience in fragile environments through strengthening rule of law institutions. They work to link up the three essential elements of the European Union&rsquo;s integrated approach as outlined in the EU global strategy, namely, diplomacy, security and defence and development.  There are currently nine civilian missions on two continents with approximately 2,500 staff deployed to them.  Ireland currently deploys 12 civilians and five members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to eight of those missions.<br/><br/>In Ukraine, where there are two Irish nationals deployed, the EU assistance mission, EUAM Ukraine, has been providing support to the Ukrainian authorities to establish a civilian security sector that is efficient, accountable and enjoys the trust of the public.  In Georgia, where two Irish nationals are also deployed, the EU monitoring mission there seeks to ensure that there is no return to hostilities with Russia and to facilitate the resumption of a safe and normal life for the local communities living on both sides of the administrative boundary lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.<br/><br/>Discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council have centred on a number of proposals geared towards making CSDP more effective. This includes adapting civilian CSDP to make it more operational and responsive in the face of new and existing security challenges; improving CSDP crisis management structures; and strengthening CSDP co-operation with partner countries and organisations including the United Nations.  It also includes the development of voluntary initiatives such as permanent structured co-operation and a co-ordinated annual review on defence, which are aimed at providing more efficiently the capabilities required for international peace support.<br/><br/>Ireland has actively contributed to the development of these concepts with a view to ensuring that they add value to the CSDP and the EU&rsquo;s international crisis management efforts, grounded in the EU treaties and related protocols.  We strongly support initiatives, through the CSDP, which improve the capacity of the European Union to contribute to international peace and stability, particularly in support of the UN.<br/><br/>Looking ahead to the next meeting in June, the Council will continue its work on the implementation of the EU global strategy, as well as discussing migration, Iraq and the Sahel region.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and the members for their time in allowing me to briefly review what I believe they would agree has been a diverse agenda at the Foreign Affairs Council in recent times.  I am always pleased to take submissions and observations from the members, and the Chairman, and to answer any questions.  I look forward to hearing their own perspectives on these issues.<br/><br/>With regard to the relationship between Government and Parliament, I regard the discourse, advice and guidance of this committee as being particularly important to me in the context of my Ministry.</p></speech>

The Minister dealt with a lot of issues in his presentation and I will not be able to cover everything in the time allowed.  I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to providing advice and guidance to this committee.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the situation in Yemen, which is obviously a catastrophic human rights tragedy.  The ongoing conflict there is, in the main, supported by Saudi Arabia.  In that context, I want to return to a issue that we have discussed previously.  I will be general because I have given up on trying to get a specific response as to how we voted on the membership of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  In response to parliamentary questions that I tabled, the Minister appears to be suggesting that we did support Saudi Arabia in its accession to that committee.  He stated in a response that his Department had received no representations asking Ireland to oppose Saudi Arabia's accession to the aforementioned committee.  Given that the Suadis are one of the main protagonists in the ongoing conflict in Yemen and the terrible tragedies that are occurring there, I ask that the Department would undertake a review of our policy of keeping private all votes for UN commissions.  I accept that there are numerous elections across a range of bodies at the UN.  I also accept that there are situations sometimes where national security or strategic interests are at stake and it may be necessary to keep how we vote in elections private.  However, our votes on the membership of committees should not be kept private, particularly the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  We need to reconsider this policy going forward.  While I acknowledge the Minister's point that this has been standard practice over generations, that does not mean it is correct in all instances.  I would like this committee to examine the issue, with a view to proposing new procedures.  Across the-----</p></speech>

What interaction did the those voting on behalf of Ireland have with the Minister or his officials prior to the vote?  Do we just assume that they are going to do the right thing?  I will leave that element to one side for now.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions regarding the European consensus on development.  I note that Mr. Gaffey, the Director General of the Development Co-operation Directorate of the Department is here and perhaps he would like to comment too.  There appears to be a move by some towards tying overseas aid.  Such moves are not being made by Ireland and indeed, we have an excellent track record in that regard.  However, it looks like there is a focus, from an EU perspective, on development co-operation in the context of security, commerce, migration and other objectives.  Ireland's stance has always been in favour of untied overseas development aid and that should remain the case.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether this has been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in any detail.  Ireland can take a very good lead in any discussions on that matter because our track record is excellent.  </p> <p>  I wish to turn now to the question of Palestine and the Occupied Territories in particular.  Has the EU Foreign Affairs Council discussed the issue of the destruction of EU funded property by Israeli armed forces?  Medical facilities, schools and other EU funded facilities have been destroyed, which is a big issue on which the EU should speak with one voice.  I have engaged with departmental officials in recent weeks to try advance further Ireland's position with regard to the recognition of the state of Palestine as part of a two state solution.  I ask the Minister to outline the EU's perspective on this question.  Is the Irish Government moving closer to recognising the state of Palestine?  I believe it would be helpful if we were to put our money where our mouth is, state that Palestine has equal status with the state of Israel and recognise both states formally.  We should get off the fence and do that.</p> <p>  However, I do not want us to do anything that would be detrimental to any new discussions that may take place in the aftermath of the recent visit of the new US President to the region and his calls for re-engagement.  I ask the Minister to give his views on how he sees that situation at this moment in time.  There are lots of other issues in which I am interested but I will leave it at that for now, given the time constraints to which the Chairman has referred.  I hope we will have other opportunities to engage with the Minister on the many items raised this morning in more detail.  Again, I thank the Minister for his presentation.</p></speech>

We are hearing appalling reports of what is happening in detention centres in Libya.  The country itself does not have a functioning government.  There are medical shortages, power shortages and so forth.  There is a serious possibility of Libya going bankrupt, such are the demands on its central bank.   How can Libya be given such a major role with regard to migrants?  Where is Ireland's voice in terms of looking for an alternative to that?</p> <p>  My second question relates to overseas development aid.  I wish Mr. Gaffey well on the next stage of his journey, following his work with Irish Aid.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien has said, our reputation on aid is unparalleled.  There is great respect for Ireland but, that being said, we are now further away from the 0.7% target.  How can we move towards that, particularly in the context of realising sustainable development goals?  </p> <p>  What is happening with regard to tackling the root causes of the problems in the Horn of Africa?  The EU says it wants to tackle them but what is happening in that regard?  Yesterday I met a delegation, including a Minister, from Somaliland.  I know there are difficulties there with regard to the recognition of that state but it is a democracy that has had peaceful elections and transfers of power.  Will the Department consider further engagement with Somaliland?</p> <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on prisoners.  First, there are Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike at present.  Can our diplomatic personnel in Tel Aviv and Ramallah raise the human rights concerns of those prisoners?  In Iran, there are seven Baha'i leaders who are in their ninth year of imprisonment and I ask that we would make representations on their behalf.  </p> <p>  Finally, I have asked previously that we would look at the process of election monitoring because concerns are being brought to me about the transparency and accountability of same.  It may not be an issue for today but I would appreciate a meeting someone from the Department to discuss that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017052500002#C00500"><p>With regard to Iran, I ask the Minister if and when we are going to reopen the embassy in that country.  The Minister will have noted that an election was held there recently and the President was re-elected.  He is trying to change the direction of his country.  I paid an official visit to Iran when I was Ceann Comhairle and spoke with the President.  It would be in our interests as well as the interests of the region for Ireland to be represented there by way of an embassy.  The Irish embassy in Iran was closed some time ago and it is ridiculous that it has not been reopened when efforts are being made to bring Iran into a normal way of doing business.  There are constant attempts to attack Iran even though the regime there has changed.  In my meeting with the President, I asked him directly if he intended to or had already developed weapons of mass destruction.  His answer, without hesitation, was "No" and he said that such weapons are contrary to the religious beliefs of the people of Iran.  I am tired of listening to people constantly having a go at Iran when there are other countries in that region that are not doing as much in terms of trying to change peoples' opinion.  Iran went through a very difficult period with the changeover in the 1970s but now it is time to bring that country on board.</p><p>It is essential to peacekeeping in the region.  I just do not understand why we do not have an embassy there to be able to report back at first hand on what is happening.  I can tell members only what I experienced.  I had a one-to-one conversation for about half an hour with the President.  I was there as Ceann Comhairle; I was not there poking my nose in.  I got a straight answer.  These people want to do business with Ireland and want to become part and parcel of the whole process in the Middle East.  It is important we have someone heading up the regime in Iran who is progressive and not going backwards.  Ireland, as an independent country, should have an embassy there from which we would get constant reports back through our diplomatic channels.</p><p> I was in Ukraine with a number of Speakers from European parliaments.  We met the country's President.  Incidentally, his two children were born in Ireland.  I had not realised that.  Ukraine is struggling.  It is blatantly obvious that the Russians are up to their ears in causing problems in the eastern part of Ukraine.  They have already walked into Crimea and annexed it, but nowhere, including Germany, raised a whimper.  Imagine someone walking into this country and taking it over part and parcel.  The issue of Ukraine has gone off the agenda.  No one is even raising it as an issue now.  The mother of the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland was living in Crimea.  He could not go to visit his own mother.  This is one of the day-to-day human aspects of all this.  We wonder what is happening with Russia and so on.  The Russians have not given up their desires to annexe parts of the world they once controlled.  As an independent country within the European Union, it is important for Ireland to have its own opinion on these sorts of issues.  We protect dearly our neutrality and should use it to speak out on these sorts of issues.  When one visits places such as the ones I have mentioned and talks to the people involved, one realises they are left swinging.  No one is talking about Crimea.  I never hear a dicky bird about it.  I would like the Minister to address that also.</p><p> Are serious efforts being made in the Minister's Department to set up a really important team to deal with Brexit?  I feel this is drifting along.  We are getting all sorts of mixed messages.  Why was the representative who was here addressing the two Houses also at the Border?  I am told he was looking at areas suitable for posts.  What was his business going there?  Our policy is to have no boundaries, and we are trying to agree this with the British.  This is such an important issue for us.  Ours is an island stuck out in the Atlantic and we are the ones who will suffer most owing to Britain pulling out of the European Union.  This little island out in the Atlantic will have an independent Great Britain between it and the rest of Europe, so before going further down the line or before fallings out between those negotiating on behalf of the European Union and Britain, we will have to address this.  We are the ones who will really suffer.  It is important we be clear about this.  I acknowledge our Government has been trying to make clear what we want, but what we want and what we get are matters on which we need guarantees.</p></speech>

Over the past 12 months, there have been successful visits by Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia.  Our ambassador who is currently responsible for the country of Iran and who is based in Ankara in Turkey visits the area regularly.  I have met some parties who have recently returned from a trade delegation.</p> <p>  Quite bluntly, this is a matter of resources and of many competing demands faced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, most important of which is the one raised by Deputy Barrett, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  We are certainly keeping this issue under review.  I would like to be in a position to report active progress on it.  I am glad the nuclear deal appears to be holding.  I accept what Deputy Barrett said in respect of recent elections in Iran.  The matter of Ireland's engagement by way of a full-time ambassadorial presence in Iran is under active consideration.  I would be happy to keep the committee informed.  In the meantime, our Ankara representative has full accreditation in Iran.</p> <p>  I wish to go back to the issue raised by Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, not for the first time.  I have received a letter from the Chairman of this committee on the matter of clarification regarding last month's elections to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Contrary to what has been said this morning, I have not disclosed the Irish vote, nor indeed will I.</p></speech>

During my visit to Saudi Arabia in November of last year, I specifically and deliberately raised human rights issues, including women's rights, with the Saudi Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I assure the members of the committee that we will continue to use every opportunity to continue to convey Ireland's position on this issue.</p> <p>  I have been asked to review policy or change the policy in this regard.  This is not an Irish policy.  It is a UN policy.  Since 1947, the rules of procedure governing elections at the United Nations provide that they take place by secret ballot.</p></speech>

I do not intend to depart from that unilaterally because UN engagement is a vital aspect of Irish foreign policy.  Like all my predecessors, I do not propose to undermine Ireland's position at the United Nations, nor do I propose to undermine the functioning of the United Nations by departing from the practice of not publicly disclosing how we vote in secret ballot.  It would be damaging to our ability to conduct international relations successfully.  It would be damaging to our capacity to advance our values and concerns and the concerns of the Irish people if we were unilaterally to abandon a practice that has been in place for more than six decades and that flows directly from a rule of the United Nations.</p><p>If there are further issues, I will be happy to deal with them, but I will not undermine Ireland at the United Nations, nor will I undermine the United Nations.</p></speech>

For example, elections involving close partners take place on a regular basis.  On average, there are in excess of 30 per annum and we do not disclose how we vote in them.  I am not talking about hypothetical examples.  It happens on a regular basis and this is one of such example.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett mentioned Crimea.  I assure him and the committee that we are unwavering in our support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Ukraine.  There is a reform programme and we keep ourselves fully informed at EU level and on a bilateral basis.  I visited Kiev the year before last and met senior Ministers.  We continue to be most concerned about the situation in Ukraine.</p> <p>  Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned the issue of development.  I assure them and the committee that the EU consensus on development was adopted last week by the Development Ministers in Brussels.  It retains a very strong focus on the elimination of poverty.  However, it also recognises the broad focus of the global development framework agreed at the United Nations and the sustainable development goals, in the development of which Ireland very much played a leading role, recognising the link between development, conflict and security, as well as economic development.  We will continue to play a strong role in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred to Somaliland.  We had recent contact with the authorities there.  While fully recognising the sovereignty of Somalia, we understand there are issues to be addressed in the case of Somaliland.  There was a technical visit last year by the President and Foreign Minister of Somaliland and we maintain contact through our ambassador in Nairobi who is accredited to Somalia.</p> <p>  I wish to refer briefly to the Middle East peace process.  I acknowledge the support of the committee in that regard.  I also acknowledge the existence of D&aacute;il motions, the cross-party support and my strong support for a two-state solution.  The Government remains committed to the recognition of the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict.  That commitment is contained in the programme for Government.  My two visits to the region have contributed to its ongoing consideration and I discuss the question on a regular basis.  I do so as recently at the last meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  It is not a question of making up my mind or being unwilling to do so but one of ensuring the two-state solution is one on which we can ensure the support of other countries, particularly in the European Union.  During his recent visit to Israel President Trump spoke in very positive terms about the peace process.  </p> <p>  It has come to my attention in the past few days that there are some who are seeking to bring pressure to bear to have a cancellation of a reading by the Israeli novelist, Dorit Rabinyan, at the Dublin International Literary Festival this Saturday.  I express my concern about this and my rejection of efforts to bring about the cancellation of the event and move towards a cultural boycott.  There are no circumstances in which I would agree with it.  I have no difficulty, as Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I have stated in the House, in raising concerns and those of Members on all sides about the continued occupation with the Israeli authorities - with the ambassador in Dublin, as I have done, and directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu and with a number of his Ministers - but I have no time for censorship or silencing the voices of those who might disagree with us or who might simply challenge us.  To try to silence artists, those who have a role in society in challenging all of us, is to head down a very dangerous path which I hope all those present will reject.</p> <p>  I am aware of the prisoner issue in Israel, in particular Palestinian prisoners, and acknowledge what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said.  It is a sensitive issue, but I cannot support the use of hunger strikes.  I am anxious to avoid using language which might not be helpful, but the overriding concern is to avoid a tragic outcome.  I have made my concerns known to the Israeli ambassador here, as have the EU heads of mission in Jerusalem and our own representative in Ramallah.  I do not accept in any circumstance that there is value in people withdrawing from self-nourishment.  It is entirely unhelpful and detrimental to one's health.  I advise the Deputy that there have been reports in recent days that moves to resolve the hunger strike may be nearing success.  I wish the parties engaging in that process every success.  I have continually repeated my condemnation and opposition to the continued advancement of settlements and also spoken about EU funded projects and property.  </p> <p>  On Saudi involvement in Yemen, I raised directly the impact of the conflict on civilians and civilian infrastructure with the Emirates Foreign Minister on two occasions when he was here and when I was in the Emirates late last year.  I also raised the issue when I was in Saudi Arabia last November.  </p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred to the situation in Libya and is right in what she said.  The political situation there is complex, difficult and challenging.  I note the point she made about migration, but the recent meeting between the Prime Minister of the UN-backed government of national accord in the west and Field Marshall Haftar in the east was a step in the right direction.  I accept that it may be some time before a solution acceptable to all sides is reached, but Ireland continues to support the formation of a functioning government under the framework of a Libyan political agreement.  I reiterate that a Libyan own and led political solution remains the only way forward for the benefit of its people.  Ireland fully supports the European Union's participation in the Quartet. </p> <p>  I advise Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that there has been a decrease in the number of migrants from the eastern Mediterranean region, but there has been an increase in the central Mediterranean region to which she referred.  This is an issue that Ireland monitors closely.  I acknowledge the work of the Naval Service in the region.  The Deputy mentioned reports of serious mistreatment and abuse experienced by migrants in Liyba, which we condemn.  In February the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union called on the Libyan authorities to redouble their efforts to improve the promotion of human rights, especially in migrant detention centres, given the vulnerability of migrants.  We need to ensure a strong focus on capacity building, strengthening the Libyan coastguard and improving reception centres for migrants along the Libyan coast.</p></speech>

Does he not accept that, for those who go on hunger strike, it is not a step that is taken lightly but is, rather, an act of desperation?  Does he not accept that many of their demands, such as access to longer and more regular family visits and to medical care, are reasonable and, as would be the case in any democratic society, should be acceded to?  These are basic demands that one would imagine any society would deliver to prisoners.</p><p>The Minister said he raised his concerns.  What are his concerns regarding the situation in Palestine?  Would he accept that Israel continues to violate international human rights law with impunity?  Are they part of the concerns the Minister raised with the Israeli Embassy here in Dublin?</p><p>The Minister said that Egypt was discussed at the February Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  The Egyptian Foreign Minister joined the lunchtime discussion.  I presume the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, raised the Ibrahim Halawa case with him.  Did he encourage other EU Foreign Ministers to raise Mr. Halawa's case and call for the immediate release of this European Union citizen who has now spent almost four years in jail?  As the Minister knows, Mr. Halawa's trial has been adjourned 25 times.  Recently, the Minister has been trying to put a positive spin on the ongoing illegal incarceration of Mr. Halawa by pointing to witness testimony being heard and to shorter adjournments.  Has he ever pointed out that, under Egyptian pre-trial law, detention, particularly for a minor, in excess of two years is illegal?  Why has the Minister not raised that publicly?  Why has he not also pointed out that Mr. Halawa's name does not even appear on the book of evidence linking him to any alleged crimes?  Why has that not been raised in public discourse?</p><p>I am concerned that the Minister is lending some sort of legitimacy of this mass-trial process that does not stand up to even the most basic international or democratic standards.  I can only assume that his putting a positive spin on matters will take attention away from what, up to now, has been a failed, quiet diplomacy strategy.  Mr. Halawa's next trial date is not for another six weeks.  He continues to spend his time in prison despite allegations of sexual assault and despite an Irish doctor calling for his immediate release on health grounds.  Will the Minister finally act and pursue an international legal challenge against Egypt over its treatment of this Irish citizen?</p><p>I do not believe that Western Sahara has been referred to by anyone.  I am very concerned about the efforts of the European Commission to renegotiate adoption of the protocols of the association agreement between the EU and Morocco.  Was this discussed at April's Foreign Affairs Council?  In April the Commission wrote to member states asking them to give it a mandate to negotiate a revised agreement with Morocco that would allow the Union to continue importing goods from Western Sahara, including fish, phosphates and tomatoes, which would enter EU the market under the same trade regime as goods coming from Morocco.  The details of the Commission's proposal are not public, but it appears that its plan consists of efforts to circumvent the December 2016 ruling of the European Court of Justice in Polisario <i>v.</i>Council which annulled the EU-Morocco agreement because it illegally applied to Western Sahara.  It seems that the Commission now wants to negotiate exclusively with Morocco and ignore the legitimate and UN-recognised representative people of Western Sahara, the Polisario Front.  That confuses the people of Western Sahara with the population there, which is made up of a majority of Moroccan settlers and the few remaining Sahrawi people who have not been forced to flee.  Is it seeking some Moroccan institution or body to provide the consent of the population while the European Court of Justice stated that Western Sahara is a distinct and separate entity?</p><p>Is the Minister concerned that the Commission that led the EU into this situation where the European Court of Justice had to annul the previous EU-Morocco agreement is now trying to involve member states in another act of illegality which would undoubtedly be challenged, and presumably annulled, by the Polisario Front at another EU court?  Is he concerned that the European Commission seems to want to undermine the landmark ruling of the European Court of Justice?  What is Ireland's position on the matter?</p><p>The Minister mentioned that Turkey and the fact that this committee met Faysal Sariyildiz, an MP for the HDP.  We are all aware of the appalling prison conditions under which many of the HDP MPs and mayors are being held.  Many are being kept in solitary confinement.  We are aware of the oppression of the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country.  The Minister referred to the Turkish referendum called by President Erdoan.  What is the Irish position on that referendum?  I am a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE.  Two of the members of PACE monitored the referendum in Turkey.  President Erdoan appeared on Turkish television to state that these two members, who were monitoring on behalf of PACE, were sympathetic to terrorists.  Does the Minister have a view on that?  Is he concerned about the health and well-being of HDP MPs who remain in jail in Turkey?  Does he believe they should be released?  Is the Minister aware that two Turkish teachers who were dismissed from their jobs and went on hunger strike have been detained by police in Ankara and there are fears that they may be force-fed?</p><p>There was a question about linking development co-operation policies, instruments and budgets to migration management and border control.  The concern is that, in the context of the return, readmission and integration of nationals, the EU is using the leverage of its relevant policies, instruments and tools, including those relating to development and trade.  Does Ireland agree with this apparent shift in policy on development aid?  We know that there are 750 million poor and vulnerable people, half of whom living in Africa, that 20 million people are at risk of starvation and that 64 million are living as refugees or are internally displaced.  Would the Minister agree that it is wrong for the EU to focus on migration when there is such poverty and inequality?</p><p>I have other questions, but the Chairman is nodding at me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017052500002#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I support Deputy Crowe on raising the Ibrahim Halawa case.  I would like the Minister to outline what can be done to ensure that greater pressure is put on the Egyptian authorities to bring about Mr. Halawa's release.</p> <p>  On Ireland's vote in respect of the election of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the Minister said he does not propose to seek to change UN policy not to disclose votes.  On this occasion, the US had called for a vote, as I understand it, which would not normally have happened.  Usually, where there are the same number of countries proposed as there are places on the commission, there is no vote.</p><p>Given that the United States in changing that practice really expressed disapproval of Saudi Arabia's candidacy for the Council, given its appalling treatment of women and girls, can the Minister say if Ireland would at least support moves by other countries to change the disclosure situation on voting, particularly where the votes of other member states of the EU on this particular vote were in fact disclosed to the press and to the public?</p><p> The issue of Palestine has also been raised by other members but I note that the Minister did not answer Deputy Darragh O'Brien's question as to why he has not acted on the commitment in the programme for Government and on previous Seanad and D&aacute;il motions to recognise the state of Palestine, given the Government's stated support for a two-state solution, the fact that we are now approaching the 50th anniversary of Israeli occupation, and ongoing concerns around human rights abuses by the Israeli state.  Could the Minister comment specifically on the commitment to recognise the state of Palestine and what we can do further on that and why it has not been done to date?</p><p> The issue of Turkey has again been raised.  I was among those members who met representatives from the People's Democratic Party, HDP, last week and they spoke to us of appalling treatment by the Turkish Government of the Kurdish population in certain regions and districts in Turkey.  I know that Minister said that he met the Turkish Minister for the Economy in April when he came to Ireland.  If we were to communicate with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the disclosures made to us by the Kurdish representatives here perhaps he could say if he could then meet the Turkish ambassador to bring those concerns to him?  I know that he is meeting the Turkish authorities on an ongoing basis.  There are huge concerns of course among EU governments about the ongoing detentions, the mass sackings of public servants in Turkey, the show trials, and the arrests and detentions of large numbers of individuals there.  This is a specific matter that the Kurdish representatives brought to us last week and I would be grateful if the Minister could raise it directly with the Turkish ambassador.</p><p> My final points concern Syria and the migration issue and I am grateful to Tr&oacute;caire and to the Irish Syria Solidarity Movement who have communicated some serious concerns to me about ongoing issues there.  We know that the terrible humanitarian crisis continues in Syria.  John Ging spoke to the committee last week of the more than 600,000 persons still under siege in Syria.  There are real concerns about forcible displacements of families; we are hearing about up to 2,000 families being forcibly displaced per week and we know that Idlib in particular has seen a large number of forcible displacements.  Can the Minister say what Ireland is doing to increase protection of civilians in Syria? Can we seek for example to have Irish agencies operating in Idlib?  I do not think that they are at present and maybe he could comment on that.  Can we seek to see air-drops of aid into besieged communities in Syria?  Can we look at the countries that are supporting the brutal Assad regime?  I listened with interest to Deputy Barret's comments about Iran and engagement with Iran but clearly Iran is complicit in much of what is going on in Syria and many of the actions of the regime.  Has the EU or has Ireland considered the question of further sanctions on Iran in respect of its involvement in the Syrian catastrophe?  How can the EU counter the malign and growing influence of Russia as a huge force behind and supportive of Assad's regime in Syria?  The Minister has spoken himself very eloquently about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Crimea and we are all conscious that the EU already has sanctions against Russia.  How can the EU act in a more concerted manner to prevent or check Russia's growing and what most of us would see as malign influence in so many areas in Syria and in Ukraine in particular?</p></speech>

I would like to let him know, however, that there was a meeting held here last week by Senator Black for the Irish Friends of Palestine.  It was a meeting to which she invited all of us and I attended along with three or four other Senators to observe.  Within hours the American Friends of Israel were on to my assistant in Chicago asking why I was at the meeting, if I was a member of the Friends of Palestine and if he would please explain my presence.  It is outrageous that a member of the Seanad is questioned about going to a meeting set up by one of his colleagues to be informed about the situation.  I would like to bring that to the Minister's attention.</p> <p>  On the issue of the terrible atrocities, and this may not be in the Minister's remit, but my brother has been in Dubai for the past 25 years and is very involved with government circles over there.  He tells me that every week all the imams' speeches have to be handed in to the government for scrutiny to ensure that there is no radicalisation preached in their sermons and that there is full access to attend.  In view of what is happening in Europe and the terrible atrocity that happened in Manchester in the last number of days, these attacks are the work of radicalised individuals, born in the very countries they target.  We need to be on the alert here and bring out some measures that will protect our own people.  </p> <p>  The Minister knows of my involvement with the undocumented Irish.  Are there any plans in this regard?  We have to think outside the box because we know that there will be no immigration reform in the United States this year.  About two months ago President Trump had a bipartisan meeting with Senators from both parties.  He said he would look favourably towards the Senate Bill that was passed in 2013, which gave us 10,500 non-immigrant visas in perpetuity.  This was a real coup for us.  There was no objection at that time to the granting of those.  Of course it never got to the House.  Should we go down an avenue where we would give reciprocal visas to US citizens who want to come to work here, especially now in light of Brexit and American companies hoping to locate here?  I would like to see if there are any plans to do that or if it is an avenue worth opening in Europe.</p></speech>

One of the key things to emerge from research that I have done for the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is that there was a special status for East Germany with regard to trade between East and West Germany prior to the wall coming down and that it was effectively treated, in trading terms, as a member of the European Union.  That might be something that could be used as a precedent for trade if not between Ireland and the UK then certainly between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is a little-known field and there is very little research and hard data on it, given the nature of the issue between East and West Germany, but it is something that we could use in respect of the special status for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  On the issue of securing at the Heads of Government meeting a declaration on the issue of a united Ireland that would be provided for in the final agreement, that declaration is very important and it is obviously also important that it comply with the Good Friday Agreement.  </p> <p>  Regarding issues that have come up before the committee and some that the Minister has touched on, we have had great discussions here about consulates and honorary consulates and we got an excellent strategy briefing document on this from the Minister's officials this morning.  There does not seem to be a ten-year plan, however, on where we will roll out consulates.  We had previously been told that there was no data available to the committee on where the Irish are globally although that was clarified subsequently and we got a reply from the Minister's Secretary General saying that the Department has the data and is working on it. There does not however seem to be a ten-year plan on where these consulates are going to be, as opposed to how they are to be identified and appointed.  It seems to be the case that we look at regions or countries only if we are asked by an ambassador to do so, rather than saying that we are going to target them.</p> <p>  I would like to sit down with the Minster and the Secretary General on a specific issue relating to the United States, namely the concerns of staff in the Irish embassies and consulates in New York about pension rights.  They are stuck in limbo between US pensions and Irish pensions and getting neither.</p><p>There seems to be an issue within the Irish embassies and consulates in New York, in that staff are concerned about pension rights and the fact that they are stuck in a limbo between US and Irish pensions and getting neither.  After all of their years of service over there, they will have to survive on a non-contributory Irish pension, believe it or not.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p><p> On the question of illegal settlements and EU law on goods coming from the occupied territories, is there any plan to ensure that these goods are identified in Ireland?  I am concerned about what happened to Senator Lawless.  It was outrageous.  They might do that in America and believe that they can intimidate Members of these Houses for speaking out, but this is not America and Ireland will not be afraid to speak out.  According to a report by 22 NGOs to the EU, the European Commission has confirmed that member states can unilaterally adopt measures to restrict trade on the basis of regulation No. 260/2009 if justified on the grounds of public morality, public policy or public security.  Given the fact that it is referred to as an illegal occupation and this is its 50th anniversary, will the Government consider taking action in that regard?</p><p> The committee has a concern about the foreign policy strategy that was given to us in draft form.  The concern relates to the EU's creeping militarisation and how the first draft of our foreign policy strategy document made no mention of neutrality.  That sent the wrong message to Europe.  I can give the Minister the draft.  We sorted it out in the final document, but only after going back and forth over it.</p><p> I will revert to the work that has been done on Brexit.  Well done, Minister.  We do not often compliment him, but we do when a job is done well.  We will not agree everything in the strategy, but the declaration on Ireland by the Heads of Government was an important step.</p></speech>

Unfortunately again, there was the loss of 30 lives in the Mediterranean yesterday.  I understand that they were mainly toddlers.  It shows the gravity of the situation of this ongoing humanitarian crisis.  Senator Bacik referred to Mr. John Ging's presentation to the committee last week.  There are so many humanitarian crises throughout the world, there is a danger that some may become forgotten - South Sudan, north-east Nigeria, etc.  Have these featured at the Foreign Affairs Council?  Does the Minister expect the Middle East peace process to be an item at the next Council meeting following US President Trump's visit to the region?</p> <p>  Is Brexit an item on the Council's monthly agenda from the point of view of its effects on the Common Foreign and Security Policy?  Where I come from in Cavan-Monaghan, its effect on Europe's foreign policy is not the issue that keeps people awake.  Rather, its economic effect, the difficulties that may arise and the risk of losing momentum in the peace process and the major advances that we have made on this island since 1998 are what concern the people whom I have the privilege of representing in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  In that context and regarding markets, where difficulties will arise for many sectors due to Brexit, is the Russian ban on certain products from the EU considered at the Foreign Affairs Council?  The Russian Federation imposed sanctions in August 2014, particularly on certain agrifood products.  That has had a significant knock-on effect on Ireland's export potential and the prices available for products.  For example, the pigmeat sector's substantial market in Russia was lost due to the ban.  Commissioner Hogan has stated that negotiations are ongoing, but is this issue kept under consideration by the Foreign Affairs Council, given its importance?  When a market is reduced, it has a knock-on adverse impact on the prices available to primary producers and processors.</p></speech>

On the basis that Deputy O'Sullivan is required for further business, I would be happy to arrange for a bilateral briefing with a senior official on the particular matter of the electoral register to address the Deputy's concerns about where we are going in that regard.  We might arrange that for next week.</p></speech>

Ireland has an involvement there from a humanitarian point of view.  I raised this specific issue in the context of my bilateral engagements with the foreign Minister of the Arab Emirates and in Saudi.</p> <p>  I apologise to Deputy Barrett for not referencing Brexit in my reply.  The Chairman is correct, in that this is a major engagement under my departmental priorities and I assure Deputy Barrett that we have a strong and active team, working in concert with the Taoiseach, his Department and the Cabinet committee, that was specifically inaugurated to deal with the challenge of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p> <p>  Turning to Senator Daly, a bespoke political solution will be required, one that recognises the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  This is an issue that has been debated in plenary sessions of the Parliament and the Seanad has a particular mandate in that regard.  I welcome committee engagements and the views of Members of the Houses.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to maintain our pursuit of effective and realisable measures to address the many areas of concern across the Government in terms of Brexit.  This includes the need to have our unique circumstances fully recognised.</p> <p>  At Foreign Affairs Council level, I have had almost 100 meetings with my colleagues.  At every Council meeting in Brussels, I arrange a number of key bilaterals in order to ensure that Ireland's priorities are not only realised, but accepted across the EU.  I acknowledge Senator Daly's comments in that regard, as it is important that we continue to prioritise Ireland's issues, notwithstanding the favourable regard to Ireland in the context of the guidelines.  We will maintain our focus and continue to engage at the highest level.  If the committee wishes to put Brexit as a single item on its agenda at any stage, I am happy to return to discuss the issues.</p> <p>  The European Council agreed that it would lead on Brexit.  Having regard to the fact that there are a number of policy areas for other Councils, we take our lead from the European Council.  The General Affairs Council, which is attended by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has engaged actively in formulating the principles, practices and procedures for negotiation.  I keep regular contact with him and the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy Barrett that we are fully equipped.  Since the referendum result, we have been in a position to augment our teams in key EU locations, with particular reference to London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels, which is the nerve centre of our activities in that regard.</p><p> Deputy Barrett mentioned specifically Commissioner Barnier and his visit to the Border.  That visit was at my invitation and I was with him.  I believe it is very important that not only Commissioner Barnier but also a number of EU Foreign Ministers would have the opportunity of visiting our Border, not to look around at suitable locations for further activity but to see the "seamless" nature of the Border, to quote the British Prime Minister, and to ensure that as strong as possible a case continues to be made for the maintenance of our open Border.  Commissioner Barnier was struck by the invisible nature of our Border.  We had been telling him that the Border between North and South was invisible and that we wished that open Border to be maintained, irrespective of what happens.  I am looking forward to taking my colleague the Danish Foreign Minister on a similar field trip, having had key Members of the European Parliament visit the Border in recent weeks as well as my colleague, the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, the most senior member of the Foreign Affairs Council.  I am anxious to ensure that, once Ireland's issues are prioritised at EU level, they can actually see it by visiting the Border.  I was pleased that Commissioner Barnier took time out to walk the Border.</p><p> Very briefly on a number of other-----</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's clarification.  I think it is important.  In raising the issue I was giving the opportunity to put these facts on the record.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017052500002#J00300"><p>I understand that the Commissioner was speaking hypothetically about various possible scenarios.  It is impossible to quantify any of this until such time as the negotiations actually commence and then the game becomes clear and there is a greater level of clarification.  It is important that, from our point of view as a key member of the EU 27 in the negotiations, we continue to highlight and prioritise our strategic national interests.</p> <p>  On the matter of the Saudi vote, there is no evidence in the instant case that the US called for a vote on the Commission on the Status of Women in any way relating to the position of Saudi Arabia or any candidate.  It did not say why it called a vote.  However, even if a vote is called, the calling of the vote or the conduct of the vote is entirely within the rules - rule 92 or whatever it is - that I have already quoted from, which is that it be governed by a secret ballot.  This is a rule.  I do not see how I can unilaterally depart from the rule, which would have an undermining effect of Ireland in the UN, as well as the UN's conduct of its own business.</p> <p>  On the matter of recognition of the state of Palestine and comments of Deputy Crowe, Senators Bacik and Mark Daly and others, the matter is included in the programme for Government where we are committed to recognising.  I am keeping under review whether immediate recognition by Ireland of the state of Palestine prior to its real achievement on the ground can be a helpful step towards resolving what is an ongoing and longstanding conflict of huge complexity.  I visited the region.  I intend visiting it again.  Immediate recognition would be a largely symbolic action.  There are arguments for and against doing so at this time.  I have not so far recommended to Government that the state of Palestine be recognised.  Of course I support and have for many years supported, as indeed does this Government and previous Governments, the two-state solution, as does the European Union.  However, I am not yet convinced that the balance of these arguments is in favour of immediate recognition now.  I say to the Chair, as a Chairman of a foreign affairs committee, that if and when I am, I will do so without hesitation.  I am anxious to continue to hear the submissions and position of this committee.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the hunger strikes.  I do not support hunger strikes, as Deputy Crowe will know.  I again acknowledge that there are real concerns about the use and the nature of detention in Israel.  My officials have raised this issue with the embassy in Israel and I have raised it myself.  It has also been raised through the head of the EU delegation on the ground.</p> <p>  I opposed the settlement expansion.  I have said that on numerous public occasions, both here in our Houses of Parliament, at EU level and directly in the context of my meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I will continue to express on behalf of Ireland our concerns in this region.  As a member of the Foreign Affairs Council, this is an issue that regularly features on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The EU has taken a number of actions to differentiate between Israel and illegal Israeli settlements including a number of initiatives relating to certification, advising against investment and requiring accurate labelling of settlement goods.  I will continue to take a deep interest in that.</p> <p>  Mention was made by Deputy Crowe and others of the matter of Egypt and reference was made to Ibrahim Halawa, the Irish citizen detained in Egypt without a trial having being concluded.  I do not put any positive spin on this issue.  I am very concerned as to the length of time it is taking to have this criminal case dealt with and a conclusion reached.  I raised the issue directly with my colleague, Foreign Minister Shoukry, at the meeting to which Deputy Crowe refers.  I avail of every opportunity, even as recently as last week, to address the issue directly with Egypt's ambassador here in Dublin.  </p> <p>  We continue to work hard and diligently on our citizen's behalf on the matter of the issue of formal legal proceedings.  There are time issues involved here.  I would be very concerned at the Irish Government embarking on a protracted process of legal proceedings that might take years to complete.  I would be concerned that there may be an adverse impact on the position of our citizen should we embark on the issue of legal proceedings.  I acknowledge what the judge has said in a recent hearing of the case when he acknowledged that progress has been made, as well as the number of witnesses that have given evidence.  I regard that as progress in the case.  However, I do not engage in the putting of any positive spin on what is a very serious issue.</p> <p>  My Department deals with 3,000 consular cases annually.  This is now heading towards ten consular cases a week and is a challenge that could be the subject matter of a particular debate here should the committee members require.  This is one of the greatest challenges facing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a consequence of more Irish people travelling abroad more frequently.  There was a 20% increase in the number of Irish passports and the Department is dealing with perhaps up to 30 new cases per week on a consular basis.  No case in the history of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been accorded such priority or resourcing as the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  I regret that the progress is such that we have not had a conclusion to the case.  I wish to see it.  I am concerned at the matter being adjourned, but adjourned now in recent times with progress having been reported.  The return date of 4 July next is some weeks away.</p><p>It is important to note, in the context of Egypt's criminal justice system and the holding of courts there, that courts are not regularly held in the course of the Ramadan period.  The return date is 4 July and the next hearing is to be scheduled for then.  My officials will be present, as they have been on each and every occasion.</p><p> In the meantime, let me stress the importance of ensuring that health and welfare concerns, which have been brought to my Department's attention, are being fully dealt with by the Egyptian authorities in conjunction with full consultation with the Irish authorities.  Our ambassador and team on the ground will continue to engage at consular level by way of visits and engaging with his family at every opportunity.</p><p> Senator Bacik mentioned EU-Russia relations both on the matter of the situation in Ukraine raised by Deputy Barrett and on Russian actions in Syria, which have been profoundly damaging to Europe's relations with Russia.  The full implementation of Russia's obligations under the Minsk agreements remains a key concern for the European Union.  What Senator Bacik has said in respect of Syria is a matter of continued concern.  As a member of the European Union and as the sovereign Irish Government, we see a political, not a military, solution in Syria as being the only way forward.  In the meantime, the Irish engagement to the relief of human suffering will continue.</p><p> On the Chairman's questions, I assure him that we will continue to prioritise the matter of Brexit in my Department.  The Chairman mentioned EU sanctions in response to Russia's aggression towards Ukraine and Russia's continued involvement at what can only be described as an undermining of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  The current sanctions have had an impact.  The current sanctions remain a key source of influence.  They are kept under review.  The current round of EU restrictions on sanctions from an economic perspective has been extended to 23 June this year.  They will be reviewed but in my view, any relaxation of sanctions must only be considered when there is clear evidence to support a measure of concrete progress that we all wish to see on the ground in eastern Ukraine.  I am not sure if that is evident at present.</p><p> I will turn briefly to Senator Lawless's continued engagement, indeed leadership, in these Houses and beyond, on the matter of the undocumented Irish, which is a key priority for the Irish Government.  I had the opportunity of raising the issue on my visit to the United States shortly after the inauguration of President Trump.  It formed a key pillar of the Taoiseach's engagement in March.  Our embassy in Washington, as well as our consulates across the United States remain fully in context with representatives of the Irish community.  It is our priority.  I would be happy to engage with Senator Lawless bilaterally or with this committee, in this regard.  I note this is a longstanding issue in which the Chairman has expressed an interest and it is important for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence of our Parliament to continue to engage at the highest level on this matter, the complexity and challenge of which is well known to us all.</p><p> Senator Mark Daly mentions honorary consuls - a network of 98.  There is a practice and procedure involved by way of ensuring that these issues are not only kept under constant review but that there is a consistency in the manner in which these appointments and interactions are made.  Officials have met Senator Daly and we would certainly be happy for them to do so again.  I acknowledge the important role that our team of honorary consuls plays across the world.  I note Senator Daly has raised some issues, with particularly reference to the United States.  We would be happy to engage with him on that.</p><p> Issues with Turkey have been mentioned by Deputy Crowe and Senator Bacik.  I would be happy to convey any message from this committee directly to the Turkish authorities.  Following the committee's meeting last week with representatives of the Turkish political administration, I and my officials would be happy to take any position the committee might adopt, directly to the embassy or further at my opportunities, to convey the views of the committee to Turkish Ministers, either at Council of Europe level when we have the opportunity of direct engagement or in the context of my bilateral arrangements with Turkey.  The issue of the post-coup climate in Turkey is one of concern, particularly with regard to human rights and in the aftermath of the recent referendum.  I assure members of the committee that Ireland's voice will not be silent in raising these issues.</p></speech>

A number of reports have been sought.  They are not yet completed.  Indeed, given the close result of the referendum, 51.3% to 49.7%, there are a number of reports, from the OSCE, the Council of Europe and others, expected in the course of the summer months.  Ireland will frame its position on the basis of the result of these reports.</p> <p>  Briefly, on Western Sahara and Morocco, Ireland categorised Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory.  We support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.  We do not have a firm view of the outcome of that decision - whether it is autonomy, integration or some other solution in the form of a number of options - provided that this is decided on the basis of a genuine exercise of self-determination.</p> <p>  We have taken careful note of a Court of Justice decision of last year before the end of the year and the possible renegotiation of the association agreement or amendments to the association agreement is currently under discussion at EU level.  This is a complex issue.  It will involve charting a way towards the reconciliation of practical issues, such as certifying the origin of goods and the monitoring of implementation with matters of principle relating to the consent or otherwise of the people of the region in Western Sahara.  I would be happy to keep the committee appraised of developments in that regard.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the motion referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on approving the terms of the framework agreement on comprehensive partnership and co-operation between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part.  Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 9 May 2017, the committee must consider this matter and, having done so, report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 25 May 2017.  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  We will hear the opening presentation from the Minister and take questions from members thereafter.  I take this opportunity, on behalf of the committee, to convey to the British Ambassador and the people of Manchester and Britain our sincere condolences following the brutal and senseless attack on the people of Manchester last Monday night.  On behalf of the committee, I wrote to the British Ambassador on Tuesday morning conveying to him our deepest condolences and asking him to pass them to the local communities affected by this senseless act of terrorism.  As a committee, we also express our sympathy to Britain in general as it deals with yet another cruel and brutal attack on society.  It was a heinous and barbaric act, targeting young and innocent people.  I want to put on record our committee's abhorrence of these evil acts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I begin by associating myself with the Chairman's expression of sympathy and I add my own condolences and those of the Government to the families of victims of the appalling attack in Manchester on Monday.  On Tuesday I spoke with the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson, and told him that the D&aacute;il and Seanad were united in expressing solidarity and recording our horror and disgust at this terrible act.  As of now, there are no reports of any Irish citizens confirmed among the victims.  I have received reports from our embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, of a suicide bombing there last night.  I abhor such cowardly attacks.  What happened in Jakarta is an affront to the Indonesian Government and the efforts to counter extremism and promote inclusion and tolerance in that country.  Both Ireland and the entire European Union strongly support that.  I understand that there are no reports of any foreign casualties in that case.  I join the Chairman in acknowledging that our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected in Manchester and Jakarta.</p><p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has been asked to approve the following motion:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part, signed at Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, on 30 April 2013, a copy of which was laid before the D&aacute;il on 11 April 2017.</blockquote><p>Ireland&rsquo;s political, economic and cultural contacts with Mongolia have been limited in the past.  The Irish community there is very small and, for the most part, transient.  There is also a small community of Mongolians who have studied or worked in Ireland, which retains a strong affinity for Ireland and its people.  I had the pleasure of meeting some of them when I visited last July for the ASEM Summit.</p><p> Other EU member states have stronger and deeper historical, economic and people to people links with Mongolia.  Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership has broadened our horizons and encourages us to strengthen our bilateral relationships with distant lands.  That is increasingly important as we adjust to new political and commercial realities in the wake of the withdrawal of our neighbour, the United Kingdom, from the European Union.</p><p> Ireland has worked well with Mongolia at international level.  Mongolia held the Chairmanship of the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, in 2016 and hosted the 11th ASEM Summit in Ulaanbaatar in July 2016, which I attended on behalf of Ireland.  There has been close co-operation within the framework of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, since Mongolia joined under Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship in 2012.  Mongolia is currently a member of the Human Rights Council for the term 2016 to 2018, and we take a great interest in the work of that Council.</p><p> Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement in our bilateral trade.  Despite a small increase in trade between 2015 and 2016, bilateral trade is still modest between Ireland and Mongolia in both volume and value.  In 2016, total merchandise trade was valued at &euro;8.2 million, mostly exports from Ireland in that regard.  There is some potential for co-operation and trade in the equine industry and possibly in agriculture, as Mongolia looks to develop these sectors.</p><p> The Irish Government has provided some modest development assistance and humanitarian assistance to Mongolia in recent times, channelled through civil society organisations.</p><p> The Irish Government has also supported the deployment of eight Irish observers on election observation missions to Mongolia, three in 2013 and a further five in 2016.  </p><p> This agreement offers us, together with our EU partners, an opportunity to get to know Mongolia a little better and to identify possible opportunities for co-operation across a wide range of sectors.  It is also expected to benefit the people of Mongolia and the Mongolian economy.  </p><p> It is intended to supersede the current legal framework of the 1993 agreement on trade and economic co-operation between the European economic community and Mongolia.  We are among the last EU member states to ratify the agreement, and I hope that the committee will be happy to approve its terms.</p><p> The main objective of the agreement is to provide a framework for strengthening the bilateral relationship between the European Union and Mongolia.  The agreement is based on a commitment to promoting respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights.  It will provide for a comprehensive, wide-ranging dialogue between the European Union and Mongolia, including co-operation in a wide range of areas such as political dialogue, trade and investment, energy, tourism, the environment, development, migration, energy, science and technology, as well as maritime and aviation transport, agriculture, health and civil society.  The agreement also addresses issues in the area of illegal migration, money laundering, illicit drugs, organised crime and corruption.</p><p> It is important that Ireland makes the necessary arrangements to ratify the agreement as soon as possible, as it will not enter into force until the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the other of the completion of the legal procedures necessary for this purpose.  If Ireland is the last member state to ratify the agreement, this will be the final impediment to the agreement&rsquo;s entry into force.  That would be a great shame, as the agreement promises to strengthen EU-Mongolian relations in the years ahead.</p><p> As the PCA agreement is a mixed competence agreement, it must also be ratified by all EU member states as well as by the European Union.  Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the agreement.  It is one of only two member states, the other being Greece, that has not yet completed the necessary ratification procedures.</p><p> The agreement was signed on 13 April 2013.  MEPs on the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Foreign Affairs consented to the PCA in early December 2016.  It was subsequently endorsed during the plenary session of the European Parliament, which took place this year from 13 to 16 February 2017, on 15 February 2017.</p><p> I thank the committee again.  I hope this motion will receive the approval of the committee and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of the agreement so that we can proceed to ratify it in the near future.  I am happy to deal with any issues or observations of members.</p></speech>

It is an agreement that is welcome.  These types of agreements are important for smaller EU member states such as ours, particularly in terms of locations where Ireland does not have an embassy.  I understand the European Parliament passed a resolution earlier this year calling for a full EU delegation to Mongolia.  Has that been agreed at Commission level or is it likely to go ahead?  Obviously, it would be of benefit to us when we do not have diplomatic representation in Mongolia.</p></speech>

The target is that this would be completed and on the ground by the end of this year or early next year.  There are a number of issues to be resolved, but the intent is to move forward.  That will take place within the next 12 months.</p></speech>

This debate is welcome, and I thank him for his presentation.  First, I am interested to know the reason Ireland is the second last country in Europe to ratify the framework agreement?  Is there a reason it remains to be ratified only by Ireland and Greece?  I accept it might be a procedural issue.</p> <p>  Second, is the Minister aware if there are any other EU third country framework proposals in the pipeline that are due to come before this committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#B00600"><p>I acknowledge Deputy O'Brien's support and that of his party.  I regret the fact that Ireland and Greece are somewhere behind in terms of the formal ratification.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It was not to do with a principle issue but the fact that we were particularly busy in recent years in terms of the composition of committees, elections and so on.  That is why I hope we can agree the motion this morning.  There was no issue of principle or legal or procedural obstacle.  It was just that over the course of our business we were not in a position to bring matters to fruition in the manner in which we will do now.</p> <p>  On the second question, I do not have that information to hand.  I would be happy to communicate it privately to the Deputy or to the Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#B00800"><p>Part of the procedure is that there could be a charge on the Exchequer.  Will the Minister explain what that might mean?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned humanitarian assistance through civil society organisations.  Who are they?  I am trying to determine the extent of our engagement to date in Mongolia.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned trade opportunities.  What does the Minister envisage will be those trade opportunities?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned money laundering and illicit drugs.  I must confess that Mongolia was not on my radar as a place where either of those activities took place; I may have missed something in that regard.  I do not think we know very much about Mongolia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#B00900"><p>These would be standard agreements.  It is not that any of these issues particularly refers to Mongolia or any issues of concern in terms of our relationship with Mongolia.  In terms of this partnership co-operation, the essential aspects are that the European Union would work towards supporting the democratic and economic development of the country.  In order to do so in a way that is meaningful, the most appropriate means are by way of a legally binding framework for co-operation.  In Mongolia, there is a requirement to strengthen economic and sectoral co-operation across a wide range of policy fields.</p><p>While our trade and investment is small, that area includes, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, some sustainable development and justice issues which we are furthering.  The agreement also looks at specific areas like the assistance we can give in the area of tourism potential in Mongolia.  This is an area where there is a great deal of potential.  In respect of our development engagement, I cite Ireland's relationship with a number of active NGOs, in particular Save the Children and World Vision, which are operating in Mongolia.  There is also the Christina Nolan Foundation with which members will be familiar.  The World Vision contribution is in excess of &euro;200,000.</p><p> Once we have this legally binding framework, it will provide us with opportunity for further discussion.  The committee might be in a position to be of assistance in our engagement with countries like Mongolia.  For example, the members might consider forming a parliamentary friendship group and making contact on that basis.  I am not familiar with the committee's travel plans, but there may be an opportunity at parliamentary level.  My experience from my short visit was that the Government and Parliament of Mongolia are anxious to strengthen their ties with EU member states, with particular reference to Ireland, albeit in circumstances where our trade and economic relationship is pretty small.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#C00200"><p>I wish to be associated with the remarks on the deaths of young people and parents in Manchester.  Our thoughts are with all the loved ones of those who died and were injured.  As the Minister said, no Irish people were killed or injured, but there is a long connection between Manchester and Dublin with people and families travelling back and forth.  I am sure there are connections to some of the injured and perhaps the dead.  I hope the bereaved and injured will find some solace and comfort in the outpouring of support from people across the world.</p> <p>  I have a couple of observations on the framework agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in supported it when it came to the European Parliament.  Some concerns emerged from the review but overall we see it as very positive.  It does not interfere with Mongolia's right to decide its own social and economic future, unlike other EU framework agreements.  It also recognises Mongolia's right to formulate its own ties with countries, which is really positive.  It is a positive step.  There seemed to be a different approach to the agreement than there has tended to be with others.  It talks about the legitimate right of Mongolia to look for co-operation on economic issues and to build political alliances with countries other than those in the EU.  I see that as a different and an encouraging approach.  It encourages regional integration into Chinese and Russian projects, the China belt, the Silk Road and Euroasian Economic Union.  There is a recognition of Mongolia's location and importance in that part of the world.  It talks about its constructive role in the region and its exceptional established democratic credentials and pledges stronger relations and support for Mongolia in its democratic transformation.</p> <p>  The agreement could become a positive reference.  It talks about the remaining challenges in human rights and the rule of law, which I ask the Minister to comment on.  It refers to engaging in a dialogue on bilateral and multilateral trade and trade related issues with a view to strengthening bilateral trade relations and advancing multilateral trade systems and compliance with WTO rules.  It can serve as a basis for further negotiations in the EU-Mongolia free trade agreement.  My concern about that is if it turns out like some other FTAs we have agreed.  Even if Parliament is agreeable, we would not necessarily agree.  I would have difficulties with that.  There are also problematic parts on trade and economic resolution relations.  The accompanying resolution agreement welcomes the inclusion of Mongolia in the GSP+ scheme and encourages the EU and Mongolia to intensify their trade and investment relations.  There is a positive point in that it stresses that intensification should be in line with international conventions on labour standards, good governance and human rights and environmental standards.  I see that as a positive step and a positive message.  Lastly, it includes reference to climate change and environmental challenges, namely, tackling extractive industries and so on.  There are a great many positives in it.  I congratulate whoever the negotiators were.  There is a growing realisation that these agreements can be positive not only for the EU but for the country involved.  The fact that labour standards, good governance and human rights are included is a positive step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017052500002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his support.  He makes two points that warrant response.  On the matter of the form of framework agreement which members will have, it is a rather standard agreement with a wide range of references and issues from human rights to trade to counter-terrorism.  I do not see any aspect which is specifically designed for the EU's relationship with Mongolia.  Rather, it is indicative of the fact that Mongolia is anxious, as is the EU, to co-operate in a formal partnership along the lines other countries have engaged with the European Union.  It is a form of common standard.</p> <p>  On human rights, I remarked earlier that Mongolia is currently a member of the UN Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 term.  Since 1992 and the introduction of a democratic constitution in Mongolia, there has been a remarkable success in that country in the transition to a market economy and democracy, as borne out in United Nations assessments.  I acknowledge the significant progress on human rights in Mongolia.  It has a national human rights commission which has been judged to be fully compliant with the Paris principles on national human rights institutions.  In 2015, the Mongolian Parliament voted in favour of a new criminal code which abolished the death penalty for all crimes and which took effect from September 2016.  The first ever EU-Mongolia human rights dialogue took place in March 2017.  There has been and continues to be much progress in that regard.</p></speech>

What type of trade and investment activity do we have with Mongolia?</p></speech>

In 2015, total merchandise trade was valued at &euro;8.2 million.  Of that, exports from Ireland were at &euro;7.4 million while imports were roughly 10% of that figure.  There is potential, however.</p><p>While the figures are modest and the engagement is little more than minimal in terms of our own international footprint, there is potential in the equine industry and also in agriculture as Mongolia looks to develop further.  I am also very conscious of Ireland's engagement in the equine and bloodstock industry and associated trade opportunities in feed and so forth.  There certainly are opportunities but I must acknowledge that the current practice is low.</p></speech>

The Minister made reference to the human rights dialogue.  I note that in the February 2017 resolution of the European Parliament regarding the agreement, among the many issues outlined was the absolute need to eliminate discrimination against women and to eradicate all forms of child labour.  Huge concern was also expressed with regard to human trafficking.  These are some of the many issues that must continue to be monitored if we are to make progress and ensure human rights do not continue to be abused.</p></speech>

As the committee's invitation specifically refers to Brexit and customs, I will focus on giving a brief overview of Revenue's role and work under way.  I am accompanied today by Mr. Tony Buckley, who is the assistant secretary responsible for customs and by Mr. Michael Colgan, who heads the Revenue Brexit unit.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  In respect of Brexit, Revenue is participating in the interdepartmental work co-ordinated by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade and we work very closely with the Department of Finance, which determines fiscal policy.  Revenue's focus is on the fair and efficient implementation of possible tax and customs outcomes post Brexit.  As members know, negotiations between the EU and the UK are in their opening phase.  The outcome and practical implications for trade and industry will not be known for some time.  To be clear, therefore, and contrary to recent media reports, Revenue is not negotiating with Her Majesty's Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, on post-Brexit arrangements and Revenue is not looking for sites for customs posts.</p> <p>  In the context of Revenue's overall role and responsibilities, we are engaged in assessing the potential impact of Brexit for Irish traders.  Our role involves the data-based assessment of the potential practical impacts of Brexit.  While we do not prejudge the outcome of the political negotiations, for practical reasons our planning is based on the full range of possibilities, including the possibility that customs controls or processes will apply between Ireland and the UK.  Our data indicate that some 12,000 businesses in Ireland export to the UK, as well as the existence of more than 60,000 importers.  In addition, an unknown number of businesses regularly move goods in transit across Northern Ireland and across the UK.  Most of these businesses are unfamiliar with customs procedures because at present, customs controls do not apply to such movements.  Through the customs consultative committee and in our meetings with representative bodies, we are listening to the concerns of these business and traders.  While it is not possible at this stage to provide detailed guidance, we are advising these traders and transport operators making long-term plans to assume that customs procedures of some form will apply post Brexit.  As soon as we have a reasonable sense of what is needed, we will provide clear, relevant and appropriate information to support business and trade. </p> <p>  Under EU treaties, customs policy is a competence of the Commission.  The law governing customs, the Union customs code, was introduced in 2016.  The administration of controls is a matter for national administrations provided that the systems in use satisfactorily address any risk to the EU.  At present, we are ranked second in the EU for ease of customs procedures so we have a track record of minimising the customs burden.  To put this in some context, Revenue processes approximately 1.4 million customs declarations every year.  Of these, 53% are imports, while 47% are exports.  There are approximately 57,000 transit arrangements.  Exports are generally checked only for safety and security reasons and in 2016, less than 0.5% of export declarations were checked.   Customs checks mainly apply to imports.  In 2016, 6% of import declarations were checked and less than 2% were physically checked.  The vast majority of these checks were carried out in approved warehouses and other premises with a very small number at a port or airport.  The low level of import checks is the result of pre-authorisation of traders, advance lodgement of declarations and an extensive system of post-clearance checks, including customs audit, which are carried out at traders' premises.  Authorised economic operators, AEOs, have a special status in the system and under agreed protocols are allowed to operate greatly simplified customs procedures.  There are currently 133 AEOs, which account for 82% of all imports and 89% of exports.  It will be very important that the bulk of trade continues to be through AEOs after Brexit.</p><p> The new customs code opens the possibility for smaller traders to receive this authorisation and we expect the number of AEOs to rise sharply, perhaps by a factor of ten, with the addition of a wide range of traders, including smaller businesses.  The Union customs code envisages the development of paperless customs systems, managed entirely on the basis of electronic processing.  Revenue&rsquo;s objective is to facilitate trade by maximising the free flow of goods.  We are aiming to have the most advanced systems possible and we will continue to maximise the simplification provided for within the Union customs code.</p><p> It is clear that managing the volume of trade will be one of the biggest challenges post Brexit.  Approximately 1 million roll-on roll-off units arrive at our ports each year, over 90% of them from the United Kingdom.  Traffic with Northern Ireland is also significant, with approximately 1 million HGVs and 1.3 million LGVs moving in each direction annually.  We are looking at the latest technology to provide us with a system that can clear goods in seconds and facilitate their free flow.</p><p> Clearly, the operation of customs post Brexit and the resulting impact on business will be defined to a great extent by the terms of the Brexit agreement.  Apart from tariffs or other restrictions that may apply, the implementation of customs procedures alone will create an additional cost to Irish business, affecting some sectors more than others.  Revenue&rsquo;s challenge and focus is to minimise the cost and facilitate trade by providing efficient solutions, tailored to the needs of business sectors and by supporting business with clear and timely information, advice and guidance.</p><p> I will summarise for the committee what Revenue is doing in preparation for Brexit.  We are studying the implications and assessing the options provided for under the new Union customs code; we are identifying key issues to the Article 50 task force through the communication channels managed by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade; we are working on scaling up our customs IT infrastructure to ensure we can deal with the anticipated increase in customs declarations; and we have deployed additional staff to prepare for Brexit and will scale up this resource allocation as necessary.</p><p> To summarise what we are not doing, Revenue is not prejudging the outcome of the negotiations, which is a political matter, nor are we negotiating with HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, on post-Brexit arrangements, and we are not looking for sites for customs posts.  I will try to answer any questions members may wish to ask.</p></speech>

Citizens and businesses alike have forgotten about the constraints of tariffs and customs obligations between this country and the UK; indeed, many of our citizens have never known them.</p> <p>  There are two elements to a customs union &ndash; the removal of tariffs between countries, and the creation of a common external tariff.  Many of the potential difficulties we will encounter post Brexit relate to the latter, that is, to our obligations as one of the remaining 27 EU member states to police the EU customs union borders.</p> <p>  I regret to say we must now speak of these difficulties with growing certainty that they will emerge.  Perhaps the clearest indication amid all the uncertainty of Brexit is that the future relationship between the EU and the UK will involve the UK&rsquo;s departure from the customs union, provided there is no change in the UK Government after the election on 8 June.  Indeed, the ruling Conservative Party election manifesto signals an intention to engage with the World Trade Organization in fixing external tariffs post Brexit.</p> <p>  As an all-island of Ireland body, Chartered Accountants Ireland recently surveyed members in business, working both North and South of the Border, to gauge their readiness for the reintroduction of tariffs between Ireland and the UK.  The businesses we spoke to were concerned about the higher prices which the reintroduction of tariffs will entail.  By definition, tariffs are protectionist.  The whole idea of a customs union is to promote the commercial interests of Union members at the expense of those outside of it.</p> <p>  We also found that Irish business was concerned about other aspects of the reintroduction of tariffs, including the paperwork, payment and policing.  Businesses reported little clarity on how customs arrangements might operate following the termination of the Article 50 period.  Relatively few understood that the enforcement of border controls for the customs union, however implemented, needed to be separated from political promises of future trade agreements between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world.</p> <p>  Many businesses in Ireland lost or downgraded their customs expertise after 1992 on the introduction of the Single Market.  There were suggestions that delays in clearing customs could for practical purposes eliminate cross-Border trade between the North and the South.  Every effort should be made to sustain the advantages of a common transit area.  This would enable goods to be shipped from Ireland to mainland Europe via the UK without customs penalties.  I want to clarify that the focus of that particular study was on the movement of dutiable goods.  The implications of Border controls and road closures on people, as had been a feature of the Border for so many years of our history, were not considered in the context of that study.</p> <p>  Ireland will be obliged to put in place a customs system with the UK which will preserve the integrity of the customs union.  The creation of a system of customs paperwork, payment and policing that does the least harm to Irish business can be designed and implemented by the Revenue Commissioners, working in co-operation with the UK tax authority, HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, and operating with the approval of the EU institutions.</p> <p>  That is not a trivial task.  Commissioner Irwin, Mr. Cody's colleague, signalled to this committee only last week that the introduction of customs controls post Brexit would result in a tenfold increase in the volume of customs administration.  If the matter were one of a simple increase in volume, we could all cope.  The real challenge is to facilitate customs administration for the many businesses exclusively importing from or exporting to the UK, which have to deal with customs obligations for the first time.  For them, this is tantamount to the introduction of a new tax.  My organisation, Chartered Accountants Ireland, is willing to work with such businesses and with the Revenue authorities in meeting customs obligations.</p> <p>  To further complicate the matter, I do not need to remind members of this committee that Brexit is largely unprecedented.  Because the nature of the land border to be created for customs is virtually unique, Ireland will be under intense scrutiny from our EU partners to get our customs controls with the UK both watertight and legally valid.  Nor do we have much time.  It may be possible to establish transitional customs arrangements with the UK, but we believe transitional arrangements are unlikely in the absence of agreement on the stated EU priorities in the Brexit negotiations published earlier this week on areas such as citizens&rsquo; rights and existing EU budgetary commitments.  That is why the committee having this debate even before formal Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK commence is particularly timely and appropriate.  I look forward to participating in this morning&rsquo;s discussion with the Chairman and his colleagues.</p></speech>

I will base my input on the customs requirements and regulations which will impact on Ireland should the UK leave the customs union in 2019.  These comments are based on the provisions set out by the Union customs code, UCC, and delegated and implementing regulations, as amended.</p> <p>  The original customs code established the integration of customs procedures across member states of the European Union following the implementation of the Single Market.  The new Union customs code continues to solidify that, in that it lays out common risk criteria and standards which must be followed in order to facilitate legitimate trade and fight against fraud.</p> <p>  Paragraph 19 of the UCC establishes this quite clearly when it states that use of information and communication technologies should be accompanied by harmonised and standardised application of customs controls by the member states to ensure an equivalent level of customs control throughout the Union so as not to give rise to anti-competitive behaviour at the various Union entry and exit points.</p> <p>  Thus, the customs control of imports into and out of the EU is delegated to the customs authorities to ensure all controls at all borders are applied equally.  The UCC reinforces that by stating: "The completion of the internal market, the reduction of barriers to international trade and investment and the reinforced need to ensure security and safety at the external borders of the Union have transformed the role of customs authorities giving them a leading role within the supply chain and, in their monitoring and management of international trade, making them a catalyst to the competitiveness of countries and companies".  The reason I reference that is because the customs code legislation is directly applicable in Ireland as in all other member states and therefore the leeway for customs in implementing alternative rules to those set out by the UCC is limited.</p> <p>  The customs code requires, first, the implementation of the customs tariff.  This means that all goods being imported into or exported out of the EU are subject to the same duty rate and controls on import and export.  Second, it requires the identical application of customs trade legislation as set out by the UCC.  This means that when goods clear customs in any member state, they are able to move freely within the EU and are not subject to customs controls in other member states.</p> <p>  Once the UK leaves the EU customs union, for customs purposes they will be a non-EU or third country.  As a non-EU country operating outside the customs tariff and the Union customs code, it is therefore difficult to see how, at this point, the UK would not be subject to the same import and export controls as any other non-EU country.</p><p>This was reiterated last week by Mr. Michel Barnier when he stated:</p><blockquote>Because we are part of the EU, businesses can trade goods without customs duties and documentation requirements are very simple ... [But this is what a member state enjoys] and this is what a member state loses when it leaves the Union.</blockquote><p>Customs controls require the following process.  An import declaration must be lodged with customs for all imports into the EU and an export declaration for all exports out of the EU.  This declaration requires 54 boxes of information from details of the consignor to the consignee, the product details and tariff details, values, country of origin information, weights and packaging information and terms of trade.  In terms of lodging customs declarations, there are two options.  A company can employ a clearance agent to act as their representative or they can request authorisation to lodge these declarations themselves.  Most goods are cleared for import or export instantly, but about 8% will be subject to checks by customs.  This is required by harmonised risk management rules.  Importers and exporters can be subject to post-clearance audit checks by customs any time within the following three years.  When goods are imported, however, duty and import VAT is payable on arrival unless a deferred payment authorisation is agreed with customs.  This allows for payment of duty and import VAT to be deferred to the 15th of the month following entry.  This facility is, however, subject to a provision of a bank guarantee. <br/><br/>All of those conditions apply to trade with any non-EU country such as, for example, the US.  The implication of this for Irish industry is significant.  First, there will be a requirement to lodge customs declarations on all imports from and exports to the UK.  It is to be assumed the same requirement will be implemented in the UK.  There is a necessary cost for this, either in the payment of a clearance agent or the recruitment of staff in addition to logistics-related costs.  A reasonable estimate would be &euro;100 per movement.  Second, there is a significant learning curve to ensure declarations lodged with customs are correct to ensure compliance, minimise risk of delays and avoid additional charges.  This can be achieved, but will involve investing time and effort in upskilling.  At the same time, we do need to take on board that this is completely achievable and many Irish companies engage in this non-EU trade without difficulty every day.<br/><br/>Third, for the agrifood industry in particular, it is critical that delays at borders are minimised and every simplification allowed by the customs code is provided to Irish businesses to enable them to streamline their customs processes.  Fourth, there are cash flow considerations to build into any future business model.  Finally, depending on whether a free trade agreement is concluded, there may be customs tariffs.  These tariffs average at 5% but can range from 0% to 20% depending on the industry.  In addition, for companies trading in agricultural and food products, there are additional agricultural levies to consider.  In this context, it is critical that Irish businesses are educated to the duty savings opportunities provided for in the customs code, which will reduce duty costs on goods for import and re-export, for example.<br/><br/>In BDO, we have carried out an optimism index in which we found that Brexit is having an impact on business confidence, with first quarter projections at their weakest since 2013.  Of particular concern is that we found that only 4% of Irish companies have sought external advice and support on the implications of Brexit and just one in 20 firms have a plan in place to deal with a potential customs Border with the North following the Brexit vote.  We are therefore advising our clients that it is critical at this point to start the preparatory work in getting ready for Brexit.  This is to ensure that companies have the information available to complete declarations, have built in the additional costs and potential delays at border crossings and have accounted for the potential risk of tariffs.  In addition, a particular focus is on ensuring companies are established to move their goods as seamlessly as possible across the Northern Ireland Border.  Again, the only way to achieve this will be by preparing and developing their customs capabilities to ensure they can take advantage of any simplifications Revenue introduces, as well as ensuring they qualify for all duty-saving procedures provided for by customs. <br/><br/>It is clear from our work that Brexit presents challenges and opportunities for companies operating in Ireland.  Our key message is that planning is key in order that our clients continue to be able to access the lucrative UK market.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  I thank them for their presentations.  I will begin with Mr. Cody.  We had a discussion last week with Mr. Liam Irwin about potential customs posts and I put a question to him.  I am sure Mr. Cody has read the transcripts and followed the discussion and will be aware of some of the issues I raised.  I put in a freedom of information request to the Revenue.  It was an information request for records concerning the establishment of possible customs posts along the Border - not on the Border, but along the Border.  I was told that Revenue had 31 such documents.  Some of them were articles.  For example, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>had an article in which Ministers were quoted.  There are other documents that talked about potential posts along the Border.  The other documents are, for example, briefings on the matter to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach, PowerPoint presentations, briefing material, a note to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, a presentation on customs and internal discussion documents.  There are 31 documents in total, a handful of which are newspaper articles in the public domain.  Is there any valid reason these documents, which, as I said, must have some reference to establishing customs posts along the Border, are not being provided to the Oireachtas finance committee that is discussing this matter?</p></speech>

We are engaged in a process of studying what are the options and possibilities.  We started this back before the referendum vote.  If we went back nine months and the Deputy asked me what is going to happen, we would have looked at what the situation was pre-1992.  We would have said that the likelihood is that there would have to be customs posts, because it was at that point a very early stage of the deliberation.  The EU customs code was legally adopted last July.  There is to be four-year and five-year IT development across Europe.  There are simplifications contained in the EU customs code that allows us to do things radically differently.  However, if the Deputy asked us back then, we would not have had our preparatory work done.  The papers and the deliberation are not a final conclusion.  The Deputy is very aware that the problem with releasing a document that Revenue has looked at is that it can then turn into a headline stating that Revenue is planning for and opening customs posts.  Under FOI legislation, there is a reason documents are not produced and there is a reason there are exemptions.</p></speech>

I did not appeal it because I understand the rationale.  The point I am making is that this is a finance committee of the Oireachtas and we are dealing with this issue.  We are having our own deliberations and conducting our own scrutiny.  I put it to Mr. Cody that dozens of documents were produced, some at the end of October 2016 and some only a matter of weeks ago.  I cannot imagine that they were produced by low-ranking officials because they have been sent on as presentations to Government Departments and Ministers but Revenue is keeping this committee in the dark with regard to the nature of those documents.  We are having a discussion here without all of the required information because Revenue believes it could possibly be harmful for Members of the Oireachtas, who are scrutinising these issues, to have the full information.  Why is it that we, as Oireachtas Members, would not be provided with these presentations? </p></speech>

I can look at providing particular aspects of the papers.  The statistics are probably already in the public domain.  We can certainly put a package together for the committee but one of the challenges we face, which will continue over the next number of years, is that we do not know the nature of the final agreement between the European Commission, the EU and the UK.  We are trying to influence that process.  We are trying to support the Departments of An Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Finance with our analysis of some aspects but this will ultimately have to be agreed with the European Commission and it would not be helpful to lay it bare at this stage.  There are certain issues that are particularly difficult.  If one were to ask the European Commission's tax and customs authorities about what the scale of the simplification could be - at the right time, with suitable clarity - one may get the answer that one wants.  However, if one asks a question baldly like "what is the treatment?", one may be told nothing.  One can get cornered.  I assure the Deputy that our efforts are aimed at ensuring that the free flow of trade on this island and support for Irish businesses in carrying on their activities is continued.</p> <p>  We have a track record of delivering.  We have to analyse what is possible and then we have to look at innovative IT solutions.  We are not second in terms of the ease of our customs procedures in the EU by accident.  That required a lot of work.  If we started some of that process before we had it fully worked out, that would be problematic.  The difficulty with these types of arrangements is that they are ultimately within a goldfish bowl.  They are very visible and sometimes we need the freedom to do the preparatory work until we have conclusions.  We have no problem with coming before this committee at any time to talk about these matters when we have fully worked out our position.  </p> <p>  Two of the presentations-----</p></speech>

This committee is very conscious of the fact that this is contingency planning and if Revenue was not engaged in such planning, I would be the first to criticise it.  I have huge regard for the office of the Revenue Commissioners and how it has operated over a substantial period of time.  We heard last week from Mr. Irwin about trade facilitation or customs posts.  In his opening statement today, Mr. Cody said that 6% of import declarations were checked and less than 2% were physically checked in 2016.  These checks were carried out in approved warehouses, ports or airports.  Obviously, in the context of Brexit, on the island of Ireland there are many routes for import and export.  We have had a discussion about the Border, and I am not going to split hairs about whether we are talking about "on" the Border or 15 km away from the Border.  If we have to conduct the checks, as was suggested by Ms Lynch, where will they take place?  I am trying to think about this from the perspective of my own county of Donegal, for example.  There are numerous Border crossings in Donegal.  Does the contingency planning provide that there would be one warehouse per county or three warehouses, for example?  If people are being diverted to warehouses, that could be a huge imposition.  If I am crossing the Border at Derry as opposed to Pettigo, for example, and have to travel 30 km to the Donegal warehouse because I am part of the 2% or 6% that is being checked, I could lose one or two hours in terms of transit time and there would be additional fuel costs too.  What are we thinking about here?  Are we thinking about multiple warehouses in each county along the Border or is it one facility per county?</p></speech>

If the Deputy had asked me that question nine months ago, I probably would have visualised a map with the necessities because this is how it worked prior to the Single Market.  Now, however, the way the customs code works is that it provides for simplified procedures, authorised economic operators and the checking is done for goods at the destination point.  It is not brought somewhere to have the check carried out.  When we talk about approved warehouses, we are talking about logistics operations that support the transport of the goods.  The goods go to their destination and we can facilitate that if it is an approved warehouse, by having a Revenue presence to carry out the physical examination of the goods.</p></speech>

That is why we want to facilitate smaller entities in getting authorised status.  If an entity has authorised status, the likelihood is that it is not going to be selected because it has an ongoing relationship with Revenue.  If the Deputy was the exporter from Derry and I was the importer and we were authorised, we would have an ongoing relationship with Revenue in which we would carry out post-clearance checks and Revenue would be very unlikely to select those consignments for goods checking.</p> <p>  In terms of the 6% for document checking, as Ms Lynch has pointed out, the entry would be entered and then it would be selected for a document check.  The importer would be required to provide the supporting documentation, the invoice, bill of lading, licence and so forth.  One of the things we are really interested in exploring is how we can move documentation checking to a digital platform.  Prior to 1992 when we dealt with cross-Border customs we had the Automated Entry Processing, AEP, system, which was an advanced electronic system.  Now we routinely get records and invoices from businesses for VAT, audit and checking submitted online through our Revenue systems.  What we are interested in doing now is exploring the idea that we could upload the documentation check.</p><p>In terms of the sophistication that we want to achieve, we want to remove the requirement for a business to divert.  There are 13 main routes across the Border, as the Deputy knows better than I.  Very soon after we began considering this issue nine months ago, we concluded that the diversion and impact of having to call to a designated Revenue customs post does not make sense and the volumes would not justify it.  Therefore, alternative solutions are needed.  The authorised economic operators that------</p></speech>

One week ago, not nine months ago, a Revenue official gave evidence to this committee regarding trade facilitation posts which would be between 10 km and 15 km from the Border to which 6% of haulage would or could be diverted.  There would be documentation checks and also possible physical checks, along with possible random patrols along the Border to divert people to these posts.  That evidence was given a week ago.  Has the thinking of the Revenue dramatically changed in the past seven days in this regard or are these type of facilities still being considered in terms of contingency planning?</p></speech>

Commissioner Irwin was discussing one of the contingency possibilities but as we look at the issues and the discussion surrounding the issues, the likelihood is that there will not be any additional customs posts.  However, there are  a range of Revenue offices in which production of any documentation can be completed.  There are such offices in Louth, Monaghan and Donegal.  Because not everybody will be able to upload online, there will be a facility whereby a trader can produce the required documents.  One challenge we face is to ensure that one is told early in one's travel of the requirement to produce those documents.  The earlier they are presented, the earlier one can be told that Revenue may need to examine it.  There are Revenue offices across the country and the facility to produce documentation at one's nearest office.</p></speech>

Currently, 2% of goods are selected for physical checks.  There is a series of rules and risk indicators involved in being selected.  As our two colleagues mentioned, many of these rules concern protecting the customs union and the Single Market.  Some of them concern perceived dumping by other countries.  Certain indicators are looked for.  From a customs point of view, it is very unlikely that there will be anything approaching 2% referral for physical goods in regard to the type of goods that move between the North and the South.  We have considered the analysis of the figures.  Much of what is transported in both directions is construction material.  There is also agrifood produce.  Something that will distort the EU market will not be sourced from Northern Ireland into the South.  I saw on the six o'clock news that RTE reported from the border between Norway and Sweden, which has very sophisticated bays for HGVs to pull into on both sides of the border.  I do not see that being the case here.  The discussion at the previous committee meeting on this issue prompted us to think further about it.  We did not change anything because of the discussion.  However, having thought about it and begun to analyse the numbers, I am almost 100% certain that we will not be providing new trade facilitation bays in whatever part of Donegal, Monaghan or Cavan.</p></speech>

Ms Lynch took us through the practicalities in terms of customs controls and laid out six different steps involved.  She said that a reasonable estimate of the cost involved is &euro;100 per movement.  Is that the cost to the business or to the State and the Revenue?</p></speech>

It involves payment of a clearance agent to lodge the documentation and potential additional transport costs such as additional fuel and potential drivers.  Businesses can lodge the import and export declaration themselves but most Irish companies pay a clearance agent to do so.</p></speech>

In his presentation, Mr. Cody set out some statistics in regard to the volume of trade.  Cross-Border traffic comprises approximately 1 million HGVs and 1.3 million LGVs, giving a total of 2.3 million movements.  If &euro;100 were paid for each of those movements, there would be additional costs of &euro;230 million in respect of cross-Border trade movements.  In terms of imports, Mr. Cody said that approximately 1 million roll-on roll-off units, 90% of which come from the UK, arrive at our ports each year.  There would be an additional &euro;90 million cost for imports in regard to the &euro;100 average payment.  There is presumably a higher volume of roll-on roll-off exports to the UK as Ireland has a trade surplus with the UK.  I do not know if specific data is available but presumably the additional costs for exports is higher.  In total, there are several hundred million euro of additional costs which will be imposed on businesses as a result of compliance.  Is that completely separate to the issue of tariffs?</p></speech>

One hopes that everything is processed in a straightforward manner but there could be documentary checks.  The cost may vary depending on the level of trade one is carrying out.  A business may be able to negotiate a better rate with an agent if it has a high volume of imports or exports, whereas agents may charge more to deal with a one-off, high-value item.  A sum of &euro;50 is a reasonable average per declaration.</p></speech>

Low-value, small transactions make up a lot of the volume.  Post-Brexit, much of the challenge will lie with these small e-commerce and low-value transactions which will be handled by the major express carriers.  It is not as straightforward as multiplying the number by 50 or 100.  Many of them are totally different cost factors.</p></speech>

However, we also have to consider who is actually going to carry them.  The vast majority of customs transactions, by definition, are handled by multinationals exporting to or importing from outside the European Union.  The &euro;400 million back-of-an-envelope calculation we have just made will impact on the smaller industries that are currently only dealing with EU and UK customers.  They are the clients Enterprise Ireland is trying to support, for example.  It is not just a question of the quantum of the client's costs but also of where they are going to land.</p></speech>

As my colleagues said, the value of the trade crossing the Border is not necessarily multiplied upwards.  It really depends on the number of containers and whether it is groupage, whether there is one container per invoice or whether one container contains deliveries for several customers.  We need to drill down into the figures to get a more accurate picture.</p></speech>

Ms Lynch touched on the matter in her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carol Lynch" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017052500002#G00900"><p>If there is no deal, we are talking about the United Kingdom trading with the European Union in the way any third country would.  It would be equivalent to importing from the United States, Brazil or Russia.  Customs tariffs will kick in and be comparable to the standard duty rates that apply to any most favoured nation, MFN, country.  For a lot of products, the rate would be 0%, for example, for IT and pharmaceutical products.  An average rate of between 3% and 5% would probably apply to most general manufactured goods.  In the agrifood sector, however, there are not only tariff rates but also agricultural rates.  Therefore, the tariff duty rate could be 18% or 20%, but that figure could be doubled, with the addition of a levy, which is normally applied on a per tonne basis, on beef or milk products, for example.  It is very hard to take the euro amount per tonne and turn it into a tariff rate, but a reasonable estimate would be a figure of 30% or 40% by the time all of the charges are added.</p></speech>

What practical steps does Mr. Keegan think firms need to take to start preparing properly and inform themselves fully of what the obligations are likely to be?  How can the State help in that regard?</p></speech>

On paperwork, they need to develop an appreciation of what they are actually trading in, with whom they are trading and the tariffs that are likely to apply.  They need to develop expertise in how to complete the single administrative documents and deal with the various checks and requirements.  They all acknowledge that a lot of their raw materials and exports will be more expensive for the end customer.  However, they are equally concerned about the cash flow implications in meeting the customs and VAT costs on their imports.  The State needs to help by clarifying for them as fast as possible the most likely shape of future customs requirements for businesses.  We also need to identify ways by which we can mitigate the cash flow implications for them.  There is not an awful lot that can be done about customs charges.  Given that it took the European Union eight years to come up with a set of tariffs in the first place, it seems clear that they are not going to disappear or be modified overnight.  There might be something that we can broker with the European Union at nation level on value added tax in order that the immediate, upfront hit on VAT would be less onerous.  These are two practical suggestions.</p></speech>

It would be wrong to think anybody underplays the cost of administration on business and we will be working hard to minimise it.  We will also be examining simplifications to reduce it.  What I am highlighting is the level of duty collected to give a sense of how much is involved on a significant level of imports.  If Mr. Keegan takes that to mean that I believe customs duty is an insignificant cost on business, I can assure him and the committee that Revenue does not see this as an insignificant issue.</p></speech>

However, we need to look at the matter in the context of the ongoing political discussions which are an iterative process, notwithstanding the rhetoric and the fact that there is a general election under way in the United Kingdom.  This is a very useful exercise for us, particularly in gleaning the level of readiness of individual businesses or sectors for Brexit.  Following on from the submissions made by Mr. Keegan and Ms Lynch, it appears that the level of readiness is poor.  Ms Lynch has said 4% of Irish companies have sought external advice and support in meeting the implications of Brexit and that only one in 20 firms has a plan in place to deal with a potential customs border with the North following Brexit.  Is it possible for businesses to do more?  We do not yet know what the final outcome of the political negotiations will be and so there are all sorts of scenario in that regard.  For example, there could be a hard Brexit, for which every business has to prepare, but we could also have a political solution, comprising outcomes of a lesser degree, including European economic area status and so on.  I am trying to get a sense of what businesses need to do to be more ready.  Is there more State organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Departments, local enterprise offices, LEOs, could do?  In other words, is there more that needs to be done from the State's point of view to assist businesses to be ready for what is inevitable?</p></speech>

My response always is that there is an awful lot they could do right now.  We are 80% sure what the final outcome will be, including that the United Kingdom will not be part of the customs union.  Once it withdraws from it, there will be a domino effect.  There will be a requirement to make import and export declarations.  That is inevitable.  To complete the information required, one will need to know the tariff classifications and be able to determine values, the consignee, the consigner and income terms.  Taking the very basic building blocks of tariff classifications which lead to duty rates - even if there is no duty rate - there will still be a need to define the tariff classifications for the purposes of customs security.  That in itself will take an awful lot of work.  For example, a company with 6,000 part numbers will need to put in a place a mechanism to determine their classifications.  Providing that information will be a requirement that will not change.  Therefore, people will need to prepare for this in the next two years.</p> <p>  We also know that there will be a requirement to make a customs declaration on imports to and exports from Ireland to the United Kingdom.  Therefore, companies will need to review their supply chains.  A lot of companies, particularly Irish companies, were set up to trade in the Single Market; therefore, they are used to selling and buying in it.  They were not set up with a model that involved trading outside the Single Market.  It will be a huge learning curvem but two years will give them plenty of time.  There is a significant amount of time remaining before anything will kick in, but if companies leave that work until the last six months, they will be under pressure.  As I said, when asked by companies what they should do, given that we do not yet know what the final outcome will be, my response is always that we are 80% sure what the end result will be.  The only thing we really do not know is whether there will be tariffs, but that issue can be dealt with near the end of the process.  Every other piece of work has to be done now.</p></speech>

As mentioned by Mr. Keegan, it is important, when examining the implications of Brexit, that we look at the sectors involved.  For example, for electronics companies, particularly the large international electronics companies, adding the United Kingdom to the model of international trading will be painful, but it is only a matter of moving them from one box to another.</p><p>They are already doing much work in that area in any event.  However, this could be completely new for agrifood companies, particularly companies that trade with the UK or Northern Ireland.  They would need much more training than someone who is already familiar with the business.  One needs to drill down on a sector-specific basis.  In addition, many supports are available, including the Enterprise Ireland Brexit readiness programme, the local enterprise offices, the chambers of commence, the Irish Exporters Association, Chartered Accountants Ireland and Revenue.  A huge amount of support is available.  The real message that it is important to get across is that businesses need to start preparing now.  We know a lot already, and this is the critical point.  Businesses should not leave preparation until later.  They should take advantage of all the information and support available.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody referred to the postman coming to the door.  Again, are we talking in theoretical terms pending the outcome of a final political negotiation?  Until that is determined, the position is effectively the <i>status quo</i>.  I will put it another way.  Reading between the lines of the Revenue Commissioners' submission, I believe it provides us with some sort of framework of understanding regarding the challenges that present themselves.  However, the Revenue Commissioners' planning, as Mr. Cody said, &quot;is based on the full range of possibilities, including the possibility that customs controls or processes will apply between Ireland and the UK&quot;.  Has Mr. Cody given us an insight into the full range of possibilities right down to the individual consumer?  Are the Revenue Commissioners scenario-planning for the individual consumer, to go back to the postman knocking at the door, right up to the multinational company?  That is what we want to get a sense of from today's engagement.</p></speech>

The possibilities range from this to the UK having the status of a full third country outside the Single Market and customs union - presumably, if this is by agreement after a transitional arrangement.  No sensible agreement would not involve some nature of transitional arrangement for something that will happen in April 2019 or whenever.  Systems would not be in place.  Considering the systems we will have to implement, the UK will be leaving the Union so it will have to have a full framework in place.  If there is to be some form of agreement - and, presumably, there will be - the likelihood is that there will be transitional arrangements.  Any transitional arrangement can vary by sector.</p></speech>

It is pointless to speculate as to how many elements of any transitional arrangements there will be.  When I talk about the impact on e-commerce, I do so on the basis of the end of a transitional arrangement, when the UK will be outside the Union and will be a third country.  If an Irish shopper then buys online from a UK-based business, it will be exactly the same as if he or she were buying from a US-based business.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody says there will have to be an increase in the number of AEOs.  Would I be subject to this?  More and more business is moving online now.  Perhaps I am misunderstanding the nature of AEOs.</p></speech>

It is a little like Ms Lynch said.  One must decide the best way of doing it.  The express carriers are a large part of the process regarding how citizens are shopping online.  E-commerce covers business to business, business to consumer, etc.  There are many aspects to it.  Regarding that basic model of the individual shopping online for clothes or whatever else, the volume of goods going through the postal and parcel post system will multiply because, obviously, much of this is sourced through England.  What may well happen also is that businesses will set up their distribution hubs elsewhere.  Currently, much of this is sourced through, say, Birmingham or wherever else.  Some of those businesses will consider how trade is done with EU citizens.  That hub could be in Cork.</p></speech>

Since the outcome of the referendum, the direction of Brexit has almost been a slow bicycle race.  After the referendum outcome, suddenly nothing really happened until the start of February, when the UK said what Brexit means is that it will leave the customs union.  Then we had the formal notification on 29 March.  Every time there is such a milestone, I think businesses become more aware.  One of the most promising things the EU has done in how it is setting out its stall is committing to transparency in the negotiations.  That transparency will, in its own right, help develop public awareness.</p> <p>  To make a very general point, customs unions are not unique to this part of the world.  The Southern African Customs Union has been in existence since 1910.  The whole purpose of a customs union is to make life difficult for people not in it.  No matter what we say, what Revenue can do and what initiatives businesses or any of us can put in place to try to minimise the downside, there must, by definition, be a downside.  I think this realisation is growing.  The committee's work this morning is making a contribution to that.  It is up to all of us to try to keep repeating this message, although not as something to be necessarily afraid of.  Opportunities exist but, ultimately, Brexit is a problem and we need to tackle it as a problem.</p></speech>

This is a little like peeling an onion: we get layer upon layer all the time, but each day it is more informative as things come to mind.  I am particularly interested in the transitional arrangements and in why Revenue is not talking directly to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK.  I ask the witnesses to clarify whether there is a legal impediment to discussions even about a transitional arrangement or the type of scenarios the UK is considering as well.</p></speech>

I was asked today about negotiations with HMRC in the context of our annual report and I said that we have an excellent relationship with HMRC and are in constant dialogue about practical issues that will arise.  That was turned into "we are negotiating with HMRC".  My colleagues and I meet to discuss customs issues, VAT issues and anti-smuggling issues, and this will continue.  However, to sit down and ask whether we will have a transitional arrangement to scope out how transit will work does not make any sense until we understand whether the UK will be part of the common transit area.  That is the context.  I meet my counterpart in HMRC and we talk about some of the challenges we face.  We face common challenges in this area.  In some ways, as I said earlier, they face more significant challenges in that they will have to provide a legislative framework for what is agreed.  Sitting down with HMRC and suggesting trying to work this out before we know what the UK's arrangement will be would not add anything.</p><p>What we will do is continue engaging with all our counterparts, as we have done.

Senator Rose Conway-Walsh's observations are particularly pertinent because one of the competencies of the European Union is to set the rates for tariffs.  When it comes to policing, however, the individual revenue authorities are left with colossal scope to determine how best to do so.  We would think the future relationship between HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs and my colleagues here will be critical in managing that process.  The UK authorities will have to deal with 27 EU member states.  We will principally have to deal with a new relationship with one of them.  We probably need to get in as early as we can.</p> <p>  It is very bad news for the clothes shop in Belfast.  Perhaps, however, it is better news for the shop in Dublin, where shoppers might ultimately buy the dress.

Potentially, the UK rules will not be the same.  The United Kingdom could set its own threshold, or whatever figure it liked, and it may decide to have no threshold.  In my discussion with Deputy Pearse Doherty,  I said that if we ask about the nature of the particular rule, a revenue authority or a commission authority will say, "These are the rules".  As Mr. Keegan says, our challenge concerns how we implement the rules, how we follow a risk-based approach and how we deploy our scarce resources to tackle serious tax and customs evasion.  With regard to the liability on a dress, by comparison with 40,000 litres of laundered fuel, I would imagine that our mobile team in the Border area will probably have a different focus.</p></speech>

I just want to present the argument.  I do not believe people have fully thought through what exactly this will mean.</p> <p>  I want to get back to the question of special status for the North in the European Union.  Does Mr. Keegan's organisation advocate special status for the North within the European Union?  How much work is it doing to promote that?  It would seem to be the solution to many of our problems, including problems we have discussed today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Keegan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017052500002#K02500"><p>We have been in existence for over 125 years.  We have 4,000 members in Northern Ireland.  We are an all-island body and very proud of it.  We have to respect very much the democratic overall decision, however much we might wish for it to be otherwise, including in commercial terms.  Also, as a representative body, we have to look at the hand we are dealt in terms of how we can deal with the legislation as presented.</p> <p>  Since the focus of today's meeting is on customs, may I make an observation thereon?  We have been working with a common customs system with our EU neighbours for many years.  It evolved over many years.  Our neighbours will not let the Republic of Ireland walk away from commitments under the EU treaties to police that system.  Therefore, the reality is that if there were a two-year timeframe, no matter what we might want the United Kingdom to do in terms of customs, it simply would not have time to rewrite a customs system that would suit an all-island approach.  Aside altogether from anything else, it is simply not possible.  Furthermore, we would have a severe concern that, with the event of Brexit, the remaining 26 EU member states would be looking at us like hawks and saying that since Ireland is still in their club and has the land border with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it has an obligation to the them to police it.  What we can practically and pragmatically campaign for is very little other than making Governments, politicians and the various regulatory authorities aware of the concerns of business and what can be done to mitigate them.  That is what we are trying to do in the context of-----</p></speech>

Much more robust negotiations, not only by the Government but also by organisations, including that of Mr. Keegan, are needed to try to influence the policy at this stage.   Chartered Accountants Ireland should not just be an administrative body trying to keep everybody happy.  We are not going to keep everybody happy.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any other trade association that has done so much to try to raise awareness of the practical issues faced by businesses trading north and south of the Border, or businesses that effectively use the United Kingdom as a land bridge into Europe using the common transit area.</p><p>They are going to be severely prejudiced as Mr. Cody said earlier.  A great deal of the exports from Northern Ireland to the UK actually come across the Border and go out through Dublin Port or Rosslare.</p></speech>

The most high profile business sector where we have concerns and which we have highlighted in our representations is the agrifood sector.  There are undeniable advantages for everybody associated with that sector in having an all-island approach.  It strikes me that even though it is not particularly a customs related issue that tourism, where there is already an all-island approach, would also experience undeniable advantages in that case.  Nothing can be done unless we bring into the public arena these kinds of issues and concerns.</p> <p>  With respect to everyone concerned, we talk about the European Union and the UK leaving the Single Market and the four freedoms of movement of goods, people, capital and services.  A great deal of the focus has been on the movement of people and a great deal of discussion of borders has been in that context.  However, the discussion in relation to goods is relatively recent.  We still need to scope out what the issues are.  In terms of an all-island approach, if it is possible within the constraints of a timeframe of less than two years and within the constraints of EU law to make arguments and representations, we will do that and are trying to do so now.  The documents we have sent to Members of the Oireachtas have also gone to our MEPs, the European Commission and HM Revenue and Customs.</p></speech>

I also have major concerns around the smaller businesses, in particular those in rural Ireland where we do not have broadband or a very <i>ad hoc</i>broadband system.  There must be real discussions between Revenue and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as to how these companies can make online declarations and what technological advances need to be made in that regard.  Were it to happen tomorrow, a huge number of rural businesses would be put out of business overnight if they were forced to rely on the current technology.  Should smaller companies be applying at this point for AEOs and is there a cost involved in that?</p></speech>

They should be looking at what features will be impacted by customs if they are trading with the UK and conducting an analysis of that.  By their very nature, small companies will have limited engagement with customs but they will probably have one or two customers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and it is about an analysis of what to do there.  In the overall context of supporting business, we have a very strong record of providing as much information and simplification for businesses as possible.  We are engaged with the customs consultative committee which has representatives of various trade groups involved in export-import-export.  We have now broadened the membership because there will be people who will be engaged in import-export but would not have seen that.  We attend seminars also.  Our challenge in attending seminars right now is that everyone wants to know what will happen when that is, ultimately, a political negotiation.  There is certain work that people can do, however.</p> <p>  Broadband is an absolute challenge for parts of rural Ireland and we are already engaged in a whole lot of online work.  Our system is online as much as possible and we are very hopeful that various developments in the broadband strategy will keep helping to get there.</p> <p>  There are opportunities.  The way customs works is that it is primarily carried out by agents at the lower level while the bigger companies have in-house staff.  That model is likely to continue and there are probably opportunities for various people in that area.  There are opportunities for the simplification process and that agents will step up to the mark on some of that where they are dealing with smaller traders.  We will see different pricing models because what will be required of agents will be different when we fully exploit the UCC.</p></speech>

It is the first occasion.  I thank the witnesses for the three presentations.  Coming from a Border county, I note that the movement of trade has the potential to change the dynamics not just across the country but in the Border area.  I am certainly concerned about how any restriction or slowing down of movement would impact on an all-island basis in particular in relation to the peace process.  I will be speaking once and asking a series of questions if that is all right.</p> <p>   It was stated that the Revenue was not looking at any additional sites for customs posts.  Obviously, the Revenue still has quite a number of properties along the Border in its ownership.  I refer to Carrickcarnon and I am sure there are many other places.  Does the Revenue intend to use those sites as part of whatever scenario it is looking at?  I respect the fact that we are in a vacuum and that there is a certain uncertainty.  I hope the witnesses will not mind me using the pun that we do not have much to declare currently because we are all in that vacuum as to what the solution will be.  We spoke to senior officials at European level about Brexit and they were quite sceptical of an IT solution.  Can the witnesses comment on that and whether the IT solution referred to as being innovative could work?  The word "smuggling" was mentioned once and I mention it a second time.  In its most recent report, Grant Thornton indicated clearly that of the order of &euro;4.23 million was lost to the Exchequer annually.  Will that increase on the basis of whatever arrangements are put in place?</p> <p>  I have not once but twice in recent times witnessed garda&iacute;, Revenue officials and other arms of the State diverting traffic on the M1 motorway.  What is that intended to achieve and is it envisaged that type of thing will continue?  There are 38 Border crossings in Louth and I understand that nationally there are of the order of 400.  Ireland, as a non-contentious border country, probably has more crossings than there are on the eastern border of Europe.  How movement can be controlled is a mystery to me.  The issue of food integrity was mentioned.  Surely, customs will not be able to control it if there is a British policy of cheap food.  I am long enough around the Border to know and perhaps the Revenue should consult more of us there about the potential for disaster, in particular in relation to the movement of livestock and food integrity.  All it will take is one piece of steak sold outside the customs union in Newry to end up in Dundalk for us to have a major problem.  Can the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017052500002#L00900"><p>I was not trying to hide anything when I said we were not looking for sites.  It was not in the sense that we had plenty of them but rather that we are not looking at that traditional type of customs post.  On the scepticism around IT solutions, one always has to be careful about who one is listening to and what the various vested interests and approaches are.</p><p>As I stated in my opening remarks, the European Commission has competence in regard to customs policy but each administration and country has the responsibility to implement customs control.  We are subject to a comprehensive audit programme by EU audit every year, and there is the potential to challenge us if we are not doing things properly.  One never gets a clean bill of health from any auditor.  We generally have an agreed process of changing and addressing concerns.  There is the idea of an IT solution.  The EU policy is to go to an IT-based customs process that is totally paperless.  The Vice President of the European Commission gave a speech at the European Parliament last week about evaluating customs performance and management as a tool to facilitate trade and fight illicit trade.  A key issue is the integration of IT systems, and that is what the development is about.</p><p> Members may wonder why I have not spoken about smuggling.  In setting any tax or customs system, one must provide the framework for the legitimate business that wants to apply.  That is the first thing and it must be in place; it must be as easy to comply with as possible, having regard to the rules.  We must also tackle the people who do not abide by the rules, and we have ongoing arrangements and relationships with other agencies in the field.  We have gone through a process in the past five or seven years relating to fuel fraud, smuggling and laundering.  I do not need to tell members about some of what goes on.  The Grant Thornton report on smuggling had figures that are not compelling as they overstate the position.  That is not to say there is no smuggling, and we are very familiar with it.  We deal with it week in and week out, and that is why, on occasion, there will be patrols and joint operations to deal with smuggling.  There are all sorts of other matters in that area that we will have to deal with.</p><p> Food integrity is clearly a major challenge, and the agrifood sector will need careful handling.  It is primarily one of the areas that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will lead on.  There is an integrated nature to the supply chain of the agrifood sector, which is probably the biggest sectoral challenge.  It is interesting in the context of the task force as this issue is primarily driven by environmental health, so DG SANTE leads in that regard, and we are kind of subcontractors after the event.  Nobody underestimates the challenge that Brexit brings but we will be starting from a position of an equivalence of standards.  As Mr. Keegan argues, when somebody leaves the club, equivalence changes over time.  That is an asset challenge but we will be a support to agriculture in that area.</p></speech>

Much has been said about the all-Ireland approach and the witnesses stated earlier that the UK would have a customs operations with many different countries, with 27 operations for the 27 EU countries.  Northern Ireland would be the same as the rest of the UK in that it would have 27 different operations as well.  Some goods could come directly from those 27 countries into Northern Ireland.  If there is to be an all-Ireland approach, does it not mean the EU regulations would be operated in Northern Ireland?  Would that be the case?</p></speech>

That would become part of the input into the political dimension.  All we can do is provide the technical analysis of what is the law and the Union customs code.  If there are to be arrangements ultimately agreed, we will then respond to that and try to make them work.  I know what the Senator is asking but the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to have a view on something like that.  I might have a personal view.</p></speech>

The Government, and specifically the Taoiseach in the keynote speech at the Mansion House, stated that ultimately this is a political process and a political problem that will be solved by politics.  It is not primarily a technical or legal matter.  That was his statement.  We are a technical operation that looks at legislation and implements it.  We do not determine the policy.  If there is to be an arrangement reached on aspects. it will be a matter for those negotiations.</p></speech>

The authorised economic operators were mentioned but does the witness see a role for those with online trading?  In New York, for example, lunches are being delivered by drones and I can envisage a problem with drones being used to facilitate the delivery of goods from across the Border to be dropped in a front garden.  If people are able to deliver lunch in New York by drone, I am sure they can deliver little parcels around Ireland as well.</p></speech>

We could have a discussion about how safe a drone would be but if something is delivered by courier or drone, it will not change the nature of the beast.  We can consider the challenges of e-commerce, which are ultimately businesses that keep records and pay taxes and duties in the appropriate countries.</p><p>There are challenges regarding how software moves around but physical goods are delivered and they go through a process, whether it is through the post office or couriers.  If, ultimately, drones are flying around dropping the Senator's lunch in Mayo, they will not be the problem.</p></speech>

When we talk about approved warehouses, that is that approved warehouse concept.  The rules, guarantees and controls are all laid out in law.  In a way the excise duty bonded warehouses are still a big feature of the way alcohol and cigarettes are dealt with here.  Customs bonded does not have such a high profile because of the Single Market but that will be back.</p></speech>

There is Brexit-related work in other divisions but there is no Brexit unit in VAT, for example, because the customs team will be to the forefront and the changes that will happen will be driven first on the customs front.  As the Chairman implies, if a percentage of staff go to meetings or talk to Mr. Colgan's team, they will not go to meetings about something else.  There are probably another ten or 11 equivalents around the organisation feeding into this.</p></speech>

We were trying to work out the transport costs to the exporting company.  Earlier, when we were trying to extrapolate the figures, the estimated cost ranged from &euro;320 million to &euro;500 million.  The cost to business will be significantly more regardless of what happens.  Companies will have to budget for the significant cost of the preparation of documentation - whether in hard copy or electronic form - to export or import goods.  That cost must be borne by individual companies.  Costs will shoot up.  Do the witnesses accept that a figure ranging from &euro;320 million to &euro;500 million is a guesstimate and that the cost could turn out to be significantly higher and that it will depend on whether the outcome of the political discussions is a common travel area or a more awkward arrangement?</p></speech>

One must look at a company's traffic of goods.  If I move, for example, ten shipments of goods across a border in a day, one is talking about costs of &euro;500 for each leg of the journey.  If I am transiting to France, however, then I am making a transit arrangement and have met my documentation requirement in Ireland but I will transit the goods right through to France.  So there will only be set of costs.  In terms of identifying the costs, one must look at the company's supply chain and how many times it will be obliged to cross a border in free circulation and trigger a customs' requirement, whether it will transit its goods or whether it is moving those goods to sell them into the UK or from the UK to Ireland.  It is going to vary widely and that is the reason companies need to look at their supply chains in order to be able to determine what will be the potential costs.  One can assume there will be additional costs, because that will be inevitable.  There will be an additional cost for compliance.</p></speech>

His or her job will be to pick up a load in Kilkenny and complement that load.  As a result of the fact that he or she is a groupage operator, he or she will heads towards the Border area and try to fill the container so that he or she has a full load of 50 different consignments.  The driver has to have the paperwork for those 50 consignments.  The burden of the paperwork trail rests with each of the companies from which the driver picked up a consignment.  The driver has the burden of ensuring that he will be able to get through customs and has all the correct documentation.  Otherwise, the logistics operator or the haulier will incur further costs.</p></speech>

Each of the companies involved will either a clearance agent and the latter will lodge the declaration in advance and will already know whether the goods have been given green, orange or red status.

For example, a large haulage company or freight forwarder will try to get all the AEO products into one container so that it will have AEO status.  That is the benefit of being an AEO trader.</p></speech>

He or she will have to have a number of different consignments and should one of them cause a problem at customs level, the other exporters who have their consignments on his or her truck will suffer a delay in terms of their being delivered to the United Kingdom or France in a timely manner.  There is a possibility of losing business when goods are not delivered on time.  These are the businesses that are least prepared for Brexit.</p></speech>

If one is looking for customs expertise at present, there are few customs agents relative to the number of exporters here.  Much of the expertise migrated and ended up in places such as Rotterdam, where there is significant customs issues beyond the European Union.  The level of expertise resident in this country to deal with the vast number of queries that will arise will be an issue.</p></speech>

Revenue has an awareness of the issues.  I think today's process is absolutely essential because, as I said earlier, this must be an open discussion.  It is not the type of technical discussion that should be happening in meeting rooms.  Businesses need to become more aware so that they can relay questions to bodies such as ours in order that we might obtain answers for them..</p></speech>

What we do need to happen - it is beginning to happen because we are getting queries almost every day - is for businesses to begin to wake up to the kind of issues that have been ventilated in this room for the past two hours.  We will play our part in relaying those queries to Revenue.  It certainly would be helpful if, at an early stage, more formal channels of communications could be opened up.  In that context, we spoke about agribusiness earlier and it would be of assistance if such channels could be opened up with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a form for referring these issues, as they arise, to Departments, Government agencies and the political system in order to identify how we might work through them.</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are engaged very much in discussions with the different sectors.  There has been significant involvement across the board.</p><p>The challenge is that we are discussing a lot of items on which we do not know the final result.  Going back to the grouping example, if one will be collecting from Kilkenny, Dublin and Dundalk to bring goods via the land bridge to France and one will not be letting anything out in the UK, one will be travelling under the transit arrangement and it will be the exact same as if one is supplying under the Single Market.  The complicating factor is that right now one would do that and one would not have to consider transit because one would be merely driving across, via ferry, across the land bridge and out the other side.  That is why the transit arrangements are important.  A matter we are discussing with our colleagues in the other member states is to be clear that Irish goods that go over the land bridge are EU goods and are in free circulation.  It is important when they end up in the French, Belgian or Dutch ports that they are received as Irish goods and there is no customs procedure.  That is one of the big challenges.</p></speech>

Their risk, if one goes back to the discussion earlier around smuggling, will be whether goods get diverted onto the UK market and that will be their challenge.</p></speech>

If one is using Amazon UK or something else to buy parts, that will affect them on cost.  First, there will be a time factor.  They will have to order earlier and they will have to carry the burden of the cost of that longer.  They will have the extra costs of getting it in.  They would rely on the courier companies to have the facilities to get that through properly, with the collection point of taxes or whatever else there might be.  There will be that cost on the SME sector.  There will be another cost on the courier company because it must have everything correct and proper.  There is an enormous cost here and an enormous risk for the economy-----</p></speech>

It will be in the interests of certain large e-commerce suppliers to have a hub in the EU, a hub possibly in Ireland.

We have heard a lot of useful statistics today and the ones to note are from Enterprise Ireland, which is looking after the constituency the Chairman is talking about.  The clients of Enterprise Ireland trade almost twice as much as any other area in the world and that is the particular grouping that will be the most adversely affected.  The larger exporters have economies of scale.  They have expertise inhouse.  They can scale up.  It is, as the Chairman states, the SME sector, which accounts for such a high proportion of jobs in this country which will be the most affected.</p></speech>

That is why I asked about that sense of Government involvement in that information piece that has to be exercised in the context of those companies.  Those are the ones that are paying Mr. Cody their taxes, etc.  We have to respect them.  I do not get a sense of that.</p></speech>

I have a couple of points.</p> <p>  Have the Revenue Commissioners examined the relationship that other EU countries have with third parties, particularly on the eastern European side, for example, Hungary or Poland?  I refer to the countries that have borders with non-EU countries.  There are plenty of EU countries that are surrounded by countries in the Union or at least in the EEA.  Have they looked at what arrangements exist and how they might be adapted or adaptable for Ireland?</p></speech>

It is part of the preparation of looking at the various different models.  There are various different legal arrangements between countries - whether it is the EEA or Turkey being part of the customs union.  Then there is the harder border on the eastern side.  In a way, there is no particular model between the eastern flank of the EU and their neighbours that provides the potential to solve these problems.</p><p>One of the closest relationships in this, because of a long standing historical relationship, is probably the relationship between Norway and Sweden.  That would be highly sophisticated and their relevant officials have authority on each side of the border.  That is a real close-----</p></speech>

Obviously, Switzerland is surrounded by member states.  I probably did not get to mention this earlier but the customs code provides for special arrangements for local trade within a corridor on both sides.  We are examining the opportunities there.  In the case of Switzerland and France, for example, people are toing and froing about their daily business like they do here, with people working in one country and living in another.  We are looking at opportunities in that area.  The Chairman asked about the work Michael Colgan's team is doing.  It involves making visits.  There is also a long standing customs programme within the EU under which we carry out exchange visits to study particular matters and when we examine IT development we work closely together.  There is a real opportunity to examine all those aspects, but there is no model in place that deals with a country that has spent a long time in the Single Market and then left.  People talk about external frontiers, but every EU country has an external frontier because every one of them has airports.  That is the external frontier.  However, the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the South is unique within the EU.  There is no model of a country leaving with a land frontier of a limited nature, because it is limited to within the island.  It is a unique set of circumstances.  We will explore and we will put anything we can into that policy arrangement.</p></speech>

It is obvious from Michel Barnier that one cannot be in as good a position after one leaves as when one stays.  We can all understand that.  If one is part of the system one is part of the system but if one wishes to walk away and take whatever advantages one perceives from leaving, one equally cannot benefit from all the advantages of being part of it.  The witness spoke about 13 main routes across the Border.  How many crossings are there, omitting people with fields and barns on both sides of the Border?  Are there 300 or 400?</p></speech>

There is a significant contradiction in what it is saying in terms of wanting to maintain the common travel area and free movement on the island of Ireland while simultaneously saying it wants a hard Brexit.  What have we heard from the UK?  It is very hard to square that circle.  On the one hand it is saying it wishes to establish its UK border force and enforce everything while simultaneously saying it wishes to keep everything else.  Is it looking at it simplistically?  Logistically, it would make sense to have the Irish Sea as the border but I do not believe it is willing to go with that and I am not sure the Unionist population would be willing to embrace the concept either.  What has been heard on that?</p></speech>

It is not a competence of the Revenue Commissioners to give the view of what the UK is going to do.  Our role is to administer the tax and customs system and to feed input into the policy dimension.  I am aware that Mr. Callinan appeared before the committee.  He would probably say they are discussions for the political and policy area.</p></speech>

Tracing its roots back to the civil rights movement in the US in the 1960s, the Center for Independent Living has been established in Ireland for the past 25 years.  We are a national disabled people's organisation and, as such, are governed by people with disabilities.  The philosophy and ethos of the Center for Independent Living is reflected in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We believe disability is not intrinsic to the person, rather it arises as a result of barriers created by society or societal failures to make accommodations to ensure people can participate in their communities.  The convention is about protecting, promoting and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of people with disabilities.  It does not create any new rights but rather collates existing rights into one comprehensive international treaty.  It is therefore not surprising that it was the fastest negotiated human rights treaty ever.</p> <p>  Last March marked the tenth anniversary of the signing of the convention.  A total of 172 countries have ratified it.  However, Ireland, to its absolute shame, has not yet done so.  Ireland is alone among European Union member states in this regard.  In a sign of the importance of the convention, the European Union itself took the unprecedented step of ratifying it.  This marked the first time the European Union has ratified an international human rights treaty.  It beggars belief that Ireland has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is an affront to our citizens with disabilities and to those who gave their lives for an independent Irish State.  The Proclamation of the Irish Republic speaks of guaranteeing "equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens", yet 100 years later people with disabilities in Ireland enjoy fewer rights than their UK counterparts.</p> <p>  It is clear that disability is not a priority for the State.  Our national disability strategy lapsed 12 months ago.  A new strategy, which took almost 18 months to complete and which, we understand, has been ready since January, has not yet been published.  Why is the Government dragging its heels and delaying the introduction of the new disability strategy?  The Center for Independent Living is carefully considering its position on the national disability strategy implementation group, given we cannot monitor and implement what does not exist.  This should not be taken as criticism of our Minister of State with responsibility for disability, whose bona fides are not in question, but rather the lack of appropriate devolved powers and supports given to him.</p> <p>  Of obvious importance to the committee is Article 25 of the convention which deals exclusively with health.  We wish, however, to underline specifically the importance of Article 25(c) which requires that health services be provided as close as possible to people's communities, including rural areas, and Article 25(d) which relates to raising awareness of the human rights, dignity, autonomy and needs of persons with disabilities through training and promulgation of ethical standards for public and private health care.</p> <p>  Well-being is covered throughout the convention.  Today in Ireland, at least 2,500 people with disabilities live in institutions, with a further 1,100 under the age of 65 inappropriately placed in nursing homes.  Census data show us that Irish people with disabilities have significantly poorer educational outcomes and job opportunities and are far more likely to experience poverty than their non-disabled peers.  Ordinary things like choosing what time to get up, what to have for breakfast and what to wear are denied to many, as is accessing public transport, socialising, marrying, having a family and other norms of life.  Basic challenges arise.  For example, wheelchair users must give at least 24 hours' notice to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should they wish to use the DART.  The same applies to Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> This presentation is a joint document, and my colleague, Mr. Michael McCabe, chairperson of the Center Independent Living, has asked me to make the presentation on behalf of the centre.  Michael can tell the committee of an experience from last week where he gave more than 24 hours' notice to get a bus from Navan to Dublin but the bus that arrived was not accessible.  Michael had to get a taxi instead, which cost &euro;70.  If we do not have an accessible transport system, it has a knock-on effect around health services.  Health and well-being should not be confined to a health-based medical model or system.  This issue is wider than just health.  I thank the committee for hearing us today and we are certainly happy to answer any questions later on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.525" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Winslow" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#G00200"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for facilitating us and giving us an opportunity to present to them in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and especially its relevance to health and well-being.  We are honoured to be here with CIL and the other organisations that have presented to the committee before us on this topic.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Joan O'Connor, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, development manager in policy and research.  I work part-time as a senior policy adviser to the DFI.  I will give the committee a little background on the DFI and I will outline both the need for a whole-of-government approach to addressing the needs of people who have disabilities and the link to health.  I will also outline the need for increased resources and a multi-annual investment programme.</p> <p>  The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, is an umbrella body of 130 organisations.  Through our work with individuals and organisations, the DFI works to shape and promote an equal society which is fully inclusive of people with disabilities.  We listen to and are in touch with the current needs of people with disabilities.</p> <p>  On the issue of health and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, as Mr. Lee has said, the road to ratification of the convention has been a long one, more than ten years so far.  The most recent hurdle to achieving this goal has been our work on the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, but that still requires more improvements and more work.  Ireland is the only EU member state that has not ratified the CRPD.</p> <p>  Disability tends to be narrowly perceived as a health issue, a view which has been reinforced by the medical model of disability.  We see this routinely through our interaction with public services and across Departments.  Disability tends to be boxed in with health issues.  Even within the HSE itself there are divisions in various health sections between mental health, disability, acute care, primary care, and health and well-being.  This does not necessarily lead to a well co-ordinated approach, nationally or locally.  In the UN convention, disability covers the whole person.  The DFI advocates for a whole-person approach.</p> <p>  Health is determined by a broad range of factors, most of which are outside the health sector.  Social well-being and economic and environmental factors are the main determinants of health.  We all understand health to encompass basic health services and also disability specific services such as living independently and being included in the community.  It is, however, not just health and disability-specific services that will achieve quality of life for people with disabilities and their families.  There needs to be interconnectedness between the Department of Health and other Departments to achieve an adequate standard of living.  We need to provide social protection, including poverty reduction, and this comes under the Department of Social Protection.  Provision of accessible housing stock comes under the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Being able to provide access to inclusive, quality education comes under the Department of Education and Skills.  Access to work in an environment that is open, inclusive and accessible comes under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Transport has also been mentioned in the context of people with disabilities being able to avail of national transport services, which is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Those factors support an individual to live with health and well-being in their community but are outside the direct responsibility of the health sector.  Despite this, the burden on the health sector has increased and is being placed on the Department of Health and on the HSE.  This will continue to increase if these factors are not adequately addressed.  The demand will grow for health and disability services and therefore increase the costs for the Department of Health.  In the absence of a whole-of-government approach to addressing these needs, the outcomes will continue to be modest.  If there is more pressure on health services, people cannot get jobs or transport.</p> <p>  We recognise that as our services are structured in this State it is the responsibility of the Department of Health to remind other Departments of their responsibilities to deliver adequate services for people with disabilities.  In effect, the Department of Health is holding the problem.  Why is this so important? I believe a cross-departmental approach is required to see some changes in the health and well-being of people with disabilities and for the health sector to begin to see a level of return on its investment, because we know the investment in disability services is large.</p> <p>  A way of doing this is through the Government's national disability inclusion strategy implementation plan.  This has been overdue since January 2016 and it has still not been cleared by Cabinet.  It requires that all the Cabinet, including the Taoiseach and the Ministers of various Departments, understand disability as a cross-cutting issue that needs the proofing of decisions across Departments.  The co-ordination as envisaged between Departments under the national disability strategy did not occur.  We still have numerous examples of disjointed ways of working.  Younger people with disabilities are being inappropriately placed in nursing homes due to a lack of a co-ordinated response from the Departments responsible for housing and health.  It is ironic we have the decongregation programme to move people out of institutions while we have young people who have always lived in the community being moved into nursing homes, and this was referred to by Mr. Lee.  There is disjuncture between mainstream employment policies, which are the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, which is the responsibility of Department of Justice and Equality.  This results in people with disabilities being excluded from mainstream activation measures and moves away from that seamless and co-ordinated approach we want.</p> <p>  The public sector duty is a legal obligation on all public bodies to promote equality and protect the human rights of all who are affected by their policies and plans.  Today we ask the committee in its capacity to seek to implement a whole-of-government approach with specific actions.  This would lead to more effective outcomes for people with disabilities and a more efficient use of resources, especially in health.  It would make Ministers and officials in each Department accountable.</p> <p>  I also wish to highlight outcomes for people with disabilities in budget 2018.  People with disabilities are having difficulty getting timely and effective interventions at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>The budget allocated to disability services for 2017 was &euro;1.68 billion but we are still asking whether the outcomes were good.  The situation is worsening for people with disabilities in this country.  As Mr. Lee stated, poverty for people with disabilities is increasing while the situation is improving somewhat for the population in general.  The disposable income of people with disabilities fell by 7.4%, a drop of &euro;1,047 per year, between 2010 and 2015.  This means people's income is down by &euro;20 a week.  This is a massive hit at a time they and their families are under pressure, and it needs to be restored.  People can manage under pressure and cuts only for so long.  People with disabilities and their families have been doubly hammered, by the cuts in their pocket and by health cuts.  Up to 1,100 young people with disabilities are living inappropriately in nursing homes due to a lack of appropriate housing and community supports.  The list goes on.</p><p> The Department of Health and the HSE need to move from a crisis mode approach to providing services for people with disabilities to an advance planning approach that can plan for addressing the true needs.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has much evidence to support planning, for example, the number of people diagnosed with particular disabilities or conditions each year, data on the number of people with disabilities in each county and the impact of this on them.  We are a long way from having enough quality services for people with disabilities to live and take part in their communities like everyone else.</p><p> We need action on the UN convention and the Government's national disability inclusion strategy.  Implementation matters and budget 2018 matters.  We need a cross-departmental multi-annual investment programme for the delivery of community services and supports, as well as Departments working together to improve inclusion and value for money from the health spend.</p></speech>

Mention was made of the public sector duty, which comes out of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  I remind the committee that the Department of Health has specifically mentioned the public sector duty in its statement of strategy.  The only other Department to do so is the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Health stated it is conscious of its responsibilities to ensure the principles of the public sector duty on human rights and equality are embedded in the work of the Department.  It gives the example of the Department's commitment to create a more responsive integrated and person-centred social care system which, among other things, and here is the very interesting point for us, supports the full and effective participation of people with disabilities in society on an equal basis with others in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It also mentions independent living.  I particularly want to take the time to mention this because it is one of very few Departments that has stated that while its business is about health and well-being, it is also about people's dignity and human rights.  This brings us to the cross-cutting measures.</p> <p>  Mr. Lee from the Center for Independent Living spoke about the beginning of the independent living movement in Ireland.  This is an important occasion for us to remember briefly the late Martin Naughton, who died recently, who was core to this and was a great colleague of everyone here over the years.  Mr. Lee was very strong in his presentation about the fact that Ireland has not ratified the UN convention.  The approach of the State is to say when we have our legislative ducks lined up, we will ratify.  In Mr. Lee's view, is there any reason the State must do it like this?  Could the State ratify it and then get on with the legislative programme of implementation in other areas or must it be done this way?  Quite frankly, for many people with disabilities, the fact there have been repeated commitments by Governments to ratify, to which they have not adhered, means it is almost like the longer it takes to introduce legislation, the further the implementation programme is pushed out.</p> <p>  Both presentations mentioned the national disability strategy implementation plan.  My understanding is this was to be in place at the start of last year.  How is this seen by the witnesses?  Another key area mentioned in both presentations is the number of young people who were living in the community but are now in nursing homes.  Ms Winslow described the irony that we have a very strong programme to get more than 2,500 people in institutions into the community.  This is a question for both witnesses.  What is not working in the community in terms of supports?  Is it a choice that 1,100 people have made in their 30s, 40s and 50s to go into nursing homes or is there something missing?</p> <p>  The Disability Federation of Ireland's presentation included the notion that the Department of Health is holding the problem.  Is it that the Department is holding the problem, cannot give it away or cannot share it?  Must something else happen somewhere else to unlock it?  How does the Department of Health get the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to take a bigger interest or make public transport more accessible?  Can the Department of Health do this?</p></speech>

This is restricting people living in their own homes.  At present, many people are getting home care packages but they can use them only at home.  This is making people prisoners in their own homes.</p><p>If only people would realise that it is much cheaper for people to live in their own homes than in residential care.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Lee" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#J00200"><p>I will first answer the question on what is not working in the community and try to put it in the context of health.  We did four reports recently on transport, employment, housing and personal assistance services, respectively.  I can provide the joint committee with copies.  I would like our members to speak for themselves.  For this reason, I will cite from the reports some comments made by members on how they are experiencing life on the ground.  The first is from our housing report:</p><blockquote>I find policies and protocols will be developed to account for people with disabilities as vulnerable people.  Doctors, occupational therapists and case workers must assess your needs.  Service providers must run risk assessments etc.  While this may be necessary in some cases, it is not necessary in all cases.  No respect is given to the wishes or knowledge of the person with a disability.</blockquote> <p>The second is taken from the transport report:</p><blockquote>To travel to my doctor and back in Donegal costs &euro;70 return.  There is no accessible public transport so I have no choice but to go by car.  I have to save the money that I should be spending on essentials like food to pay for the journey.</blockquote> <p>The third statement is taken from the report on personal assistance services:</p><blockquote>The provider I am familiar with is funding and staff led.  While it can't control the lack of funding, it can enhance the process of empowering people with a disability to know what their world would look like with all their needs met.  People with a disability don't have a clear process into assessment or what they can ask for.  Fear and secrecy is at the heart of too many people's lives and [this is] reflected in how they engage.  The service provider generally does not address this adequately.</blockquote> <p>The same report features the following comment from another service user:</p><blockquote>[It is] definitely not fair or user friendly.  I regard the system as one in which the client is 'done to' &ndash; the assessment process is highly subjective.  Recently, I have obtained copies of PSDS policies from different parts of the country.  Not only is the assessment subjective, based on assessment tools from 1965, in terms of policy it is biased on a geographical basis and depends on the skill and judgement of those handling the budget at local level.</blockquote> <p>These are only a sample of comments made by our members about how they, as persons with disabilities, experience life in Ireland in 2017.<br/><br/>Clearly, there are not enough supports in the community for people with disabilities.  The national disability strategy, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and best practice are all about enabling people to live in the community.  Achieving this requires the provision of proper supports.  Money is being invested in building nursing homes all around us and the beds in these homes will have to be filled.  In our experience, the people who own these homes are not too fussed about the demographics of the people who are filling these spaces.  This is a matter of serious concern to our members.  While on the one hand investment is being made in building nursing homes, on the other hand there has been no further investment in personal assistance services since 2009.  How does that tee up with what the Government says it is doing and is supposed to do?  Investing money in institutions while failing to make proper investment in supports to enable people to live at home is contrary not only to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but also to the national disability strategy policy.<br/><br/>The supports required by people with disabilities have been documented.  The best source of information is to ask people with disabilities who use services what they need.  The Center for Independent Living is based on the philosophy of active citizenship.  As well as pointing out the difficulties and issues that arise, we also set out how these problems can be solved.  The solutions come from those on the ground.  We are asking that we be listened to because these solutions will ultimately save money.  If we were discussing the private sector, the market would dictate how a service would operate and how much money would be invested in a particular service because a service would not be used if it was not good enough.  The position in this case is the reverse in that services are simply provided for people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is about people with disabilities being listened to and becoming involved in the monitoring process of the convention.  To respond to Senator Dolan's question, there is no legal impediment to Ireland ratifying the UN convention.  The failure to ratify is for policy reasons only.  There is nothing in the convention which provides that X, Y and Z must be done before the convention can be ratified.  The Government will speak of Ireland being a dualist system and the need to have all our ducks in a row before we can ratify.  My response is to ask whether life has been getting better for people with disabilities since the convention came into play ten years ago and the answer to that question is a resounding &quot;no&quot;.  The Government is not, therefore, busy getting things right before the convention can be ratified.<br/><br/>An issue arises regarding the term &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; on which a ruling was made following the referral of the Equal Status Bill to the Supreme Court in 1996.  The Supreme Court decision refers to &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; in terms of the property rights of private citizens and states that it may encroach on constitutional rights in the area of property.  Now, 21 years later, our view is that this judgment was particular to a specific Bill at a given time and should not be used as a weapon for refusing to ratify the convention.  We understand the Attorney General has provided legal advice on the decision.  We have not seen the advice and have asked that a copy be published.  We understand the Taoiseach can waive the privilege that applies in respect of such advice and make it available in this case.  As far as we are concerned, there is no legal impediment to ratification.  Other dualist nations have ratified it.<br/><br/>On the national disability strategy and implementation group, I will give the example of employment to which Senator Dolan referred.  A so-called comprehensive employment strategy was launched in September 2016.</p><p>I would like to know how many jobs for people with disabilities have emerged from that.  Of particular concern was that there was no sign of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, not only at the launch in 2016 but in terms of engaging with the comprehensive employment strategy, it has been left to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection.  Why are jobs for people with disabilities not an issue for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  For anyone who does not have a disability, it is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If a person has a disability, it is a health or medical matter.  People with disabilities are the same as everyone else.  We are all citizens of Ireland.  Why exclude people with disabilities from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  That is one example of where there is not joined-up thinking or support.</p><p> We are experiencing a lot of frustration in terms of the national disability strategy.  We are now being told we have a Minister of State with responsibility for disability who sits at the Cabinet, although he is not a member of Cabinet, and that issues relating to disability should be passed on to and dealt with by him.  Disability should be a matter for every single Department.  There should be someone specific in those particular Departments who is responsible for disability, and the Department that should have over-arching responsibility to make sure the national disability strategy is rolled out by Departments is the Department of the Taoiseach.  In my experience of the past four or five years on the national disability strategy implementation group, it was only when the Taoiseach's Department became involved for a period of about five or six months that we saw movement by other Departments on the national disability strategy.</p><p> On supports and why they are being given to nursing homes and maybe the older age sector when they should be given to disability, I would say it relates to fair deal.  That is set up as a statutory scheme.  Civil servants naturally follow the statutory scheme and the money will go to the area where legislation provides for it.  There is no statutory basis for personal assistance services.  Indeed, there are more than 30 non-statutory schemes run by the Department of Health, some of which have nothing to do with health, and we would question why things such as mobility and transport grants and even personal assistance services are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  Why are they in the Department of Health and not, for instance, in the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Justice and Equality?  These are some of the issues I wanted to raise today.</p></speech>

I have been working in the disability sector for 30 years, either volunteering or where family members have a disability, and we get movement when disability becomes a political issue, is taken seriously by the Taoiseach and the Cabinet and is given priority.  In recent years, disability has not been seen as an issue by our politicians.  I cannot overstate how significant this is.  Many people in Ireland live with a disability and their families are impacted.  A huge percentage of the population is impacted by disability in one way or another.  Until it is taken seriously again as a political issue by the Taoiseach, in particular, by the Department of the Taoiseach, and by the Ministers in Cabinet, we will not have serious movement towards meeting the needs of people.  There is an obvious legislative requirement and each Department is accountable for delivering outcomes that clearly make a difference to people's lives, whether they be jobs, education or supports, and for ensuring there is interconnectedness between those.  Good strategies are being developed that might need more specifics.  We have good legislation and the convention but we lack the political will.  I cannot overemphasise how important we see this committee's role in influencing that and, through the means available to it, putting it to the Cabinet and the Taoiseach that we need an approach that cuts across Departments.  We need the political will to take it on.  There are many organisations and people who can help in aspects of implementation at statutory, voluntary and not-for-profit levels.  We need that political will if we are going to make a real difference.  Until we do that, we are wasting our resources, not using them efficiently and not having good outcomes for people, which is the most important thing.  There are countless stories we could tell about people we know who have made representations and come to us, and we have to put our finger in the hole to plug the water coming out, as it were.  We live in the community.  People with disabilities want to live in the community and need supports to do that.  We want to live in the community.</p> <p>  To answer Senator Dolan's question, people are going into nursing homes, largely not by choice although sometimes it is, and living with elderly people in inappropriate settings because often a package to suit their needs has not been put together, even though that would be very cost-effective.</p> <p>  Is the Department of Health maintaining the problem?  I think the answer is yes, because that Department is not demanding that it be a cross-cutting issue, either within its own work or between other Departments, nor is it looking for measurable outcomes that could make a difference.  All that links back to our policies and quality of life principles and so on.  They all link back.  There are so many different policy documents we are looking to fulfil, so let us unlock the problem.  Let us get the political will.  What would it take for it to be taken seriously?</p></speech>

In this way they are isolated and are on the margins of society.  Senator Dolan asked about what was not working in the community.  For example, there might be someone on the social housing waiting list who is nearing the possibility of getting accommodation and getting a home but there are no health supports to match.  There are waiting lists and they cannot access the health or social care supports to take up the offer.  Another example is that they may be living in their home with elderly parents and having a very uncertain future.  I wanted to highlight those examples.</p></speech>

The area of disability has to come out of the Department of Health because it is not a health issue.  If I am unwell, I will go to a doctor, but my disability is not a health issue.  If we remove the area of disability from the Department of Health, it will solve a lot of problems.</p></speech>

I am the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on disability services.  Since I was appointed approximately a year ago I have been absolutely blue in the face trying to get the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to ratify the convention.  Do the delegates think  there is anything more I or we, as politicians, could be doing to bring this issue to a head and have the convention ratified?  The Minister of State guaranteed that it would be ratified by the end of 2016.  We are nearly halfway through 2017 and, even though we are getting closer to ratification, we are still not progressing quickly enough for me.  Do the delegates have other suggestions to make to allow their groups to push us, as politicians, to bring the issue to a head?</p> <p>  I have two other observations to make.  I am glad that various speakers have brought up the fact that it is not just a health issue.  A whole-of-government approach to disability services is essential at this stage.  Any motion, Bill or policy being introduced should have to be disability-proofed.  Many speakers also referred to the importance of personal assistant hours.  Through my work I deal with a lot of groups that work with people with disabilities.  The lack of personal assistant hours and the fear of losing a medical card are the two huge issues that keep coming up.  I am with the delegates on that one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#L00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their comprehensive presentations which I very much appreciate.  I return to the budget of &euro;1.68 billion for disability services.  Is that money coming from the health budget or from a number of Departments?  There is a health budget of approximately &euro;14 billion.  I am not sure whether the sum of &euro;1.68 billion is part of that budget or the social welfare budget.  Will the delegates identify what is coming from the social welfare budget for the disability sector for supports?  Will they identify all of the supports provided by the Department of Social Protection?</p> <p>  It has been mentioned that people here are at a loss compared to people living in the United Kingdom.  Will the delegates outline the rights people here do not have?  It is important to highlight and focus on the differences and how people here are at a disadvantage as a result of the convention not being implemented.</p> <p>  The delegates spoke about the number of people in nursing homes.  I agree with them, but the building of nursing homes is a matter for the private sector.  The decision to place someone in a nursing home is not taken by the person running it.  An application must be made through the health service.  It is not the private sector which makes the final decision.  When an application is made to have someone admitted to a nursing home, especially a young person with a disability, is there a mechanism in place within each HSE area to see if there is an alternative to admission such as a more comprehensive home care package?  From my dealings in this area, I am not convinced that there is.  Have the delegates sat down with HSE representatives in the various regions to see if this issue can be dealt with to ensure better outcomes for applicants?  I have seen huge differences in people who have been able to remain at home because of a substantial increase in home care support.  In one case it has added at least ten years to the person's life.  I accept, however, that there might not be people available with the necessary skills to provide that support in some parts of the country.  It is a major challenge, especially in rural areas, but it is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  The other issue about which I am greatly concerned and which I have had to deal with locally in Cork is related to people living in local authority housing.  In March 2014 I came across a person with a major physical and intellectual disability being cared for by their parents who had a letter they had received from Cork City Council in July 2008 confirming that they were on the list of applicants to have adaption works carried out in their house.  Six years on no works had been carried out.  I communicated with the city council for more than six months to see if they could be progressed but without success.  I then went to the Ombudsman and the works were carried out, but it took me 16 or 17 months.  The person concerned was receiving full-time care which would probably have cost the State &euro;3,500 a week, but there was no such cost because the person concerned was being looked after by their parents at home.  There was a lack of co-ordination between the local authorities and the health and social welfare services.  Have the delegates ever considered the possibility of putting a mechanism in place to get State agencies to work together?  In fairness to the Cope Foundation in Cork, it did a huge amount of work for the family in question to try to get the city council to progress the works involved.  I am glad to report that I managed to obtain &euro;2.5 million for the city council this year to have 42 houses adapted.  We will clear the list.  It normally takes six to eight years from the date of application to have the works done.  The family mentioned are the reason the &euro;2.5 million is in place, not me.  They highlighted the issue and now many other families will benefit as a result of their bringing it to my attention.</p> <p>  On the provision of disability officers in local authorities, there seems to be a huge lack of understanding, about which I have gone to the National Disability Authority.  I submitted a freedom of information request to a number of local authorities, one of which replied that it was glad to report that the disability officer had dealt with two issues for the year, at a total cost of something like &euro;12,000.  My understanding of the role of the disability officer in a local authority is that it is his or her job to highlight cases such as that of a local authority tenant who needs assistance in having adaption works carried out to meet his or her needs.  It seems, however, that disability officers have the attitude that their only responsibility is to ensure access to public buildings.  Have the delegates communicated with local authorities on this matter recently?  I raised it with the National Disability Authority over two years ago and I am still not convinced that anything has changed.  There are approximately 40 local authorities.  Surely people working at that level could identify some of the issues involved.  It is not just about the streetscape or access to public buildings; it is also about access to services and, in particular, ensuring houses are adapted and planning for the number that will need to be built for people with disabilities.  While we are all talking about the building of new houses, we are not talking about the number that will need to be built to cater for people with disabilities.  </p> <p>  The delegates might deal with these issues.  I thank them for the work they are doing, but there are challenges that we need to deal with.  There are budgets available to do much of what needs to be done.</p><p>It is just a case of people applying their minds to having the works done.</p></speech>

If they were not labelled as "disabled", they would still receive the money.  Mr. McCabe's point is interesting about whether a person's disability or his or her need is the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan O'Connor" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#M00700"><p>On the point about young people being placed in nursing homes, we sit on the national consultative forum and the main problem seems to be budgetary and resources not being available.  When people are admitted to a nursing home, the common summary assessment report is filled in.  It poses a question about the appropriateness of the placement.  DFI is conducting research and analysing the forms to ascertain how appropriate placements in nursing homes are.  My understanding is funding is not available for the necessary number of packages of health and social care supports.  It is almost like there must be a crisis.  A pot of money can then be accessed through the fair deal scheme and the person concerned will end up in a nursing home.  We also receive many calls from people living in nursing homes to tell us about their situation and that they do not want to be there.  There are younger people, but the level of care does not support progression towards independent living or helping them to do something for themselves.  Co-operation is needed in the identification of resources within the health budget to resolve the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Winslow" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#M00800"><p>I will take Senator Colm Burke's questions first and then come back to Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony's.  </p> <p>  A connection is needed between housing and the supports people require and which are currently being provided by the Department of Health.  As Ms O'Connor said, the fair deal scheme has locked in resources in a specific way and they are not being freed for people who prefer to stay in their community.  It is a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, there are not sufficient resources and money in the community for good assisted living and personal assistant supports to put appropriate packages together, while, on the other, the only to way have an inappropriate solution is to put people in a nursing home.  Flexibility is needed somewhere, as well as a tying up of what is going on.  It is a serious issue for many people who are affected.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the Senator has improved the budget for the payment of housing adaptation grants in Cork.  The budget has been cut and there have been great difficulties throughout the local authorities in this regard.  It is a no brainer that if something suitable is done in somebody's house to make it more appropriate to their needs, he or she can stay at home.  That matter needs to be examined as one that requires additional resources.</p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked how we could help her and how we could help each other.  That would be a good way forward.  It is important to have the UN convention ratified, but it is even more important to make Departments accountable under the implementation plan for the national disability strategy.  It will mean making constant requirements of the various Departments and Ministers concerned and their special advisers and officials, which will mean breaking it down into manageable pieces and addressing what we are looking for in each area.  Some work has been done on that issue in the strategy, albeit not enough, but there are measurable outcomes.  It is then about having the will to pull it all together.  As Mr. Lee said, we want it to move from the highest political level to responsibility being taken by the committee and, in particular, the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities.  It is about interconnectedness.  We will do anything we can to help, including providing information, data, statistics and evidence of good practice.  It is important that we work with the committee and the Deputy in that regard.  I make that offer on behalf of the DFI.  It will also be true of the other umbrella bodies.  We need a joined-up approach, even among ourselves, to get this issue onto the table.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Lee" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#M00900"><p>I will take both questions on the convention together.  Ratification is an important step, but it is only the start.  The world will not change for people with disabilities as soon as Ireland ratifies the convention.  The treaty gathers existing rights and includes them in one comprehensive instrument, but, under the convention, there is an obligation to raise awareness of disability issues.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State is committed and wants to see the convention being ratified, but the State has left it on the long finger.  It was not a priority, but now as soon as it is under pressure to ratify, suddenly the Government is trying to sort things out in the disability Bill which was rushed and is approximately half the size and half as comprehensive as it should be.  </p> <p>  Ms O'Connor mentioned the deprivation of liberty.  If there was the political will, this could be done, but the Minister of State does not have the support of a political party behind him and is not a member of the Cabinet.  There may be issues in that regard.  It is not for the want of trying on his part, but he is up against the system.  At the end of the day, it is a bad signal to send to people with disabilities.  If the Government is not prepared to sign an international treaty which North Korea signed before Christmas, it sends a signal all the way down the line and ends up in scenarios where abuses could happen.  There is a direct line between what is done at the top and what happens at the bottom.  Implementation will be important.  As soon as we ratify the convention, we will need to be in a position to make sure it is implemented and that people with disabilities can monitor its implementation, as required under Article 33.</p> <p>  On the difference the convention will make and the difference in the rights of people with disabilities have in the United Kingdom compared to those living in Ireland, one can take an individual complaint to a UN expert committee where his or her state has breached the convention.  Within two years of signing it, the Government will be reviewed by the UN committee on the rights of persons with disabilities.</p><p>Thereafter, a report will be done every four years on the Government and how it is progressing the rights of people with disabilities under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Until we ratify it, that does not come into play.  I would say the Government is concerned about resources and their allocation.  I am concerned in the meantime that resources are being eroded.  They have been eroded.  If members look at the joint statement the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Centre for Independent Living and other organisations launched yesterday, which details what is needed and which we can make available to members, they will see it is a resource issue.</p><p> Decisions that fundamentally affect the rights of people with disabilities to engage in society in the same way as their non-disabled peers can engage - such as those about personal assistance services - can be made at the stroke of a pen.  There is no accountability.  There is no proper independent administrative tribunal available to people to question decisions that are made that affect their lives.  As I mentioned earlier, there are some 30 non-statutory schemes under the Department of Health that many people rely on with regard to engaging with the community and living in society.  In the UK, there are tribunals.  If a decision is made and one is unhappy with that decision, one can appeal that decision to an independent body.  They are some of the differences.</p><p> Again, we would look for personal assistant, PA, hours.  Mr. Michael McCabe will talk about personal assistant services shortly, so I do not want to go into too much detail.  With the PA service, the leader - that is the person with the disability - can direct the service.  That person can decide what time to get up at in the morning, what to have for breakfast, what to wear, where to go out, how to use his or her time, whether to go shopping or whatever else, rather than being told that assistance will be available at a certain time.  Personal assistance can enable people to do these things that others take for granted.  They are not then dependent on family members or friends.  That changes the dynamic of their relationships.  If one is relying on family members or friends as carers, then one is really changing the dynamic of the relationship with that person.</p><p> We have engaged with HSE teams.  It varies from region to region.  There are some fantastic people trying to do much within limited budgets.  There are other people who are driven by figures and budgets.  The system itself needs to be reviewed and changed.  I will give specific examples.  I can think of one man in his 40s who went in to hospital for a procedure and who had never lived in an institution.  He had always lived at home, initially with his parents, and with personal assistant services.  He went into a hospital for a procedure.  As he was in hospital, he lost his PA hours.  Following the procedure, he was required to take medication.  There are issues about whether personal assistants can give medication to leaders - the people with disabilities that they are serving.  In that particular case, he moved from the regional hospital that he was in.  He refused to go into a nursing home, which is where he was being directed.  He went into a community hospital.  I visited him on numerous occasions during the two years that he was in that community hospital.  During that time, there were people coming and going.  People were dying in a ward beside him.  He shared the ward with three other people.  At one stage, the ward was closed for a number of weeks because of an outbreak of some illness or another and he could not get in or out.  He was directed to the nursing homes support scheme - the fair deal scheme - to get a nursing home, because that is where the money was.</p><p> We thought that perhaps we could judicially review the decision on his situation.  Eventually, after two years, some creative accountancy was done and hours from older age support were given to him to enable him to live back in his house.  The local authority was very good.  It kept his house for him for the almost two and a half years that he was in hospital.  It was only because of his determination that he managed to secure those hours that enabled him to go back to living in the community.</p></speech>

I worked for 20 years.  I am married.  I am very active in the disability sector.  I would not be able to do any of this without a personal assistant.  My wife and I would not be able to have an equal relationship if I was constantly depending on her.  It is very hard to explain if one has not experienced it before.  The other thing I would ask the committee to do is to consider direct payments.  Those have to come in.  We have been fighting for them for the last number of years.  It will be much more cost-effective as well.</p></speech>

We hope to finish by 11.30 a.m.</p> <p>  I will bring Senator Burke's question in.  There are a number of concerns among the families of people who are in congregated settings.  They wonder how those people are going to manage in their communities if they are decongregated and if proper supports are not put in.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said that 500 people moved out of congregated settings last year.  There will be approximately 180 this year because funding is limited.  There are concerns about decongegration.  While it is the policy of the Government to decongregate, there are concerns about how people will cope, particularly those who have been in congregated settings for a long time.  The other question is on respite services and people moving from adolescence into adulthood.</p><p>They may have had access to respite services as adolescents but when they move into adulthood they have great difficulty accessing respite care.  </p><p> On the PA hours issue, the Minister was here a couple of weeks ago and there was a dispute between Senator Dolan and the Minister on a mathematical calculation of the number of PA hours.  The number of PA hours allocated this year is 1.4 million.  It seemed the number allocated last year was 1.3 million but it was actually 1.5 million and it was now dropping back to 1.4 million.  Perhaps the witness has some comments on that.  </p><p> On the point raised by Mr. Michael McCabe, how close are we to moving to personalised budgets and will they be cost effective?  They give autonomy to the person but can people actually access services themselves with personalised budgets?  I interrupted Senator Burke's question.</p></speech>

It is fine to sign a declaration that it will be implemented.  I would be careful with the comparison to North Korea's implementation.</p></speech>

They have built up relationships with staff in local authorities and with disability officers.  I agree with the point that we should not focus solely on the access issue.  Their remit should be broader.  There is a job of work to be done to make mainstream public services more disability friendly and making them fit for purpose.  Our staff are engaged in that work, and working with the local community development committees and the public participation networks.  That work is ongoing, and hopefully we will see results from that.  We see results from it already.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Winslow" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052500002#O00400"><p>On the issue of the officers, it was brought in years ago to address the issue of access and it has been weak enough.  It needs to be buoyed up and taken more seriously.  There are some examples of good work but it is about building on that.  Equally, one of the most frustrating things for working people with families is the variations depending on where people live and how things are managed and co-ordinated.  We have been trying to achieve a standardised approach and co-ordinate clearing houses in order that people can have a joined-up approach to their plans and their work.  We are trying to achieve person-centred services around personal plans.  There are some good examples of practice that are good at putting the person and their family in the centre but there are some very poor examples as well.  We need to see improvement on key workers to work with people and their families in order that we can join up all the various aspects.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan highlighted the issue of the variability of the number of PA hours with the Minister recently.  The reality is that there are not enough.  We have lost some hours and need to start building up again.  At minimum we are talking about adding 500,000 hours as soon as possible, hopefully as a result of this budget or the budget in 2018.  </p> <p>  There is no doubt that respite services make a big difference to families.  This should be a budgetary issue going forward.  We have had cuts in respite grants and services.  We have had examples of bed closures and beds not being available because of cuts in services or other demands.  Respite care makes a huge difference to families and I am sure that the committee is hearing how big a difference it can make to be able to manage and have planned breaks throughout the year.  It makes living in the community better for everybody, particularly for parents and carers, but also for the person if it is an appropriate respite placement.  Sometimes people get put into places which are not appropriate.  Those options need to be freed up again.  We had growth.  We should see that improve again.  </p> <p>  We need to take this seriously.  We have good policies, and we even have pieces of legislation which have never been fully implemented.  This includes the plans we are now talking about.  Political will is needed and, as Mr. Lee said, that influences the mindset throughout.  We need leadership from the top to complement the good work that is being done throughout the regions and counties.  The mindset needs to change.  We need to see this as an equality and rights issue, and give people some hope again.  I am very involved with people living with multiple sclerosis.  The condition can progress and change.  Hope makes a huge difference to people's quality of life.  I cannot overemphasise how important it is to bring some hope back to people's lives, when they are living in the community and doing their best.  </p></speech>

It is an important part of the relationship because some people can abuse the PAs.</p> <p>  On the question of personalised budgets I would imagine that some people have them already, although it is not publicised very well.  I met a friend last week who has 40 hours.  It is not enough, but he has direct payments.  I understand that people are worried.  Young people with disabilities are no different than anybody else.  They have to live in their own way, live their own lives and make mistakes like everybody else does.  Parents can be very overprotective but they are not doing any favours for their kids.</p></speech>

HIQA can take thematic approaches, and it has done so on matters in the past.  We would ask that HIQA take a thematic approach - take the inappropriate placement of people in nursing homes as a theme and get the facts and the figures.  It is the only organisation that can do this.  Perhaps the committee could make a recommendation along those lines as that would give us a clearer picture.</p><p> In the context of North Korea, believe it or not, last week was the first time a UN human rights monitor was allowed into that country.  It was the special rapporteur on the rights of people with disabilities.  She went there and provided a very diplomatic report afterwards.  Members can look it up on the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, website.  I utterly accept the Senator's point in that regard.  Nevertheless, Ireland should be leading the way.  We should be ratifying it.</p><p> According to the Government's figures, there are more people waiting for PA hours than individuals who have access to such hours.  There has been no investment in PA services since 2009.  At a minimum, it should be doubled in order to address the waiting lists.  It is the younger people who are having difficulties accessing PAs.  They might have supports in terms of school and third-level education but after that they are on their own and they go to the back of the queue for PA services.  As a result, it is very difficult for them to plug into life.  Getting a job is even more difficult.  There must be investment in PA and other support services that enable people to live in the community.</p></speech>

In an ideal world there would be choice as well for people to live together, because people get peer support regardless of their disability.  It is not an ideal, but the movement is bringing about a huge change from people's institutional experience.  There is going to be a lead-in period for people and it will take a while.  It is natural that there are fears and some of the solutions undoubtedly are not ideal.  In the normal scheme of things, the Chairman and I do not choose to live alone; we choose to live with other people, so there will have to be some more flexibility in it.  I appreciate the concerns the committee has heard in that regard.  At the same time, however, we must push that model to bring about real change, including in the mindset.</p></speech>

With regard to adaptation work on houses, I understand from the Department that there is adequate funding available to local authorities now.  If the organisations encounter a situation where a local authority is not delivering, they can contact the committee and the Chairman and I will have no difficulty with going to the Department to provide any assistance we can.  The vast majority of people in the public sector work hard to get the best possible service for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

Almost immediately after the vote, this emerged as an issue which would be of central importance to Ireland and how Brexit would work.  It is core to how a significant number of citizens live their lives daily.  It will also be a key part of the future relationship of the State with its closest neighbour.  A number of witnesses we have had before us have referred to and made comments on this.  The witnesses today will obviously add to the picture.  We are trying to complete the picture as we move towards our final report.  On behalf of the committee I welcome representatives from the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Mr. Damian McGenity, Mr. JJ O'Hara and Mr. John Sheridan, to our meeting today.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p><p>With all of this out of the way, I invite the witnesses to make their opening remarks.  They can decide the order in which they will speak.  We will hear all of the opening remarks after which we will have questions in batches.</p></speech>

It is a very good opportunity to explain who we are and what we would like to see done as a result of Brexit.  I apologise on behalf of our main spokesperson, Mr. Declan Fearon, who is unable to be with us today due to work commitments.  I thank the Clerk and the staff for co-ordinating the meeting.</p> <p>  Border Communities Against Brexit comprises ordinary individuals.  Mr. Sheridan and I are farmers and Mr. O'Hara is involved in tourism.  Border Communities Against Brexit has members from along the Border, from Derry right around to Dundalk.  It came about mainly because there was no real voice in Border communities lobbying on behalf of the remain vote, which was 56%, in the North.  It became very clear very quickly after the Brexit debate there was almost a demonisation of people who wanted to fight to remain in the European Union.  We are often called remoaners and this is something we have steadfastly stood against.</p> <p>  Our main concern is that as a result of Brexit there would be a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  I was here with Mr. Fearon two weeks ago to listen to the EU chief negotiator, Mr. Barnier.  We certainly welcome the high-level engagement Europe has had on Brexit.  It understands very well the situation in Ireland.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers have done a lot of work on this front.  Our key concern following Mr. Barnier's address is the EU would seek to protect its borders.  It is understandable that this would be the case from a European perspective and from the perspective of protecting European food consumers.  The impact of a hard border, through its economic ramifications and the jobs it would potentially put at risk, is enormous, as well as the social impact of hemming in people away from their natural hinterland or with regard to visiting their families.</p><p> The Irish ambassador to the UK, Mr. Mulhall, has said that 2 million vehicles cross the Border each month.  Approximately 30,000 workers cross the Border on a daily basis.  The main sectors we have lobbied, having identified them as being to the forefront of the Brexit debate, are agriculture, agrifood and tourism.  In the North alone, there are 100,000 people employed in the agriculture and agrifood sectors.  Mr. O'Hara will talk about tourism, which is an all-Ireland sector.  There are 260,000 people employed in that sector.  There is huge concern in the South about the impact the Brexit talks will have on trade between the South and the UK, particularly in the beef sector, where 90,000 jobs are at risk.  According to a report that was published by the Central Bank recently, 40,000 jobs could be at risk as a direct result of Brexit in the next five years.</p><p> The North has depended on EU support.  The EU has been very good to the North.  Billions of pounds have been invested, particularly in rural communities.  Under the Common Agricultural Policy, approximately &pound;240 million is provided in direct support to farmers every year.  We have been told that Britain will leave the EU in two years' time.  That is a huge risk.  There has been no real detailed discussion on how Britain will be able to sell produce on the world market.  Europe has trade deals with 60 countries.  Given that Brexit is happening so soon, we do not know how the agrifood sector in the North can expect to get trade deals to sell products.  We do not think it is possible.  If Britain crashes out of the EU with no deal, we will be looking at WTO tariffs.  As we have outlined in our document, such tariffs range from 13% to 60% in the agriculture sector, depending on the product being sold.  Such issues are of huge concern to us.</p><p> Those who support Brexit have not yet set out in detail how they envisage that the problems which have been identified will be resolved.  That is why we have called from an early stage for the EU and the Irish and British Governments to engage with the possibility of securing a special status for Northern Ireland.  We believe this is the only way to protect trade and the movement of people and goods on the island of Ireland.  The effect of this proposal would be to move the EU border to the Irish Sea.  We do not think this would affect the constitutional position of the North in any way.  We would like to discuss this proposal further with the committee today.</p></speech>

Our main business is tourism.  We have a bed and breakfast and a tour company, Irish Life Tours.  I will explain what we see coming down the road for the tourism industry.  Tourism Ireland, which was established under the Good Friday Agreement, markets all Thirty-two Counties of Ireland.  It has important offices around the world.  We work very closely with its New York office.  The problem at the moment is that it has cut its forecast for the coming year by 6% because of Brexit.  This is a fact.  In 2016, tourism in the North of Ireland increased by 26% and tourism in the Border counties increased by 14%.  It is the second biggest industry in the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  The problem coming down the road relates to who will fund Tourism Ireland in the future.  In 2008, its funding was cut by a certain percentage.  The year 2010 was the worst for tourism in the history of the island of Ireland.  The problem we have is that tourists are making up their minds today.  We have to market two years in advance.  We have been at meetings in Italy and Germany in recent months.  The problem is that we do our marketing two years in advance.  People consider the idea of coming to Ireland in the first year and budget for that idea in the second year, before coming to Ireland in the third year.  This problem needs to be sorted out today because it is having an effect on the ground today.  We cannot wait until Brexit happens two years down the road.  We have seen the figures for EU visitor numbers in the first three months of this year.  There has been a reduction of 5.5%.  Brexit is already happening on the ground.  The issues to which I refer are developing because of currency fluctuations and fear.</p> <p>  I will explain the main thing that is concerning us.  This is what is coming up in our meetings across Europe.  People want to know whether tourists will be safe if there is a border in two years' time.  That is a big issue.  It came up in Italy and in Germany.  These are facts.  We are here today to explain our problem.  Tourism Ireland needs to know where it will get funding as it goes forward, and what level of funding it will get.  Are the Twenty-six Counties to be marketed separately from the Six Counties?  Will we be selling an island that is partly in the EU and partly out of the EU?  This is a real problem for businesses on the ground.  Tourism is the second largest industry in rural Ireland.  Many of those who own farms are involved in tourism as a second business, for example by renting houses, canoes or bicycles.  We need to get answers for them.</p> <p>  The second issue I am here to talk about is funding.  The North of Ireland has received over &pound;7 billion in EU funding under various programmes.  One of the main programmes is the Erasmus programme.  It is a very big programme for young students across the North of Ireland.  It gives them an opportunity to spend 29 days in various parts of Europe.  Their accommodation, food and travel costs are paid.  Are we saying to our young people that in two years' time, they will be unable to go to different parts of Europe under this programme?  We have students from Italy in our own business at the moment.  They are here for three weeks.  Last week, we had students in from Poland.  We work with colleges across Europe.  The students from those colleges are selling our products on the ground in Italy, Poland and Germany.  We bring students canoeing and we show them various places and things around us.  They are treated well when they come here.  When they go back to their own countries, they tell 20 people around them about their experiences.  This is the best and cheapest way of marketing Ireland as a tourism product.  Funding is a major industry.  The Peace Bridge in Derry is one of the finest projects one will see.  The tourism issues across the Border counties need to be sorted out sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

I would prefer to have questions on Brexit than to speak for myself.  I am a farmer from south west Fermanagh.  My farm is one of a number that are managed together as Legnabrocky Farms, the chief executive of which is my son.  I was worried from the outset that the referendum might go the way it ultimately went.  I grew up during the Troubles on a farm that adjoined the Border.  I had to go through numerous army, police and customs checkpoints to travel between the local villages of Blacklion and Belcoo.  I used to meet mobile patrols on the road.  Every time one opened a gate, one did not know whether one was going to go up in smoke.  Therefore, the first reason I was concerned about Brexit was that Europe had helped to deliver peace to this country.  My farm is involved in primary beef and lamb production.  We have suckler cows and sheep.  Those commodities, particularly sheep, will be most affected by Brexit.  I can explain the reasons for that later.</p><p> "Consternation" is the best word that I can use about the result of a referendum that was based on misrepresentation at best and lies at worst.  I say this as a citizen of Europe and an Irish person holding a European passport who exercised his democratic right and voted to remain, as did 56% of the North.  Of the Border counties, Fermanagh and south Tyrone were nearly 59% in favour of remaining, Armagh was approximately 65% remain and Foyle was 78% remain.  There was a very strong vote to remain along the Border corridor.  I do not feel like being isolated in south west Fermanagh with the only place I can go dictated by a 25 degree angle.  I was brought up along the Border and have spent as much time in the South as in the North.</p><p> Under the Good Friday Agreement, the whole economic island of Ireland deserves to be considered for a special designated status.  As Mr. McGenity stated, this would not affect the Constitution.  The Constitution can be left for another day.  The island's economies are integrated, far more so than Britain's economy is integrated with Europe's.  Those economies were built for efficiency and scale, which is nearly unique in the world.  They have it down to a t.  This is a food island and I would like it to remain that way.</p></speech>

The Brexit issue is looming large in that context as well.</p><p>My questions are on the special economic status that we are seeking on top of the ability to move seamlessly over and back across the Border.  The research that we have seen on the special status of East Germany in terms of its economic ties with West Germany prior to the wall coming down shows that it was treated as though it were a member of the then EEC.  Have the witnesses investigated this and made submissions on it?  We have been told time and again, including when the Commissioner was in Leinster House and the European officials interacted with us, that the issue of Ireland must be dealt with first as one of the three matters that they want to have addressed before trade agreements are settled.  They told us to go to them with ideas.  One of the ideas that we are considering is using East Germany's special status prior to the wall coming down as a precedent for a special status for Northern Ireland and the Border counties, in that there would be an economic deal between Northern Ireland - not necessarily with the UK - and the Republic.  Have the witnesses encountered this precedent and have they received any legal advice on it?  We only have some information on it.  Due to the nature of East Germany and West Germany and the amount of time that has lapsed since, it seemed to have been an <i>ad hoc</i>structure, albeit one that we could use as a precedent.</p><p>We all know of the problems.  We must devise recommendations beyond just asking for a special status for Northern Ireland, even if that is exactly what we want.  We must set out how it could be done, why it should be done and what happened in East Germany.  Germany will be one of the key decision makers in this section of the negotiations.</p><p>I must give my apologies, as I must go to the other meeting, but I will read the transcripts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#C00400"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their well-argued and well-supported submissions to us.  I do not want to be presumptuous, but I believe that every committee member, including those who are not present, favours a special status for Northern Ireland.  The principle is probably agreed and I hope that I am not being arrogant in saying that.</p> <p>  As Senator Mark Daly mentioned, the real question is about what that means.  The paragraphs in the witnesses' submission on potential solutions refer to the special status as allowing Northern Ireland "to remain part of the EU".  That is one way of putting it.  There is another way of discussing a special status for Northern Ireland, and that is a special status for Northern Ireland "in relation to the EU".  That is a slightly different idea.</p> <p>  The common travel area is safe and sacrosanct.  No one will interfere with anyone's right to cross the Border on a train or bike or by foot.  No one will ask who the person is or what he or she is doing.  Rather, we are discussing the movement of goods, including agricultural produce.  That is the crucial issue.</p> <p>  I will put an idea forward for the witnesses' consideration and ask for their views on it.  We do not have to have a single special status with Northern Ireland, for all purposes and in every respect, being "in relation to the EU" in category A or B.  It is possible to view agriculture as one aspect of the special status whereas dealings with aircraft components from Belfast could be in a different category.  In other words, an all duck or no dinner approach to special status need not be taken.  We can have a special status across a range of economic activities and goods.</p> <p>  I am in sympathy with the witnesses' view that, in so far as physical customs checks must be carried out, the most practical way of doing so is on the Irish Sea corridors.  When Mr. Michel Barnier visited the Houses, he said that Europe wanted to protect its borders.  I did not take him as having in mind hard border checks for all purposes.  There probably is not a major problem with saying that the island of Ireland can remain an uncustomed area for the movement of most goods and that, in respect of certain goods only, custom checks can be done on the basis of electronic returns.  For example, one would seek prior permission or be registered as a person who moves aircraft components, pharmaceuticals or whatever.  When Mr. Barnier stated that the EU wanted an imaginative and flexible approach, I hope that he was thinking along the lines of this kind of suggestion and that the harder Brexit idea is not there.</p> <p>  I will throw those ideas out to the witnesses and seek their responses to same.  Regarding special status as a principle, they are pushing an open door with us.  The question is, what does it mean or can it mean many things.</p></speech>

Recently, I was part of a delegation that travelled to Brussels with representatives of Border Communities Against Brexit.  They put in a Trojan amount of work engaging with European colleagues at every level from Mr. Barnier down.  I share many of their frustrations and concerns.  I also share most of the sentiments that were expressed by Senator McDowell on special status.  Respectfully, I do not share his confidence about the common travel area and the movement of people.</p> <p>  I agree with the previous speakers on special status.</p><p> My party has outlined its view in documents about how that would look.  Other scenarios will evolve as things move ahead.  </p><p> Mr. O'Hara's contribution highlighted clearly the potential threat.  What we need to do first is protect the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and the threat posed to it by Brexit.  Mr. O'Hara observed that tourism is a critical, growing sector of the Irish economy, both North and South.  He looked at its importance for job creation and the economy across the island, not least along the Border corridor, and the impact that Brexit will have on that sector.  Then there is the question of the impact Brexit will have on Tourism Ireland and how it does its work, not only as a cross-Border body but also how it will promote the tourism offering in Ireland as a single entity overseas when one part of the island is in the EU and the other outside.  Once again, it highlights how much Brexit permeates across every aspect of our lives and in a negative and detrimental way.  That was highlighted very clearly for me.  </p><p> It would be interesting to hear the witnesses' own views on special status as they have engaged extensively on the issue at home and overseas.  They made this point in their own contribution but we need to hear a clear outline from the Government of its view of special status for the North and indeed for the South, will be.  As the Government has been mandated by the D&aacute;il to argue for special status, one would hope that is its responsibility and intention.  Have the witnesses had engagement with the Irish Government in this regard?  What feedback have they given regarding their view on special status?  What have they argued for, with whom have they been arguing and what is its likelihood in the future?</p></speech>

I am glad that the Acting Chairman let me in here, because I want to tease out the question of special status some more.  I agree wholeheartedly with everything my colleague Senator McDowell said.  Agriculture is my brief and I would like to get the opinions of the two agricultural representatives from the party and tease out the issue from an agricultural perspective.  An all-island special status would be ideal in tourism, I cannot see any negatives there, and it would solve many of the agricultural problems, such as the cross-Border travel, milk, sheepmeat, cattle, pigs and so on.  We are trying to come up with proposals, solutions and answers so I am playing devil's advocate here in trying to get to the root of things rather than being negative.  On the bigger question of agriculture, the Twenty-six Counties cannot get any better status in its relations with the UK after Brexit than as matters stands at present under the European model.  If, as a result of bargaining and horse trading, all-island special status meant that while the North remained in the UK, this meant there would be tariffs on their products going into the UK, how would the representatives feel about this?  How would that work in the agricultural model?  If that did not happen, how could the agricultural model work if beef from Belfast was going into the UK tariff-free while beef from Dublin went in with tariffs?  I am not saying that it cannot work but it does not sound like something that would be very easily worked out.  Ideally, we would love to wind back the clock and not have a Brexit.  However the aspiration coming from here is for all-island status, but it requires a lot of thought.  It is not something over which we would immediately jump up and down while saying, "fair play Mr. Barnier, you gave us all-island status, we are 90% there". It could be a step back in some ways because we would have to collectively go back to the drawing board to see how this would work.  There would be ramifications.  What are the witnesses thoughts on that especially from the agricultural perspective which is their brief?</p> <p>  It must be very frustrating without an assembly or a Parliament in Westminster, but prior to the assembly's dissolution and the election being called, what feedback were witnesses getting on the ground from their negotiations or from whatever work, of meetings and research they had had with those on the other side of the Border?  As Senator McDowell said, anything the witnesses are saying pushes an open door here.  We can only go on the public speeches by Theresa May but the witnesses are meeting people face to face, like-minded individuals and people in business who might share the same grievances or fears as themselves.  What do they think is the feeling on the ground?  They are strongly emphasising that the majority in Northern Ireland have voted to stay but unfortunately in democracy, it is the overall result, we cannot go on sectoral votes in present circumstances.  I could argue that if all elections were based on the box in my little local village, I would be President of Ireland now.  We have to take the overall result and unfortunately we are where we are.  I would like to know what sense the witnesses are picking up in their face-to-face meetings on the other side of the Border.  They will find nothing other than positive things here, we all share the one aspiration.  </p></speech>

On the overall remarks on special status, I wish we had the answers.  It would short-circuit the enormous problems of Brexit.  I want to pick up on Senator McDowell's point on potentially having separate deals for separate sectors.  While there may be traction in that, one potential stumbling block is that the diverse nature of business and of European law and rules on a variety of sectors.  It may be possible to get a deal in the agriculture and the agrifood sector, and that would have further implications for getting product into the UK market, as Senator Daly said, because Europe does not allow countries to do individual trade deals.  In pharmaceuticals, for example, Almac gave evidence to the Northern Ireland select affairs committee in February.  It is a big employer in Portadown and has its European headquarters there.  It is at the very top end of medicine and much of what it does is research and drug trials.  It said in its evidence that it had bought a facility in Dundalk, that Europe requires that the medicines are tested in a laboratory by a competent person, within the European Union.  Look at pharmaceuticals or, as the Senator said, the aircraft and other sectors.  For instance, I spoke to an engineer and quantity surveyor last week.  He is a neighbour of mine in the North and does a lot of work in Dublin.  The construction industry is beginning to realise that to buy product from the North in the UK which has a CE certificate, when that is brought here to the South, he, as an engineer, will not be able to sign off on that project because that component does not have a certification.  The answer is not simple.</p><p>There is a great lack of dialogue on Brexit.  Unfortunately, there is no assembly now sitting in Belfast and those institutions need to be put back in place.  In the absence of constructive dialogue and of a strand that we would like to see developed between London, Dublin and Belfast on the way in which these problems can be teased out, the way in which solutions can be put forward and on how people can engage in that discussion, we fear a solution will be imposed on us that could be very unworkable.  Overall, we would like to have such a dialogue.  The Irish Government has done an enormous amount of work.  Its Brexit document is very good.  The Minister with responsibility for European Affairs attended the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday.  However, the deeper discussion required on what the solution to Brexit is and the feeding of that into the process is not taking place across all the political parties and the non-governmental organisations.</p><p> The feedback we have got on the ground, and Mr. John Sheridan will comment on this from the farming sector, and I also farm part-time, is that people are now beginning to wake up.  This is only two years away.  Representatives of the Ulster Farmers Union, UFU, appeared before the Seanad committee recently and they sat on the fence in terms of Brexit.  My view and that of the Border Communities Against Brexit is that those in the farming sector were told that Brexit would be good for them and that they would be able to get deals on the international markets.  We are a year down the line and no deals have been signed yet.  The great danger is that if we crash out of the European Union, we would move to having default World Trade Organization tariffs in place and we would have no support in terms of payment because farming is simply not profitable.  The UFU is now saying that Britain will have to trade internationally but its main competitor will be the European Union.  The UFU is saying in debates such as this one that in terms of farmers who voted for Brexit to deregulate the sector, that its regulation will now have to be increased.  When they go to sell their products on the international market, the first thing they will be asked by potential buyers is why would they buy a British product when they have a European product of a high standard.  Therefore, farmers will have to provide a higher standard product for that market.  Overall, this is very complex.</p><p> Our feedback from Downing Street is that they are all over the place on Brexit, that there is no consensus within the Cabinet, there is no clear thought, their advisers are out of their depth and the UK Brexit Secretary is not on top of his brief.  Given the general election that is taking place, if there were to be a fracture in the negotiations on the issue of the bill that the EU is seeking from the British Government, that would not bode well for us.  There is a great risk that the talks could break down at a very early stage.</p></speech>

He asked about East Germany and the wall coming down between East and West Germany.  The Border Communities Against Brexit took the attitude that we have a white sheet of paper in so far as we mitigate the impact of Brexit or approach a hard Brexit being imposed on us.  As a group, we have believed from the outset that having a special status means nothing unless it is a special status within Europe.  Anything else is only special status outside it.  I would go so far as to say that we do not accept there is any form of a Brexit other than a hard Brexit.  Any soft Brexit we would view as a Brexit by stealth over the years with layers upon layers of legislation being introduced which would once again lead to a hard Brexit.<br/><br/>Norway has its own deal with Europe.  Switzerland spent eight years trying to negotiate a deal and it has still has not finished it but it still has a deal with Europe.  Cyprus, north and south, is working as one island and has Britain's biggest military presence located in the middle of the island.  There is also Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  There are several different special designated statuses and it comes down to how we interpret it.  We have the good luck of having the Good Friday Agreement.  It is one of our biggest accomplishments.  It is an international agreement lodged in the Hague and it is there to protect every Irish and EU citizen on this island.  <br/><br/>We have a heavy cloak upon us as a group.  We have not looked particularly any further than that, other than we know that special status is possible.  It was a matter for us to highlight and we have achieved that with a special status for Northern Ireland now being talked about throughout Europe, in Britain and in Ireland.  That is the first step.<br/><br/>There is a second step, which shows our accomplishment.  Everybody who is anybody - any business, all the educational establishments and the health establishments - and all those people who have responsibility who were very quiet before the referendum are now coming out and saying they want things the way they were.  It is a little late for that but not in this country because of the Good Friday Agreement.  We can hold the <i>status quo</i>.  Even though people are seeking that things will stay the way they were, some political parties, especially in the North, are saying that they want things the way they were but they want a few cherries on top.  I am afraid those cherries are not there for the picking and that must be well understood.<br/><br/>Deputy McDowell referred to a special status for Northern Ireland and Mr. Damian McGenity more or less answered that point.  The only point that was not addressed was the issue of a digital border.  A digital border would still require a hub.  It would involve self-regulation.  A digital border cannot take cognisance of a container carrying a number of different commodities.  Some of those would probably have to be checked and others would not need to be.  A space for a warehouse and the parking of a lorry would be required.  If a lorry with a container is carrying perishable goods and it takes two or three days to clear that container, those goods would be lost.  If a customer needs a product from that container immediately, and the clearing of the container is held up for two or three days, that customer will not do business with that provider again.  We have considered the issue of a digital border in many different ways and we believe there is only one place for it and that is out in the sea.  We have a porous Border and it has always been like that, despite all the tools that were thrown at it to keep it in place.  I have no doubt that Europe would protect its borders even more vehemently than Donald Trump would aspire to build a wall between America and Mexico.  That is how much Europe values it markets.  Europe will make sure that the integrity of its high-quality product, produced to a higher environmental standard and traceability, is not affected by any porous border.  By that I mean, inferior product coming through a border on the one island, which would be crazy carry-on.</p><p>I am glad to see that members feel the same and are considering how that special status can come into being, in particular in terms of how it can be legally implemented, which is Senator McDowell's field of expertise.  The need for special status needs to be pressed upon Westminster.  As a unionist farmer who farms on the Border, I have always perceived the Good Friday Agreement as my protector and that my sources to go to were Westminster, Dublin and Europe.  We have doors and avenues into all of those places.  Unfortunately, to date, Stormont has muddied the waters.  Certain parties decided to go over to London and take out a four-page wrap-around advert<i></i>in the <i>Metro </i>freesheet newspaper to promote a vote for Brexit.  Those parties now want things to stay the same.  That beggars belief.<br/><br/>In terms of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question on the common travel area, CTA, I am worried that there could be a problem in terms of the common travel agreement but if there were special status for the island of Ireland to remain in the EU, that could hopefully be overcome and the CTA would certainly be let go.  In a Brexit scenario involving a Border on the island, I believe Westminster would try to hold to its side of controlling immigration.  At the same time, it is starting to acknowledge it needs these people to work in factories in the UK.  Immigrant labour makes up 65% of the workforce in the processing industry in Northern Ireland.  <br/><br/>In terms of the Irish Government reply, I must commend it on the seminars it has held.  I attended a mind-blowing briefing on energy.  I did not know anything about the way energy worked on this island.  After the seminar, I felt that Brexit is a complete bonfire of money and that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, was misrepresented at the dinner he went to in Downing Street at which it was said that Brexit could be nothing only bad for everybody.  That statement is correct.  The division of these nations will do nothing for anybody.  It must be done in such a minimal way that as little money as possible is burnt.  Ireland, Britain and Europe will have to work together to ensure that because everybody is going to suffer in this.  It is a sad situation but it can be overcome.  We want the Government to make one last effort to put the ball over the bar and come out clearly saying it is looking for a special designated status, this is how it is going to do it and to set out the parameters and a timeline as to how that will be done and how legal jargon will be brought into play.  It needs to tell Westminster that it understands that the UK is leaving the EU.  Ireland is a member state of the EU along with 27 others.  It has international trade agreements with 60 countries.  It must tell Westminster that, along with Europe, it will ensure that it is self-sufficient in energy, that it looks after its farmers, beef, milk and lamb, and the UK can leave the EU but Ireland, as an island, is firmly staying.  That is the final thing we want the Government to say, whether that be the current Government or any that may succeed them.  <br/><br/>In regard to whether we would be prepared to pay tariffs if there were an all-island status, let us look at the market for milk.  The UK is about 65% self-sufficient in milk.  However, two-thirds of the UK's milk exports to international countries, including Thailand in particular, are from Northern Ireland.  International trade deals have been built up over the past 20 years.  In 1995, milk commodity was trading at around &pound;1.2 billion.  Over 20 years, that has been built up to &pound;2.23 billion.  Dr. Mike Johnston, Northern Ireland director for Dairy UK, stated that in a Brexit situation, those he represents would be in competition with Europe and to hold those international markets, their product would have to be made sexier and more built into it.  A lower price may have to be taken for it because UK producers would be competing with the EU and known EU standards and would not be able to give any standard for exports from the UK.  There would be a new British standard that will not yet have been accepted by any other country.  The same situation pertains for every commodity. <br/><br/>Mr. O'Hara will confirm that we were considering the Saudi Arabia frozen beef market.  It is a big market for beef.  There is already much live shipping to Turkey.  There is not a huge problem in beef.  Intervention could be used if Britain does not want to buy our beef.  However, it should not be forgotten that Britain has always used Ireland as a bread basket and it will not be able to source the amount of beef it needs from any country but their next-door neighbour.  It will therefore be knocking on our door and looking for that beef, tariff or no tariff.  The lamb industry would fall off the top of a cliff.  Britain has half the sheep-breeding population of Europe.  It is approximately 75% self-sufficient in lamb but still exports 40% of that lamb to France.  One thousand lambs per day go from the North to the South for processing and then on for export to France.  After Brexit, to get 400 pence on the Rungis market, we would have to take a tariff of around 56%.  Farmers in this country would achieve 226 pence, a little over half of the price in the North.  Farmers here are already complaining that they are taking prices for lamb that they were taking 20 years ago.<br/><br/>I am not afraid to pay a tariff to Great Britain because while it is threatening that Ireland needs it as a market, I would say Britain needs Ireland as a source of food.  Three million people per year get food from food banks in Great Britain.  They include nurses and policemen.  From where will the UK get its food?  There is no guarantee from the British Government that in a Brexit situation they would look after food production sufficiently.  It has said it would fund agriculture for one year post-Brexit.  However, even that one year is ambiguous because it depends on the time when a claim is made.  Some politicians have said that the Common Agricultural Policy was going to end in 2020 anyway.  That is not correct.  The current CAP reform was put in place until 2025 approximately with a mid-term review in 2017 approximately.  It will be in place until 2022 or 2023 at the earliest.  There is much misrepresentation of facts and figures.<br/><br/>I am happy to answer any questions members have.  If I was mistaken in quoting any figures, I will stand corrected.  We have relied on accurate figures from different sources, notably Andersons farm business consultants, which we will give them to the committee after the meeting.</p></speech>

I was away on Oireachtas business at the time.</p><p>I have been watching the witnesses' progress ever since they appeared before our committee.  There is no doubt about the amount of work they have done and I commend them on it.  They have done an exceptional amount of detailed work.  I know Mr. Sheridan spends his time watching social media and takes any chance he gets to push forward the agenda.</p><p> There are a few things in the document with which I take issue.  I am a democrat.  I live in a democratic society.  In the democratic society in which I live, there are four provinces.  At no stage will we ever allow a province to break with the rest of the country because it votes against something.  Regardless of whether we like it - and many of us do not like it - Northern Ireland is part of the UK and the UK took a decision to leave the EU so we cannot use phrases like "opinions are not being respected" because the same would apply to Scotland, Wales or the Isle of Man.  I do not accept that and I do not accept that the witnesses have been disenfranchised at this point.  In respect of the argument made by the witnesses, particularly Mr. Sheridan who has made these arguments very well any time I have listened to him, the Good Friday Agreement is the solution to our problem.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' view on this.  In their document, they rightly point out that 1.8 million citizens in Northern Ireland can apply for and are entitled to be provided with Irish passports.  That makes them different to their counterparts in any other part of the UK and or the EU.  What we are effectively saying is that 1.8 million European citizens are being denied the right to participate fully in the European Union.  This is where the Good Friday Agreement kicks in.  We cannot have bilateral negotiations with the UK despite our several hundred years of history but we can talk under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement.  We can have arrangements under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement which we could bring forward to the EU and request that it rubber-stamp them for all intents and purposes.  I met Michel Barnier, Guy Verhofstadt and various other people when I was in Brussels.  I do not care what anybody says, there is a huge willingness to find a solution to the problems of Ireland.  We cannot have a situation post Brexit whereby beef is being sold on the world market as "northern" or "southern" Irish beef, with two different standards applying.  In such circumstances, I completely accept what the witnesses are saying to the effect that the Border must be somewhere in the Irish Sea.  There must be free travel across our 270 or 280-odd roads.  We must be able to move trucks up and down and transport milk.  Milk is going to Roscommon and then goes back to Belfast when it has been processed.  Sheep are coming from Northern Ireland to be killed.  I was going to say "executed" but "killed" is the word.  The meat is processed and sent back.  Bacon from the South goes to Northern Ireland.  When I look at my Ulster fry, which I will be looking at tomorrow morning, I am never quite sure where any of it comes from.  Our economies are totally interlinked.</p><p> There is a problem with having the Border somewhere in the Irish Sea.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' solution in this regard.  While the nationalist community and the citizens of the Republic would have very little difficulty with that, it is my view that we would have to deal very sensitively with our unionist brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland who see themselves as British.  What right have I or anybody else to tell them they are not British?</p><p> I thought the witnesses were a bit hard on the UFU.  I think it is walking a delicate political pathway in respect of trying to hold on to what it has.  In respect of the &euro;2.3 billion in financial aid between 2014 and 2020 mentioned by the witnesses, it is my firm belief that the British Government will not honour its commitments to 2020.  It is also  my firm belief that as soon as the negotiations begin, the British Government will take all funding off the table because it is its view that the UK is leaving.  I am putting a scenario to the witnesses that we should go forward as the economic island of Ireland, about which Mr. Sheridan spoke about a few moments ago.  However, that would mean that the European aid provided to the farming community in the South would be matched by the British Exchequer in Northern Ireland.  In other words, there would no difference in the supports available to the farming community because I think it drives most economies in this country.  If a farmer is getting subvention for cattle in the South, an equal subvention must come from Westminster for farmers in Northern Ireland so that farmers are playing on the same pitch and with the same supports and problems.  Standards on the island of Ireland would have to be maintained to the EU standard, or higher if the British come in with a higher standard.  I would be terribly afraid of what Mr. Sheridan spoke about, namely, the importation of cheap beef, bleached chicken and lamb from New Zealand, although I am not knocking its standards.  I would be afraid of those things.  We must hold the standard and in holding that standard, we must be sure that the farming communities on both sides of the Border have the same supports.</p><p> I would dearly like us to steer away from the notion that we have disenfranchised people in Northern Ireland in some way or that their views are not being respected.  Unfortunately, when people live in a democracy, they do not always get what they want and certainly Northern Ireland did not get what it wanted from Brexit.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

The witnesses' presentation was excellent, very clear and precise.  Obviously, I am very concerned and really pick up on the anxieties.  It is very scary - terrifying actually - particularly when I hear that Westminster is out of its depth and does not know what is going on or how to deal with it.  That really concerns me.  The fact that I am not sure that Northern Ireland is a priority is very concerning.  I do not think it will be top of the British Government's priorities.  I think Northern Ireland - particularly in terms of Cushendall, Cushendun, north Antrim and Rathlin Island - is probably one of the beautiful parts of this country.  The tourism industry was really devastated during the conflict.  I used to travel up to my father's home in the North with my family.  I could not believe there was no tourism there back then.  One could understand why this was the case in light of the conflict but it started to come back and I see that now.  I go back up there all the time and I see the southern-registered cars, in particular, and also cars with British registrations.  There is no doubt that it has picked up.  My concern is that this would be impacted upon again.  Coming from a farming background with family in Northern Ireland, the impact would, from a farming perspective, be devastating.</p> <p>  I have a very simple question.  I know we talk about special status for the island of Ireland.  Recently, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government spoke about working towards a united Ireland in one of his campaign speeches.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  Would it be beneficial?  I know that when we are looking at special status for Northern Ireland, it will be very complicated.  In addition, I understand that if we ever did work towards a united Ireland, that would also be very complicated bearing in mind the fact that the Good Friday Agreement is very important and plays a huge role.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on working towards a united Ireland?  Would it help in any way or be beneficial?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#G00400"><p>They are very quick and concise observations more than anything else.  While we all agree with the sentiment relating to special status, we must concede that one of the key components must be the retention of our membership of the Single Market.  As has already been stated, there are different views regarding the common travel area and how that will work out.  In the context of the economics of it, if we lose that, then t&aacute;imid i bponc and we will be in big trouble.</p> <p>  It is not very often that I disagree with Senator Craughwell but I believe that we have been disenfranchised.</p><p>The reason we have been disenfranchised is, ironically given the point he made, the Good Friday Agreement.  When people both in the North and the South endorsed the Agreement overwhelmingly, it was agreed and accepted that there would be no change in the constitutional arrangements, unless it was consented to by the people.  The people who had an opportunity to vote in the referendum voted to remain within the European Union.  The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament has indicated that, in its view, the Good Friday Agreement will have to be altered as a result of the Brexit vote.  Therefore, we have been impacted on uniquely and it is because of the Agreement that Northern Ireland is not like Scotland, England or Wales.  The primacy of the Agreement, North and South, means that we are being disenfranchised and the constitutional status is being altered.  Therefore, the Agreement is being subverted against our will.  I do not necessarily want to put the organisation on political ground because I know that it tries to avoid it.  However, for me, the most logical special status would involve an outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, that is, reunification, which would allow us all to retain our place within the European Union.  That is not to simplify the issue, but nevertheless it should be part and parcel of moving forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sheridan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#H00300"><p>I will answer Senator Craughwell and in calling him Gerry I am not being formal.  That is just the way we are, unless he insists otherwise.  I thank him very much for his kind comments.  </p> <p>  I feel as if I have been disenfranchised.  First and foremost, when the referendum campaign started, we were told that &pound;18 billion was the sum that was going to the European Union from Westminster.  Whereas those in England did not quite get a buck for their pound, in the North we received approximately &pound;1.50 or &pound;1.60 for every &pound;1 put in.</p> <p>  For the one debate held in the North, organised by the Ulster Farmers Union, UFU, on agriculture, two people were asked over: the former Secretary of State, Mr. Owen Paterson, and a former president of the National Farmers Union, NFU, Sir Peter Kendall.  On Brexit, the encompassing body of the NFU for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took the attitude that the United Kingdom should remain.  Because of politics and its lobby which it had to protect, UFU sat on the fence on the issue.  I asked Sir Peter Kendell to please tell us the truth.  The former Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, said that after everything was taken off, &pound;6.3 billion was the net cost to Westminster of its contribution to the European Union and that &pound;300 million was the sum that went to the agriculture sector.  There was the figure of &pound;350 million a week on the famous red bus which was multiplied by 52 weeks to give &pound;18 billion, but it was an absolute and outright lie and a misrepresentation.  For that and many other similar reasons, I feel as if I was disenfranchised.</p> <p>  I am sorry for others such as those in Scotland who do not have a Holy Thursday agreement.  However, I am well aware of the Good Friday Agreement which was made and lodged in the Hague.  It was made following years of thought.  It was not a knee-jerk reaction in a referendum.  For that reason, I do not believe I am wrong in saying I was disenfranchised.  We should not forget that Ireland gave up its claim to the North in the Agreement and that Britain stated the North was entitled to self-determination.  It gave those of us in the North that right.  That is another aspect that has to be looked at.</p> <p>  I chair the National Beef Association in the North of Ireland.  The association has thousands of members throughout Britain and hundreds in the North.  I never asked to be put in this position, but I am in it now and have a responsibility to stand up and speak from the heart and about what my head sees in the future for my family, community and country which I love with a passion.  I have to speak my mind think the UFU feels the same.  There is a responsibility on it to look after its members first, regardless of its lobby.  It is rather disconcerting to see it sitting on the fence and stating it wants things to stay the way they are when it knew from the start they could not.  That is my retort to Gerry.</p></speech>

We come from rural Leitrim, a beautiful place.  It has always been involved in different conflicts.  In my house a man was hanged for treason because he had taken in people who were part of the Spanish Armada.  There is the home place of Se&aacute;n MacDermott and the Border along which roads were blown up.  There are 277 Border crossings.  This is the real thing.  Having talked to farmers, if there is a hard border, a real farmer will have to travel 11 miles to get to another part of his or her farm.  There are houses that straddle both sides of the Border.<br/><br/>Tourism Ireland is a good example to use to showcase the benefits of an all-island economy.  Special status is the only way to go to solve the problems I see.  There is a simple but important point.  If an American tourist has a visa to enter the European Union, will he or she look for a second to cross the Border? <br/><br/>In July last year the car hire companies came together and added an extra &euro;40 to the cost of car hire to travel across the Border into the North of Ireland.  That is fact.  They are looking at taking the money now.  That is an extra cost to the tourist to Ireland.<br/><br/>Senator Frances Black is doing brilliant work.  From a tourism point of view, she is right: having a hard border would make a major difference.  We are developing an all-island network and will give the details to the Seanad.  It is called <i>Irish.network</i>and is a 32-county network.  It is about business and community regeneration.  Given what we see happening on the ground, it has to come from the people up.  It does not matter where we stand in political or communiy terms.  That is why Border communities are working well together.  We meet Deputies from different parties and are trying to bring the project along on an all-island, all-party basis and it is working.  Listening to us, special status would be major, but the Border needs to be extended to the Irish Sea.  That is the only way forward.</p></speech>

I also thank the Seanad for its invitation and, in particular, taking the time to look at what is a crucial issue - Brexit.  In preparation for this meeting I discovered that Senator Mark Daly had done some work on the issue.  There are other committees working on it, including the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the British-Irish committee which we hope to meet in the future.</p><p>While we do not quite know how the committee system operates here, we urge arrival at some cross-committee or cross-party consensus on gaining special status and what it might actually mean.  As we state in our document, it is fundamental that dialogue open up between the Governments in Dublin, Belfast and London.  If that tripartite could travel to Brussels with an agreement on the status we are seeking, it could be delivered.  That is the message we want to leave the Seanad with today.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I am speaking in a personal capacity, having spent a long time working on the issue of reconciliation and community relations in Northern Ireland.  That is the basis on which I have tried to frame my remarks.  I also teach politics in the university, so I have an interest in the consequences and the procedure as to how we go forward.  I produced a very long paper of which the second half is essentially irrelevant  because it just provides background material.  The committee will be glad to know that I will speak to the first part only.  I will speak to the first part and then perhaps read a little bit of it, because it is something worth reading into.</p> <p>  The first thing to observe is that we have arrived at the crisis in Northern Ireland with almost no preparation.  The issues have emerged after Brexit.  Even in the context of the referendum itself, the issues of Northern Ireland largely surfaced through being raised by the Taoiseach and former Prime Ministers.  Inside Northern Ireland it was remarkably quiet.  The turnout figure was very low at 62%.  The lowest turnouts anywhere in the UK were in the constituencies of Belfast West and Foyle.  It was in areas that voted to remain that people were least likely to vote.  It has subsequently turned into more of an issue and we have caught up with it.  That is a problem because the preparation has been very limited.  </p> <p>  The second thing to note is that this issues hits across the pivotal institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not need to labour the point that the Agreement has been the central development in Irish-British relationships over the last 50 years and has framed Northern Irish politics since then.  I have written in my submission that "Reconciliation replaced conflict, dialogue and partnership replaced conflict and enmity and mutual accommodation replaced mutual antagonism".  These have been huge, historic shifts and I believe they were understood to be historic in Ireland.  The Governments were central to the Agreement and the reason that Brexit matters so much is that anything which divides the purposes of the British and Irish Governments is very serious for Northern Ireland, perhaps even more serious than the people of Northern Ireland take it to be.  It is also, perhaps, more serious than the people of the United Kingdom take it to be. </p> <p>  The Governments framed these talks.  That is the truth of the matter.  The Anglo-Irish agreement process, the framework documents, the negotiation behind these things, the sponsorship of the talks, the mediation in crisis and so on were all sponsored through inter-Governmental partnership, which was a critical element of the talks.  There were built on a series of international principles, human rights not being the least of these, but which included treating citizens of the two countries equally within both, the opening of borders and freedom of movement.  These principles may have been implicit or explicit but they were nevertheless there.  </p> <p>  I have identified at least six dimensions of inter-Governmental issues which seem to be critical and explicit in the Agreement.  These dimensions are: the question of citizenship and how it is defined; questions of consent on the Border and of identity and constitutional nationalism; changes to the Irish Constitution; the parity of esteem doctrine which says that Britishness and Irishness will be treated with parity of esteem; the North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South bodies which relate to it; and the British-Irish Council.  It strikes me that this is not just a Northern Irish issue but an inter-Governmental issue and that the Good Friday Agreement is touched by anything which changes those things.  </p> <p>  While we have had continuous devolution in theory since 2007, we have had at least eight mini-breakdowns all of which have required the mediation of the Governments working together in order to put the Assembly together again in some form or other.  The framework of the Good Friday Agreement was that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  We run the risk that when some things become not agreed, everything becomes not agreed again.  It all unravels.</p> <p>  This is where I might read some of my submission.  I tried to frame my remarks around three questions.  The first was whether any party to the Good Friday Agreement have any formal intention of abandoning it.  My view is that it seems certain that for the vast majority of voters, and the Government, in the UK, the decision by the UK to leave the European Union was not taken with any intention of breaking or abandoning the Good Friday Agreement.  In some ways this highlights a difference between the received view of the Good Friday Agreement in Great Britain as a largely successful pragmatic compromise specific to Northern Ireland and that on the island of Ireland, where it is understood as a dramatic and historic exercise in constitutional and political innovation between two states, achieved through very delicate compromises and balances.  Even the Good Friday Agreement&rsquo;s detractors on the island of Ireland, and there are many, acknowledge its significance.</p> <p>  For voters and Government in the UK, any impact on Ireland is unintended collateral, but not malicious.  We may therefore have to reckon with the fact that the potential implications of the decision to leave the EU for the Good Friday Agreement and hence of Ireland North and South are not fully understood or acknowledged in the UK itself.  If this is true, this would mean that there has been no preparation for the extreme delicacy and attention to detail required to renegotiate its fragile balances within a short timeframe.  More importantly, the assumption in the UK is that the Good Friday Agreement has to be altered to bring it into line with the prior order issue of Brexit.</p><p>The assumption in many parts of Ireland is that Brexit must be designed in such a way as to protect the existing commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  This mindset difference is, in and of itself, a significant challenge.  All of this is a significant challenge to any concept of reconciliation, which remains the purpose, core and at the heart of what the Agreement was to deliver.</p><p> Does the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU create significant problems and challenges for the structures and assumptions on which the Good Friday Agreement is built?  The answer is "Yes".  The Agreement was only possible because nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  In this context, unilateral action by one signatory inevitably has consequences for the overall ecological balance and sustainability of the entire deal.  I have outlined four levels at which I see these challenges arising.  The first is at the tacit and implicit level.  In terms of the underlying assumptions, unilateral action by one party in a formal partnership has inevitable consequences for other parties.  When that party is a government, inevitably, those shocks are greater.</p><p> Second, it is clear that the sense of shock and concern about the Good Friday Agreement is not equally recognised even by those who opposed or supported Brexit.  Those who support Brexit see that as illegitimate interference in a sovereign decision, with the potential that they would be resented.  Those who hold their Irish citizenship as their primary identity or who value the international partnership of the Agreement have exhibited shock, confusion, anger and grief.  Above all, there is an underlying feeling of betrayal in that commitments made had been broken without a second thought, and with indifference to the consequences for peace and the sacrifices that were made to get us this far.  In a divided society, the most important aspect is that these very different emotional reactions polarise and divide, with huge consequences.</p><p> Third, at institutional level, the Good Friday Agreement was above all a new compact on how Britishness and Irishness would relate in Northern Ireland, in Ireland and between these islands.  The institution of physical borders, trade borders and cultural borders of any sort is an unanticipated development of huge implications.  Given that the Border is now caught up in global economic and political questions, it may not be possible to make accommodations which are first and foremost designed to meet local requirements.</p><p> That in turn raises the unique citizenship arrangements in Northern Ireland.  The Agreement establishes the birthright of everyone born in Northern Ireland to be British, Irish or both as they may choose, in perpetuity and aside from all questions of constitutional change.  Equal treatment and access to goods and services is guaranteed to both.  The State must act with parity of esteem to both traditions and is committed to cultural rights.  Furthermore, Ireland has a special interest in Northern Ireland and has an established State presence through a Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, office in Northern Ireland.  The President of Ireland makes informal unheralded visits to communities, institutions and events without obstruction.  The consequence is that both Britain and Ireland, and through Ireland the European Union, will have an enduring and unique shared interest in the people and territory of Northern Ireland that makes it distinct, and only operable through co-operation and mutuality.</p><p> The Good Friday Agreement states that "the functioning of the Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council are so closely inter-related that the success of each depends on that of the other".  Unsurprisingly, the North-South Ministerial Council was deigned to "consider the European Union dimension of relevant matters, including the implementation of EU policies and programmes and proposals under consideration in the EU framework.  Arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings".</p><p> Exactly what happens now is unclear.  What is certain is that without the agreed North-South Ministerial Council and cross-Border bodies funcitioning there is no constitutional basis for the Assembly to function.  At its most acute, North-South co-operation has been critical in justice, policing and security.  The Patten commission explicitly promoted co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Fresh Start agreement set up a joint task force, and there are regular cross-Border actions against crime, including terrorism and smuggling.  Those are some of the constitutional issues.</p><p> With regard to principles, the European Union is built on a number of core assumptions which might be held to be implicit in the Good Friday Agreement and its development.  Some of them are explicit such as the human rights charter.  In broad terms, these can be characterised as human rights, the four freedoms, and equality of opportunity.  Given that they are implicit rather than explicit, the way in which they interact can be complex, but there can be little doubt that any fundamental derogation from any of them</p><p>threatens the balance of a divided society.</p><p> Technically, the European convention is an instrument of the Council of Europe, not the European Union.  Nonetheless, any threat to unilaterally alter the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the convention and the court would have significant potential ramifications for the Good Friday Agreement where it is a core element in the construction of the institutions.  The four freedoms are not explicitly addressed in the Good Friday Agreement.  However, it could be argued that their spirit - freedom of movement for labour, capital goods and services - have been the central practical outworking of the Agreement in Ireland.  Any change to those freedoms will alter the lived experience of post-Agreement Ireland in a fundamental way, challenging the Agreement less at the level of its technical formulation than at the level of lived experience.</p><p> That takes me to the social and economic level.  The Agreement has had a profound effect on the social and economic life of Ireland, North and South.  Any unintended consequences of Brexit will therefore impact not only on the relationships of sovereign states but on the quality of life of communities and families and on the economic future of the island.  While economic and business relationships, including cross-Border enterprises, thriving trade and extensive infrastructure, have taken most of the attention, the social implications for cross-Border commuters, cross-Border families and communities rejoined since the Agreement through programmes such as PEACE and INTERREG should not be overlooked.  In addition, any hard land border between the UK and the EU will be placed precisely where the costs of these changes will be greatest and where resistance is most deep rooted and determined.  The geography of the Brexit referendum in Northern Ireland matters, posing the question of how any border could be imposed, who would impose it, how tariffs are to be collected and monitored and how immigration is to be controlled.</p><p> The search for solutions to these problems is urgent, but it is likely to be time consuming and politically contentious.  Furthermore, there is no agreed Northern Ireland position on these matters and, in so far as they touch on issues of identity and constitution, there is unlikely to be one.  The fact that the EU has established that these issues are prior to any discussion of trade must be correct, but the potential for this to cause growing frustration in the UK and among those supportive of Brexit in Northern Ireland should not be underestimated. Furthermore, any prospect that as a result the UK would crash out of the EU is potentially disastrous for Ireland in the context where these issues still are not addressed and there is growing recrimination.</p><p> Some steps to be taken suggest themselves in a practical way.  The two most serious threats to peace in every divided society and therefore in Northern Ireland are fundamental political uncertainty, which is filled by people taking action, and significant unilateral action in the face of partnership where people believe that it is broken.  Brexit raises both of those issues in an unexpectedly vivid form.  It is therefore incumbent on all parties to move past the "Keep calm and carry on" phased to the next phase which my be characterised as "Let us now make plans to address these issues before they become unmanageable".  Failure to do that will leave both uncertainty and mutual recrimination in terms of partnership in place, with the potential for it to fester.</p><p> By raising the question of Ireland as a prior order issue, the EU should make clear that its priority regarding Ireland is sustaining and growing reconciliation.  This could potentially become a shared goal of negotiations if the United Kingdom could also be encouraged to see sharing reconciliation in Ireland as the goal of negotiations rather than simply a question of protecting national trade interests.  If reconciliation is the goal, and the protection of reconciliation in Northern Ireland, North and South and between these islands requires flexibility and unique arrangements, then both sides should be encouraged to signal that these will be explored in-depth.  The substance of the negotiations should be to identify the potential incompatibilities between the existing treaties and agreements and Brexit; and to establish an agenda for resolving these issues, which includes the negotiators, the Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p><p> There is no consensus in Northern Ireland about Brexit.  Any attempt to force one in advance is likely to result in lowest common denominator minimalist agreements leaving all of the contentious issues unaddressed.  Northern Ireland must be present in its plurality in the negotiations.  The alternative is that any deal will have to be imposed with considerable long-term consequences.  The existing frameworks of the Agreement - the North-South bodies, the British-Irish Council and the intergovernmental conference - could be focused on problem solving around this issue.  There is also an urgent need for renewed civic voice for solution finding in this situation.</p><p>One of the key issues to be addressed is the nature of the Border and its management.  There is no point anymore in simply saying the Border could run down the Irish Sea or it could be hard or it could be soft; we need to get down to that discussion.  The other key issues are the future competences of the three strands within the Good Friday Agreement and their interlockingness because those matter.  These are citizenship rights and equality issues that underpin the Good Friday Agreement and which probably need to be reiterated in some form; trade and economic relationships; and the ongoing support for reconciliation, including three areas which seem to still be the past, present and future with the frameworks of dealing with the past, the fresh start and a shared future, in other words, building for a different future.</p></speech>

Dr. Morrow talks of the special status for Northern Ireland, but I did not get his opening remarks.  Many have raised the issue.  Does the Good Friday Agreement have to be renegotiated in full or in part as a result of Brexit?  With regard to the special status of Northern Ireland, we have brought it up here on previous occasions, and I will repeat again what has been said about the precedent.  Has Dr. Morrow done any research into the special status of East Germany, and its citizens, which had special status within the EU because of its unique relationship with West Germany, which was in the European Economic Community at the time?  We should look to the precedent of Cyprus and northern Cyprus, which is currently under negotiations between the UN, the EU and - ironically - Britain with regard to Cypriot reunification.  Consider those citizens in northern Cyprus who are treated as EU citizens even through they live in the part of Cyprus not under the control of the government of southern Cyprus.  They are citizens of an EU country, which is the whole of Cyprus.  Has Dr. Morrow researched the precedents for all of that in respect of citizenship and how Northern Ireland changed people's ability to be Irish and British citizens or both and how post-Brexit they are going to be EU citizens or non-EU citizens?  In making the case for the special status of Northern Ireland and most important the citizens of Northern Ireland this committee must give recommendations using precedents or other examples that have already been set.</p></speech>

I have a question that may stray into territory in which our esteemed colleague Senator McDowell would have much expertise.  The Good Friday Agreement is enshrined in international law and it has standing within international law.  Is there an option for the Government to challenge any elements of an agreement that would threaten, or be in contravention of, the Good Friday Agreement in international law?  Would Dr. Morrow see potential there in a doomsday scenario if we needed to do that?  In a hierarchy of rights would the Good Friday Agreement take precedence over a potential settlement that might arise in Mr. Michel Barnier's negotiations?</p></speech>

Senator O'Reilly has raised an interesting point.  It is one I have tried to tease out in various fora regarding the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and the unilateral move from the British side that - to quote the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee - "altered" the Good Friday Agreement.  I may be on to a loser here, since I have not heard Senator McDowell express an opinion on this, but given the legal status of it should there be cause for concern that this unilateral move does not just potentially alter the Good Friday Agreement but seeks, in a way, to trump or precede the votes taken North and South?  Does the Irish State have cause for concern that elements of the Good Friday Agreement, of which it is co-guarantor and which people have endorsed through referenda, is under threat of alteration?  Is there merit within that argument?  Dr. Morrow has said in his paper that an arrangement almost exists already within the Good Friday Agreement for special status.  This may be arguable within a political context but within the broader economic and social context I am not so sure that I am convinced of that just yet.  Does a referendum in Britain effectively trump a referendum that was held here on the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

How high up are the topics of the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland and the old Irish scenario in Theresa May's English priority list for this situation? It is as if they are making things up as they go along.  The Brexit referendum result had not been perceived and no thought had been put in to it prior to the referendum taking place.  The UK has now inherited a quagmire of potential problems, issues and scenarios going forward with the Brexit negotiations.  I believe that if there was a one to one with Theresa May one would hear a lot of points, problems and issues before the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland or Ireland gets a mention.  What is Dr. Morrow's opinion on this? From the UK's perspective, I believe that at the moment a tripartite or even sitting down to renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement is a non-runner.  Ireland is negotiating as one of 27 member states and this is the end of the story.  We are not allowed to go and negotiate individually.  Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom's negotiations so what input would the North have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#M00700"><p>I wanted to make one further brief point.  An element of the Good Friday Agreement agrees that there would be no change in the constitutional status unless it is consented to by the people.  Does Brexit poses a threat to the constitutional arrangements that exist under the Good Friday Agreement if it is altered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.619" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#M00800"><p>Since I am coming under a bit of pressure to say something I should throw in a couple of my own thoughts and maybe Dr. Morrow would address them.</p> <p>  The question of the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement is primacy over what.  At the moment it has the status of an international treaty, it is registered in the UN and is accepted in The Hague, the EU has endorsed it and so on.  It has that status but we are now dealing with an exercise by the UK of a right that was given under the Lisbon treaty to opt out of the European Union.  Ireland was party to that treaty also.  We agreed that every member state had the right to leave.  We did not say to the United Kingdom: "Sorry, you do not have a right to leave unless you get our consent."  There is a complexity in that regard.</p> <p>  The second interesting point is the Good Friday Agreement acknowledges that both Governments recognise it is the right of a majority of people in Northern Ireland to determine one question only; whether the North remains in the UK or - with a single binary choice - becomes part of a united Ireland.  It never said that Northern Ireland has the right to join the United States of America or to go in or out of the European Union.  The choice that is guaranteed to the people of Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement is, as I see it, never a right for them to say they are sick of the European Union and they are getting out or that they want to join with Iceland or Scotland or whatever.  It is a binary choice.</p><p>It is not an absolute constitutional autonomy which is given to them.</p><p> We have to remember that Mrs. Theresa May was a lukewarm supporter of the remain campaign.  The previous Prime Minister resigned when he lost the referendum.  Mrs. May formed a Government to implement the people's wishes in Britain.  We cannot regard her as the person who has torn up the Good Friday Agreement.  I think it is a negative view of her and that the pro-Brexit lobby was entirely indifferent to and negligent about the Irish issue.  She was not part of it.  She is now trying to pick up the pieces and to keep the Conservative coalition together until she gets her overall majority, in which case she will have a bit more elbow-room and a mandate to reach compromises.  As I see it - just looking at the good things at the moment - the maintenance of the Good Friday Agreement is stated to be a British priority.  It is also stated to be an EU and an Irish priority.  We should not get up in a heap and say that destroying it is somebody's priority.</p></speech>

The second is that our aim is to reconcile the inevitable Brexit with the Good Friday Agreement by having as soft an impact as us possible on that agreement and its underlying values, as mentioned in Dr. Morrow's papers.  I hope I am not being too controversial.</p></speech>

I totally agree that the key issues regarding the Agreement must include the nature of the Border, its management and the future competences of the three strands within the Agreement - citizenship, rights and equality.  The latter are so important, as are trade, economic relations and support for reconciliation.  In Dr. Morrow's experience, what is the energy from Westminster and what is the energy from the Irish Government?  Coming back to the priority, because this is so important, particularly for Ireland in general, what is Dr. Morrow's experience of it?  In a perfect situation, what does he feel should really be focused on today?  What are the beginning stages?  What should be worked on at present?  What is the timescale in all of that?  We do not have much time, which is a bit worrying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Duncan Morrow" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#N00600"><p>I hope I answer all the questions.  If I miss one, Senators can remind me.  In some ways, the questions run through each other.</p> <p>  The risk to the Agreement structure is, in my view, not that anybody has intended to break it - the Senator is right and everybody is very aware of it - but that it seems to be inversely proportional to the problem.  In that context, I go back to a children's game, Jenga, whereby if one pulls out one strut from somewhere in the middle of the stack, the whole lot collapses on the table.  That is my fear.  It is not on the level that anybody has a plan; it is that, by pulling this out, one sets off a dynamic.</p> <p>  On the energies and priorities, it is crystal clear that it was not a priority for London.  The core priority is renegotiating the relationship with Brussels, and the immigration and trade issues that arise from that are London's absolute priority.  The difficulty is that the Northern Ireland settlement was based on a totally different principle.  The Ireland settlement was based on the principle that getting control over borders was done through international co-operation, not by putting up big fences.  This principle is to get control over borders by putting up big fences.  That would really be running a coach and four through the whole structure of what the Good Friday Agreement is about.  That is what we are wrestling with here.  How do we actually deal with that?</p> <p>  Senator Mark Daly asked if the Agreement has to be renegotiated.  It is very difficult to put the challenge we face in particular terms.  However, if we wish to retain the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement, we are going to have to do much detailed negotiation about how those principles are adjusted for Brexit.  If we do not do the detailed negotiation about those things, then Brexit will unravel the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the problem.  It is urgent that we sit round a table and start dealing with these matters in detail.  The John Hume doctrine of all those years ago was that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  All those strands and different dimensions were in an overall package.  Nobody got everything that he or she wanted, but everybody got enough to allow matters to move forward.  If the Border is taken out of the equation, it strikes me that all the other balances are unpicked.  I am asked to speak about reconciliation here.  If one wants to protect it, we need to really look at this because the potential for creating much offence-giving resentment on either side of this is pretty large.</p> <p>  Somebody talked about the differing energies in the different capitals.  One of the most striking things to me personally, as I go around the North, is the difference in energy between nationalists and unionists, or between remainers and leavers.  Many people who are instinctively unionist seem to think that we just need to get on with this, move ahead and get it done.  On the other side are the people who really see this as the difficulty it is and are alarmed about what it means in practice - potentially a hard Border and so on.</p> <p>  To go back to the geography of it, the hard Border seems to me to be a fiction in practice, unless somebody is going to put in place large fences and do something about imposing it, in which case we do not have either a hard or soft Border but, rather, a theoretical frontier that is a non-reality.  I do not know what the context of that is - I am starting to think of a lawless space in the middle of this island - but the consequence is something to wrestle with, or else one can go back to saying that we will have a hard Border.  We have to assume that everybody in the places where the hard Border is imposed will like that and will not seek to resist it.  I think that is a difficult proposition in light of our history.</p> <p>  It is not about being alarmist; it is about getting past the nicety of staying calm and starting to really identify the very specific practical problems which have to be looked at here, which is why I said there are five things.  The reason I have not come up with a proposal on them is that everything we learned about negotiation here is that one names the heads of agreement and then sits round the frames and tries to fill them in such a way that one can accommodate people in a meaningful way.  I do not know whether London has the time, energy or effort to do it.  It certainly is not an attack on Mrs. May or saying that she has an agenda to break this down.  The consequences of neglect for us are that dynamics start to emerge which, for example, make the assembly in the North and the North-South bodies non-viable and raise various other aspects of the Border question.  That starts to amount to a serious set of issues.</p> <p>  Does the Agreement have to be renegotiated?  It is probably not the proper term, but we have to talk about how the Agreement is read into the current circumstances, and that will look very like negotiation.  I do not know whether there has to be another signatory on the other end.  I am certainly not proposing that language of renegotiation but, to be clear, we need to look at that.</p><p>That might be something that needs to be done.  That question needs to be looked at in detail and we need to ask whether it can be done within the framework of the existing agreements or not.  If it can, it should be; and if it cannot, it needs to be acknowledged and we need to move on one way or the other.  That would be an important piece of work to do.  Can the Good Friday Agreement and its principles be retained within the current frameworks after Brexit or not?  I have not done that work.</p><p> While I am open to contradiction here, to my knowledge the citizenship arrangements in the Good Friday Agreement are globally unique.  We have the most open citizenship arrangement anywhere in the world as far as I know.  The formulation of it is that it is the birth right of everybody born in Northern Ireland to be British, Irish or both as they may choose.  In other words we can shift between them and furthermore that would be maintained in any further jurisdiction.  There is an ongoing inter-penetration of Britishness and Irishness in Northern Ireland which will not stop and which is territorially defined by the Six Counties.  That means it is special.  I do not know what the language is.  Maybe we have to find another language that is not special.  That citizenship arrangement does not apply to any other territory on the island of Ireland or the island of Great Britain.  That makes it different.  There is also the right to shift which Ireland got established through the negotiations such that if Northern Ireland becomes part of Ireland it will be integrated immediately as a member of the European Union.  That also makes it unique.</p><p> It strikes me that to a certain extent we are dancing on the head of a pin about the specialness issue.  We can start to talk about where it is special and where is it not special, but it is certainly different.  That is my starting point.  It does not really help in a divided society to try to find solutions that do not take account of that difference.  The obvious alternative is to have a referendum and have a straightforward discussion on the Constitution one way or another, but that will still not solve the issue of this inter-penetration.</p><p> On the specialness of this, I am stuck between my wish and my clarity that this has to be done if one wants a way out of it, and my - if not despair - certainly concern that it is not a priority.  So I do not know if it is just a case that nothing will go or whether that then turns into a slow car crash.  However, the previous safety net of working on reconciliation, joint institutions and the governments resolving problems when they reached a certain level of escalation are no longer certain to me, as someone living in the North.  That creates uncertainty.  Uncertainty in ethnically divided societies is the biggest single factor that drives people into polarity.  The second one is the loss of trust between the key partners; that is the unilateralism one.</p><p> Structurally, looking at this strictly academically, both of those conditions now apply; we have uncertainty and we have a degree of difference because, as the Senator said, Ireland is not even negotiating its own deal but is negotiating it through the European Union.  We have a degree of unilateralism and resentment on both sides.  I am sure all members of the committee watched the British reaction to Mr. Juncker's speech, which was pretty negative in suggesting that this will become a complicated and difficult negotiation.</p><p> I am simply saying we are special and we need attention.  While Northern Ireland is not the United Kingdom's priority, one of its priorities for the past 50 years has been not to get bogged down in Northern Ireland.  We are heading to a place where we may end up getting bogged down in Northern Ireland.  It is incumbent on me to say that.  We need to put in place something to deal with that at the level of seriousness it had.  I do not think we are manufacturing this.  We are actually saying that we ought to do this now because otherwise it will take far longer than it needs to.</p><p> On the status issue, as Senator McDowell said, it is not clear that there is a simple legal challenge there.  There are many different complex legal Acts, the Lisbon treaty being one.  The United Kingdom Supreme Court determined that Brexit could proceed, but it is quite possible that as the negotiations come forward there are certain kinds of Brexit that actually contradict all of those laws and make it impossible.  I think we are still stuck within a kind of a case-law situation and we do not know.</p></speech>

Nevertheless we know legal issues are certainly engaged.  How that happens will depend on the type of Brexit.</p> <p>  Ireland is now upfront; the European Union has said it is upfront.  After the election we will need to see what negotiating position the United Kingdom takes and what its approach to this will be.  If it accepts that Ireland is upfront, much of this may become possible to deal with it.  If the United Kingdom rejects that, then paradoxically the Northern Ireland issue will move up the agenda rather than go down the agenda, but it will do so on an emotional basis and it will become more complicated.  It may be that cool heads will prevail and we will start to move on trying to get some detail on this.</p> <p>  However, if we get the alternative scenario where two years into the process there is no budget deal and we are facing the crash-out doomsday scenario, then Northern Ireland really is in the middle of quite a difficult situation because it is about imposing hard borders where there is no agreement.  It is about a series of divisions inside Northern Ireland which are reopening.  Those are significant for all of us because we know what that can mean.  I am not here wishing it, threatening it or even suggesting it is inevitable.  However, I am saying that we know it is possible and we need to do everything we can to ensure we are going in the still direction that we have.</p></speech>

As a committee, we are anxious to hear what solutions, if any, she has to offer.  Many other witnesses have mentioned money.  We hope Ms McIntyre has lots of answers.</p><p>Before we begin, Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.  </p><p>I now invite Ms McIntyre to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Mr. John Greer, director with responsibility for assessing applications and monitoring projects.  I hope that he will get an opportunity later to outline some details of the funded projects and their activities at this time.  We always welcome the opportunity to report on the progress and impact of our cross-border EU funding programmes, PEACE IV and INTERREG VA, which are worth &euro;0.5 billion and will run until 2022.  It is a good news story in terms of these programmes.  I am sure Members are familiar with them.  In line with the topic to be addressed here today, I will confine my comments to the context of those EU funding programmes.</p> <p>  It is important to mention at the outset the significance the EU funding has had in the region over the last 20 years.  Funding has played a crucial role in addressing social, economic and cross-border challenges and cannot be underestimated.  The value alone of the funding does not reflect the impact it has had.  The impact of Brexit and possible loss of funding is a matter of great concern to many hundreds of thousands of people who are directly and indirectly benefitting from the PEACE and INTERREG programmes across the region.  It is an issue that has come up many times in conversation over the last few months.  I draw the attention of Members to annex 1 attached to my statement which provides some historic overview, including a number of the most significant benefits from both programmes.</p> <p>  I would like now to briefly outline a number of the challenges that we have identified in relation to managing the EU funding in the region.  The most significant challenge we face is the uncertainty surrounding future funding, post-2022, when the UK leaves the EU.  However, with regard to current funding programmes, we have also identified some practical challenges over the next few years.  The funding for the current programmes has been, as much as possible, Brexit-proofed in relation to the UK's share of the funding within the programmes.  This was provided by way of an assurance from the Treasury in October last.  All projects that are approved before an exit date will have their funding assured.  We are in the business of ensuring that as many projects as possible will be funded before that time.  The practical implications of the UK leaving the EU on the activity delivered by the projects is as yet uncertain but we will continue to monitor that into the future.  We will be running a series of evaluations and engagements with projects and stakeholders to ensure that the activity they have planned to deliver and are undertaking is not hindered in any way at the time of Brexit.  These stakeholders also had plans and ambitions for future activity post the funding of their projects and we will also be looking at the how Brexit might impact in that regard.</p> <p>  The European Commission undertook a research project across all European borders to gather evidence relating to funding of cross-border programmes.  It identified 37 common obstacles, which Members will be pleased to hear I do not intend to list now, summarised into four key areas.  In terms of what could help address some of those obstacles, the research recommended that the best way of overcoming the obstacles that would have the most productive impact in the region was in the areas of competitiveness, such as product innovation and development of cultural and industrial activities and social and human capital, such as education and training activities.  I am pleased to report that our programmes will run up to 2022, focused on those areas.  </p> <p>  Members will see from the INTERREG VA programme that it is a cross-Border programme worth &euro;283 million, comprising four core objectives in the areas of research and innovation, which is about building business industry relevant research and innovation capacity across the region on a cross-Border basis and will involve engagement with 1,400 SMEs and micro-businesses, aimed at developing their new products and processes in tradeable services.</p><p>There are environmental initiatives in the areas of protected habitats, water management and sustainable transport.  There is also a significant amount of money, &euro;63 million, in cross-Border health and social care, which will target more than 30,000 people.  <br/><br/>The PEACE IV programme is worth over &euro;270 million. I imagine that most of you are aware of the PEACE programme and its objectives.  It was the EU assistance to help address the peace and reconciliation needs of the region.  The Irish Government played a pivotal role in securing this PEACE IV programme, which we are now implementing.  <br/><br/>There are four core themes in that programme the first of which is shared education, which involves direct, sustained, curriculum-based contact between pupils and teachers from all backgrounds on a cross-Border basis with the aim of promoting good relations.  Second, &euro;37 million was allocated directly to the area of children and young people in trying to ensure that we improve the capacity of those young people to have positive and effective relationships with others from different backgrounds.  Third, shared spaces and capital involves eight capital projects with the objective of creating a more cohesive society and changing attitudes and behaviours in the area.  This also covers victims and survivors.  We have &euro;17 million allocated to this theme and it will add investment to cross-Border health and well-being services that develop proven expertise within the region.Initiatives to address local needs will be delivered directly through local councils and almost a third of the programme has been directly allocated to the local authorities across Northern Ireland and the Border region.  They all have individual plans and allocations, addressing the areas of shared spaces and services, children and young people and building positive relations.  Finally, the fourth core theme is the building of<b></b>positive relations<b></b>at a regional level.  This objective is to support groups impacted by the legacy of the conflict and this support will, we hope, be used to fund up to 20 projects at regional level. <br/><br/>There is a high level of interest in these programmes.  The INTERREG programme is about 90% committed at this stage and the letters of offer have been issued.  The PEACE programme is about 45% committed.  We are also assessing all aspects of the PEACE programme with the view to having that programme 90% to 100% committed by the end of September.<br/><br/>One possible solution to the challenges surrounding the loss of EU funding is to take every opportunity to obtain access to EU cross-Border programmes in the future.  The EU, the Irish Government and the UK Government have all put Northern Ireland and Border issues at the top of their agenda.  Each has reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  There is good will for solutions to be found and we in SEUPB are in a unique position enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  We have much experience of working at intergovernmental, regional and local level, developing programmes and looking at the needs of the region.  With regard to the EU itself, there are precedents across the Union of programmes that currently involve a non-EU country.  The committee will all have heard about Norway and Sweden.  There are also other programmes ranging from Russia to Andorra and for the accession countries, so the EU already has that facility in place.  It also has tools in place such as integrated investment tools for regional policy.  We therefore believe there are opportunities and precedents in place and consequently, if there is political will and a financial way, there are opportunities we should be seizing at this moment.<br/><br/>Some reasons non-EU countries get involved with EU countries are really quite straightforward.  For some it has to do with the geography of the border region and their wish for integrated development between the neighbouring lands.  The programmes become a valued part of the regional policy approaches and create access to centres of innovation, such as universities, which allow for exchange of knowledge.  While those precedents exist, however, I believe that Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland require a unique, bespoke solution because much of that cross-Border work has been under way for 20 years.  As we are now going into a different situation, it is important that we have our own bespoke and unique solution.  The PEACE programme was itself a unique solution because there is no other PEACE programme in the whole of Europe.  We have the precedent and we should seize that opportunity.  Most of the sectors that are going to be affected by Brexit are actually already included in PEACE and INTERREG.  We cover a wide range of sectors.  Future programmes should include the best of those aspects - all of those aspects - because one cannot have a peace programme without the harder economic aspects the INTERREG programme brings.  The programme should have the best of both to help create a Brexit bridge across that Border.  Timing is critical, however, because the European Commission is already working on its future, post-2020 programmes.  As it is also looking at the regulations and how they will be modified, timing is critical to ensure that nothing is done to those regulations or in the drafting of those future programmes that could exclude an opportunity that we may have in the future.  </p></speech>

Had work been done on cross-Border projects and funding prior to Brexit, prior to the referendum result?  In other words, was there work in train on the next programme that was then interrupted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#AA00300"><p>We had a group down here last week from Co-operation Ireland.  They were unionist community workers in the main and they argued that they have been left behind and have not benefitted in any way from the peace process or from anything else.  Is that because they or their communities have not been proactive enough or where does Ms McIntyre see the problem? I would be interested in her comments because I believe we have to bring all of the communities together, particularly as we are looking at Ireland becoming an economic area.  Everybody has to be comfortable in their skin with that notion and nobody has to feel threatened.  That might have little to do with Brexit in the short term but long-term it will have an impact on how we, as two parts of the island, jointly try to tackle the problems.</p> <p>  Second, an organisation like the SEUPB is constantly planning for the future and developing new programmes.  Has the organisation now reached a cliff edge, unsure of where it is going after 2020?  I understand that funding is guaranteed to 2020 but certainly, based on the visitors we have had here from the House of Commons and the House of Lords, there will be no money coming from Westminster towards anything unless some sort of new bilateral agreement in put in place.  Has the SEUPB just stopped dead in its tracks and said what we have right now we hold?</p></speech>

I was personally involved with the all-Ireland scouting centre at Castle Saunderson and helped those involved to prepare and fight their case to get SEUPB funding.  They were very successful.  I visited it recently and the output and product there, what it has done, is impressive.  It is an enormous facility with huge implications for community building and for young people's lives.  It is a great example of what the SEUPB does.  The whole list there is very impressive.</p> <p>  A couple of things struck me.  Did the SEUPB do much of a marketing job during the campaign on what it does?  Was there much of a focus on its work?  The organisation goes under the radar a bit and when it is received it is taken for granted.  Is there a deficit there in the marketing of the organisation's project and product in the popular sense?  Crystal-ball gazing is not in the witnesses' brief and neither they nor any of us know what is likely to happen post Brexit when it comes to replacing the organisation. Have the witnesses a view on that or on what will happen?  It will be a huge loss if the SEUPB and these kind of activities are not replaced.  </p></speech>

This is one of the key issues in respect of the PEACE IV funding.</p><p>What we are looking for is the precedent of the Norway-Sweden model, particularly a list of those funding schemes involving EU and non-EU members, which we can include in our submission.  We will continue with the PEACE funding and the Government is making a strong case on that.  We are lucky that Mr. Barnier was involved in that in his previous post and therefore understands its importance.  The scale of the INTERREG programmes - 3,552 businesses helped in the 2007 to 2013 programme - makes stark what will be lost if an alternative is not found.  The EU has challenged us to come up with an alternative and to demonstrate that Ireland is a special case.  We have to make those special cases.  The precedent is there with those cross-border agreements between an EU state and a non-EU state.  As INTERREG applies to the EU only, we therefore need to create a special purpose vehicle to replace it.  The PEACE funding is unique to Northern Ireland but there are also other unique EU and non-EU funding programmes that we might have to use as an example to replace the INTERREG programme.  </p><p> The Chair and this committee will be making recommendations but they must be very specific.  If we ask the EU to continue the INTERREG programme in Northern Ireland, it will not work.  We need to be able to say that we understand that INTERREG cannot continue but that to continue with the peace process we need to continue with INTERREG and follow the funding models and programmes that are in place elsewhere.  The witnesses are the experts on this and we need their assistance.  What are the other EU and non-EU states doing to programme and fund projects?</p></speech>

They are programmes within the INTERREG family.  There are a suite of programmes, INTERREG A, B and C.  There are transnational programmes and we have a piece of research on that which details a broad list of the programmes that exist.  We can certainly provide a written document to include some of that information.  The Norway-Sweden programme and the Swiss-Italian programmes are examples.  There are several programmes and we can provide that for the committee.</p> <p>  The way they operate is that the member state that stays within the EU get their ERDF element from the EU in the same way that any other programme does.  The part for the country that is not in the EU comes from its national budget and it is matched.  </p></speech>

A draft proposal contained in a report on Brexit by the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which I am a member, is that all current and future EU programmes, in the absence of an agreement in the alternative, would be funded by Her Majesty's Treasury.  While that is also what Ms McIntyre is talking about, in that instance we would require details on the Italian-Swiss programme, that is, the breakdown of how much the EU country contributes and how much the non-EU country contribute to the same programme.  It is important for the work of this committee that we do not talk about the theory of INTERREG continuing but how it works in practice in other countries.</p></speech>

The UK side has paid 60% of the current INTERREG programme while 40% comes from the Irish side.  The EU funds are included in each of those.  Were the UK willing to proceed with future programmes, we obviously would be seeking that it contributed the same money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.650" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#BB01100"><p>The funding issue is very important and will be a core part of the discussions.  The EU have said that Ireland must be sorted.  It would be very helpful if, in the historic example of the previous funding programme broken down on the 60:40 basis, we could arrive at a figure.  This would enable us to say that were this programme replicated post Brexit, this is what the cost would be to the Irish taxpayer, this is what the EU would contribute and this is what the British taxpayer would contribute.  That is essential to our work as we do not wish to merely state that programmes should continue.  We need hard numbers.  The EU wants hard numbers in order to be able to say to Britain, when negotiating the divorce settlement, that certain things have to continue.  If that could be supplied it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The EU budget reflects what Ireland will get out of it.  We will not be able to work out how much finance the UK might be willing to put in to match a programme until all those pieces are in place or if it will contribute anything.  It will be the UK's choice if it is going to contribute anything.  Those figures are available and we will send them to the committee.</p> <p>  We find that there is a huge interest in these programmes.  We are well oversubscribed in the areas of funding that we have delivered and to which we are currently making awards.  I do not believe that there was any issue about marketing the programmes.  </p></speech>

The Castle Saunderson project is an excellent project.  We were involved in its launch with President Michael D. Higgins a couple of years ago and we got very good coverage for that.  It is sometimes difficult to communicate the work that we do.  We work with the projects themselves to help them develop what they are doing in terms of communications and marketing and they all have a separate budget for that.  We do the marketing and communications and the projects do that as well.</p> <p>  We recently carried out a stakeholder's survey to look in to awareness of the programmes within Northern Ireland, the Border region of Ireland and in western Scotland.  Awareness is higher in the Border region than it is in Northern Ireland.  It is projects such as Castle Saunderson, the effects of which permeate through the local communities, which help generate awareness of what the EU funding is doing.  We can always do more; that is a given.  Perhaps the Senators here today would like to come and see some of the projects and help us to communicate the benefits of the work that is being done through PEACE and INTERREG.  </p></speech>

We had received a number of applications under that call.  Unfortunately for us the UK's decision to leave the European Union happened at a very early stage of the programmes.  Fortunately, it has not had a significant impact.  Interest in the programmes is phenomenal.  Typically, any call for proposals we put out receives requests for funding in excess of three or four times what we have available.  Unfortunately for the applicants, there is a high rate of attrition for those requests but it clearly demonstrates a great appetite for the work we are doing and recognition of the programme's place.</p></speech>

We are output-based, so the Commission has a set of outputs the projects have to achieve but I think we deliver far more than that.  One project we are funding under the health call is being led by the Royal National Institute of Blind People, RNIB, and is essentially connecting people who are blind in rural communities with one other.  This both provides connection for the people on the ground who are suffering blindness and provides bridges with the community groups that are acting as a conduit to put these people together.  The important point is that it has a very dramatic effect on their lives on a day-to-day basis.  It changed their lives both for the duration of the programme and for a period thereafter.</p> <p>  One of the bigger things is the projects in INTERREG that are focused on research and innovation.  These have very singular outputs looking at the number of PhDs that are produced.  Their impact is far wider than that because we are funding investments in creating superclusters round renewable energy.  They are providing opportunities to create PhD students, as well as opportunities for employment.  They are building an intellectual property, IP, base in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  That has massive impacts in respect of employment opportunities and the attractiveness of the region for foreign direct investment.  The commercialisation of the intellectual property has real-world effects on developing solutions that people will use on a daily basis.  One of our projects, the border and regions airway training hub, BREATH, project is led by the Dundalk Institute of Technology and is focusing on the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  COPD has a much higher rate of prevalence in Ireland and BREATH is developing solutions to address that illness and then commercialising them.  Not only is the project providing research opportunities, investing in the intellectual property base and providing jobs for people, but it actually is addressing a condition that is specifically prevalent within our country. </p></speech>

Nothing was stalled on that work.  We have already started looking to the future and emerging technologies programmes because it is led very much from the Commission's objectives and policies.  We look at that and we have a great story to tell with those current programmes.  Great work goes on there.  There is no shortage of people wanting these programme in the future.  We have examples of the types of projects we are doing.  People may not have realised that the EU was funding cross-Border programmes but they are excellent.</p> <p>  On the comments about the unionist community, as the PEACE programme is rolling out at present, the local authority action plans are starting in their action to get mobilised.  The projects will be mobilised and people will start to see the impact of the PEACE programme on the ground in the next year.  There has been a dearth for the past two years, from the end of the programme to the one that is ready to go.  They may see the impact of that on the ground.  We have done a great deal of work in the past ten years in engaging with the unionist community to bring them into the programme and to ensure they were getting an allocation from the programme.  I believe one aspect of the failure to engage was a low capacity within that community to apply for the grants but I would like to think that has been addressed during the years.  We certainly have done a great deal of work on that issue.  The people who came before the committee might see the impact over the next few months, which will change their attitude.</p> <p>  We are constantly developing new programmes.  We are constantly looking at where the gaps are.  As we go through these programmes, we will continue to look at revising them if there is funding to do so.  We are always looking to the future and we will continue to do so.  We think there is a very positive response from both the EU, the UK and Ireland on the impact of these programmes and the challenges we will face.  We are very optimistic there will be future programmes .  We know the Irish Government are very committed to finding a way forward. </p></speech>

We are delighted to be able to glean from his expertise and we will have a full engagement after his opening remarks.  Before I invite Professor McCrudden to make his opening statement, he might bear with me as I read the notice on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p><p>I now invite Professor McCrudden to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

My name is Christopher McCrudden.  I am Professor of Human Rights and Equality Law at Queen's University, Belfast and William W. Cook Global Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School.  Until 2011, I was Professor of Human Rights at Oxford University and I am a fellow of the British Academy.  I am also a practising barrister at both the London and Belfast bars and in that capacity, I was junior counsel in one of the cases from Northern Ireland that was heard by the UK Supreme Court in December concerning Brexit.  If there are any questions on that litigation I will be happy to try to answer them but I will not be discussing that case specifically unless asked to do so.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the invitation to give evidence to this Seanad committee.  I am honoured to have been invited.  It is my first time and I hope it may not be the last.  I congratulate the Chairman on his initiative in holding evidence sessions regarding the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland.  I am conscious as the Chairman said that it has been a busy day.  I shall not therefore make a lengthy statement.</p> <p>  I wish to make seven brief points by way of introduction.  First, I believed before the referendum - nothing that I have seen since has led me to change my mind - that Brexit is likely to be a disaster for Northern Ireland if the adverse consequences are not substantially mitigated.</p><p>I congratulate this committee for holding evidence sessions because it wants to focus precisely on the mitigation of adverse consequences.  I now know pretty much what those problems are, not least in areas that affect me personally such as higher education.  We are sure to be hit from time to time with the discovery of yet another unintended consequence.  At least the broad outlines of what the problems will be are now clear.  In broad terms, there is a significant degree of consensus among the parties in Northern Ireland, and between Dublin and London, about the wish list relating to Northern Ireland that should be presented in the forthcoming negotiations.  I think that will become even clearer after the general election when the agreement that appeared to be emerging between the major parties in Northern Ireland is published.  The basic aim of policy for the future seems to be to preserve as much of the <i>status quo</i>as possible.<br/><br/>There now appears to be broad consensus among the EU 27 - this is also reflected in the British Government's negotiating position - that there are unique circumstances that apply to Northern Ireland.  I think the inclusion of this language was a major achievement of Irish diplomacy.  It really does not concern me whether the phrase that is used is &quot;special relationship&quot;, &quot;special status&quot; or &quot;unique circumstances&quot;.  I realise that there are political consequences, but I do not think the exact phrase matters all that much in broad terms.  The committee will be aware of the important and critical distinction between a special status within the EU and a special status more broadly and not necessarily within the EU.  The UK Government appears to have ruled out the first of these options but not the second.  Of course, that may change either way.<br/><br/>I suggest we need to move beyond identifying problems, beyond wish lists that seek to preserve the <i>status quo</i>and beyond stressing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.  We need to begin to develop a detailed plan regarding how to achieve as much as possible of that wish list.  I hope the committee will be doing this.  Any agreement must be capable of surviving scrutiny by, for example, the European Court of Justice.  From what I can see, there is no such agreed plan at the moment.  It is not evident in Dublin, Belfast, Brussels, Berlin or London.  Not only does there not appear to be an agreed plan in any of the relevant official circles, there does not even appear to be the basic outline of a plan with regard to Northern Ireland, which is worse.  The various wish lists that are floating around are just that.  I do not think we have the luxury of saying &quot;Sure it will be grand&quot;.<br/><br/>I have been working with some of my colleagues at Queen's University - Professor David Phinnemore, Dr. Lee McGowan and Professor Dagmar Schiek - as well as with Mr. John Temple Lang, who is a former Commission official, and Mr. Brian Doherty, a former legal adviser to the Northern Ireland Government, to try to focus minds by producing an outline of a plan.  This has now been published as a pamphlet by the European Policy Centre in Brussels.  I would be happy to supply a copy to the clerk of the committee for distribution to Senators if they so wish.  I hope we can talk more about the detail of this plan.  I will provide a broad outline of it.<br/><br/>Our plan would involve Northern Ireland joining a European Economic Area, EEA, agreement together with Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.  This would address some critically important issues: notably, trade in goods and services, membership of the Single Market, free movement of people and the preservation of the single electricity market.  The major advantage of the EEA option for Northern Ireland, apart from addressing some of the major substantive issues I have just mentioned, is that it is a known quantity and therefore would not involve a renegotiation of everything that would be necessary to develop a single market, etc.  It would not be a panacea.  It would not cover the issues of customs, agriculture and fisheries.  Essentially, we are suggesting that an EEA+ option, which would supplement the EEA agreement with a series of additional agreements in areas not specifically covered by the EEA, should be adopted.  An additional useful aspect of the EEA is that a significant discussion has to take place about the dispute settlement mechanisms to be included in the agreement that will result from the forthcoming negotiations.  The UK appears to have set its face against any involvement in the European Court of Justice, at least for now.  We will have to see whether that red line is maintained.  That seems to be the position.  The EEA agreement uses the EFTA dispute settlement mechanisms.  The EFTA court, rather than the European Court of Justice, would be involved.<br/><br/>The final point I would like to make is a personal position.  I suspect that the major sticking point for any proposal of this kind will be in London, rather than in Brussels.  The EEA+ option would meet several of the UK's apparent negotiating red lines.  No part of the UK would remain in the EU, would be subject to ever-closer union or would come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice after the agreement came into effect.  However, it would seem to involve a need for some east-west checks, particularly in terms of the movement of goods and people between the island of Ireland, which would be within a single market, and the rest of the United Kingdom.  It would seem to involve some east-west checks while significantly reducing North-South barriers.  The UK Government has specifically rejected the proposal that Scotland would join the EEA on the grounds that it would interfere with the UK's single market.  Suddenly, the single market appears to be an attractive option, at least within the UK.  Unfortunately, there are appears to be a stark choice between North-South checks and east-west checks.  This choice will be based not solely on economics but also on questions of identity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.667" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#DD00300"><p>I thank Professor McCrudden for a very stimulating and challenging contribution.  It occurs to me that lawyers are sometimes inclined to look at things as they are rather than as they might be.  If a flexible and imaginative solution to Ireland's difficulties were to be found, it could be the subject of a mini-treaty to enable it to go outside the constraints of existing EU law without forming a precedent for other things or requiring the European Court of Justice to go along with it, so to speak.  If something is done at treaty level, or even at mini-treaty level in the form of a protocol to be added to the treaties, that is it: the court in Luxembourg more or less has to accept it and live with it as a treaty court.  It occurs to me that we should not be too afraid of the European Court of Justice because if there is an appetite for real flexibility, this can be done.  I accept that it would involve unanimity, which is never a very happy thing, but it should be doable if there is nothing much to antagonise any of the other 27 member states.</p> <p>  I was interested in what Professor McCrudden had to say about the common travel area.  I have been banging a drum at this committee by saying I do not think this is a major problem.  I understand that the UK authorities hope to maintain visa-free travel for EU citizens travelling to the UK.  The UK intends to put up its defences, so to speak, in areas such as employment, health and welfare, in respect of which there will be all sorts of internal checks.</p><p>It will, however, allow any EU national to get on a train from Paris to London without asking him or her to apply for a visa or to pass through a formal immigration control.</p><p> What I really want to ask about is goods.  Whether the special status is within, subject to or part of the customs union or analogous to being part of the customs unions, the east-west axis is the much easier one to control, subject to certain things.  I made the point this morning that one does not have to have a single solution for all areas.  Agriculture and agricultural products are one thing while pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts are another.  Some things are far more easily monitored in their movements than others.  One can have quite a flexible approach which does not involve stopping every truck wherever it crosses whatever line.</p><p> I wish to ask Professor McCrudden to elaborate on a couple of matters.  What is his sense of the Conservative Party ideology that it wants a homogenous United Kingdom and that anything going down the line of a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to that basic value?  Professor McCrudden drew a distinction which I drew this morning.  Special status within the EU would get the Conservative Party's hair standing on end but special status in respect of the EU is a slightly less challenging concept.  Can Professor McCrudden comment on those propositions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.669" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#EE00200"><p>I congratulate Professor McCrudden and his group at Queen's University on the first Brexit debate I attended.  It was excellently prepared and the contributors were truly wonderful.  Certainly, it sent me back home thinking that we were somewhat behind the curve in comparison to where those guys were on that evening.</p><p>We had a group in this morning whose members were talking about how Northern Ireland had been disenfranchised with the will of the people not being observed in circumstances where 56% of them voted against Brexit.  As a democrat, I hold the view that if one is a citizen of the United Kingdom, it is tough luck if one province happens to go against the majority.  Majority rules and that is the bedrock of democracy.  Having said that, however, the Good Friday Agreement changed everything.  There is no other part of Europe that is covered by an agreement like it.  There is no other citizen in Europe who has a right to hold two passports and to claim citizenship of both the Republic and the United Kingdom.  Technically, if all 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland decided to apply for Irish passports, where would it leave the United Kingdom's dogged position of no access to the Court of Justice and &quot;We are all in or we are all out&quot;?  It is not possible to tell 1.8 million people who have a right to be citizens of the Republic, by virtue of which fact they would be citizens of the European Union also, that one is going to write off their wishes.  That runs contrary to my democracy argument that it is tough luck that the United Kingdom, of which the North is part, decided to leave the European Union.  We are talking about unique circumstances.</p><p>I take on board a great deal of what Senator McDowell said.  In coming up with a special solution, a treaty is probably the only way forward.  It is something I have just heard for the first time but it seems like an ideal solution.  I am interested in those areas of dual citizenship and the notion of whether one can really force one's will on a community which is separate and distinct from the island of England, Scotland and Wales where 56% of them do not want to be part of that decision and are <i>de facto</i>European citizens in any event.</p></speech>

Professor McCrudden seems to angle towards the east-west model.  I will stick with agriculture specifically.  If the EU agrees that as part of negotiations Northern Ireland or the island of Ireland will get a special status, beef producing farmers, for example, in the Twenty-six Counties will still be paid up EU members in receipt of CAP payments.  There will be no CAP in the North.  I cannot see the EU going that far.  While it might give the island a special status, I cannot see it funding that.  As such, there will be a divide within the agricultural model straight away.  If we have an east-west border, will there be tariffs on Northern Ireland beef if there are tariffs on Southern Ireland beef?  One then has the element of farmers in the North of Ireland who will dig in their heels and say their beef is British beef.  It has come across loud and clear in our deliberations with many groups - such as that which appeared before us this morning - that they would accept a tariff, which would be a better scenario than a division on the island.  Almost everyone who has attended - and ourselves - favours a model of special status.  If it were achieved in the morning with an east-west border as opposed to a hard border North-South, would we have opened a complete can of worms in terms of working out the logistics of the all-island model?</p></speech>

I understand the matter raised by Senator Paul Daly but I am hopeful that Professor McCrudden will say that the difficulties he outlined can be overcome.  It is good that Professor McCrudden proposed a model and a solution, which is welcome.  How hopeful is he that he can get the model through?  Has it gained much traction?  While today is an effort in that area, has he done much else to get that into the space and onto the table as an option?  At the initial meetings on Brexit in my local authority area at home, the local Oireachtas representatives suggesting that the Norwegian model of relationship with the EU was probably the great hope for the entire UK.  How optimistic is Professor McCrudden that we can get what he proposes accepted?  How optimistic is he that we can overcome the difficulties raised by Senator Paul Daly?  I hope he says that we can.  Certainly, as a public representative living in the Border area, I am acutely aware that we have to get an all-island solution to the greatest possible degree.</p> <p>  I share Senator McDowell's optimism around the free movement of persons.  That battle is won, albeit we cannot take the victory for granted.  Assuming it is won, we need a similar situation in respect of the free movement of goods.  The alternative is a nightmare which has been well chronicled in the past number of weeks.  I will not go back over that again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.672" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#FF00100"><p>I would like to raise the issue of EEA+ status in respect of Northern Ireland.  Theresa May has ruled it out in seeming to opt for the hard Brexit option.  I take the point that resistance to that idea would probably come from London rather than from Brussels, although I am not too sure how excited Brussels would be about it, either.  It would set a precedent for part of the country remaining and getting the benefits of the EU.  Would British companies then establish themselves in Northern Ireland in order to have the best of all worlds?  They could be able to trade in the UK and the EU.  I am not too sure how that would work in practical terms.  The EU has challenged us to come up with solutions that are within current EU law, although those law can obviously be amended.  If Belfast was going to remain in the EEA and also remain in the UK, a London-based company would just establish a subsidiary there, allowing it to do its operations in a sterling area.  As we have found out with everything else, there is a caveat to every solution we come up with until eventually we end up back where we started.   The mantra from the EU is that Brexit is not going to be a success.  Britain's objective is to make it a success but the EU's is for it not to be.  Would Northern Ireland remaining in the EEA+ be regarded as a success in some instances?  A lot of UK companies and financial houses could transfer to Belfast because they would have access there whereas if they were in Britain they would not have it.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of the European Court of Justice.  Everyone is kind of talking around the issue but it is part of our remit here.   Our position must be that Ireland needs to be sorted first before the trade element is done.  It also must be our position that Northern Ireland remains under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, no matter what the British Government or Westminster decides to do in terms of pulling it out of it.  While Britain might leave, Northern Ireland should remain.  That is part of our negotiating position.  In the absence of that, EU citizens in Northern Ireland, of whom there are many hundreds of thousands, would have no access to justice under EU law.</p></speech>

I will go through them sequentially.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell raised four issues.  The first was the modalities of how we would reach an agreement, and the structure and form of such an agreement.  I tend to agree with him that some form of treaty-based, specific agreement for the island of Ireland and its relations with Northern Ireland and with the EU would be a sensible way forward.  I am perhaps less immediately optimistic than the Senator that this would escape consideration by the court of justice, not least because, as he will have seen, in the last few weeks the court of justice has reviewed a trade agreement and has found part of it to be in violation.  Prior to that, the court of justice had been mightily exercised about retaining jurisdiction over the interpretation of EU law, which of course would require jurisdiction over any treaty of that kind.  I am with the Senator half way, in that I agree it would be a necessary mechanism, but I am not convinced it would escape the court of justice.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell's second point was about the common travel area, which he does not see as a major problem.  The common travel area as I understand it dates from about 1923.  It has gone through various forms and iterations.  Its most recent iteration is a non-legally binding statement that is published, unlike most of the previous common travel area agreements.  I am stating the obvious in saying that each of those agreements took place in a context in which both the United Kingdom and Ireland were outside the EU and therefore EU law did not apply, or they were both inside the EU and thus both bound by its law.  The unique circumstance is now possibly of the common travel area seeking to operate with one party in the EU and bound by EU rules while the other is not.  We do not have a precedent for that.</p> <p>  I am glad that the Senator is optimistic but I am less immediately convinced that the common travel area can resolve the problems, not least because we do not really have a full view of what the complexities of those problems might be.  For example, the free movement of persons may or may not be problematic in terms of requiring checks.  If there is a substantial hard Brexit view that there has to be a hard Border, that might involve individual checks of everybody crossing that Border into the United Kingdom.  We know of course that the common travel area in the past, from 1923, did envisage just those kinds of checks in certain circumstances.  Saying that the common travel area is the thing to go for camouflages the fact that in the past, the common travel area has covered a multitude of different types of arrangements.  What I am suggesting we should go for is the current iteration of the common travel area.  Whether that is consistent with EU law remains to be seen.</p> <p>  I am spending more time on these questions than the Chairman probably wants.  The third question from Senator McDowell was about goods and the flexibility that is envisaged in terms of east-west issues.  I agree that most of these issues can be negotiated on a tailor-made basis.  The problem is not a principled issue but a question of the modalities.  The problem is that negotiating everything of this kind from scratch - trade in goods, trade in services, free movement, the common electricity market and so on is the stuff of ten years of negotiations at least.  One of the potential benefits of the off-the-peg EEA model is that while it does not cover many of the questions that I will go on to consider like agriculture, it does get some issues off the table, which then allows us to build on a relatively secure basis.  There is real tension between getting the ideal solution, as it were, ten years on, and getting something now on which we can build, that at least gets something onto the agenda and securely pinned down.  We do not have to renegotiate all the details of the EEA agreement.  All of that has been done.  It is a known product.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell's fourth point was on the Conservative Party ideology.  He will be surprised to hear that I am not in a position to interpret Conservative Party ideology.  I will say, although I have promised not to talk about the Brexit case in the British Supreme Court, two things are very apparent in that decision.  This is not in respect of the ideology of the Conservative Party but of a much broader constitutional ideology.  One is that parliamentary sovereignty rules.</p><p>All of the apparent understandings that some of us had that there was a movement beyond parliamentary sovereignty have now collapsed.  This has consequences for the future.  If we want to shift out of the current constitutional mode in the United Kingdom context, that will have to be absolutely hammered home and we cannot rely on flexibility in that regard. <br/><br/>The second is that the United Kingdom is a unitary state and so the argument that my clients wanted us to put with regard to the idea that there is a constitutional pluralism, as it were, within the United Kingdom went nowhere.  It was a unitary state governed by parliamentary sovereignty.  This comes back to the point about antipathy to special arrangements.  We are undergoing essentially a constitutional negotiation - that is not much of an exaggeration - in the UK.  I do not know how well that will go but the position in London is generally that the UK is a unitary state and, therefore, anything that breaches that, particularly if it has economic effects like breaching the so-called single UK market, will be viewed very hostilely. <br/><br/>I thank Senator Craughwell for his comments.  I believe the percentage who voted to remain in Northern Ireland was 53%.  On the point about democracy, to be theoretical and academic, that depends on where the demos is.  The Senator will know as well as I do that the demos in Northern Ireland is whether it is part of the United Kingdom or not.  That is the critical question that divides Northern Ireland.  The problem that Brexit has brought to the fore is that the relaxation in notions of national sovereignty and national identity, the sense that there could be shared and different understandings of those issues, is being threatened.  Unfortunately, identity, sovereignty and nationality have come rushing back.  That is the problem because we return to the question we thought we had resolved with the Good Friday Agreement as to what exactly the demos is in the Northern Irish context.<br/><br/>More generally, in terms of two passports, I must declare an interest as I carry both a British and an Irish passport.  I am, therefore, in exactly the position the Senator mentioned.  Not only that but I need to declare an interest again as both my children have British and Irish passports, although they were born in Oxford.  Where does this leave us?  It leaves us in a situation where the position in Northern Ireland is a particular example of the larger negotiations that will have to take place about how the UK treats EU citizens and how the EU treats British citizens, particularly the former.  The issue is that it is no longer just a question of how the UK treats Polish plumbers but how it treats 1.5 million people in Northern Ireland who are, as the Senator correctly noted, potentially all EU citizens.  This begins to bring a particular dimension to the general problem of how one deals with EU citizens.  What this means is that there are two outstanding questions, as has been mentioned, that are in the preliminary part of the negotiations.  One of these is Ireland, while the other is the treatment of EU citizens.  The EU citizens' point also has an Irish dimension.  Notwithstanding whether the penny has fully dropped, the Irish dimension is central to two of the three preliminary questions that must be settled before the negotiations can proceed to trade.<br/><br/>Senator Paul Daly raised the issue of agriculture.  The European Economic Area agreement does not cover agriculture.  While it covers some of the goods aspects of agriculture, the general issues the Senator raises are not covered.  It is clear, therefore, that the EEA agreement would not deal with the issues described.  It would not cause an extra problem with regard to such issues, however.  In other words, while there would have to be a separate agreement with regard to agriculture, there is no reason this will not be compatible with the EEA agreement.  Other states in the EEA have negotiated separate agricultural deals so at least the EEA option does not create more problems in the area of agriculture.<br/><br/>As to whether the agriculture issue is a can of worms, the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; and it would be misleading of me to indicate otherwise.  Either last week or the week before, the leader of French farmers expressed some of the opposition to the notion that Northern Ireland could be the route for cheap British food imports into the European Union and they are resisting this for that reason.  I fully agree with the Senator that this opens a can of worms.  It also raises a funding issue as to how far the British Treasury will provide subventions that will be equivalent to the EU funding that will be lost.  As the Senator will be aware, the UK will provide this funding temporarily but there is no guarantee that will be the case subsequently.<br/><br/>Senator Reilly asked how optimistic I was.  On a day as beautiful as today, how could one fail to be optimistic?  On wetter days in Strangford, as I look out over the harbour, I think it is very difficult in two respects.  First, it is not clear that an agreement will be reached, in other words, we may not get past the first three initial issues.  Everything seems to change each time I disembark from a flight.  I was in Berlin in recent days and I visited London a few days prior to that.  As to whether there is general optimism, the answer is &quot;No&quot;.  As to whether it is more than 50% likely that there will be an agreement on these issues, I am doubtful about that.  On that question, the problem is that the outlines of what everybody wants are clear.  There should be no hard Border and free movement and a single market on the island of Ireland should continue, etc.  The EEA is one of the relatively few ways in which these major objectives can be achieved.  It is as simple as that.  We have a dilemma, therefore, because some aspects of the EEA agreement will not be palatable.  On the other hand, if people want to achieve what they say they want to achieve, this is the way to do it.  I apologise as I realise that does not answer the question about optimism.  <br/><br/>Senator Reilly also asked what we were doing to sell the idea of the European Economic Agreement.  Academics generally are not in the business of selling ideas.  We are presenting an idea for consideration in various places.  I presented it in various forums in London and I know John Temple Lang has presented it in various forums in Dublin.  As I stated, I attended meetings in Berlin in recent days but I have no idea whether the idea is being picked up.  It is being talked about and it is coming out in various think tank reports.  <i>The Guardian</i>referred to it last week when it noted the idea was on the table.  Beyond that, however, I cannot say much.<br/><br/>On Senator Mark Daly's question about how enthusiastic Brussels is, the thrust of the question, which I take as being put in good spirit, is that this creates a problem because Belfast wins.  Coming from Belfast, that would be an entirely acceptable result as far as I am concerned. </p></speech>

The problem the Senator identifies is a real one.  I would encapsulate it by asking how far the hard economics of this will be tempered in Brussels by a sense of what I can only describe as solidarity with Ireland.</p><p>I am afraid I have no idea which is going to win out.  If it is purely based on hard economics, each of the points being made by the Senator is entirely valid.  We are where are.  I did not vote for this and I did not want it.  As I stated at the beginning, it is something I would want to reverse if I could but it is not, apparently, going to be reversed.  The question is whether, therefore, in light of that Brussels is going to punish the UK and, in doing so, punish Ireland for something for which it was not responsible in the first place.  I hope that wiser counsels will prevail that will recognise the need for solidarity in the first place with Ireland, as well as the need to preserve the peace.  There is a sense in Brussels that can be picked up that there is a degree of pride that European capitals were involved with underpinning the peace agreement.  The last thing I hope Brussels, Berlin or Paris wants is a return to the terrorism in Northern Ireland.  I do not want to appear to be sabre-rattling and there is a danger in using the whiff of cordite to try to threaten; that is not what I am doing and I hope I would not be interpreted as doing that.  In order to be responsible, one needs to play down these threats although they are a reality.  If there are Border posts, the Senators living around there know that in the past, in the 1950s, the Border posts were the target.  It was as simple as that.  We have photographs to prove that and it is all in the archives.  I cannot imagine it is anything other than the crassest lack of responsibility for any capital to risk going back to that when we have a working arrangement in Northern Ireland.  We hope it will work even better in future with regard to devolved government.  We cannot sacrifice that.</p></speech>

Is it possible that the economic analysis could be "gamed out" and Belfast wins, with the financial houses of London not having to go to Frankfurt and Paris but instead setting up a brass plate company in Belfast before being good to go?  We have been asked to put forward realistic solutions that are doable.  I support the idea of an EEA+ in terms of what it would solve for agriculture, cross-Border issues, an all-island energy economy and all of that kind of stuff.  It comes back to the idea that the EU is saying, quite clearly, that Brexit is not going to be a success.  If it was a success, everybody would do it.  They are hardly going to encourage Brexit to be a success.</p></speech>

It is a lot more complex to fracture on an east-west basis than the market for goods.  It may be that the best we can hope for is special status as regards goods and having to walk away from services and saying it is part of UK sovereignty or something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#HH00400"><p>The physical movement of goods is one issue.  That is why we are teasing it out.  We are doing this as we are talking.  If EEA+ is not a runner because of the benefits for brass plate companies establishing in Belfast - I am talking about financial houses or insurance companies - what is the next best thing in the real world?  That is probably not possible.  If we scale back, EEA+ would be EEA-, including the all-island energy economy, along with agriculture.  There is also the issue of hard goods manufactured in Northern Ireland or the South being traded over and back.  We talk about the challenge of maintaining the <i>status quo </i>to the point where it might preclude all sorts of things being done in Northern Ireland in order to have the have the benefit of EEA+ for those who are there as of a certain date.  Senator McDowell makes a valid point in that there are certain things the EU will not allow as Frankfurt and Paris might like to pick up much of the stuff coming from London and do not want it going to Belfast.</p></speech>

It is about detail, workability and feasibility rather than simply identifying problems.  We are now looking towards solutions and that seems to be absolutely the right thing to do.  Our position is essentially to float this as an option, partly to tease out precisely these kinds of questions.  Until now, as far as I can see, there has been no alternative plan against which one can set exactly the kinds of questions being raised.  If we have succeeded in raising those issues, it has been at least a partial success but we can do more than that.</p> <p>  The Senators asked specifically about some implications.  The paper I will send to the clerk spends a bit of time teasing out some of the legal issues we have spoken about.  As to whether the EEA agreement is compatible with EU law in a broad sense, it is.  That has been entirely settled and there is no question on whether it is compatible with EU law.  That is a major plus as all the negotiations that had to take place to make it compatible with EU law have already been settled.  We are coming back to the known quantity point.  We have also been doing work on the details, for example, in terms of the financial contribution that states would need to make if they were to buy into the EEA agreement.  We have been doing estimates of that.  It is not in the paper but we can send separately some work that is exactly on the question raised about financial services.  We have been trying to work out what the implications are for financial services.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell mentioned the distinction between services and goods and he is absolutely right.  We already have a functioning EEA market in which precisely that problem has not arisen.  We have not yet seen the flow of financial services to Norway, for example, so there are constraints in the EEA treaty meaning that some of the financial services issues are not quite as simple as might be supposed.  I want to make Belfast a success and I would be happy for floods of financial services to come to Belfast but unfortunately, our estimate is that will not happen and the benefits are minimal for the financial services industry to move lock, stock and barrel to Belfast.  I might send a note to the committee on that issue to explain the background rather than holding it back this morning.</p></speech>

We can go through key areas like policing and justice and there can certainly be an argument made for whatever EEA arrangements are there.  Senator McDowell would know about extradition and how the European arrest warrant would solve the problem.  A hard Brexit brings a special problem relating to the peace process in that regard.  Tourism is a cross-Border and all-island issue with the related matter of the travel area.  There is also the energy market and environmental issues.  There is no huge success in Westminster arising from agreements on an EEA level between North and South on those matters.  They do not want to see brass plate companies moving there.  This is about trying to find out how to make a credible argument to say there is no downside to continuing the European arrest warrant in Northern Ireland, given the special problem we have on the island with that issue.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has said no deal is better than a bad deal.</p><p>When it comes to the European arrest warrant, no deal means we now have the same problem that was dealt with by Governments in the past.  The challenge is trying to identify economically, and this is an economic argument, where it is that the EU would turn around and say it cannot agree to the EEA on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-25a.684" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Christopher McCrudden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017052500002#JJ00200"><p>One of the reasons for the success of the Belfast Agreement is that it operated in a situation where the economy was improving, in particular in its early days.  Not a lot is written about this but it was clearly the case that it was an improving market, in particular in areas of confidence-building, for example, employment.  The fact there was an expanding employment market made it a lot easier for greater equality between Catholics and Protestants in employment to come about, which in turn increased the likelihood of the political arrangements being more successful because some of the tensions otherwise in the community had been reduced.  I would argue that the notion of splitting the terrorism stuff off from the economic stuff is a mistake.  There is a crucial requirement that Northern Ireland, in order to remain peaceful and supportive of the Good Friday Agreement, is going to have to be economically successful, and that if one has an economic basket case on one's Border, that is in itself destabilising.  It is destabilising for the Republic and it is going to be destabilising for us.  With respect to the Senator, the economics here cannot be hived off.  It is an intimate part of the question as a whole.  I would resist the notion that it should be separated off in the way that, perhaps as devil's advocate, Senator Daly has been suggesting.</p></speech>
