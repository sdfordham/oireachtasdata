    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Foley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#D00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to address it on the below cost selling of fruit and vegetables.  My brother and I operate a protected crop enterprise in north County Dublin.  We grow tomatoes which we produce for about eight months of the year.  We supply some of the main retailers.  As chairman of the IFA vegetable and protected crop committee, I represent growers nationally in dealing with the Government and all of the retailers.  I am joined by Mr. Paul Brophy who has an extensive broccoli and cabbage production enterprise in County Kildare, Mr. Colm Grimes who farms in Skerries, County Dublin and produces cauliflowers, leeks, scallions and rhubarb and Mr. Eddie Doyle from Mooncoin, County Kilkenny who runs a potato, vegetable and dairy enterprise.  All four of us supply the large retailers, both directly and indirectly, through merchants and facilitators.</p> <p>  The horticulture sector has a farm gate output figure of &euro;395 million, of which edible horticultural produce accounts for 85%, while the remaining 15% is accounted for by amenity horticulture.  Although a relatively small sector within agriculture, horticulture makes a hugely important contribution to the economy and rural society, with an estimated 6,000 people employed full time in primary production and a further 10,000 employed in downstream businesses.  In 2013 the retail fresh produce market in Ireland was worth &euro;1.2 billion, with vegetables accounting for &euro;500 million; fruit, &euro;550 million; and potatoes, &euro;150 million.  Fruit and vegetables combined represent 14.5% of the average grocery shopping basket and are purchased in 51% of all visits to grocery shops.</p> <p>  In general terms, production levels in the edible horticulture sector have been maintained, but the number of producers has fallen and continues to fall, as these family businesses are constantly challenged by their weak bargaining position in the food supply chain.  The single biggest threat to the industry is the dominant position of the large retail groups in Ireland which are forcing down the prices paid to suppliers, in many cases to below the cost of production.  The retail market in Ireland is characterised by the concentration of 95% of buying power in the hands of five retail groups.  Almost 80% of market share is controlled by Tesco, Supervalu-Centra and Dunnes Stores, with a further 15% by Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>  In Ireland and at EU level, it is widely recognised and accepted that there is a major imbalance of power in the food supply chain between retailers as price setters at the top of the chain and primary producers as price takers at the bottom.  This imbalance has resulted in a situation where farmers are sometimes compelled to accept unreasonable conditions and prices that do not cover their costs or provide an economic return.  Vegetable growers cannot continue in an environment where their produce is constantly being used by retailers as loss leaders and being offered to consumers at way below the cost of production.  An example of this is the "Super Six" weekly promotion in Aldi in which fruit and vegetables are sold at between 39 and 49 cent.  Similar promotions are replicated in the other multiple retailers.  For the average grower, the cost of producing carrots is 55 cent per kg.  Swedes cost 53 cents per unit to produce, while a cabbage costs the grower 52 cent a unit. </p> <p>  Below cost selling is the main threat to the sustainability of the horticulture sector.  While promotions have always been a part of retail sales, the practice of below cost selling has brought a new and potentially terminal threat to the sector.  Supermarkets use it to encourage footfall into their stores.  Often the timing of these promotions takes no account of availability of supply.  At these times sales volumes can increase to a multiple of normal demand and, in many cases, growers cannot meet the orders and sales are lost to imported produce.  Such promotions also greatly affect the sales of other competing fresh products such as broccoli and cauliflower, the highly perishable nature of which means that they cannot be held over until the promotion finishes.  This distorts the market for everyone, regardless of whether one's product is on promotion.  Products that do not fall within the supermarket specification are normally sold to the catering sector.  However, during these large promotions, large volumes of this class 2 product remain unsold.  The volatility in demand caused by these promotions is totally unsustainable.</p> <p>  Growers were the victims in a vicious battle over market share when retailers savagely discounted Irish potatoe and vegetable prices in the run-up to Christmas 2013, during which some items were sold at one tenth of their production cost.  Such action by retailers had a very negative effect on the wholesale sector and many farmers have seen this sales avenue completely vanish.  It would be naive to think growers are not making a substantial contribution to these promotions.  The majority specialise in a small number of products and do not have many product lines over which to spread their costs.  The long-term outcome of below cost promotions is a lower price for everyone's products. </p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 was the first attempt by the Government to improve the functioning of the food supply chain.  While the IFA believes the legislation does not go far enough, the new regulations under consultation and due to be commenced this year will be judged by suppliers and farmers on their effectiveness in rebalancing power in the food supply chain.  The legislation fails to address a number of issues necessary to restore equity to the food supply chain and curb the dominance of the retail multiples.  The biggest of these issues is the failure by the Government to prohibit in legislation below cost selling and appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee implementation of the regulations. </p> <p>  It is critical that the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission take a proactive role in ensuring full compliance by retailers with their obligations under the new regulations.  The commission will need to demonstrate its willingness to take on board complaints made by suppliers and primary producers in confidence and initiate its own investigations into the behaviour of retail multiples.  It must set the tone for rigorous implementation of the regulations by issuing contravention notices and naming and shaming retailers found in breach of the regulations, as well as taking legal proceedings, when necessary. </p> <p>  Growers are fed up with the quality product, the result of their investment and hard work, becoming a weapon in a war of attrition between the major multiples.  The fresh produce sector is in ongoing decline and we will not allow the industry to be decimated by crude price cutting tactics which give the illusion of value to the consumer.  Supermarkets are quick to wave the Irish flag and use individual growers for promotions, but that belies the real position.  Farmers cannot continue to produce food at rock bottom prices which put their businesses at risk.</p> <p>  Unfair trading practices have been a topic of much debate and a source of serious concern within the European Union for many years.  The issue is being addressed in other EU member states, as seen, for example, in the appointment in the United Kingdom of a groceries code adjudicator and the German restrictions on below cost selling.  The IFA welcomes the stance of the European Commissioner for agriculture, Mr. Phil Hogan, on the supply chain initiative at EU level and his recent call that &ldquo;all players in the food chain should realise that it is imperative that producers get a decent return for their raw material.&rdquo;  The IFA has called for the European Commission to address, as a matter of urgency, the issue of equity for producers in the food supply chain by implementing EU statutory legislation to prevent below cost selling by retailers of produce.  The voluntary initiative undertaken in the European Union in recent years is simply not working. </p> <p>  In an effort to find a solution to the major challenges being faced by fresh produce growers a horticulture stakeholders forum comprising representatives of five sectors, namely, vegetables, mushrooms, soft fruit, top fruit and protected crops, with the IFA, Teagasc and Bord Bia, has been convened.  I chair this forum which is working towards the development of an action plan in a number of key areas.  An immediate priority is to resolve and rationalise issues concerning producer organisations to facilitate the greater participation of fruit and vegetable growers.   Producer organisations are the cornerstone of the EU support regime for fruit and vegetables.  This opportunity must not be missed by Irish growers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must strike a balance between compliance with EU regulations and the ability of growers to access producer organisation funding.  </p> <p>  I am calling on the committee to support the IFA&rsquo;s position on the urgent need to regulate the issue of below cost selling.</p><p>The current imbalance of power in the food supply chain is unsustainable for family enterprises in Ireland producing fruit and vegetables for sale.  A further reduction in the number of growers may undermine the capacity of the sector to supply certain products, as the output supply would fall below a critical mass.  This vulnerable sector is under particular pressure from retailers and will not survive the price war if the Government does not take action.</p></speech>

I have long desired this issue to be discussed by the committee.  We produced a report some time ago on inequity in the food supply chain, and members of the committee have long advocated action in this regard.  We have found it difficult, however, to persuade people to be as frank and forthright as Mr. Foley has been today.  I am sure all members are keen to contribute.  I call on Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to begin, followed by Deputy Martin Ferris.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#E00300"><p>I  welcome the delegates.  It is beyond time that we had a discussion on this issue, which deserves serious attention in its own right.  At the same time, however, we should acknowledge that it is part of a wider issue.  What we are dealing with in the agricultural industry is a type of hourglass effect, with a large number of consumers, a very small number of retailers and processors, and a large number of producers.  This is the case not only in Ireland but across Europe.  In most countries the market is dominated by five multiples or thereabouts, which means there is an overweening power in the middle.  In the case of the delegates, that power is the retailers, while in other sectors it is a combination of retailers and processors.</p> <p>  I am very strongly of the view that the key issue in farming is that farmers want it to be profitable in its own right.  They want to have certainty that if they produce good-quality goods, they will get a fair return for them.  Mr. Foley outlined the issues very clearly, including the sudden promotions, prevalence of below-cost selling and the absolutely crazy situation that pertained in 2013.  I understand that Christmas 2014 was not very good for producers either, because the retailers manipulated the situation in a different way and left farmers with unsold products.  Perhaps Mr. Foley will comment on that?</p> <p>  Mr. Foley seems to be saying that this issue should be tackled on two levels.  At a national level, he supports the regulations in the groceries order but argues they should have gone a lot further.  In line with the Oireachtas committee report recommendation, he calls for the appointment of a food ombudsman who would examine these matters and determine whether or not fair play is pertaining.  Mr. Foley also wants a ban on below-cost selling at local level, which I would heartily support.  What is going on at the moment in this regard amounts to exploitation.  In addition, Mr. Foley would like to see consumer law tightened up, not only to protect consumers but also producers, many of which are small operators.  Will he elaborate on the practical mechanisms that might be employed in this regard?  There is a major challenge here and we will have no horticulture industry left if things continue as they are.  We certainly will not have a traditional farmer-led horticulture industry.</p> <p>  There also is scope for action at the European level.  During a visit to Brussels in September last year, it seemed clear to me that the European Commission is very engaged on the issues of price and the power of multiples.  This concern applies across all products but is particularly acute for the vulnerable vegetable and fruit sector.  Whether one is in the Mediterranean or in Ireland, it is a common problem.  It was pointed out to us during our visit that it is the position of the Commission that a farmer is entitled to a fair return for his or her product.  We should build our case around that very simple statement, which is set out in the Lisbon treaty.  It seemed to us at the time that there are two elements to this, namely, information and regulation.  I noted Mr. Foley's observation that voluntary codes do not work.  It is a view with which I agree.  As I said, what is required is a two-step process.  First we get the information and, second, we bring in regulation to ensure there cannot be exploitation of a dominant position, which is basically what is happening at the moment.</p> <p>  On the question of information around produce, the delegates might be aware that we had a delegation from the French Embassy before the committee some time ago.  Those witnesses spoke about the gathering of information, the working of the observatory and so on.  It would seem to be a relatively simple matter to appoint, either at national or European level, people who would function as an observatory, working out, for example, the amount of broccoli sold and the retail margin taken by the shop, transporter, farmer and so on.  Those data should be taken over a season because I would guess they play at highs and lows.  This would give us the facts and allow us to compare price paid with production cost.  I am very confident that if consumers knew what was happening, they would be very much on the side of the producer.</p> <p>  I assume that if all the vegetable and fruit producers in Ireland were to refuse to sell, say, broccoli or cabbage, the retailers would simply import them?  There is an issue here in respect of labelling.  In the case of the National Dairy Council, for instance, we have seen how it is possible to be effective in ensuring the consumer knows what is happening.  Is there any way of introducing country-of-origin labelling which would ensure that where a native product is being swapped for an imported product, that the consumer would be aware of it and be aware, through advertising, of the effect it is having on this very important sector of the farming industry?</p> <p>  I very much welcome Mr. Foley's contribution today.  It is good to see people coming forward publicly to outline what the issues are.  I understand why so many farmers have been reluctant to do so.  We need to follow up on the extensive work the committee has already done on this issue to ensure there is fair play for the horticulture industry and that it not only survives but thrives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#E00400"><p>I thank Mr. Foley for his presentation.  All members will support what he said regarding the abuse of power by the five multiples and the damage it has done to producers and, in the broader context, to small shopkeepers and other rural enterprises.  The way in which these retailers have been able to get away with it down through the years is an indication of the worrying influence they have in the wider political sphere.  It is a challenge to democracy when such powerful players can effectively set the agenda.  This committee has done good work on this issue in the past and we all want to see the implementation of the recommendations set out in our report.  We hope that will be done in due course.</p> <p>  Mr. Foley indicated that producer numbers have fallen and continue to fall.  Most of these are family businesses, as he said, which are unable to compete because of the prevalence of below-cost selling.  Can he give any indication of the numbers of companies that have gone out of business in the past five years?  How does he see the numbers going if this issue is not dealt with?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Foley and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that a voluntary code will not work.  There must be a mandatory system of regulation and it must have teeth.  I fully support the proposal for the appointment of an ombudsman.</p><p>Someone must ensure the regulation is implemented and oversee the situation where multiples are getting away with abuse.  This is not just happening in this industry but across the agricultural producer area, where multiples are abusing their power for their own selfish benefit.</p><p> I thank the delegates for their presentation and assure them that we fully support the position they have adopted here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#F00200"><p>I thank Mr. Foley and his colleagues for their presentation.  It is good to see people are willing to come and outline the problems.  We had hearings throughout 2013 on the grocery goods sector and it was stated during those hearings that people were reluctant to come forward and discuss the problems because of the fear of retribution from the multiples if they made their views known.</p> <p>  Mr. Foley said in his presentation that the value of the horticultural sector is small in terms of overall agricultural output, but the number of people employed is significant, indicating the industry is labour intensive.  If the horticultural sector were lost to us, the impact would be greater than the loss of the products themselves.  In the hearings we had in 2013, all of the multiples were adamant that they do not ask suppliers to contribute to the cost of promotions.  They were also adamant that they do not include this requirement in contracts with suppliers.  Will the delegation outline for us the type of conversation that takes place if a multiple is putting on a promotion?  What do they say to suppliers in terms of price, is it included in supplier contracts that they must participate in these promotions, and is a price variation fixed in those contracts?  What would the reaction be if a supplier indicated he could not afford to or refused to participate in a promotion?  What reactions have been experienced by the sector's members from multiples in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#F00300"><p>This committee has not been remiss in tackling this problem.  When I was Chair of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2010, we held a full inquiry into this issue.  The power the multiples wielded at the time was frightening.  Their power was so substantial that even reasonably big businesses were terrified of putting their heads above the parapet.  We hired a young researcher to interview people at night on the issue.  The IFA was forthcoming with information at that time and it is now repeating what it said in 2010.  We had a full conversation with the IFA then and it pointed out the inadequacies at the time.</p> <p>  The 2014 Act has been a missed opportunity.  It is inadequate, will not work and is somewhat mealy-mouthed.  One of the 80% multiple cohort does not treat its workers well, not to mind treating small businesses like growers very well.  Some of its workers have been out on strike recently, due to variable contract hours and other issues.  That same business dismissed this committee out of hand when it sought its attendance.  It waved us away.  The impression was that we are just small fry who should know our place in the queue and not be annoying them because their job is to make a profit, never mind how they do so.  That type of behaviour is wiping out small shopkeepers and businesses.  It is wiping out growers and producers, but also wiping out people further down the line.  Small shopkeepers are important because they provide two or three jobs in their areas.</p> <p>  The multiples are not fooling consumers.  I have been told that the multiples said they could supply a Christmas dinner and vegetables for approximately &euro;1.25 per person, but consumers know that this is not feasible.  Informed consumers did not fall for this marketing.  However, one can understand that with money being scarce, as it has been over recent years, people will buy the cheapest products, particularly if they are of good quality.</p> <p>  The multiples are up to same old tricks again.  They say there is no such thing as low-cost selling or that producers are not paying for the most advantageous shelf space.  We were told before this does not happen.  It is a bit like asking us to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, where we hear and see no evil, but we all know these practices take place.  Price cutters amplify growers' vulnerabilities.  They are vulnerable and under threat when we aggregate all the factors involved.</p> <p>  We used to be told we should use the Competition Act to deal with these issues and that it provided a remedy to this situation.  That was a load of nonsense because evidence had to be produced and people were afraid to come forward.  I believe we need a system like that in Britain, a groceries' code adjudicator, and that is what the committee recommended in 2011.  This is more or less the same as what was recommended by this committee under the Chairman, Deputy Doyle, after an extensive review of the situation.  We need the clout of law and need to be able to name and shame those who are not compliant.  We also need to have significant penalties that can be imposed on those who engage in practices that will end with the destruction of a vulnerable sector.</p> <p>  Throughout the country everyone is rushing to the big stores.  This will wipe out all smaller businesses and producers.  We will then have crocodile tears.  I will not participate in any more protests in the middle of the country or anywhere else, because the people who are there crying crocodile tears are the very people who pass by the rural post office or shop and only avail of them at night when they cannot get to the big store ten miles away.  I am fed up with this situation.  The people who contribute to this situation are the people who can stop it.  The consumers have huge power here, so let us see what they do.  We will end up with empty streets in villages with no shops except in major towns, but all we see are crocodile tears and politicians jumping on bandwagons and misleading people.  The consumers can change the situation if a statutory code is laid down.</p> <p>  The situation now regarding what will happen is that people will go to the major multiples and retailers and the small shops will die.  Then the multiples will wipe out small producers altogether as there will be no competition to which they can sell their produce.  We know where we are heading and we know how to stop that.  The only way to stop this is to bring in regulations.  I am glad to see Commissioner Hogan is on-side on this, but he needs to go a step further and match rhetoric with action to ensure we sort out the issue.  Otherwise we will end with a country where we have very little in rural areas and where all business is done in the bigger towns.  There will no longer be local football, hockey or rugby teams.  Locals schools and everything else will come under threat.  We will not be around in ten years time to see that happen, but it will happen the mad rush towards multiples continues.</p> <p>  It is time to cry "stop".  It is not just time to cry "stop", but time to act and to put mechanisms in place to stop what is happening.  This Legislature has the power to contribute to that, but I sometimes wonder whether it is cowardly and afraid to take on the big boys.  It is very easy to take on the small people and to put licences and all sorts of regulations in place that prevent them from getting out of their traps.  Taking on the big boys is a different job and I wonder whether we have the political will to do that.  I would not hesitate to support any measure to deal with the situation.  If a Bill was introduced tomorrow to deal with it, I would be delighted to support it, because I am sick of what is going on.  Recent events have made me even sicker.  I wholeheartedly support the IFA's campaign.</p> <p>  Some of the delegates said to me outside that there is not much vegetable production in Westmeath.  If they go down to Ballinahown or to Cloonown which is right beside us, there are good carrots there too.</p></speech>

It was unfortunate that the witnesses did not make a contribution to the deliberations of the joint committee when we dealt with this issue some 18 months ago.  At that time, I recall asking the chief executive of one of the large multiples about the type of structure his company had in place.  He asked me whether I was suggesting that his company charged "hello" money and told me that any such suggestion should be taken up with the Garda.  I gather from conversations with people in the fruit and vegetable sector that this problem occurs regularly.  What types of arrangements do the producers have with the various multiples?  Do they deal with them as one body or as individual companies?  </p><p> A vegetable company located not far from my home, which deals with all of the multiples, informs me that it pays a charge to have its products placed on the shelves of X, Y or Z company.  If this charge is not paid in advance, the multiples will not sell the company's products, which is not fair.  Do the witnesses also pay such charges?  What kind of charging arrangements do they have with the multiples?  Do they have contracts with A, B, C or D multiple or are they afraid to answer my question on the arrangements in place?  On the previous occasion we addressed this matter, it was implied that producers were very much afraid.</p><p> This problem is not confined to vegetable growers.  Time and again, milk is used as a loss leader in several supermarkets.  A customer of five different supermarkets will be charged five different prices for the same carton of milk, which is wrong.  I presume the same applies to vegetables. </p><p> I agree with Deputy Penrose that the debate on the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill was a lost opportunity.  The joint committee's report of 2013 made fair and reasonable recommendations based on the British system that had been introduced in the preceding 18 months.  Do the witnesses have evidence on how the British system is working?  It has been in place for two and a half or three years.  I support the independent adjudicator model adopted in Britain.  Has the adjudicator been busy keeping an eye on developments?   </p><p> I agree that a voluntary code is no good and a statutory mechanism is required.  The European initiative about which the Commissioner has spoken recently is very welcome.  Most of the large multiples, with the exception of one which did not have the manners to grace the joint committee with its presence in 2013, are based elsewhere in Europe.  Is the introduction of Europe-wide regulation, as opposed to an Irish system with less clout, the most appropriate response to this issue?  The joint committee noted previously that the profit margins of the large multiples were not available for scrutiny because they have an opt-out clause based on the fact that they have their headquarters elsewhere.  Will Europe-wide regulation be required to ensure all angles are covered? </p><p> The main issue is the requirement that producers receive a fair price for their products.  Profit margins are becoming tighter across the board.  A structure must be introduced to ensure everyone is treated in a fair and proper manner.  Deputy Penrose referred to the way in which a specific company had been dealing with its employees recently.  The witnesses have been subject to certain practices for many years.  It is time to act.  </p></speech>

The problem, as alluded to by previous speakers, is that the multiples have secured a dominant position in the market as a result of the shopping behaviour of Irish people.  I do not know how the growing phenomenon of online sales will be dealt with but it, too, must be addressed.  Are potato sales, which stood at &euro;150 million at one point, still in decline as a result of changes in eating habits such as the consumption of more pasta?</p> <p>  One could argue that below-cost selling is taking place in the tillage industry.  I calculated my production costs a moment ago.  The only difference that arises is that we can sell to numerous suppliers at the world price, rather than at a price that is being manipulated internally.  In 2009, the dairy sector could also have argued that it was selling its produce below cost.  Incidentally, the term "below-cost selling" must be defined if the legislative change they seek is to be introduced.  Responsibility for one of the main costs facing farmers, namely, the cost of conacre or leasing, lies with farmers and there is no way anyone would legislate in that area.  </p> <p>  Tillage land is currently making &euro;300 per acre, while potato land may make less.  I do not know how to get around the challenge these profits present.  As a tillage farmer, my sector is facing competition from people who are willing to rent land for ten years for grass.  Some people can make a profit growing grain or vegetables on their own land but not everybody is on their own land.  Should we introduce a definition that includes the percentage of land that is owned and the percentage that is rented in order that farmers will be able to work through their costs, as is done in the Teagasc bulletin every year, and decide what is a fair set of costings?  One cannot speak generally about below-cost selling because the costs of production vary from farmer to farmer.  For this reason, we need to agree a definition of costs.  We heard that the greatest threat is the failure of the Government to address the issue of below cost selling but we must first define the problem before we can deal with it.  I do not mean that statement as a criticism of the witnesses. </p> <p>  As other speakers noted, the joint committee had substantial discussions on below-cost selling a few years ago.  It would have been good to have representatives of the growers before us at that time but they failed to appear because they were afraid.  I was informed privately that they feared they would be de-listed or treated unfairly by the multiples.  It is time to spit everything out and inform members which companies are behaving poorly and which are not.  We cannot pursue this issue with one hand tied behind our backs.  We need to know which companies are misbehaving and which are not.  </p> <p>  At one point during the joint committee's hearings, I asked a representative of one of the multiples if he had ever heard of the terms "pot-holing" and "marketing support".  The response was to blank the question.  These terms were used by a producer located not far from this building who had been drive to his wits' end by the behaviour of some of the multiples.  We need to have this information on the record because it is frustrating that the issue is clouded in fog.  I have the impression that the reason we are here again is that the multiples have decided they can continue to behave as they wish.  It is time to name and shame.  </p> <p>  We heard that Irish supermarkets are quick to wave the Irish flag.  That is also true of many other businesses which import foreign grain and other products.  I spent at least ten minutes last week looking at a carton of milk, which had many Irish features on the label but had been produced in Northern Ireland.  We all wish to have better co-operation between North and South but it should not take a person who is familiar with these matters, as I am, ten minutes to figure out the origin of a carton of milk.  I found out only by reading a small stamp. </p> <p>  Farmers have a free choice.  I dropped a large amount of conacre this year because I could not make money on it.  I normally forward sell when I rent land.  I know my costs of production, which are straightforward, and the cost of land.  For this reason, I sell on or near the day I set and if I cannot make money on that day, I do not plough.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>I know that a person cannot stop fully but there is scope to pull back to a certain degree.  Were it not for the single farm payment, it would be impossible to make such decisions.  Forward selling is one option upon which progress could be made.  If we are to revisit this issue and speak to the multiples again, we must ensure that discussions on their behaviour are open and frank because I believe their behaviour is wrong.  I spoke to many of them during the Christmas period when they were ruining the market at a time of year when farmers absolutely had to sell their produce.  I am also aware of their behaviour when it comes to spoilage.  We need facts and we need some brave person to stand up and say: "This is what is happening.  Here is the documentation.  I am not happy about it."  I know it is a difficult thing to ask but we need to get this onto the agenda.  Otherwise, we will be discussing this again in two years' time.  A lot of other farmers will not be caught out.  Unfortunately it is those farmers who are trying to make a living from this industry who will suffer.</p></speech>

While bravery may be too strong a word, I acknowledge that it takes some guts when the topic under discussion involves them being critical of the hand that feeds them.  The witnesses are here today representing producers throughout the country rather than to talk about specific cases.  I have no doubt that the challenges described by them today are being faced by everyone in the industry.  I will not repeat the sentiments of those who spoke before me, but they have outlined the position of this committee on this.  We are very much at one on this issue.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the challenges that promotions bring and the price volatility that is decimating the industry.  I ask them to outline the regularity of such promotions.  How often are they happening?  Is it once a year or a couple of times a year that one could expect to get a call at short notice?  Is there any discussion or leeway on it or are farmers simply told by the supermarkets to supply the product or it will be sourced elsewhere?  In that context, what type of contracts do farmers have?  Obviously, promotions are over and above the contracts.  What form of contract could a producer in the fruit and vegetable sector expect to have?  What is the typical duration and what certainties are built into it?  Are we seeing a general straying away from contracts or is it that the contracts themselves are not sufficiently robust to give producers the certainty they need to plan into the future and operate normally in the expectation of making an income that would cover the cost of production?</p> <p>  Mr. Foley said that there are issues with regard to the roll-out of producer organisations and I ask him to outline them to us.  How does he see them working and what needs to be done to make them work?  I completely agree with the points he made about the role of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in the future and the importance of the new grocery regulations.  These are absolutely key and we will use our influence here to try to ensure they are as robust as possible.</p></speech>

I will first ask Mr. Brophy to deal with the question on the supermarket strategies in 2013 and 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#H00500"><p>In 2013, the strategy of the supermarkets was simply to increase footfall and they slashed and burned to do so.  It became a race to the bottom, with prices dropping from 39 cent to 29 cent, to 19 cent, to 9 cent and finally to 5 cent per pack or kilo of product, and the supermarkets all followed each other.  The strategy backfired in the end and led to a backlash because people knew it was devaluing all the products.  In 2014, when prices came down, the strategy was slightly different.  The supermarkets started a tendering process whereby producers were asked to tender for their price.  A lot of growers here would not deal directly with all the supermarkets but would deal through a consolidator.  The consolidator would bring them a portfolio of products which could include, for example, ten fruit items and two vegetable items.  It is then open to them to tender for the products but the supermarkets tend to play one against the other to get the best value going forward.  That had a more upsetting effect on prices in 2014.</p> <p>  It was due to pressure on the part of the IFA and other organisations that the supermarkets did not adopt the strategy of cutting the prices to ridiculously low levels.  That was the answer to what happened in 2013.  However, there was some wastage and there was not the same degree of uplift in sales because the volumes were not sold and importers had product in.  We were led to believe that there were significant losses on the part of the retailers and some of the importers of product that was lined up to be brought in.  When the price was not there, the customer was not there.  That was the effect in 2014.</p></speech>

Many producers would have contracts which are not strictly contracts.  I have what I would call arrangements on paper which are not legal agreements.  Under the new laws and the rules of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, if a producer is dealing with a business valued at &euro;50 million or more, that business must issue the producer with a contract.  I would imagine that, going forward, most growers will either have a contract with a supermarket, if they are dealing directly, or with a facilitator.  That will be the law.  The IFA is aware that there are contracts floating around now but a legal agreement will be a requirement in almost every case in the future.</p> <p>  Regarding the legislation, the IFA looked for an ombudsman, having examined the situation in England.  I heard today through Twitter that four supermarkets are in trouble in the UK on foot of investigations.  The IFA has made representations to have some other parts of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission legislation changed.  Those representations are with the Minister at the moment but I do not think he has fully signed off on them yet.  We certainly feel that it is up to the legislators to put the necessary laws in place and to ensure those laws are implemented.  The strength of the new commission will be judged on what it does, how and what it investigates and how much it investigates.  We also feel that adequate resources should be made available to the commission to enable it to do its job properly.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the age profile of growers is one of the most worrying issues.  Indeed, the age profile of this current IFA committee is far lower than any other that I have been on for quite a while.  There are very few young people entering the business and one must ask why that is the case.  Are they afraid of hard work or what is the issue?  The reality is that they do not see themselves making a good enough living out of it.  Unless they can get a proper economic return, they will not go into the business.  My experience is that once a producer stops growing, he or she never goes back to it.  If we lose that critical mass of growers, we will not be able to rebuild the sector.</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle will deal with the questions on potatoes.</p></speech>

We have had our own specific problems in this regard.  Some of the facilitators have arrangements with growers.</p><p>They might have a corps of growers but outside that corps they buy mostly on the open market, or free buy.</p><p> Producers have been treated very badly.  We have had huge crops because of the good weather for the past few years.  Growing conditions across Europe have been very favourable leaving us with crops bigger than anyone would have expected.  High prices in 2012 because of the atrocious weather in that season encouraged some growers to come back into the industry.  We have had a few people growing over and above what they should grow.  It has led to very poor market conditions.  We are struggling to get through this year.  Potato growers are resilient and the good people who have been in the business for years will come through.</p><p> Deputy Barry said we should not be taking land and planting our crops at such high prices.  It is a valid point.  We in the IFA try to make that point to growers and for the most part they are very responsive.  We are getting to grips with the potato problem.  We have a promotion which will go ahead in September and will be very beneficial to the industry.  It will help improve sales, which have been affected by pasta, rice and so on.  Every other carbohydrate on the market is promoted as better than the potato, which sadly it is not.  Our promotion aims to change that and bring the potato back to its former importance in the household.  We work hard on this.  An Bord Bia and the merchants are involved too.  The IFA is pushing it and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very helpful.</p><p> One speaker mentioned labelling but unless we have the legislation behind labelling we will not get anywhere.  We can label but it might only be down to a little stamp on the corner of the carton before one recognises where the product comes from but the consumer does not have time for that.  We need labelling.</p><p> The own brand selling is doing equal harm to our industries in agriculture.  Lidl, Tesco and Dunnes Stores do not produce milk.  Legislators could take this on very easily.  The name of the producer of that item should be given equal space on the carton or package.  Let Tesco, Lidl or Aldi put their names on it but we have to get equal space.  That must be taken into account.</p><p> This issue would be easier to address than below cost selling although it is urgent to address that.  The incessant and relentless pressure of promotions has driven us into the ground.  Someone asked how many are left in the industry.  I would not be able to give numbers on the spot but there are only five or six left in each category of vegetable.  We can put the growers for each code in the country in a car and take them to a meeting.  That is how I see it.  It is why the supermarkets readily support us but their way of supporting us is to get quotes from our competitors and force the cheapest quote on us, regardless of whether we put it in or not.  They are not doing anything illegal but a tender is not a tender when they force a grower down to the cheapest price.  The dunce is running the class in many events in the vegetable industry because the supermarkets have forced us into an unsustainable position.  We are at the last gasp coming in here to speak to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015042100002#J00200"><p>In response to Deputy Barry about below cost selling.  The cost of production is a separate issue.  The supermarkets take a product that has been invoiced to them at between 75 and 80 cent and sell it for 39 cent.  That simple act undermines our livelihoods and those of the small shops which have only a certain amount of products to dilute the effect of the promotions whereas the big supermarkets have thousands of items.  They use the promotion to catch footfall.  It is a very simple equation.  It is selling something below the invoiced cost.  There is no science to it.  That is wrong.  Section 9 of the OECD guidelines for competition state they should conduct "all their activities in a manner consistent with applicable competition laws, taking into account the applicability of the competition laws of jurisdictions whose economies would be likely to be harmed by anti-competitive activity on their part".</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s description of the hourglass was perfect.  There is a narrow band of buyers that can select and use whatever strategy they like and play one of us off against the other.  We deal with a fresh product and do not have the option of moving it into many different outlets.  The tradition of promotions developed many years ago to offload surplus product such as strawberries or tomatoes when they came in as a flush.  We all bought into the strategy because we did not have the refrigeration facilities to keep product fresh for longer.  This has developed on the back of big businesses devising a simple strategy to undermine small, unbranded products.  I can guarantee they would not touch a strong brand and I will not mention any names.  They never appear in these super-sixes.  They pick us off as individuals and use products that are freely available in Europe, and do three to four promotions a year, two of which will fall into a grower&rsquo;s season of production.  They do not give the opportunity to produce for that promotion, not that anybody would because due to variables such as weather one could miss one&rsquo;s mark.  There is a six-week lead-in, which is not enough time.  It takes 20 to 25 weeks to produce my crop.  I cannot gear up with a six-week lead.  The product goes fivefold in sales in the week it is sold.  One cannot fill it, so foreign product comes in to supplement it.  People who have overbought are left with a mess a week or two later when they go off it.</p> <p>  An example of the other collateral damage is if my neighbour is selling something that competes on the shelf with my product.  Customers buy two packs of my product that week and ignore my neighbour&rsquo;s product, which affects him, whether or not he is in the promotion cycle.  The wholesale market is even affected.  The year they did the super sixes at Christmas, when all the supermarkets followed one another like sheep, the people who depended on the traditional wholesale market in Smithfield could not sell their product because the canny traders in Moore Street went into the local discounters, bought the products off the shelf, sold them on their stalls and made more money than if they had bought the product in the wholesale market.  The collateral damage was even wider because people who were not affiliated to the supermarket trade got caught in the crossfire.  It is a huge abuse of market dominance.</p> <p>  The Competition Authority blocked the sale of Aer Lingus to Ryanair on the basis that it would not be good for the country.  This is not good for the country in the long term, economically or socially.  It will wipe out small businesses.  My payroll is over &euro;1 million a year.  What is the spin-off from that to the local economy?  The people I employ go into local shops, even the ones we are giving out about, and spend their money there.  We buy our inputs locally.  This has a huge ripple effect.  While it may be small in the context of the IFA overall, as an employer and cash value business it is a huge issue.</p> <p>  Below cost selling is simply selling something below the invoiced price.  It has nothing to do with the cost of production.  My cost of production is different from other people&rsquo;s cost of production, depending on scale.  They might have the advantage of being small and nimble but we have other competitive advantages having scale.</p><p>The cost of production really has nothing to do with this as this is a case of selling something for less than one has paid for it.  Only the big players can do that because they have the footfall and the other products with which they can catch back the money.</p></speech>

I take Mr. Brophy's point about the invoice cost but it would be naive to say that is a fundamental basic.  We all know about rebates and we all know about scale.  Mr. Brophy knows well that if we brought in something based on the invoice cost, I, or someone else could produce an invoice to the supplier at whatever the supplier wanted and then everyone else is screwed because that invoice is then taken as a template.  That I why I am trying to drill down to the cost of production.  The way this is going to be solved will be with a bottom-up approach where we can actually make a living as primary producers.  I am absolutely sick to the teeth of the primary producer getting fleeced.  Mr. Brophy's case is an extreme version of it.  People are lying to our face and telling us that the public wants it and that they are doing a public service; they are not.  However, rebates exist.  In fairness, we cannot get away from cost of production.  The retailer pays the supplier but at the end of the day I ask who is paying for the promotions.</p> <p>  I am being told that people are paying for marketing support, which is "hello money" under a different form.  I am hearing that there are certain people paying directly to get their products into prominent positions.  If what I am hearing at this meeting that the retailers are paying the growers for the product, they are dropping the price dramatically so everyone else is getting hammered.  There seems to be a web of intrigue and it is a case of whatever they can decide or dream up at short notice.  If we could be supplied with a list of where the major abuses occur, even without names, it would be really helpful as a way to begin untangling this.  If we follow the money we will get to where the problem is.  I know that some of these multiples do not supply their accounts in Ireland but if we follow the money of where the suppliers are supplying we will get to where the abuse is happening.  It is good to hear this because at least, now, we have growers who are willing to say, "Stop" and we have not had that up to now.</p></speech>

Is there any evidence that money has to be paid in advance, the &quot;hello money&quot; or whatever?  From what I hear from different people the &quot;hello money&quot; is a requirement in order to get a product on the shelves of supermarkets.  Has Mr. Brophy any evidence of this practice?</p><p>Following from a question I asked, I refer to the balance between the initiative taken by EU Commissioner Hogan on this matter compared to the Irish solution.  When we were dealing with this matter a year and a half ago we were castigated in a <i>Sunday Independent </i>article by an individual who has since become a part-time politician, that we were not looking after the consumer.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was lumped in with us at the time and we were seen as a group of Fine Gael farmers who had only one item on their agenda and that was to look after our own people as such.  Where does Mr. Brophy see the balance being?  We could be accused again.  We are all on the same side here but the consumer side will be used by the multiples who will maintain they are looking after the consumers and giving them what they want.</p></speech>

I think we can fight back on that one.  A lot of urban people understand the concept of fair trade coffee.  They understand that coffee growers should get a fair return on the coffee bean.  In fairness to them, some of the most urbanised people in this country will go to the Fairtrade shop to do their business because they do not believe in exploitation.  I have been down in north Dublin a few times and I think what is going on here is a hugely damaging exploitation, not only of farmers but of the Irish industry and that unless we as a people stand up, we will not have a native farm-led horticultural industry in the country.</p> <p>  We need to explain to consumers that if they want consistent supplies of Irish vegetables, potatoes and fruit, the first thing to know is whether the product is Irish and when it is not; whether it is fresh and when it is not.  More people are environmentally aware and many people have an objection to huge air miles being involved in importing products that could be produced at home.  Therefore, I think this committee has a role, through the State agencies, as happened in the case of NDC milk.  We are very good at labelling beef.  It is very interesting to watch all the major supermarkets putting up big billboards saying, "We only sell Irish beef".  They know that the consumer buys into that idea.  We have to get the message across that where possible the consumer knows when a product is imported and when it is Irish.  That relates to the point made by Mr. Brophy about the own brand which was discussed but we did not reach a final conclusion.</p> <p>  The own brand issue is a huge issue in farm products.  For example, with reference to the attraction of own brand products, two cartons of milk will be produced in the same dairy out of the same milk but one will be cheaper.  My belief is that the answer is very simple.  Whereas if in the case of the branded product the supplier is changed from one dairy to another, the customer will know but in the case of the unbranded product this can be swapped around anyway, the supplier can be changed and nobody knows.  The consumer is entitled to know who and where has provided the product.  I remember seeing in French supermarkets many years ago that the sheep farmer who produced the lamb was identified.  Should we insist that the consumer should know from the label who produced the vegetables and fruit and where they were produced?  Should there be country of origin law introduced and the Tricolour only permitted to be used to show that the produce was genuinely produced in this country?  There should be none of this washing and packing products and calling it an Irish carrot.  We could explore together how information could be given to consumers because I do not underestimate the consumer if given the right choice.  </p> <p>  I refer to the six big supermarkets without naming them.  We know who are the big players.  Do they count for 80% or 90% of products sold?  I refer to small greengrocers and small corner shops.  I am counting SuperValu as being one of the big supermarkets because it is part of Musgrave.  Are we reliant on 90% or 80% of products going through the big five, through the narrowest part of the hour glass?</p> <p>  Exploitation is exploitation where somebody in a dominant position abuses that dominance.  Up to now, European law has always been concerned with abuse of dominance against the consumer.  This is not just an Irish problem, the EU has made it absolutely clear to us it is a pan-European problem.  We need to work on this as a pan-European problem as well as a local problem.</p><p>We need local legislation as it is quicker to implement.  We also need tightening of regulations and so on.</p><p> If we want to retain European agriculture as it is - we are not the country with the largest number of horticultural farmers - we have to press Europe so that they absolutely control the dominants.  I am delighted that Commissioner Hogan has taken up the banner on this since he became the Commissioner.  Certainly the Commission officials are very supportive of his position.  However, we need to push this home.  First, something he can do quickly is to publish information.  He can then introduce regulations which would be a bit slower and take more time.  The more the information on issues such as labelling, pricing, margins and so forth is in the public domain the more we can educate consumers that it is not really in their interests.</p><p> I never came across a supermarket that operated as a charity.  We need to be blunt.  The supermarkets might offer vegetables, which are grand and healthy, at very low prices.  However, as customers come to the checkout with children they offer chocolate, Coca Cola and other soft drinks on which they are making a killing.  Any newspaper that claims that they are out to help the consumer is being very na&iuml;ve about supermarkets.  Supermarkets are interested in one thing, profit.  We should send out that message clearly.  They will manipulate everybody, including consumers, to make that profit.  It is always very interesting to watch the layout of the supermarket, including the location of sweets as last-minute buys where children can stick out their hands.</p><p> We need to get across the message that we are not anti-consumer, but the consumer is also the producer and depends on the producer to create the wealth for the country.  We have to fight back on that issue.  As a committee we should jointly reject that we are anti-consumer, but we are very much for maintaining this industry for this country.</p></speech>

Presuming that bag of carrots is not sold below cost, are the witnesses claiming that Irish growers are worse off if their carrots are sold in that way than if they are sold loose and the consumer can select and weigh them?  Is there a difference in what the producer gets or is there concern other than purely the amount of money the grower gets?</p></speech>

Some of the smaller processors have indicated that own-brands have a role to play.  That is not in fruit and vegetables obviously, but mainly in secondary processed foods.  However, their overuse creates a masking effect.  That is why we did not want to make a recommendation.  We addressed the matter in a full paragraph in page 21 of our report, which stated, "The committee considers that own-brand products give too much power to the retailer and make it too easy for them to substitute".</p></speech>

I think I have been in three or four of them over the years.  They come and go for various reasons.  For those making investments it is a huge area of support from within the EU.  There seem to be major difficulties in drawing down the money.  There are two cases at the moment, one involving a mushroom PO and another involving a salads and tomato PO.  They are not able to draw down through some of the regulations.  In my capacity as chairman of the horticulture forum, I have written to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on the issue.  On Friday I received a reply which we need to digest.  His letter concedes that the rules are quite restrictive and need to be reviewed.  There seems to be one rule in one country and then when applied in our country it is different.</p> <p>  On the PO side I can speak for the people who are having difficulties.  They certainly felt the Department approved their plan of action but they were unable to draw down the money when it came about.  That is the argument that has been put to me.  They are in continuing discussions with the Department.  Of a &euro;5 million drawdown they will lose at least &euro;1 million and it could be higher; I am not 100% sure of that figure.</p> <p>  Vegetable growers have been very reluctant to join POs because of the restrictions as well as the massive amount of paperwork and cost.  Representatives of one PO recently told me that the cost of drawing down the money nearly negated the amount of money they were getting.  It is being reviewed at European level.  It is a very good avenue.</p> <p>  In conjunction with Bord Bia, the IFA looked at the whole PO situation in Ireland.  About two years ago a report was commissioned and we carried out an investigation as to the best way to move forward.  Through the horticulture forum we are trying to get a pilot scheme to get some vegetable growers to move halfway into the PO to try to move things forward.  I believe the EU allocated &euro;800 million last year towards PO and we are only drawing down a tiny amount of it.</p> <p>  Any proposed legislation needs to be two-pronged.  We need national and European legislation.  On a national level we have an opportunity at the moment.  The door is not quite fully shut on the Commission as to any changes that could be made.  It is very important that we push that as far as we can.  It is also important that the Government keeps the pressure on Commissioner Hogan to deliver on what he is saying.  Some MEPs have spoken in favour of some sort of legislation.  Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, was very vocal in what she said.  I would encourage any possibility of introducing legislation in Europe.  We believe that below-cost selling is totally anti-competitive and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  On the labelling issue, I do not know any vegetable grower who is not a member of Bord Bia or does not use the Irish logo.  In order to place the Bord Bia logo on produce, a producer must have an identification number.  It is not up to farmers or the IFA to check those kinds of things.  It is up to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  We have always been pressing for more checks in this area.</p> <p>  On the matter of costings, we are investigating the possibility of cost plus, where we look at the cost of production and we then determine what margin we need to sustain the business and reinvest, which is terribly important.</p><p>I hope that is the direction in which we move in future. </p></speech>

What is the impact of own brands on fresh vegetables?  Is it simply that they allow companies to switch suppliers?

We highlighted this issue in December 2013.  Last Christmas, the joint committee welcomed a commitment from the retail multiples that they would not engage in a price war.  We were chastised for our position and there was some spin and counter-spin, with the committee being accused of being in breach of competition law.  I should clarify that we asked the multiples not to engage in a price war.  We did not ask them to set a minimum price, much as we may have liked them to do so.</p> <p>  We found during our hearings with the major multiples and their representative organisations that they became very defensive when challenged on issues such as "hello" money.  As the retailers have shown over the years, there is more than one way to skin a cat, even if hello money, as we understand the practice, is not used.  We need to be vigilant, as the price war and tendering issues have highlighted.  </p> <p>  The door is still open in respect of introducing national regulations.  We must ensure that enforceable regulations are introduced, with statutory powers of oversight.  We were reassured by officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that companies found to be in breach of the law were engaged in a higher class of criminal act.  It would be interesting to find out how the United Kingdom authorities deal with four retailers.  I hope they will be named and shamed.  </p> <p>  The issue boils down to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point on the need for fair trade for all.   It is the European Union's stated objective that everyone should be able to secure a viable income.  The industry will not survive otherwise.  Mr. Brophy referred to the size of his payroll in the context of a provincial town.  It must be very important to the area in question.  If production is lost and everything arrives in a chilled truck or container, it will not return because people who give up growing fruit and vegetables do not start again.  I am something of a veteran in this regard.  Many years ago, I used to visit the vegetable market at 5 a.m. on most Mondays.  I did not do so because I like to get up early.  As with everything else, one does what one is paid to do.  </p> <p>  I will circulate a strong statement on this issue to members.  We welcome the evidence we have received on various practices in the sector, which the witnesses did not discuss in detail for understandable reasons.  The joint committee will play its part.  As the witnesses have seen, there is all-party agreement on this issue and all sides fully supported the report we published in October 2013.  </p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the IFA's protected vegetables and crops committee, Mr. Foley, Mr. Brophy, Mr. Grimes and Mr. Doyle, for appearing before us.</p></speech>

What I want to present today is a project funded under the EU as a Creative Edge project with a number of partners including the Western Development Commission and partners in Finland and Sweden.  This will give the committee a sense of some practical pilot initiatives we have used to try and support the creative economy, given its importance in terms of both urban and regional focus.  Our project is a &euro;1.1 million project that finished in 2013.  We focused on three key areas: the roles of people, place and creative production, and the milieu of those three areas coming together to form a very vibrant creative economy.</p><p>A lot of research has been carried out examining the creative economy in an urban area.  This is the first time that a major research project has had an applied focus to look at this issue in a rural context.  There are many definitions of the creative economy.  Dr. Pat Collins and I are reconceptualising the way one would look at the creative economy, which would include creative expression, such as music and visual-audio performing arts, creative application and creative technology.  This is the way we examined the creative economy in the west of Ireland, Northern Ireland, northern Sweden and Finland.<br/><br/>This is the first pioneering mapping, at a very micro level, of the creative economy in rural areas of peripheral parts of Europe.  As part of the project, we established creative hubs.  Our colleagues in Northern Ireland looked at using vacant buildings to support the creative economy.  We also examined the possibilities associated with our website, <i>mycreativeedge.eu, </i>and ways a portal can support and internationalise creatives.  That was led by the Western Development Commission.  We had mentoring and training programmes.  All of these were successful pilot initiatives that made a difference in supporting the creative economy. <br/><br/>If we take the west of Ireland as an example, on the slide is a visualisation of the sector when looking at application, creation and expression.  We would consider it to be  a diverse sector which crosses a number of different areas.  Cultural consumption is important in terms of the number of theatres, museums and culture and heritage sites.  These are the science parks of the creative economy in terms of supporting and enabling people to access those. <br/><br/>There is an overall high-level mapping, which is available online if committee members are interested in looking at it in terms of their own context.  This is the high-level picture in terms of the areas that we looked at.  If we take the audio-visual sector, which is very important in Galway and the west, we see that it is very highly concentrated.  When we come down to the micro-level, we can see that there is a high concentration of audio-visual sector initiatives in Connemara, which is a result, I suppose, of TG4 and the evolution of that sector there.  My colleague, Dr. Pat Collins, has done a lot of work in terms of understanding that significant cluster.  <br/><br/>The other important part of it concerns creative education.  We mapped the creative education institutions on the island of Ireland.  We identified approximately 3,000 graduate places.  There is a need to grow that sector.  Graduates from creative courses are four times more likely to create jobs or to be entrepreneurial.  They are very significant in terms of job creation and enterprise.<br/><br/>We also created a portal.  Many of the creative companies are micro, one or two person, operations, although some of them are bigger.  The Western Development Commission pioneered <i>mycreativeedge.eu</i>.  This is a portal which a creative can join and put up a profile at no cost.  This has been very effective in terms of internationalisation, generating more business and creating a profile for the creatives.  In the first few months, up until 2013, 500 businesses had registered with it and it had approximately 36,000 unique visits.  For creative industries and one or two person operations, this is a vital source to give them greater visibility.  <br/><br/>In the survey, respondents said they wanted networking opportunities and more customised supports.  They were seeking a strong international orientation and better mentoring in terms of working with colleagues and building their businesses.  <br/><br/>Our colleagues in SEED in Northern Ireland established creative hubs.  This might be relevant in terms of vacant buildings throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  They created a template and a toolkit and they set up four hubs during the course of the projects.  These hubs are not-for-profit.  One or two people can go into a location and set up their businesses.  They receive mentoring and there is a whole stakeholder engagement which goes behind that so that these become sustainable hubs for creative enterprises.  This has been very successful in Ume&aring; in Sweden.<br/><br/>Our colleagues in Sweden pioneered the mentoring aspect.  They also pioneered working with creatives, graduates working with business and creating international meeting points.  Finally, our colleagues in Finland pioneered the idea of creative education, internationally, across the four partners, getting them to work with businesses in terms of the creative economy and looking at how they utilise their cross-media skills, which included working with a tyre company to create new products and services.</p><p>This is a critical sector for the national economy, one that would equate in terms of time to medical devices and ICT.  It is undervalued and needs to be recognised more in terms of coherence and in terms of policy.  We also suggest there be more detailed data, similar to what we have pioneered in this project to really map out the rest of the clusters of creative activity throughout Ireland because they are really important to society, rural society, and also in terms of economy.  In some senses if one has vibrancy in terms of creative activity and consumption, and also in terms of creation, they are like having many foreign direct investment companies in particular locations.  They keep coherency and vibrancy in the local economy.</p><p> We also would argue that there needs to be greater coherence at a policy level on co-ordination between the different actors responsible for this sector.  Our analysis of Sweden and Finland proves that better policy co-ordination, better regional supports and a more customised approach works and helps in terms of the sectors growing and flourishing.  We suggest having a ten-year plan to redevelop the sector, similar to successful models that have been followed for other sectors such as ICT, medical devices, life sciences, etc.  We are finding that there is a great appetite from the creatives in terms of the willingness and need to develop this sort of support.</p><p> When looked at from a regional and peripheral perspective, the place is the aspect that needs to be protected but also the place helps to harness the uniqueness.  Catalysts such as the specialised programmes we have just outlined will help to create new networks and create activity in terms of the internationalisation that is required.  Our project has shown us that we can create great connections on a pan-European basis between peripheral regions, working together to boost the economic activity in international trade.  Better use of broadband and access to all those kinds of things are critical.</p><p> On cultural consumption, 80% of consumption of cultural products comes from seven categories, the highest being television, radio and Internet.  It is very important that Ireland is well positioned in these cultural categories to be a very strong and dominant force internationally.  There needs to be more analysis of content because this is at the cutting edge.</p><p> On education, there needs to be enhanced, broadened understanding of skillsets, discipline and connections.  More data need to be collected in terms of creative education.  As we would do for other sectors, there is a need for creative innovation hubs throughout the country - mini ones like the creative hubs that we have pioneered with our project.</p><p> Those are just some thoughts we have on a project we have run for the past three years and also the research we have done for the past five years in this sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cathal O'Donoghue" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#F00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to appear today.  I will speak about a document prepared by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, both in its report and its research report.  I acknowledge the input from my colleagues who are present.  It very much drew upon work within the Western Development Commission and NUI Galway.</p> <p>  Within the commission we regard the creative sector as being very important.  We devoted an entire chapter to it in the research report and there were some very specific recommendations for the sector, recognising the importance to which Dr. Cunningham referred.  It is a relatively varied sector building upon performance and expression, technology, and applications such as arts and crafts, etc.  It is recognised as a sector that can have an important impact, particularly in rural and more peripheral areas.</p> <p>  OECD research has shown that up to the middle of the last decade, the creative economy grew at twice the annual rate of the service industry and four times that of manufacturing.  There is a very high growth potential particularly for the sectors linked into the knowledge economy.</p><p>Given the structure of those businesses, they can be complementary to the needs of rural economic development.  The Western Development Commission highlighted the fact there are 5,000 businesses and 11,000 direct employees.  This is, therefore, a relatively big sector in the west.</p><p> The creative economy is a strength and has a competitive advantage for Ireland's rural regions, drawing upon our rural image and capitalising on the creative strengths, thus being a potential source of employment.  WDC research shows there is a difference between urban and rural creative industries, with the creative industries in rural areas drawing more upon the land and building, for example, fashion clusters in Donegal and craft clusters in Connemara and places like Offaly and Westmeath.  The WDC forecast estimates there are 17,000 potential jobs in the western region alone.</p><p> Some of the potential advantages of the sector are due to the fact it is an important indigenous sector providing incomes that benefit people living in Ireland.  It has strong growth potential, in line with other aspects of the economy, and often produces high-quality jobs, particularly in the locations in which they are based and especially in more peripheral areas where there may be fewer quality employment opportunities.  As a knowledge and creative sector, the sector can help stimulate innovation in the wider economy, particularly given its links with other sectors.  It can also play an important social role in making an area more attractive.  If there is a strong creative sector in an area, this can have spin-off effects on tourism and other visitor-based businesses and, as a result of its location, can promote rural and regional development.</p><p> As in all other economic sectors, people are important drivers for this sector, along with their skills, creativity and innovation.  However, there are skill needs.  The location of an industry relates to the attraction of a region, in terms of landscape, heritage, infrastructure, social network and quality of life.  This feeds in both directions, both drawing upon the environment in which it is based and contributing to the view of that area.  As in other sectors, creative supports relate to the infrastructure that can facilitate development, whether funding, networking opportunities, marketing capabilities and infrastructure, especially broadband infrastructure for IT-based businesses.  This is critical and was the number one requirement at every meeting CEDRA had throughout the country.</p><p> Our document provides a SWOT analysis.  I will not go through all the detail on that, but I will mention some of the high-level strengths, such as the high level, quality and diverse mix of skills throughout the country, the natural attributes of locations, and the creative supports where there is critical mass, particularly in Galway, Sligo and Leitrim.  On some of the opportunities, there are hidden skills and skills that are not marketed which do not generate an economic return within the sector.  There are also possibilities of having more businesses within unspoilt landscapes and opportunities for more export access.  A theme across rural economic development concerns how we move from supplying to a local economy to a global economy.</p><p> Some of the weaknesses in the sector are not unique to the creative sector and are typical of SMEs elsewhere, for example, capacity and business skills.  This fundamental gap was identified across the CEDRA report.  There may also be gaps in creative skills, for example, where we want to change the way we do things.  There are also gaps in terms of the availability of low-cost workspaces and challenges in terms of networking.  Some of the threats are the loss of key skilled people and, perhaps, a policy of focusing on attracting new skills rather than sustaining and encouraging existing skills.  Gaps in infrastructure also exist and we also face some of the other issues in terms of SME development, such as funding.</p><p> In regard to policy, concern was expressed in the report on the multitude and different sources of support and advice on capacity building.  This is not unique to the creative sector.</p><p>That was the fundamental point made across the CEDRA report, and the 21st recommendation in that report was the development of a co-ordinated strategy for the creative industries that places a specific focus on potential to contribute to the development of the rural economy, with consideration given to a specific mechanism that combines the creative economy's support competencies with the relevant Departments, many of which have been mentioned, as well as existing lead agencies.  In particular, there is the Western Development Commission, the Crafts Council of Ireland, the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board.  This should introduce a more integrated approach to funding in line with the overall approach advocated by the commission.</p><p> Fundamentally, the challenge in promoting rural economic development highlighted in CEDRA was the lack of co-ordination.  There are many institutions involved in supporting sectors but the question remains as to who is choreographing or directing all these different activities in particular directions.  In particular, we highlight the gaps within the creative sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Brannigan" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#H00200"><p>The Western Development Commission, WDC, formally expresses its gratitude to the committee and its members for the invitation today to make a presentation on the creative economy.  As my colleagues have already mentioned, we will address some of the national case but, more specifically, the regional case for the creative economy that we have discovered in our work.<br/><br/>As members know, the WDC has a statutory remit to foster and promote economic growth in the seven counties of the west.  We have a vision, as expressed in the notes available to members, about making a confident global region and all that pertains to that in the creative economy.  However, we are involved with much more than the creative economy.  We promote our region to individuals and enterprise globally and we have in excess of 1 million visits to the request website.  Through policy, access to finance instruments and innovative development programmes with partners, we have supported 1,899 jobs in recent tough times.  As such, we would welcome more time to discuss such issues with committee members under the theme of broader economic development.<br/><br/>There is a question of why we would consider the creative economy, and that has already been addressed by colleagues today.  It is globally important and of growing significance to advanced, knowledge-based economies.  Equally, for us, it is unique in a regional sense in that it is one of the few industrial sectors where growing thought indicates that jobs tend to follow people in the creative class rather than people following jobs, which has traditionally been the <i>modus operandi</i>.  Growing research also demonstrates that regions in particular are well suited to exploit this creative economy due to certain factors inherent within them.<br/><br/>The WDC has mapped, with partners, the creative economy in our region, and that forms much of the discussion today.  As has been mentioned, we have engaged with National University of Ireland, Galway, and the Whitaker Institute, Teagasc and others, as well as Oxford Economics.  Some of the key findings have been circulated to members.  The creative economy in our region is a sector employing almost 11,000 people directly.  It is a sector which engages nearly 5,000 businesses and it also earned more than &euro;534 million.  It also offers opportunities, and we know there is a very big opportunity now with exports.  That line is often trotted out but we have measured it through commissioned work.  There is a very low participation rate in exports among creative businesses and the value is very low indeed.  As such, that gives us good headroom in which to get products to a global market.  As has been mentioned by my colleagues, quality of life is essential to the discussion about the creative economy.  It begets success in many other industries and some would argue it is also the seed of innovation, and many of the regions in our country would be eternally grateful if we could move along in that respect.<br/><br/>That, in broad brush strokes, is the case for this being a significant sector.  We can consider what we have done in the previous six or seven years.  Along with partners such as the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, NUIG and the Whitaker Institute, Teagasc, the local authorities and many others, nationally as well as internationally, we in the WDC and through the good work of my colleague, Ms Pauline White, and others have engaged in trying to have a programme to develop growth areas within the creative economy.  We have some ideas on what has worked and what has not.</p><p>As members have already heard, we have put in significant effort in the Creative Edge, which has garnered 550 international businesses in the creative economy, allowing them to access global markets.  It is a beginning, not an end, but the access is now established.  Through another programme, Creative Momentum, we have an international expertise to assist growing in new markets and new product development.  For example, Finnish expertise is helping Irish capital to come together for new product development, which is always a good thing.  What is important from the point of view of the WDC, given our western investment fund and our background in venture capital, VC, expertise, we have an access to finance instrument, a micro-loan ability up to &euro;25,000.  We have earmarked &euro;1 million over three years.  That is giving creative economy businesses access to seed capital in terms of export growth.</p><p> In total, the Western Development Commission, WDC, with partners, has sourced and is directing almost &euro;4 million of risk capital to this critical sector, &euro;2 million of which is directly in the region.  For us, the creative economy is indigenous.  It is also immutable in that it is bound within our region.  That is really important because it gives different ways in which to tackle the creative economy, both in the urban centres and in the rural centres depending on the regional identity.  The simplest way to put it is that people come to my region to be creative because they are inspired by it.  They do not want Temple Bar any more.  They are looking for other ways in which to create goods and services and we need to get them to the world.  We are helping them to try to do that.</p><p> I will not go into the reasons the region is so inspiring.  We have a lot of data on it, but I will just mention some key points.  Galway is a UNESCO designated city of film.  Music and literature from the west is famous nationally and internationally.  In Yeats we have an iconic poet and in 2015 we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of his birth.  This is a national commemoration with which the west is proud to be associated, not just from a commemorative aspect but also from an enterprise and entrepreneurial aspect.  We have Aosd&aacute;na communities and film and audiovisual clusters.  We have all the components to make a world class global economy within our region and we believe that it is also the national story.  It is not just us.  As has been mentioned, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, has earmarked the creative economy as one of the areas of diversification in the rural economy.  We commend it in that regard and will work with it to achieve that goal.  The Action Plan for Jobs, an innovation of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has earmarked the creative industries for the deepest consideration in terms of support.</p><p> In essence, the WDC has sought to showcase innovatively and support this highly indigenous and sustainable sector within our region.  The next step in the vision is to grow the sector significantly in the coming years, with product development and exports being the key areas of development.  The WDC is working with national, regional and international partners and businesses to implement this using private sector, national and European funding.</p><p> To enable this transformation and have the creative economy truly become of global stature, it is essential to evolve the national support narrative to access broader enterprise development programs for the creative economy.  It cannot just be grant funded; it needs more sophisticated instruments of support.  Due to the highly indigenous, specialised and geographically rooted nature of enterprises in the creative sector, the WDC would strongly recommend consideration of a permanent regional creative sector development function to be established.  This would greatly accelerate realisation of a vision to create a global indigenous sector in the west and other regions and realise the revenue opportunities there.  Once again, I offer many thanks for the kind invitation and consideration of committee members.</p></speech>

Mr. Brannigan referred to 11,000 people being employed directly in the creative economy.  Would they all respond that they are working in the creative economy or would they say they are working in film. fashion or crafts, for example?  Is the term "creative economy" widely used to describe the overall sector?</p> <p>  Reference was also made to the unique potential of the region.  In what respects does Mr. Brannigan consider the regions to be unique?  He also referred to the Action Plan for Jobs.  Does the WDC have a particular role in the Action Plan for Jobs?</p> <p>  Professor O'Donoghue mentioned the CEDRA report, which is very important in this entire area.  Does he think it has the potential to deliver or what investment is needed to expand the sector?</p><p> Could Dr. Cunningham indicate whether the university courses are geared towards the creative industries?  Is there stakeholder engagement in terms of identifying courses, and what courses in particular do NUIG and other universities offer within the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Brannigan" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#K00200"><p>I will take the questions in order if that is okay.  To answer Deputy Kyne's first question, I do not yet think we are at the point where people feel they are part of the creative economy.  He is correct that someone working in the creative economy would consider himself or herself to be a jeweller, craftsperson or potter.  That is fine.  We do not need to change that.  The use of the term "creative economy" is one to use simply from a support and branding point of view, and it is important to be known as a global creative region rather than tinkering with the personality and brand identity of individual producers.</p> <p>  I could go into a lot of detail in terms of unique potential in the region.  The approach is twofold.  First, the quality of life attracts people to live there.  Addressing broadband and access infrastructure allows people to work there.  The second thing is that there are specific sectoral issues that are very welcoming to people within certain areas.  For example, a lot of world class photographers come to the west.  We did a bit of research on NUIG on the reason that was happening.  It turns out it is because of the light changes.  We always talk about the weather but it means that one photograph can be taken on a given day in several different lighting conditions and it looks good.  That is a reason a lot of photographers go there as well as the quality of life.</p> <p>  The last question related to the WDC's role in the Action Plan for Jobs.  I am very happy to say that we are very much involved.  To date, we have been involved in two to three of the regional workshops with the Minister.  We have been fully involved in that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cathal O'Donoghue" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#K00300"><p>In terms of the CEDRA recommendation, the fundamental objective across sectors is to have improved co-ordination of the instruments of the State to better generate rural economic development.  Very often that is a cross-cutting challenge.  We organise ourselves within the State in terms of sectors, industries or pillars and whether it be creative industries or rural economic development in general, it is a cross-cutting goal.  That is very hard.  An outcome of the report was the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, as the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs.  That is a start in terms of co-ordination.  She has established an interdepartmental group where members of a variety of different agencies meet regularly and are preparing an implementation committee.  Fundamentally, that is hard.  A challenge to the group is the availability of human resources.  Perhaps more staff time could be made available to facilitate co-ordination.  Many of those involved in the co-ordination of the CEDRA measures have busy jobs and other things to do.  It is a challenge to deliver.  It is going in the right direction in terms of the structures that are being set up but perhaps more could be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Cunningham" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#K00400"><p>In regard to university courses, Dr. Patrick Collins and I mapped the island of Ireland.  We identified 385 programmes on offer.  Application focuses on music, creative expression and technology.  We recommend that could be enhanced and grown.  We found a lot of evidence of collaboration with industry partners in terms of students having opportunities to work with creative companies and various businesses.  When one looks at our colleagues in Finland and Sweden it is clear that could be even further enhanced.  It is necessary to grow the capacity.  If the industry is to grow as a whole, we need to ensure there is creative talent in terms of the early stage career graduates but also in terms of people who want to get into the industry in later life or want to change career direction.  There is a clear need to retain graduates in order that they could explore the creation of their own business within a university or institute of technology environment, and that they would be supported and mentored in doing that.  For example, we looked at the Finnish example of the pro-academy.</p><p>They have a different model of education and spend three years working on a business idea.  They take some courses and are self-managed and self-taught.  They have creative champions who mentor them through that process.  These are innovative ideas that could be brought here to expand capacity within the third level sector and support the growth of the sector as a whole.</p></speech>

There were international teams which interacted with very experienced entrepreneurs in the creative economy from different backgrounds such as film.  It is a showcase to show that they are exposed to these role models and can see there is a possibility of creating a business.  The evidence is that there is a great deal of this happening in the Irish system; however, it could be enhanced and developed to encourage the young people concerned to start their businesses, perhaps not immediately but later, and create the connections between industry, the university sector and graduates.</p></speech>

I am very impressed by their creative vision, with which I was not familiar.  It reminds me of the Kilkenny Design Centre.  When it started, it was very sophisticated and there was a Nordic influence on the artists involved.  The problem is that the products are not expensive enough for a real business to add value to their basic material.  The delegates are pioneers.  Do they interact with the local enterprise boards, LEOs?  I know from experience that creativity and innovation go nowhere if they do not have that business ability.  The LEOs want to develop businesses, for which creativity is critical.  It takes innovation to develop a product that is different.</p></speech>

The LEOs would love to help us if we could join the dots.  We work with local authorities, but we need to work more because we need to broaden the partnership to realise this objective.  The LEOs are a very important instrument.</p></speech>

If we could work with them in terms of providing guidance and oversight, that would be very effective, but we are not quite at that point.  We aspire to reach it, which is why we have made the recommendation to ask the committee to please help us to have that type of influence.</p></speech>

Some years ago I was invited to become an adjunct professor of management in NUIG.  At the time I asked what the word &ldquo;adjunct&rdquo; meant and was told it meant one was not paid.  I found it a very interesting and exciting task because the then president of the college said it was concerned about the criticism, a criticism that could be levelled at any institute, that it would become theoretical rather than practical.  It wanted to have enough people there who actually had experience of business or creativity.  How do the delegates manage to achieve this?  How do they manage to coax their clients to meet people who have been in business, worked at it and succeeded, or perhaps failed, but who at least have that experience?  Do they not find this difficult?</p></speech>

One of the key issues for WDC is market led, taking the jargon away, speaking to the people who are doing it to find out.  In this case, what I said in the presentation was that in Creative Edge and the Whitaker Institute, Ms Pauline White and others have managed to get 550 businesses interacting with us so we can survey them and talk to them.  This has been the case since the beginning.  When we did the original creative west piece of analysis for the 11,000 jobs, we interviewed 350 organisations, some 200 businesses.  That was critical to that research being good.  It became more econometric analysis as opposed to just market research.</p> <p>  It is critical to talk to the businesses.  There is also an issue where we are trying to work with these people to change the mindset.  There has been a slight dependency culture over the years within the creative sector.  We are talking about loans and financial instruments which are much broader-based but had to change thinking.  There is a service shared learning there.  It does not succeed every time but we try to feed back in and especially through NUIG and the Whitaker Institute though having engaged with real businesses.  We also have international comparators with Finland, Sweden, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  One gets a bit kudos from talking about people overseas and sharing that type of knowledge.  I guess that is how we get them to engage but engaging with the business is critical to what we have done.</p></speech>

We have 43,000 fee paying clients and hundreds of food businesses, both SME and large, who are clients.  The research and the activities we undertake follow very much what the industry is looking for.  We are not just followers, we also try to lead the industry as a development agency.  Members of the board are members of the industry.  We have stakeholder committees in each of the commodity areas and that defines our programme each year.  We are strongly imbedded within the industry with a very practical and applied focus.  In terms of our science, really high quality science, we would be comparable to the universities in terms of quality but we work in a narrow area in a specific industry.</p></speech>

In terms of the public mind, generally the small companies get shouldered out of the limelight by the larger ones.  When an announcement is being made about multinationals coming in, it is the first items on the news and newspapers and everybody is talking about it but the media tends to ignore the smaller initiatives such as those the representatives are promoting.  I am aware they promote all of them but, in general, they get a bad press and do not get the kind of publicity they deserve.  If there are ten companies which have five people each employed, that is 50.  When all of those are added the figures are significant.  There is a disparity of esteem about the operation, status and significance of the smaller companies.  I wish to give one example from my own experience in County Donegal.  When Radio na Gaeltachta was established in the peripheral areas of south west Donegal and north west Donegal, the Irish language was not considered a posh vernacular.  Younger people, in particular, were indifferent towards it, despite schools and their best efforts.  When Radio na Gaeltachta was established it had a very significant impact on promoting the language.  Once something was on the radio people saw it differently.  They heard their tongue being spoken on the radio with very important matters, such as current affairs and sport, being discussed.  It changed the psychology of people in the area to the extent that people thought that if the language could become important nationally, other things could be promoted nationally.</p><p>I know many younger entrepreneurs who have a great sense of get up and go to do things.  Many small companies in the tourism industry organise fishing trips, mountain climbing and other activities using local resources that were underused or perhaps never used properly.  The presence of Radio na Gaeltachta has provided a very strong psychological impulse.  Apart from the language, there are other things that are important.  In other places such as County Donegal there are small but vibrant and important local industries which together have a great impact.  That point struck me when the speakers mentioned that smaller businesses were as important in many ways as larger businesses that were in the limelight.</p></speech>

In the SME sector there is a substantial number of jobs provided, even more than the number available in the larger business sector.  There are as many people living in small and medium-sized towns as there are in the greater Dublin area, but often national policies skim over their importance.  To deliver rural economic development one needs to meet the needs of both segments, as stated throughout our report.</p></speech>

There is a need for investment in infrastructure, including theatres, museums and tourist trails.  In reference to our colleagues in Northern Ireland, there is a need for creative hubs, places where people can meet in different types of network.  My colleague, Dr. Pat Collins, has shown that TG4 has spawned a global audio visual sector that employs in of the order of 600 people.  It is growing and international in its orientation.  What we have found in looking at Finland and Sweden is the importance of the economy, society and culture coming together.  These three elements when fused together give long-term sustainability because they are grounded in people's entrepreneurial and creative ability.  If it is harnessed and supported in a customised way, depending on the needs of a locality or particular region, it proves to be sustainable.  Clearly, in terms of growth rates, this sector is out-performing many others that we think are very successful.  There is sustainability and at its heart is uniqueness.</p></speech>

Sometimes small is beautiful because, as well as being indigenous and immutable, it is rooted to whatever it is, which is always good.  The sector has a really powerful dynamic.  People will participate in it for a lot less than they would in others.  Speaking plainly, in gross value added, GVA, terms, what they will accept to be involved in this sector is way below what one would normally expect because they want to be involved in it for quality of life reasons, which is fantastic.  That means that one can have a vibrant society in a peripheral area because people want to live there and will be happy to accept a salary of &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 as opposed to &euro;60,000.  That is why some of the projections of 17,000 and 19,000 jobs within ten years seem to be aggressive until one looks at the GVA figures.</p><p>They are quite low.  It is &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000.  Many of the jobs are seasonal, part-time and lifestyle related.  That is the nature of it.  It is not any less valuable - small is beautiful - but it sustains a rural and peripheral community at a fraction of the cost of bringing in a large multinational.  While a multinational might be a nice solution - and I am not against it having worked for one for 15 years - this is a perfect balance because it achieves the same thing with people who will never leave because they are rooted.</p></speech>

It is a very important area.  As someone who came home in the 1980s after doing a commerce degree to tell the family I was going to become an actor when most of my friends were working in the fish factory, I can understand exactly what the witnesses are expressing and the type of policy we need to look at.</p></speech>

This turns on its head the idea that living in a rural area is a disadvantage.  It is a distinct advantage to live in a rural area if one is involved in the creative industries.  I found it intriguing that the Irish language was not mentioned until Deputy Conaghan referred to it.  I might have missed something at the beginning, however.  I see the Irish language as an integral part of the development of the creative industries.  A kind of reverse migration can happen with the language.  If people can develop their creative industries as Gaeilge initially, it is very easy for them to migrate back to English as we have seen with the likes of D&aacute;th&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute;, Grainne Seoige and the band Altan, all of whom started as Gaeilge but then came back to a much more mainstream audience in the lingua franca of English.  We must realise that there is huge potential in training people as Gaeilge who also have very fluent English.</p> <p>  I am also interested in the connections with organisations like Skillnets.  Skillnets was utilised very well in the creative industry in Spiddal to do the kind of vocational training creative people wanted.  We are talking about training people in the creative industries, but the creative person tends not to like mainstream education.  They tend not to want to do degrees.  Degrees tend to have an element of homogenisation so that if one sends people to art or drama schools, they tend to come out doing the same type of art or drama, which loses their individualisation.  Artists in particular tend to shy away from that type of training, which is why we need a different model when it comes to the creative industries.  Skillnets has been utilised quite well, but there are also other options.  I would be interested to hear any thoughts the witnesses have on the use of the Creative Europe and Leader programmes to enhance the creative industries in the west.</p> <p>  There are outstanding examples of people who have turned rurality into an advantage.  I think of Philip King and his company, South Wind Blows, which is based in west Kerry, the way they produced "Other Voices" and the programmes they did on Irish music.  Philip has been very critical recently of the accessibility of broadband technology.  Surely, that must be given a bigger priority.  If we have a hub or a town where we intend to create one, we must ensure the top level connectivity is available.  Where do the witnesses see the hubs being based?</p> <p>  Links with third level are very important.  Third level options being available rural areas is also hugely important.  If one looks at the furniture college in Letterfrack, one sees a prime example of how one can take a niche course, put it in a rural area and have it create its own dynamic in that it brings people to the area.  It is within a community that is in itself very creative.  What do the witnesses recommend as regards third level colleges doing that?  The trend in the last number of years has been to contract, to pull in from the periphery and to take courses away from those rural areas.  For example, there has been a trend in NUIG to pull back on the number of courses that were available part-time and at weekends.</p> <p>  The other tendency of people in the creative industries is to multitask.  There are two elements to that.  They can multitask in a creative sense by being a writer, artist and filmmaker and do a number of different things.  We need to look at a model of supporting them that will allow them to either multitask or specialise in one area.  The other classic example of multitasking is where someone who is very good at pottery, for example, also wants to run a business but lacks the business skills.</p><p>There is then that innate fear of collaboration with someone who might be more <i>au fait</i>with business and marketing.  How do the witnesses see us overcoming that problem?<br/><br/>The witnesses referred to the area being given a regional status.  We know that there is a move within Europe to broaden the labelling idea so that if one gets a wine or cheese from a certain region, a classification is given to it.  Is that the type of regional branding the witnesses are thinking of in order that one could get an EU classification as a creative area which would given one a certain kudos?  It is something like the UNESCO idea of film in Galway.  Is that something that could be looked at?<br/><br/>I was in Denmark quite a few years ago where they had a fantastic concept of the cultural dynamo in one of the folk high schools.  The folk high school is like transition year but after school as opposed to in the middle of it.  One can do a course in whatever one wants after finishing the equivalent of the leaving certificate.  The one I visited was a creative arts school which had dance, theatre, film and music.  There was another element in the idea of cultural dynamos.  Cultural dynamos are the people who make things happen.  They are the people who see opportunities and that there might be funding available.  They can access resources and people who can do things, drag them together and push them to do the projects.  Do we have anything similar in Ireland where we create these cultural entrepreneurs and dynamos?  Is it something we should be thinking about?</p></speech>

When the Senator mentions the Irish language, I could not agree more.  Without judging it in any way, I would add the word "authenticity".  When the Senator refers to Philip King, which we have discussed, it screams authenticity.  For a creative product, an authentic experience is really important and it is what people pay money for in high-value products.  If one is speaking Irish, it is seen as an authentic experience and when it is created in that medium, they see it.</p> <p>  I am sure my learned colleague will have a great deal to say about the issue the Senator raised on third level.  We know there is an entrepreneurial deficit in our region, which is due to peripherality and other factors.  I would like to see people coming out of the creative courses having an add-on of entrepreneurialism to bridge that pre-mentoring gap where they can apply some business skills to the artistic abilities they have and move it on.  That would be great.  The Senator mentioned regional status.  I had not thought about a UNESCO type thing.  While there may be a branding opportunity in the fact that we are located in a region, it is a jump we would not make ham-fistedly.  We would like to consider it with everyone.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to multitasking.  We have discussed a great deal today the traditional creative sectors.  I ask the committee to understand that Minecraft was developed in Ume&aring;, Sweden, by a guy in his bedroom.  We think we have those type of break-out capabilities in the west and we are looking at all aspects of it.  Dr. Cunningham covered some of the segments.  There is creative technology based in some of the urban areas which we consider is very strong and it needs to migrate into the rural areas to a greater extent.  Those guys in their bedrooms like GMarsh TV in Claremorris need to get to the world more quickly because they have the product.  That is my point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cathal O'Donoghue" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#P00500"><p>In terms of local economic development, we push very much that areas need to work on their unique selling points and to optimise their existing resources.  Language is a distinct cultural asset which allows areas to create uniqueness and develop niche economic opportunities.  The Senator mentioned access to education.  One of our core recommendations and focuses was on the delivery of greater skills training within rural areas, perhaps tapping into some of the infrastructure that exists in the education and training boards and old VECs nationally with high-speed broadband.  Links might be built to the institutes of technology to have more remote access without having to construct huge scale facilities in remoter areas.</p><p> Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh made a point about multitasking.  From our point of view in Teagasc, about two thirds of farmers require off-farm employment to maintain a viable household.  Therefore, businesses like the creative sector, which can provide part-time niche employment, are important in balancing the household budget.</p><p> As regards the Leader programme, the uniqueness and niche dimension to businesses within the creative sector are consistent with the goals of Leader funding whereby they should not duplicate or compete against existing money.  Therefore, there would be opportunities in terms of attracting funding from that source.</p></speech>

From our research in Finland and other countries, we have been looking at new modes of delivery, including shorter courses which are more tailored and focused.  In my presentation I mentioned the pro-academy model in Finland.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, creatives do not really like to do a lot of courses in the traditional structure.  They have an opportunity to work on a business idea.  If a person wants to learn something, someone in the group takes a lead.  That model is innovative and could be used in an Irish context.</p> <p>  Professor O'Donoghue's point was about utilising the existing infrastructure in new and innovative ways.  The creative hubs idea in Sweden, which has also been piloted in Northern Ireland, is about getting people to meet and interact in different places, both formally and informally.</p> <p>  Like any sector, business skills are required at the early start-up stage to understand the marketplace.  Skills are also required as one is scaling, growing and internationalising a business.  There is a real need to support that.  In addition, the uniqueness of individual creativity needs to be protected as well as building the business acumen by bringing new people into the business from other sectors.</p> <p>  Cultural dynamos are critically important.  In public or self-organised community spaces, people examine how to create different networks connecting people formally and informally.  This is where new ideas are generated.  In my own experience, I have found that there is a willingness to learn and be open to new ideas in the creative sector.  In some ways, it operates formally, while also maintaining the informality and freedom of the sector.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  What would they like to see with regard to the forthcoming spatial strategy?  The fear is that one wants to appease everyone, so what are their views on creating specific industrial and service clusters, particularly in the west?  For example, areas like Castlebar and Letterkenny could be focused on where there will be a greater impact from the spillover of benefits for the region.  The concern would be whether balanced regional development means that everyone has to gain from it.  How do we maximise our resources with regard to this regional spread, to ensure it benefits the regions?</p> <p>  Galway is bidding to be the Capital of Culture 2020.  Do the witnesses have an input into that process?  Perhaps they can outline the potential of that for Galway and the western region generally.</p></speech>

It is not specifically tied to the creative industry, but the view of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, is that the strategy was relatively weak on areas outside hubs and gateways.  It was strong on growth centres, but many people are living in small or medium-sized towns and wider rural areas.  One of the reasons for the establishment of CEDRA, and the preparation of the report, was the weakness in many of our policies on those dimensions, so a stronger focus is required.</p><p>Recognising that while economic growth may occur naturally, particularly in growth poles like the cities, people choose with their feet, and over the past decade, substantial numbers of them have moved out of cities into towns.  They live there and so our strategy needs to reflect those needs.  They are relatively young people, often with negative equity.  These towns and surrounding areas have issues that will exist into the future with varying opportunities and challenges.  It is important for the national spatial strategy to recognise those differences.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we did cover one of the aspects of why we are pushing forward the creative economy regionally as well as nationally.  The narrative is that there are people there who attract jobs because of their creative ability.  They are in the region for their own choice so they will not go elsewhere.  That is a great example of what the WDC and regional development do.  We are not interested in dividing up some sort of pie.  We are genuinely interested in the national well-being.  That is why we want to find sectors where we have international competitiveness.  The dumb question is, do we want to be internationally competitive as a country?  If so, we have to pick our strengths.  Renewable energy is a great example because we are not going to put up 1,000 turbines anywhere to generate gigawatts.  It thus becomes a question that if one chooses to do so, one chooses to do it in certain areas where there are good natural resources.  In the creative economy we have a strong international sector.  This is not balanced regional development, it is sensible economic development.  That is a really important thing to understand.  I would not be qualified to discuss another aspect.</p> <p>  The clustering effect has to happen, rather than it being forced.  Michael Porter's strategy is great but I worked it for 15 years and one must spend an awful lot of money to make it happen.  There are natural places in rural areas which allow agglomeration effects for clusters, that is, where people can go to meet.  That is important.</p> <p>  With the committee's permission, I will spend a second on Galway's bid to be Capital of Culture.  It is a wonderful idea.  Our region benefits from having one of the most exciting micro-cities in the world.  It can only benefit the national cause to have such a bid.  I saw the Volvo ocean race there and they still rant about the welcome they received and what it did for Ireland.  That is exactly the effect we would always like to see from a City of Culture bid.</p></speech>

Dr. Collins and his team are involved in extensive consultations and stakeholder engagements.  It is unearthing the potentiality, diversity and international strength that Galway has.  That is not only in terms of our empirical research but also regarding the imagination and ideas that are coming forward.  In addition, there is the importance of culture, language, place and the uniqueness of Galway, building on the success of 83 festivals per year that are generating huge economic activity and benefiting the city.</p> <p>  When Galway is successful, it will shine a justifiable light on Ireland's international position in this economy.  It is unique in terms of the environment and the imagination that Dr. Collins and his team can bring in working with the stakeholders, including the local authorities.  That can create an imaginative and innovative process that will bring a legacy to support individual companies as well as growing the economy internationally.

It is a terrific idea.  Should there be a national directory?<br/><br/>I heard Mr. Phil Coulter make a presentation at another committee on which I sat prior to this one.  He said that if he was starting now, he would not attain the same success, nationally or globally, because there are no policies on promoting Irish performers on national radio and television in terms of air play.  Several artists are associated with that view and feel strongly about the issue.  Would Dr. Cunningham research it?  His comments on work placements linking creative graduates with industry are excellent.<br/><br/>Does Professor O&rsquo;Donoghue have any view on how we might incorporate business skills for young people?  They need to think of themselves as being self-employed because they are part of the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, although they may not think they are.  Much of their employment will be contract work and they will go back on social benefits when a contract ends.  Is there sufficient expertise in the LEOs to recognise the potential business of a young person?  Much of it comes from courses and taps into technology that is moving so rapidly that people may not recognise the potential when, for example, a girl or a boy designs something like <i>Minecraft</i>or writes <i>Game of Thrones</i>.  They have the potential and the capacity to do something fantastic.  Are we missing out by not recognising it?<br/><br/>Mr. Brannigan&rsquo;s point that jobs follow people in the creative class is well made and puts the matter in perspective.  How can we get away from the impression that many people graduating have that they must work for nothing for a long time?  They sign on and then have to try to find some work on a film or here, there and everywhere to build a CV.  There is no other sector in which a young graduate who has worked hard for three or four years is expected to work for nothing.  That is particularly evident in the creative industries and the technology sector.<br/><br/>Do any of the delegates have an input into developing the third level curriculum?  Have they fed any of their findings on linking industry into the process?</p></speech>

It is a fast moving, diverse sector.  We have noticed in counties Mayo, Sligo and Galway that there is almost an underground aspect to much of this, especially among young people.  My colleague, Ms White, recently attended the Rough Draft festival, although that is the wrong word for it.  Many creative technology people come together at their own cost to discuss how to improve their businesses.  At the first festival I attended two years ago there were 200 present and I was the only person from the public sector in the room and they would not let me speak.  They were, in effect, 200 micro-businesses.  That is the level of knowledge available, which one cannot read in a book.  As Senator Feargal Quinn said, one has to engage with them.  That is one of the reasons I would like to see a regional aspect to enable people to develop these links directly with the client base.</p><p>It would help them to build it up and LEOs and others to channel support to them.  On the impression that they must work for nothing, it is a question of making it a viable career.  The rewards are huge.  Our research has shown specifically that many salaries are lower because they are lifestyle-based or seasonal.  There is an acceptance of this and it allows people to work on the periphery.  There is no doubt that in some cases it is an apprenticeship.  That is why we would like to see a greater awareness of the career path in these emerging sectors to make entrepreneurial skills more apparent in order that people will work more for themselves and in that way develop self-worth in order that they will not feel they are being exploited in some way, while still learning the skills because ultimately it is their business.</p></speech>

They are exactly the same as in the wider SME and creative sectors.  There is a need and whether it be in farming, business or the creative sector, it is becoming more complicated to exist, survive and thrive in the business environment which is more complicated and volatile.  To be successful, it is important to be a manager, as well as an expert in whatever the business is.  While we recognise the need, there is no demand.  Almost the first stage in getting people to engage with the tools and supports is to create awareness and a demand.  We are working with 22 partners across agri-business, banking and farm organisations to try to create this awareness.  I imagine a similar approach would be useful in other sectors such as the creative sector.</p> <p>  I am not an expert on the skills set of the LEOs.  It was a view of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, that, while it supported the LEOs as development organisations, they needed to be proactive rather than passive.  The one-stop shop idea is that people come to them, but as a development agency, it needs to get out there and where there is a need but not necessarily a demand, push it to get people to demand what they need, even if they are not aware they need it.</p></speech>

It fills a real need because many of these creative industries do not have the expertise required.  It allows them to create an international showcase for their activities.  It is good for business to business connections, if they are looking for someone to help them in that respect.<br/><br/>In response to the comment made by Mr. Phil Coulter and in regard to the Irish language, we can learn a lot from the French film production sector which has grown while maintaining the French language.  We need to equip Irish graduates to use new media to distribute their products and ideas more effectively, be it through Spotify or whatever else.<br/><br/>As for the workplace issue, our first hand experience in <i>MyCreativeEdge</i>is that it has a significant positive effect because students understand the business requirements of the business with which they deal.  They have to marry them with their creative talents, do it within a timeframe and put an economic value on their talent and decide how much they will charge for it.  Developing it at an early stage in their formation and building on it with good support is critical.<br/><br/>In response to the question about working for nothing, there is a case for the industry to create sustainable career paths at an early stage of formation to make it as attractive as engineering or other sectors which have done a lot to support career development.  They articulate to people considering entering the industry at an early or late stage that there is a viable, interesting and dynamic career available.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here.  I will quickly flick through various images on the screen which come from an exhibition which just closed in Milan on Sunday.  They will give members a flavour of the potential of the creative economy for our emerging and established design community.  The potential of the creative industries cannot be underestimated in terms of its impact as a catalyst for radical change.  Design, creativity and innovation are intrinsic to the future growth of Ireland's economy.  In the same way that Ireland has excelled in developing the agricultural, pharmaceutical and technology sectors, this is the moment to utilise the creative industries as a platform and tool for growth, innovation and economic development.  To do this, appropriate infrastructure and supports are required.</p> <p>  My role as the head of international programmes for Irish Design 2015, ID2015, and as head of innovation with the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has provided specific insights into the needs of these sectors.  ID2015 is a year-long initiative backed by the Irish Government exploring, promoting and celebrating Irish design throughout Ireland and internationally to drive job creation, grow exports and increase competitiveness.  The programme for the year includes presenting the work of Irish designers at high-profile events in design capitals including London, Paris, Eindhoven, Milan, New York, Chicago and Hong Kong/Shenzhen.  ID2015 is being convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, in collaboration with partner organisations on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise Ireland.  It is an ambitious programme with more than 300 national and 50 international events throughout the year that aims to create 1,800 jobs over three years; generate an additional &euro;10 million in design-based exports; generate 200 new design business start-ups; facilitate 300 companies to attend international trade events; engage with an audience in excess of 3 million; and develop a national design centre.</p> <p>  The ID2015 programme is a significant undertaking and represents the start of a journey to position Ireland at the leading edge of design collaboration, integration and innovation.  To ensure its success and that of the creative industries as a whole, a long-term, strategic view from economic and cultural perspectives is required.  The broad spectrum of design disciplines represented by ID2015 includes, but is not limited to, architecture and the built environment, film animation and motion design; food design; furniture design; gaming, product and industrial design, textile design; crafts; fashion; and web interface and digital design</p> <p>  ID2015 has identified key strategic enablers that could be applied to the creative industries sector as a whole to drive job creation, innovation and balanced economic development in the creative economy.  These can be listed under the following headings: education, enterprise and innovation; communication and promotion; legacy, infrastructure and disruptive reform; and commercialisation and internationalisation.  In terms of the first heading, the development and implementation of an education and enterprise model in collaboration with all major third level institutions to develop a strategy that provides tools for creative industries students and graduates to become entrepreneurs with the capacity to trade internationally is recommended.  This can be achieved through tailored programs delivered in partnership with the network of local enterprise offices, LEOs, and incubation centres throughout the country or through new models based on international exemplars such as NeueHouse in the US directed by James Reilly or Highway1 set up by Liam Casey of PCH.</p><p>To foster innovation across an integrated eco-system of creative industries, the parameters for innovation vouchers or similar incentivised funding should be broadened to enable B2B innovation across multiple sectors.  An innovation brokerage system should be established to pair companies and assist in the development of strategies and relationships to realise innovative products and services.<br/><br/>To realise significant growth in exports, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and creative industries need to have access to international markets.  Sustained investment to enable participation in international events such as design weeks, fashion weeks and architecture <i>biennales,</i>as well as access to funding to attend trade events for creative industries, must be maintained and further developed.<br/><br/>Raising awareness of the quality and innovative nature of the creative industries is key.  Coverage in high profile international media enhances and elevates the international perception of Ireland and our design, innovation and technical abilities.<br/><br/>To ensure sustained growth and development of the sector, a level of infrastructural supports is required.  They include a benchmarking of the creative industries sector as a whole.  The Western Development Commission has done a substantial amount of work in that area in the western region.  We also need engagement on an inter-agency and interdepartmental basis to maximise resources and strategic development of the creative sectors.  Access to investment for the creative industries through grant aid or venture capital funding is key.  The development of projects and programmes that integrate design thinking solutions across the business and community sectors to drive efficiencies and provide a platform for new systems to emerge is important.  The development of design hubs or creative industries hubs to encourage networking, collaboration and the sharing of skills, ideas and expertise is recommended.  The launch of a Made in Ireland campaign and a strategy of supports based on models in the United Kingdom and the USA would increase the capability of Irish manufacturers and bring visibility to the types of product available in Ireland.  The creation of a creative industries policy and a future strategy for Ireland is extremely important also.<br/><br/>I will give a sense of the impact cross-sectoral collaboration can have, especially when coupled with international exposure.  As I said, I have just returned from Milan where we opened Liminal Irish design at the threshold.  It represented over 20 Irish designers and design companies.  It was the first time in 50 years that we had this kind of international exposure and representation.  The level of innovation and resulting products from this initiative were significant.  For example, companies such as Thomas Montgomery, a small furniture manufacturer based in Bray, partnered Perch Design Solutions which is based in Dublin and they launched a product called FLOAT, an integrated system for seating in office environments.  It integrates both social and work-based interactions.  I asked Mr. Stuart Montgomery, its chief executive officer, his impressions of attending the show.  In terms of interest, he had received 45 concrete leads and interest from global design brands such as Labofa in Denmark, Kloebar in Germany, Vanerum in Belgium and FASB in Italy, which are interested in either tertiary exclusivity of his product or developing licensing agreements.  That is the result of just one representation on an international platform.<br/><br/>Another example is Design Partners that has worked with an American company, Seed Labs Inc.  They are exploring the smart home market to uncover and deliver the potential of its technology and brand.  Seed Labs Inc. developed pioneering Bluetooth and connected solutions technology through its own software, protocols and chips.  Design Partners has helped it to translate them into a brand, an experience and product design language in the design of all their products.  Working closely with Seed Labs Inc., it launched its first control device, Silvair, in Milan in April and it is just about to launch in the United States.  That is important because these companies are positioning themselves at the forefront in shaping the future of connected and integrated devices.<br/><br/>Enabling these collaborations allows true innovation to take place.  Supporting and promoting collaboration across sectors and disciplines will enable more intuitive, responsive, user centred smart design products and services to emerge.  Ireland has an incredible opportunity to merge our assets, technologically, scientifically and creatively, with the creative industries.  Based on research being undertaken as part of Irish Design 2015, we have the opportunity to develop and support a defined policy and a strategic plan for investment in the design and creative industries for the future.</p></speech>

Is craolt&oacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute; &eacute; TG4.  T&aacute; &aacute;r gcl&aacute;racha le feice&aacute;il ar fud na t&iacute;re agus ar fud an domhain ar Sheinnteoir TG4.  T&aacute; muid lonnaithe i mBaile na hAbhann i gContae na Gaillimhe.</p> <p>  TG4 was established in 1996 as a public service broadcasting initiative to promote the Irish language and culture, raise the profile of the language as part of the Government&rsquo;s wish to create a bilingual society and normalise its use.</p> <p>  TG4 operates as a publisher-broadcaster.  We source most of our Irish language programmes from Ireland's independent production sector.  Through this and through all of the other services we buy from the Irish creative sector, such as marketing, digitisation, software and hardware, music, etc., we have a significant impact on jobs in the economy, innovation levels and Ireland's economic development.</p> <p>  TG4 has commissioned Irish language content from more than 100 independent production companies in Ireland.  Most of these are small to medium-sized enterprises.  We have particularly focused on sourcing content from companies which operate through the Irish language, and many of these are located in Gaeltacht and regional areas, thus bringing significant social and cultural benefits to these rural communities with the high-skill employment they sustain.</p> <p>  TG4 is committed to investment in high-quality original Irish language content produced by the independent production sector in Ireland.  We spend over 90% of our programme budget with this sector annually.  In 2014, we purchased &euro;22 million worth of Irish language programmes and services from the sector and a priority of our strategy is to grow this spend in future years.</p> <p>  TG4 also places an emphasis on nurturing talent in the Irish language creative economy through our development programmes which support first-time producers, directors and writers in the Irish language.  This is done through initiatives such as the provision of training courses for Irish language producers, writers and directors and support for media courses in universities and institutes of technology.</p> <p>  IBEC's Audiovisual Federation research on the Irish film and television industry shows that in excess of 300 highly skilled and creative full-time jobs in the film and production sector are directly sustained by TG4 commissions on an annual basis.  TG4's Irish language soap, "Ros na R&uacute;n", now in its 20th year of production, creates a significant level of direct employment and contracted personnel in the local economy.</p> <p>  Through our work with the independent production sector in Ireland, TG4 also helps to develop the capabilities of the companies and individual talent with whom we work.  By investing in skills and training, services and technology systems and approaches, and by working to defined standards, the capabilities of the production and creative sector in Ireland are continually enhanced.  We also help to raise finance for the independent production sector through working with it to help it secure sound and vision funding from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, funding from the Irish language broadcast fund and European media programme in addition to helping them work with international co-production partners such as European broadcasters.</p> <p>  The effect of TG4's expenditure every year extends beyond the first round of our purchases such as content or marketing services as additional economic value is created further down the supply chain and in other markets.  Thus the effect of TG4's spending is multiplied as it trickles down through the economy.  The multiplier effect of TG4's expenditure, direct and indirect, in terms of contribution to Ireland's national earnings was &euro;74 million in 2014 with an employment impact of 1,150 jobs, including production sector jobs.  This reflects the level of TG4 expenditure in Ireland on indigenous programming and creative services rather than on purchasing these from international markets.  For every &euro;1 invested by TG4 in the creative industries in Ireland, it was worth more than &euro;2 to the economy of Ireland in 2014.</p> <p>  The creative industries combine conventional cultural industries, for example, film and television, publishing and advertising, with digital media, software and technology sectors.  Much is based on intellectual property, and the fast-changing nature of the creative economy generates many opportunities.  If the global creative economy was a country, it would be equivalent to being the fourth largest economy in the world, and it would have the fourth largest labour force with 144 million workers.</p><p>Research from Nesta also shows that creative industries rely much less on imports than manufacturing sectors.  The commissioning of programmes from the independent production sector and services we source from other sectors will continue to support a vibrant and creative production sector in Ireland, the Gaeltacht and other regional areas outside Dublin in particular.</p><p> Looking ahead for TG4, we are seeking to grow our contribution to job creation, innovation and economic development in the creative economy.  We aim to maximise the share of our public funding which we spend on Irish language content.  We also aim to continue to spend most of our programming budget with the independent production sector rather than purchasing content from international markets.  This will provide for investment in the creative sector and job creation.  TG4 is establishing a digital Irish language archive, sourcing systems, digitisation, archiving and other Irish language creative services as part of this important project.  Since the beginning of 2015, with the assistance of grant-in-aid from the BAI, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, TG4 has indirectly employed five people with language and IT skills to archive and catalogue its Irish language content.</p><p> These activities and many others will continue to sustain jobs and support the development of additional jobs, drive innovation and growth in the creative economy.  Our funding must be sustained to enable us to continue to make this valuable contribution.</p></speech>

It seems there is a great deal going on about which we did not really know enough.  I would love to hear more about the attendance at events during Milan Design Week.  Why is it no one got there during the past 50 years?  If the recent attendance was such a success, we should be doing more of this.  Who are the design sector&rsquo;s competitors?  How will it overcome this competition?</p> <p>  The challenges TG4 faces are different from the ones faced by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland.

It sets the frame for what is emerging on a global scale.  Why had we not been there before?  There was a focus on the design sector in the time of the Kilkenny Design Workshops.  It has not been focused on as much in the recent past, which is one of the reasons the Irish Design 2015 initiative is critically important.  We are delighted that it is being supported significantly by the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p> <p>  We are competing globally.  The challenges for Ireland involve cost competitiveness, economies of scale and how small businesses can make the leap from employing perhaps six to eight people to a growth trajectory and strategy.  From our first-hand experience in Milan, we know that the quality and innovation of what we produce are on a par with what is produced by our international competitors.  During Milan Design Week we were in the Zona Tortona, one of the first established districts outside the Salone del Mobile Milan.  Ireland's exhibition was selected as one of the top three in the district, competing against hundreds of other exhibitors.  I hope we will be back in Milan.</p> <p>  As for what I would wish to be given by the leprechaun on the side of the road, we have started on an incredibly exciting, dynamic and positive journey which will lead to significant growth in Ireland&rsquo;s economy and design community.</p><p>What could go wrong is if that ambition, as well as the level of investment and commitment to this initiative, were stopped before it could get off the ground.  I would like to see a long-term strategy for the development of the sector.</p></speech>

If we had more money, we could invest in the independent production sector to produce more programmes.  We would then have more original Irish language content for viewers who would be entertained and educated.  I hope it would also increase our viewership.  It is, in a sense, a revolving door, whereby we need to grow funding and then the sector in every part of Ireland, to have more and better quality programmes and increase our viewership.</p></speech>

The greater the number of people involved in the arts, film, drama, acting, writing, camera work and so forth the stronger the sector will be and this will benefit TG4.  </p><p> On the location of a new studio in Galway city, the more studio locations we have the better it will be for TG4, County Galway and the city in general.  We have Studio Telegael in Baile na hAbhann.  A new location in Carnmore would help to attract investment and production to the west and Galway in general.</p></speech>

Irish Design 2015 has received a very positive response from the sector which views the initiative as very encouraging and one which should be sustained.  We have run a series of open calls, which has provided a level of funding directly to the designers and design companies.  More than 130 individuals and design companies have received funding through the initiative.  We also had an open call for an international trade fund, which provides a level of matching funding to enable applicants to attend relevant trade events internationally.</p> <p>  We have just submitted our first quarterly report which shows that we had more than 50 designers at international events.  Alongside the event in Milan, we had a presence during London Fashion Week, which showcased emerging Irish fashion designers, and 21 designers at the Maison &amp;amp; Objet trade fair in January.  We launched the year with Showcase, our international trade show.  We were delighted to bring the exhibition, Weathering, to Beijing during the President's visit to China in December.  As a result, we saw a significant increase in the number of Chinese buyers visiting Ireland for the Showcase trade event, which was extremely positive. </p> <p>  On the international element of the programme, we have received considerable support from the embassy network abroad.  We are working with more than 25 embassies and touring a capsule exhibition that is also linking with some of the trade missions taking place in 2015.  This is a significant and positive development.</p> <p>  On the design courses available in Ireland, when I graduated from the National College of Art and Design, the entrepreneurial and business side was not a core component of courses.  As I stated, we are actively working with the institutes of technology and universities to roll out a programme in this regard in September as part of the new curriculum.  We will also develop a design education programme to encourage entrepreneurial activity at second level and this will feed into the programme at third level. </p> <p>  In terms of design hubs, they can be both physical and virtual and both have benefits.  There are examples in Ireland such as the Fumbally Exchange where a number of creatives are housed under one roof and able to share experience and expertise.  This model has proved to be highly beneficial.  NeueHouse, the model I mentioned in New York, houses a number of companies and provides flexible co-working spaces.  It serves as a very efficient recruiting mechanism for creatives for technology companies in New York city.  It is very important to have some element of this here and linkages between Ireland and other countries such as the United States.</p><p> In terms of the profile in the media, first and foremost, we need to be present at events to secure coverage.  We need to make the best representation possible in terms of quality, innovation and the type of product we choose.  It is also a matter of building relationships and partnerships, which are core elements of Irish Design 2015.  Internationally, we have developed very significant relationships with institutions such as the British Council, the Design Council in the United Kingdom and the V&amp;A where we will have a significant intervention later in the year.  We have also established links in New York, for example, with the director of the Museum of Arts and Design and Paola Antonelli in MoMA.  All of the relationships and partnerships we build make a major difference in terms of the type and level of profile Ireland enjoys and the and way in which it is perceived.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1031" speakername="Michael Conaghan" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015042100002#BB00200"><p>I welcome our guests.  I watch TG4 much more often that I initially thought I would because it is a highly engaging channel.  While I do not understand much of the vernacular, the reason I watch so many TG4 programmes is that their content is strongly visual.  The channel has brought a new eye and ear to matters of Irish interest which many of the other broadcasters have never captured or did not believe were worth exploring.  For example, one would not expect a programme on labourers in England, principally ordinary men who were working in tunnels and on roads, to be very engaging.  However, the human side of the story penetrates and makes the programme very engaging.  While I did that type of work for a long time, my wife, who is a great follower of TG4, never worked as a labourer.  She likes the channel because it takes ordinary things and makes them extraordinary, appealing and engaging and she and I have both become regular viewers.</p> <p>  As well as Irish labourers working in Britain, TG4 addresses the issue of emigration generally, including to America.  It does not always focus on those who have made it big, earned a great deal of money and returned to show off their success in Galway or Donegal but addresses topics that have been neglected and aspects of the experience of Irish people in America that are not normally explored.  One of its strengths is that it shows the fate of emigrants and features strong human interest stories and other issues that remained unexplored until now. </p> <p>  TG4 also features little corners of Ireland that have been neglected or that people have never bothered about.  Its programme makers go to these places to build a story of the area, perhaps using as a focal point a river and its salmon or trout fishing or the scenic value of a waterway or mountainous area.  It is amazing how engaging such programmes can become simply through their visual impact and the personality and sound of a landscape or river.  The story lines are frequently simple but profound in that they have a hidden quality which engages those who are willing to be engaged, as more and more people are.  Ordinary topics have become extraordinary and TG4 explores rich seams of the human experience of Irish people in different settings, contexts and spheres which mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC and RTE do not consider to be sufficiently interesting.</p><p>The interest is there, if it can be found and presented.  </p></speech>

We will do this by being a strong visual channel and by subtitling most of the content.  In those ways we try to maximise our audience and try to create a bilingual society and normalise the use of the Irish language.</p> <p>  I accept the points made in regard to emigrants and the United States.  Recently we did a lovely programme on the tunnel tigers, those who spent years in the tunnels in London and elsewhere in Britain.  Also, a production company in Carna, S&oacute;nta, did a four part series, "GAA USA" on the history of the GAA in the United States, which covered from before the GAA was established to the present day and looked at its future there.  Another nostalgic programme was made by Bob Quinn from Connemara, a lovely programme on the Galtymore ballroom.  </p> <p>  One of the reasons we have managed to touch base with rural and other parts of Ireland is that we are a publisher broadcaster.  Therefore, we take most of our programmes from companies that are mostly based in their own localities and which mirror their own society.  In a sense, we have approximately 100 small companies scattered and dotted throughout Ireland supplying programmes and mirroring Irish life of days gone by and present day Ireland.</p></speech>

An initiative of Irish Design 2015 and the Irish Architecture Foundation is to develop a series of talks entitled "We Built this City".  This programme looks back at how Irish labourers contributed to building the fabric of so many cities worldwide.  My colleague, Karen Hennessy, met with Members of the Houses of Parliament whose parents and grandparents had contributed to building the fabric of London and they are interested in hosting an exhibition there.  Similarly, in New York and Chicago there are stories we hope to be able to tell and communicate.</p> <p>  On emigration, we have a richness in terms of our diaspora, with over 80 million of us worldwide.  This is evident when attending international events.  We intend to launch an initiative known as the global Irish design challenge, to challenge designers worldwide to present us with their vision for a future Ireland and for a future strategy for Ireland.</p></speech>

I have passed through the airport a couple of times recently and have seen the picture montages there that give a sense of what is going on in Irish Design 2015.  I would not be as <i>au fait </i>with design as others.  We know a little about fashion designers, such as John Rocha, Louise Kennedy, Orla Kiely and Lainey Keogh and from the Connemara perspective, Cniot&aacute;il Inis Me&aacute;in, seems to have done very well on the international market.  Philip Treacy is another Galway designer.  However, in other areas of design mentioned, such as architecture, I am not as <i>au fait</i>with designers.  How do we compare internationally in those other areas?  We are not in the same league as Milan, but would we be in the premier league or are we somewhere down in the third or fourth division internationally?  What do we need to do to bring ourselves up?  I am not necessarily concerned that individual designers be there, but that there should be awareness of their work.  How can we promote them more?</p><p>I am also conscious that many of our designers are members of the diaspora.  Do we have a brain-drain scenario in this regard?  If a person wants to make it as a designer, must he or she go abroad, to London, New York, Paris or wherever?  What can we do to counteract that and how can technology help us in regard to better connectivity?  Where are the gaps at third level when it comes to training and education for this area?  Previous speakers suggested we lack policy in the creative industry area.</p><p>From a policy perspective, what gaps do the witnesses see that we as legislators need to examine?</p><p> &Oacute; thaobh TG4 de agus n&iacute;l aon dabht faoi, t&aacute;im anseo le ceithre bliana agus n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; aon duine ag c&aacute;ineadh TG4 &oacute; th&aacute;inig m&eacute; anseo.  Chuala m&eacute; neart c&aacute;ineadh faoi na craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; eile ach n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; droch-fhocal faoi TG4.  Is moladh an-mh&oacute;r &eacute; sin faoi p&eacute; at&aacute; i TG4 agus na dreamanna at&aacute; ag obair ar na cl&aacute;racha ar fad.  T&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhacht leis an tionscadal seo.

An mbeimid ag rith amach as daoine le Gaeilge gur f&eacute;idir leo oibri&uacute; ar na cl&aacute;racha mar l&aacute;ithreoir&iacute;, scr&iacute;obhneoir&iacute; agus mar sin de?  C&eacute;n r&oacute;l a fheiceann na finn&eacute;ithe do TG4 &oacute; thaobh an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain agus &oacute; thaobh an Ghaeilge sa phobal.</p><p> S&iacute;lim gur ch&oacute;ir aitheantas a tabhairt don n&uacute;ala&iacute;ocht a bhaineann le comhlachta&iacute; ar n&oacute;s EO teilif&iacute;s, Nemeton TV sa Rinn, Irish TV i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus Telegael a bhfuil ard&aacute;n idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta bainte amach aige &oacute; thaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; anam&uacute;lachta agus mar sin de.

In terms of how we compare internationally, we rank like with like.  Our challenge is that we do not have a huge number of product or industrial design companies of a scale which can compete from a cost perspective.  One of the stories in Milan is about a company called Dolmen, which has launched a device called Moocall.  I think it did it in partnership with the IFA.  It alerts farmers as to when a cow is about to calve.  It will send an alert to both the vet and the farmer.  Globally, that kind of product is worth billions.  The committee will be able to do the maths itself.</p> <p>  The point about the diaspora and the brain drain is critical.  We need, from a policy perspective, to start putting in enablers and infrastructure to make it attractive for our designers and our design community to remain in Ireland.  The whole fabric of manufacturing and production is changing radically.  I had a discussion with the CEO of Casino, which is one of the largest Italian furniture manufacturers in the world.  He was saying that even the Italian industry is changing.  A democratisation of manufacturing and producing is happening worldwide, and Liam Casey is responsible for some of this.  This gives the potential to individual or small companies to make and compete globally.  It also means there are more mergers and acquisitions, so they are competing against very large global corporations.  We need to put the infrastructure and supports in place for those on the middle ground.  We are not going to compete at every level, but we can identify where we can compete.</p> <p>  The Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has commissioned an audit of producing and making in Ireland.  Irish Design 2015 is also looking at a programme to see how we can map our resources.  Often the problem is not that we do not have the skills here, but rather that we do not have the visibility of the skills available in Ireland.  It is very important to bring some kind of a brokerage system to bear in order that we can enable people to produce efficiently and effectively in Ireland.</p> <p>  We were asked what gaps there are in training at third level.  The animation sector, for example, finds it quite challenging to recruit animators in Ireland, although it is a thriving sector.  In respect of the fashion and textile sector, which was mentioned, we are working closely with the British Fashion Council.  It provides supports over a three-year period and a lot of that support is directly into the trade.  It will have placements with fashion manufacturers, producers and designers.</p><p>This gives those graduates the kind of live training and hands-on knowledge they need when they want to go out and make a name and business for themselves.  We have seen many of our designers return to Ireland over the past number of years and we need to incentivise them to remain here.</p></speech>

Ach creidim gur &aacute;bhar d&oacute;chais &eacute; go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i bhfad n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Creidim freisin go bhfuil cuid mh&oacute;r de phobal na Gaeltachta anois - mar gheall ar an lagrach a bh&iacute; againn le roinnt blianta - r&eacute;as&uacute;nta bocht i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus go bfhuil imirce ann agus go leor daoine imithe.  Mar sin, t&aacute; an Ghaeltacht n&iacute;os laige &oacute; thaobh saibhris teanga agus saibhris eacnama&iacute;ochta de.  Ach s&iacute;lim go bhfuil an Ghaeilge n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre ar fud na t&iacute;re agus go bhfuil r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach ag TG4, mar aon leis An Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, le f&aacute;ilte a chur ar dhaoine agus an Ghaeilge a bhr&uacute; orthu.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l ag TG4 an Ghaeilge a bhr&uacute; mar theanga ionas gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;isteacht l&eacute;i, breathn&uacute; uirthi agus sult a bhaint aisti agus oideachas a fh&aacute;il.  Caithfidh an Ghaeilge a bheith mar chuid d&aacute;r saol agus caithfear f&aacute;ilte a chur roimpi agus &iacute; a &uacute;s&aacute;id, c&eacute; acu an bhfuil duine ar bheag&aacute;n focal n&oacute; ar mh&oacute;r&aacute;n focal.</p> <p> It is true that technology has changed.  Just four or five years ago at TG4, everything was on tape, it was standard definition, presentation was manual and everything was on long form content and we were broadcasting for Ireland.  Today, however, we have a tapeless or file-based station, everything is high definition, transmission is fully automated, it is short and long form, is on all digital devices and is aired throughout the world.  T&aacute; athr&uacute; an-mh&oacute;r tagtha agus is f&eacute;idir linn seirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il do gach duine ar fud an domhain.</p> <p>  Maidir leis an todcha&iacute;, the future, it is very challenging.  However, if TG4 remains an Irish station with Irish content mirroring Irish life, music, sport, song and dance, I believe there will be a demand for it.  Netflix, etc., is an additionality and is in demand, but if TG4 remains Irish with Irish content, s&iacute;lim go mbeidh an pobal ag iarraidh breathn&uacute; ar st&aacute;isi&uacute;n TG4, at&aacute; mar &iacute;omh&aacute; ar shaol na t&iacute;re seo.</p></speech>

TG4 is a wonderful station and I know many people who watch it regularly.  Some of them do not have great Irish, but they enjoy the content and it is helpful that programmes are subtitled.  Many youngsters enjoy watching programmes like "Sesame Street" or "The Muppet Show" which have been dubbed in Irish.  That is a great idea.</p> <p>  We have a huge diaspora, but does TG4 see a role for itself in reaching out to them?  I am not sure how the process works, but does TG4 have a role in selling on its product so that people in Australia or America can tune in and watch programmes that it has commissioned and broadcast?  How do production companies tender for work with TG4?  Do they come to TG4 with ideas or does TG4 come up with the ideas and then reach out to them?</p></speech>

We dedicate approximately seven hours per day for young people, between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. and then again between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. with content between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. being geared towards teenagers.  Young people are important and we will continue to serve them.</p> <p>  On the diaspora, as I mentioned, technology at TG4 has changed significantly.  We have our traditional TG4 television and the TG4 player.  With all of the content we commission, bar sports, we have international rights and this is available live on the TG4 player and there is also a 35 day catch up.  Therefore, throughout the world, anyone who wants to watch TG4 content may do so within 35 days.  This is a good service which is very much in demand.</p></speech>

Does she think career guidance is reaching young people and revealing to them the potential of design as a career path?</p><p>Does she believe the arts offices should have a greater role in supporting any young people who come up with designs and linking them to the enterprise offices?  I recently had an interesting engagement with a young milliner whose house is overflowing.  What organisations can creative people approach about identifying spaces particularly in rural areas?  Is there a role for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland in this regard?  For example, Shannon Development may have some available property.  I mention that because I am familiar with that area.  In other areas there may be spaces that could be identified similar to the Fumbally Exchange Ms Allen referred to but that it would be more of a rural area.</p><p> Offaly County Council and the county enterprise board acquired a space, called the innovation hub, which includes a number of young technology companies which are coming up with all sorts of ideas for apps etc.  Perhaps that could be replicated elsewhere.</p><p> Each county has people with particular skills and crafts.  I will focus on one that I know well and I love its name, Offaly Crafty.  It does pop-up shops.  It is amazing to see what is going on in one's own county that one did not know about.  Is there not potential throughout the country to have permanent spaces where craft spaces can exhibit?  I do not know if each county can sustain that.  For example, many national craftspeople exhibit in the Core Crafted Design in Ballinahown.  Could each county sustain something like that or should it be done regionally?  We need something permanently accessible.  Given the increase in the number of tourists who seek out something that is distinctively Irish, there might be potential in that regard.</p><p> Ms Allen spoke about going to Milan.  Hazel Greene, the Offaly-based silk scarf designer, won the accessory designer of the year in a competition in Galway which is wonderful.  I understand that she has received commissions for some of her work.  It is great to see all of that success.  Many people are surprised about what is happening with the creative economy.  Are we taking it somewhat for granted because we are so good at it?  Do we really appreciate it enough?  Do our national broadcaster and the other broadcasters give it sufficient focus?  Does it have to be part of a specialist programme or, if there is a great success in an international competition, should that not feature as part of the mainstream news to allow people to appreciate what we have as a nation?</p></speech>

In one of my former roles with the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland, I worked directly with some of the career guidance agencies.  From a local enterprise office understanding and from a designer's, craftsperson's or artist's perspective there is a challenge in terms of understanding what the job is.  Young designers presenting themselves do not necessarily see themselves as entrepreneurs.  Equally a local enterprise office will not necessarily see them as potentially being the next business it wants to be able to support.  We need to put that infrastructure in place.</p><p>The Design and Crafts Council of Ireland has launched a number of initiatives and we are actively working with the local enterprise offices.  We have set up a design mentoring panel to give advice to young and emerging craft enterprises.  We have realised that just as the designers need an education, the agencies also need an education.  We will actively work with them to deliver workshops regionally.  We have set up an initiative, called Fuse, that brings a number of experts in retail, design, innovation and PR into a space with a group of designers to work intensively with them to understand what those young creative individuals need in terms of support.  That is followed on by one-to-one mentoring, much of which is supported through a partnership between local enterprise offices, and Irish Design 2015 and the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland.<br/><br/>The role of arts officers in supporting the designers is very important.  I was an arts officer for a brief period and I know it is a very demanding role.  More to the point, there is a gap.  There could be a role for a similar person in the design field - a design officer or a craft and design officer in the local authority who could potentially deliver a dedicated support service.  If we try to give too much work to arts officers, they might not be able to deliver.<br/><br/>On spaces for creative individuals, the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland is looking at creating centres of excellence for fashion and textiles, and ceramics.  There is a benefit in terms of supporting the emergence of workspaces for creatives.  We need to look at the model.  I know a number of local enterprise offices have supported those in the past.  Not all of them have been successful and some have been extremely successful.  We need to look at the levels of investment and how we bring creatives and companies forward, looking at those economies of scale and how those enterprises can scale.  We need to come together and develop a number of strategies in partnership.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked if we appreciate the creative economy enough and if we take it for granted.  We work in partnership with the media.  <i>The Irish Times</i>and RTE are very strong partners particularly for Irish Design 2015.  It is very important to celebrate our wins.  It would be great to have a slot that celebrates Irish design in Milan, for example, on the national news.  We need to become more aware of the contribution not only to the economy but also from a cultural perspective of how Ireland is perceived abroad.  The level and depth of culture that we hold intrinsically in ourselves without even knowing it is something we should celebrate more fully.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Rosemary Steen, director of public affairs; Mr. John Fitzgerald, director of grid development; and Mr. Aidan Geoghegan, project manager on the North-South interconnector project.</p> <p>  Last month we published a draft strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s transmission grid.  The draft strategy, on which EirGrid is now seeking public feedback, is shaped by three key pillars, namely, open engagement with communities, making the most of new technologies and a commitment to make the existing grid work harder before building new transmission infrastructure.  The strategy takes account of the changing technical and economic context for Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission system, examines the energy challenges facing Ireland and identifies the steps we need to take to develop a strong and secure transmission system for homes, farms and businesses throughout Ireland in order that the electricity grid is capable of providing for the energy needs of our country now and into the future.</p> <p>  The strategic review includes an independent report from Indecon which shows that investment in the electricity grid will directly benefit Ireland&rsquo;s economy and can help reduce energy costs.  As well as supporting indigenous businesses and consumers, a modern transmission grid will put Ireland in a strong position to continue to attract foreign investment and support new and emerging opportunities in the energy sector.  This approach will also support Ireland&rsquo;s current policy objectives, including the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and the IDA&rsquo;s regional development strategy.  The draft strategy reflects the change in economic circumstances and our current circumstances as a country, an economy and a society.  In recent years we have seen technological advances, some of which we have deployed already to great effect and others which are now emerging.  Based on all these advances, our new strategy is firmly focused on maximising existing assets and deploying appropriate advanced technology solutions.</p> <p>  In respect of the North-South interconnector, the review determined that there remains a clear need for the project and that a 400 kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution.  The interconnector is a 400 kV overhead line linking a substation in Woodland, County Meath, with a new substation in Turleenan, County Tyrone.  It will provide a second high capacity transmission line between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The project will more than double the power transfer capacity between North and South, thereby improving the efficiency of the all-island electricity market.</p><p>It will enhance the security of the electricity supply throughout the island of Ireland, which is essential for economic growth, the creation of jobs and improving the standard of living and quality of life for all.  In addition, it will enable more renewable energy supplies to be connected to the network, thereby reducing our production of greenhouse gasses and our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  The interconnector is needed now, as a cross-Border bottleneck has developed on the all-island electricity system, which is having serious financial consequences.  Last year the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, reported that the North-South interconnector would remove the bottleneck and reduce electricity costs by &euro;30 million per year.<br/><br/>The proposed scheme has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate for some time, with the focus on whether it can be put underground.  Several independent reports on the issue have been published.  In 2008 the Government commissioned the Dutch energy consultancy company Ecofys to produce a Study on the Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines Versus Underground Cables.  In 2009 EirGrid published a report produced by industry experts, PB Power, which examined overhead and underground options for the project.  A key component of the study was a comprehensive and site-specific underground cable evaluation that identified and evaluated a specific route corridor.  The report was reviewed and updated in 2013.  Another report commissioned by EirGrid was a technical study by TransGrid Solutions of Canada that investigated the impact of high voltage, direct current, HVDC, schemes in the Irish transmission network.  We also commissioned an assessment by Tokyo Electric Power Company of the technical issues related to significant amounts of underground cable in the all-island transmission system.  In 2012 the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published a study by an international expert commission which had reported on the case for, and cost of, undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  The Government-appointed independent panel, headed by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, acknowledged that the evaluation of undergrounding of the North-South interconnector was compatible with the methodologies being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects.<br/><br/>We do not have time to examine in detail the findings of all these reports, but there are two themes that emerge from them, the most prominent of which is the finding that undergrounding the project would be more expensive.  The international expert commission's report concluded that an underground solution would be three times more expensive than an overhead option.  Our own estimate is that an underground system would cost in excess of &euro;500 million more than the overhead option.  As a State-owned company the mission of which is to develop, maintain and operate a secure, economical and efficient transmission system, this is an additional cost EirGrid cannot pass on to consumers.  It is an additional cost that would not be acceptable to the regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  This is made clear in a joint letter to EirGrid in 2013 from the CER and the utility regulator in Northern Ireland which stated:<blockquote>[T]he project must not only be progressed quickly but also cost effectively.  The Committee understands from the Irish Government review that the cost for the undergrounding of the project would be significantly higher than the AC overhead line construction employed elsewhere in Europe.  The regulatory authorities would therefore be of the view that customers should not be expected to pay for any unnecessary costs associated with undergrounding of the cables given there would be no enhancement in service. </blockquote>I will deal briefly with some of the technical aspects of the project.  In its 2012 report the international expert commission made only one recommendation, namely, that the North-South interconnector not be undergrounded using AC technology.  We agree with that recommendation.  The commission, while not recommending that the interconnector be undergrounded, stated that if it were to be undergrounded for all or a significant portion of its length, the best solution would be to use HVDC technology.  EirGrid is very familiar with HVDC and keeps abreast of the development and application of the technology which we successfully deployed in our east-west interconnector project.  However, while it was, in fact, the only technically feasible option available for the east-west interconnector, the same cannot be said for the North-South interconnector project.  There are technical options to be considered and they have been. <br/><br/>The international expert commission found that AC overhead line technology was the standard in Europe for implementing projects similar in application to the North-South interconnector.  That remains the position.  There are significant technical issues with putting projects such as the North-South interconnector underground using HVDC technology.</p><p>One of the key benefits of the North-South interconnector is the ability to operate the networks North and South as if they were one system.  This will bring cost savings for electricity consumers as a larger electricity system can be operated more efficiently than smaller ones.  However, if the project was to be put underground, it would be an HVDC system linking two alternating current or AC networks.  As HVDC is not compatible with AC, there would be additional complexities as it would require equipment to convert the power from AC to HVDC and back again.  In order to function properly, an HVDC interconnector would also require a computerised control system.  Such a system would be bespoke and very complex and introduce a risk of mal-operation.  Taking such a risk when there is a technically superior and less risky option readily available is unnecessary.  In addition, "tapping" into an HVDC interconnector at an intermediate point to provide a new grid connection or for network reinforcement in the future would add to the already complex control system.  It would also be significantly more costly, potentially in excess of &euro;100 million more, than tapping into the proposed AC overhead line.  This would disadvantage future development in the region.</p><p> Where are we with the project?  EirGrid has recently republished its proposed line route that will form the basis of an application for planning approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The review resulted in the proposed tower locations being repositioned along the alignment.  The alignment has not changed and the owners of the land holdings affected were notified prior to publication.  We are looking to submit a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming weeks.  In fact, we have been liaising with the board on the planning application for some months.  We have been doing this because 18 months ago the European Commission designated the interconnector a project of common interest, PCI.  This is a significant development and means that the project is subject to a new EU regulation for trans-European energy infrastructure that is designed to facilitate a more efficient permit granting process.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was designated as the competent authority for managing the PCI process in Ireland and, as per the EU regulation, we submitted a draft application file to it for review.  Last month we submitted additional information to the board which it is reviewing.  Once it is satisfied with the draft application, it will draw up a schedule for formally submitting the planning application.  We expect this to happen very soon. </p><p> As I mentioned, open engagement with communities is a key pillar of the draft strategy.  During the course of the project we have endeavoured to meet every landowner affected by the development and have had productive discussions with many.  Others have chosen not to deal with us directly, appointing intermediaries to represent them.  This is their undoubted right and prerogative.  However, it is also a barrier to effective engagement and we encourage all landowners to talk to us.</p><p> Recently we have opened offices in counties Meath and Monaghan and will shortly open a new office in Cavan.  We are encouraging anyone interested in the project to call in and discuss it with our project team.  These offices will remain open right through to the submission of the planning application and afterwards.  Our staff will be on hand in the local offices to provide assistance for landowners and members of the public who wish to make a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la once the statutory consultation process starts following the submission of the planning application.</p><p> The interconnector is critical to ensuring a safe, secure supply of electricity throughout the island of Ireland.  It will bring major cost savings and address significant issues around security of electricity supply, particularly in Northern Ireland.  On behalf of the EirGrid representatives present, I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to brief it on this critical development.  We are happy to take questions Members may have</p></speech>

The Chairman has mentioned that different solutions are appropriate for different projects.  There is no one bespoke solution that works for all projects.  I will talk about them in turn, indicating the differences between them.  I will deal, first, with the North-South project which is at a significantly more advanced stage than both the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  It has been the subject of extensive analysis and consultation for a number of years.  A number of reports have examined the undergrounding of the interconnector.  In 2009 EirGrid commissioned PV Power to produce a detailed report which was published.  It included a route specific evaluation of the underground option.  The analysis was updated in 2013 and made available.  In addition, in 2011 the Government appointed a commission of three international experts to look specifically at the project.  Its terms of reference included an examination of the cost of, and the case for, undergrounding the interconnector.  The commission reported in 2012.  At the time its members appeared before the committee to brief members on their findings.  The underground option has, therefore, been analysed extensively.</p> <p>  The independent expert panel was established at the start of 2014 by the then Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  It is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and includes Professor Colm McCarthy, Professor John Fitzgerald, Professor Keith Bell and Dr. Karen Foley.  It was asked to examine the analysis and assessment of the different technical options, specifically the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector, and come to a view on whether the analysis was the same as that being proposed for the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  It concluded that it was.  Therefore, the same rigour and analysis has been applied to the alternatives, in particular, the undergrounding option for the North-South project.</p> <p>  I will address the question of the new advanced technology that has been potentially deployed for the Grid Link project and the extent to which it may or may not be applicable to other projects.  It is a technology that relies on upgrading the existing grid; therefore, the Grid Link project is about transmitting large power supplies effectively from the Munster region to Leinster and, in particular, the east coast centred around Dublin where there has been and continues to be significant growth in demand.  However, there is a multiplicity of transmission lines between Munster and Leinster.  The new technology which has not been deployed anywhere else for this purpose in Europe before relies on maximising the utilisation of these lines.</p> <p>  In the case of the North-South project, it is about joining two transmission grids - the grid in the Republic and the grid in Northern Ireland.  There is a single link between the two.  While we have two transmission grids, there is a single all-island energy market.  To have the infrastructure underneath to support that single energy market, it is necessary to reinforce it.  Unfortunately,there is only one link and we do not have a multiplicity of lines, the use of which we could maximise.  Therefore, new infrastructure is needed.</p><p>That technology is not appropriate, which means the main technical option for the North-South interconnector is an underground solution using HVDC technology.  As I pointed out, this technology has been the subject of extensive reviews.</p><p> The Chairman asked about the other two major projects.  As part of the Grid West project, EirGrid examined overhead and underground options.  We established that by reducing the voltage from 400 kV to 220 kV, we could potentially underground up to 30 km of the circuit.  We identified and analysed this option.  The analysis of the three options was conducted in line with the terms of reference established and set out by the independent expert panel.  The analysis has been submitted to the panel which is in the process of reviewing it.  Once the review has been concluded, the panel will provide an opinion to the Minister as to whether the analysis meets the terms of reference and the options are set out in an objective and comparable manner.  EirGrid will then publish the detailed analysis that has been submitted to the independent expert panel and engage with local communities in the area in an extended project specific consultation on the three options.</p><p> Grid Link has always been approximately six months behind Grid West in terms of project development.  In addition to an overhead option, which is the one on which we have been engaging with communities and for which we have identified multiple line routes, we are in the process of developing an underground cable route.  This would be a direct point-to-point route from Cork to Kildare rather than a three-point solution, as is the case with the overhead line.  As part of the Grid25 review, which we have been carrying out for the past year, we identified this new technology which is deployed in other parts of the world.  For example, it is deployed in the United States on very long transmission lines that are hundreds of kilometres in length to enable them to be used effectively.  EirGrid has established that in the context of a relatively small system such as the system in Ireland, the technology can be used for a different purpose on existing lines to maximise the power throughput on them.  This is another option in respect of these lines. </p><p> EirGrid will develop these options in further detail.  They are clearly very different across a range of criteria in terms of their impact on the environment, both visual and natural, cost implications and technical characteristics.  They all meet the needs of the regional economy for the next decade or until 2030.  We have stress-tested them specifically against the IDA's regional development strategy and the plans for the region in terms of existing industries and their anticipated development over the relevant period.</p></speech>

My perception of consultation, and I am sure members from the north east and elsewhere will have views on the matter, is that people believe decisions were taken before the consultation took place.  Why was consultation not allowed in advance of decisions being taken?</p></speech>

We listened to the feedback we received last year from communities and local people throughout the country.  I also received some strong feedback from the joint committee during my previous appearance before it.  During last year, we reviewed and examined our consultation process and how we engage with communities.</p><p>In December we published and made available a report and a review that included two independent external reviews on that subject.  Central to this was a set of 12 commitments as to how we would improve our consultation and engagement in the future.  We recognise that delivering large-scale linear infrastructure projects, no matter what their technological implementation, is incredibly difficult.  It is a fact that they have an impact on communities and we need to learn continually and improve on how we engage with communities.</p><p> A key point is that we published our strategy in draft form to allow for comment over an eight-week period.  It was not a case of us saying that this is the new strategy and this is the way it must be.  It was us reflecting on what we had heard as we developed the individual projects and reflecting the changed circumstances in the economy.  We put together a draft strategy for comment.</p><p> I refer to the Chairman's point about the role of consultation in the decision-making.  We are quite clear that we are going into the Grid West project with three options.  We have not decided which one and we do not have a predisposition towards one or the other.  We have the independent expert panel to ensure that as we analyse the options and present the analysis of the options to the public, this is done in a fair, transparent and comparable way in order that people can see the trade-offs that are being made or that need to be made when a selection is being made from options.  Ms Steen may wish to comment on public consultation.</p></speech>

We have advertised to recruit more people to assist us on the ground because we are conscious of reaching out for feedback.  We take very seriously the need to make greater efforts in engaging communities.  In publishing the strategy as a draft, we have demonstrated that we are listening, that we are taking on board feedback and we are trying to change the approach.  However, we have projects at different stages.  As Mr. Slye has explained, some of these projects are quite advanced.  However, we are very committed to making sure that where we can engage with members of the public, we do so.  I am very much aware of the concerns that have been raised here to date and we will be reflecting further on them.</p></speech>

It seems that the company has done a U-turn with regard to the Grid West and the Grid Link south.  When it is good enough for Grid West and Grid Link south, why is it not good enough for the people in the path of the North-South interconnector?  There is significant disquiet in this regard.  There is also significant scepticism with regard to the consultation process.  As I stated, I think it was a decision made by the company to take the energy from one point to the other without any consultation with the people on its path and this has led to the almost stand-off situation at this stage.  Is it fair and equitable for the company to drive on with the proposal on the North-South interconnector?  The company has explained all the technical issues but the fundamental point is that this project will have a detrimental effect on the area in its path.</p> <p>  Over the past two and a half years there has been discussion in this committee and in the D&aacute;il about the cost.  The undergrounding of the project was going to be three times more expensive.  In December 2013 the figure was bandied about that it would be six times the cost of the overgrounding.  This report gives the figure as being 1.57 times the cost.  Why is there such a variation in the figures?  How come the figure of six times the cost has been reduced to 1.57 times the cost?</p><p>Where was the figure of six times the cost found?  What is the cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector?  There is a fear among people on the path of the interconnector that, regardless of consultation with the communities, the offices opened or the engagement, the decisions have been made, the routes are planned and the plan will go ahead.  Why will EirGrid not consider undergrounding the interconnector?  What is the real rationale behind that decision?  The information, technology, knowledge and issues around putting the entire North-South interconnector could be as wrong now as the figures were a year and a half ago.</p><p> The communities are very aggrieved and feel strongly that the consultation is a whitewash, is only ticking a box and will not make any real difference to the overall strategy that EirGrid will announce.</p></speech>

In 2009, we published a detailed, route-specific analysis of undergrounding by the international company, PB Power.  That was updated in 2013.  The Government appointed an international expert commission of three who examined the case for and cost of undergrounding it.  The independent expert panel appointed by the Minister concluded that in all material respects undergrounding had been examined to the same extent and level of detail as was being proposed for the Grid Link and Grid West projects.  All of that analysis has been done for the North-South project.  It has been publicly available and has been debated publicly, including with this committee.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the multiples of the cost as being 1.57 versus six times.  I take it the 1.57 is from the comparison of options for Grid Link in the recent strategy.  For different projects different technology solutions are appropriate and they require different capacities of interconnector.  For Grid Link the proposed underground scheme is 700 MW, but for North-South a 1,500 MW scheme is needed.  Therefore, the comparison is not like for like.  The 1.57 is based on a 700 MW scheme for the Grid Link project.  There is still a band around that &euro;800 million to &euro;850 million as we are still involved in the engineering and detailed design of that.  With the delivery of the east-west interconnector, we have a lot of experience of the costing, engineering and delivery of these high voltage direct current, HVDC, projects.</p><p>The higher cost multiple comes from our detailed engineering analysis of delivering an underground solution for a North-South connector and from the PV power report where the multiple was approximately five.  That is based on a detailed engineering analysis, component by component and route specific, which is all documented and set out in the PV power report, which was updated in 2013.</p><p> The other number often cited is a multiple of three.  This comes from the international expert commission appointed by the Government.  That multiple was not derived through an on-site engineering study, but through comparison with a range of projects around Europe.  The commission carried out an international benchmarking exercise - some of the commission worked closely on those projects and I expect it was good information - and its conclusion was a factor of three.</p></speech>

Was that ever a reality?  I made the point earlier that the communities in the path of the North-South connector will ask why putting the cables underground is not being considered for this project when it is being considered for the other two projects.  Whatever the accurate cost, be it a multiple of 1.75 or 1.57, and considering the damage that will be done to these communities for generations by keeping the cables overhead, is it worth saving on those costs?  Fundamentally, considering the damage that will be done by what is proposed, is putting the cables underground not the best option to protect these communities?  If the cost is only a multiple of 1.57, as stated in the report, putting them underground should be considered.</p></speech>

That cost relates to a comparison of two different things.  In the case of the Grid Link project, to build a 700 MW interconnector between Cork and Kildare, the multiple comparing that to a 400 kV overhead solution that goes from Cork to Waterford to Kildare is 1.57.  However, what is proposed and needed in the case of the North-South connector is technically very different.  It is more than twice the capacity required.</p></speech>

What is in the draft strategy report the Deputy referred to for the Grid Link project is an estimate of the cost of a 700 MW HVDC solution between Munster and Leinster.  In the case of the North-South connector, what is required and needed is power transfer capacity of 1,500 MW.  Therefore, a like-for-like comparison cannot be made.</p></speech>

The same mechanical and engineering works would have to be carried out, whether it involves 700 MW or 1,500 MW, and it is only the capacity that would have to be enlarged.</p></speech>

At that capacity, there are no installations worldwide of that size and we would need twice the infrastructure.  Instead of one cable set in the road, we would need two cable sets in the road.  We would only need one road opening or one trench through agricultural land, but the cost savings from a single mobilisation are far outweighed by the fact we need additional converter stations at each end.  A converter station costs somewhere between &euro;75 million and &euro;100 million and additional cable sets.  Cables cost in excess of &euro;1 million per kilometre.  The costs are not marginal, but potentially double.</p></speech>

The committee might stop me if it is not relevant.  This is one of the reasons why the route for the North-South interconnector has a preference for agricultural land over local roads.  When we were doing the routing for an underground option for the interconnector, we considered all the options, including disused rail lines, existing roads and agricultural land.  We have touched on one of the key issues why, in the case of the North-South interconnector, agricultural land is the optimal route corridor.  That is distinct from the Grid West project, which only needs a third of the capacity, as a 500 MW interconnector, and there is much less sterilisation-----</p></speech>

This is a very contentious issue and there are different aspects which cause concern for people.  Everybody agrees that in this country we need secure, affordable and sustainable energy supplies.  Everybody is conscious of that but how can we get there in an economic way and in a manner that respects people's lives and ways of living?  How we can we do it in a way to deliver the benefits we are seeking?  There are a few components to consider.</p> <p>  The witness mentioned the technological advances that have been made since the last proposals were put forward, particularly in terms of Grid West and Grid Link.  I am unclear about the financial impact of those as there seems to be some contradictory information in the material that we have.  If I read this correctly, the projected cost of &euro;3.2 billion in 2011 will now range from &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.9 billion in 2015.  Another document indicates that there is the option to use existing infrastructure, at least in part, for Grid West and Grid Link, so I would have expected a big reduction in the cost.  Undergrounding is argued to be three times more expensive for the North-South interconnector but people still have serious doubts about that figure.  It is moving around the place.</p> <p>  People will not be reassured by the witness stating that the project is of common interest.  Basically, the indication is this can be fast-tracked through the planning system.  There was mention of consultation with the community.</p><p>Design documents are being drawn up to support planning applications.  As that costs money, it means effectively that decisions have been made.  It is difficult to know what difference public consultations can make as the design decisions have been made.  Otherwise, EirGrid would not be in a position to produce design documents for planning applications.  Am I wrong in saying this?</p><p> EirGrid referred to series compensation technology, which will allow existing infrastructure to be used, but dismisses it for the North-South interconnector project.  As I am not technically knowledgeable enough and do not have technical staff who could advise me on why this must be the case, will the delegation explain to me in simple English why it is that series compensation technology can be used elsewhere but not for the North-South interconnector project?</p><p> Several times during the presentation it was mentioned that too much of a burden must not be placed on communities.  I agree completely, but the burden seems to be in terms of energy bills only.  While this is important, there are other impacts such as on house and home values, agriculture and those involved in the tourism industry.  Has any analysis been carried out of these aspects?  I would have expected one to have been carried out.</p><p> There has been a difference in approach between the North-South interconnector project and projects in the rest of the country.  Will this have an impact on future discussions or proposals for an interconnector project with Britain or France?  If there is to be wider interconnectivity between continental Europe, Britain and Ireland which is not beyond the bounds of possibility, will the same restrictions apply to such a proposal?</p><p> Nowhere in the documentation is the impact of further delays in the North-South interconnector project addressed.  There have been many delay in the project up to now.  I do not see any evidence that progress has been made in getting those who will be immediately impacted on, namely, the host communities whose lands and lives will be impacted on by the interconnector, to understand or to at least accept that this is the way this needs to be done.  The fact that they do not understand or accept this means that some people will resist the project in every legal way they can, despite the object of common interest designation, allowing it to be fast-tracked through the planning system.  What will be the impact if there are further delays?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-21a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Slye" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015042100002#M00200"><p>The Deputy's first question was on technological advances and the financial implications.</p><p>The Deputy said that he would have expected to see a drop in the &euro;3.2 billion number, which was the estimate of the cost of the Grid25 review in 2011.  As he will have seen from the recently published draft strategy, there is a range from &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.9 billion in terms of the cost.</p><p> On a like-for-like comparison basis - in the original 2008 strategy we had assumed an overhead line solution to a project and we assume that is how we would now deliver all the projects - there is a significant drop in the overall costs, which is the &euro;2.7 billion number.  Therefore, the figure of &euro;3.2 billion on a like-for-like comparison basis comes down to &euro;2.7 billion.  However, in addition to that, we have become more open to other technologies and that includes advanced technologies such as series compensation, which I will talk about later, and also underground technologies.  Hence, we have published a range for the total cost because, for many projects, the decision about whether it will be overhead or underground has not been taken and that decision, on a project by project basis, would impact on the cost.  If we took the decision to underground a project, it would increase the cost.</p><p> The Deputy is correct in that some of the new technologies we are deploying are more cost-effective.  Some of them are more expensive but have other advantages such as undergrounding and, hence, the range in the figures.  We moved from a point estimate, which we would have used in the original strategy, to a range in this respect.  We have not picked a solution for many of the linear projects and therefore there is a range in the cost depending on the technology choice.  However, there is a significant scaling back.  The original number was &euro;4 billion in 2008, the number was &euro;3.2 billion in 2011, which is the number that the Deputy selected, and now the number is down to &euro;2.7 billion if one were to a like-for-like comparison.  That reflects the stark change in economic projections and also projections around use of electricity.  That was the Deputy's first question.</p><p> The Deputy's second question, if I picked him up right, was around the multiple of costs for undergrounding the North-South project.  He referenced the three times cost.  That is not a number we produced but one that was produced by the international expert commission, which was appointed by the Government and reported in 2012.  It was its conclusion that deploying a HVDC underground solution in respect of the North-South project would be three times the cost.  Our detailed engineering analysis comes up with a higher number than that and that was the subject of the discussion that I had with Deputy Moynihan.  I am aware that the three times number has been questioned but it is important to make sure when making comparisons to ensure they are like for like comparison of projects.  The three times number is not ours it is that of the international expert commission.</p><p> The Deputy picked up on the project of common interest, PCI, point that I made during my opening remarks and the issue of it being a fast-track process.  The PCI process is a European one that was introduced for what are labelled projects of common interest and they extend across different infrastructural types.  Typically they are cross-Broder projects.  The North-South interconnector has been designated a project of common interest.  The enabling framework within the Irish planning system to give effect to that was put in place late last year and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was appointed as the competent authority for managing projects of common interest.  There is a slightly different process for projects of common interest to the process that would apply for a project such as a substation in Mayo.  One of the key ways it is different is  with respect to the process before application.</p><p>It sets out what is required of the developer in terms of their engagement with localities and communities.  As a result of the designation of North-South, and these regulations came into force in the middle of the North-South project although it had a life before the end of last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the competent authority, had to examine the project and the consultation and engagement that had been done and determine whether it met the requirements for consultation and engagement as set out in the projects of common interest, PCI, regulations.  That is called the concept of public participation, which we had to produce around that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la reviewed that and agreed that we could move forward based on the consultation that had been done.</p><p> The other difference is that under the normal planning rules, the developer submits a planning application, and there is fairly limited engagement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la before that.  Under the PCI process a draft application is provided to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which it reviews, and it must certify that it is fit for purpose before it is submitted as a formal application.  We have been engaged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that since November or December last year when we submitted the draft application.  That is quite a different process.  Once it has determined that the material is fit for purpose it then sets out the schedule of the process involved in lodging the application.  That is everything from site notices to notification of statutory bodies to notices in newspapers, etc.  It sets out that process, and we understand it will take about four weeks.</p></speech>

It has a series of consultations on it in which everyone has an opportunity to have their say.  An oral hearing is conducted.  My understanding of it is that it is not significantly different in terms of what the process looks like from the point of application forward.  That is it in terms of the PCI process.</p> <p>  The next point I picked up was on the new advanced technology we are deploying on the Grid Link as an option, alongside the overhead solution and the underground solution in terms of series compensation technology and why that is not applicable to the north-south project.  I would say it is also not applicable to the Grid West project.  I will attempt to explain and if I do not do so adequately, members can feel free to interrupt me.  It is technology that is deployed on existing transmission lines in existing transmission stations.</p><p>It is large transmission kit such as one would see in a transmission station.  It is put on the ends of a transmission line and it changes the electrical characteristics of that transmission line and allows more power to be pushed over the line than would happen in the absence of this technology.  When this technology is put in, it allows the maximisation of the power transfer over the existing transmission line.  Advanced control systems now allow the possibility to change how that happens from the control centre as well.</p><p> In the case of Grid Link, that works because we have a need to move large amounts of power from the south and south west, where generation is growing in the Cork-Kerry area, up towards the east, centred around Dublin where there is demand growth.  That is one of the key parts of the Grid Link project.  There is a multiplicity of existing transmission lines which run from the general south and south east area to the Dublin area.  The existing transmission network covering that is a mesh network.  Therefore, existing transmission lines are in place upon which we can place this technology to maximise use.  If that multiplicity of lines can currently carry 100 units of power, by deploying this technology we can raise that to, say, 110 or 120 units of power.  </p><p> We need to do two other things as well to solve the Grid Link issue.  One is to up-rate seven or eight existing lines in the Golden Vale south east region, which we can do.  That involves upgrading and changing conductors on the lines in existing infrastructure to allow them to carry more power.  The second thing we need to do is to install another cable underneath the River Shannon.  We are trying to get power which is being generated in the Cork-Kerry area out so we need to get it underneath the Shannon and onto the 400 kV lines, where we are going to deploy this technology, and maximise the use of those 400 kV lines, which start at Moneypoint station and travel up towards Dublin. </p><p> That is why it works in the case of Grid Link.  It does not work in the case of North-South or Grid West because the problem is a different one  In the case of North-South, the problem is that there are two different transmission grids.  We have a single, all-island energy market but two transmission grids with, currently, one link between them.  We need to enable the two grids to be operated more seamlessly together to maximise the benefits of the all-island market.  To do that, we need to put in place another piece of infrastructure alongside the existing one.  We do not have the underlying network to utilise; it needs new infrastructure.  Hence, the technical options boil down to an overhead option or an underground option to do that.</p></speech>

In order to transmit electricity, we need a circuit in between.  The technologies to do that are either underground or overhead technologies.  If we go underground, we need the large converter stations at either end, because the underground technology uses a different power transmission technology.  It uses high-voltage, direct current, HVDC, technology.  All of the grid, all of the material in this room, everything we have, uses AC technology.  We therefore need these converter stations to convert the power from AC to DC and back again.  When we talk about converter stations, that is what that is.  The HVDC cable is completely underground, but we have these converter stations at either end to convert them in and out.  Hence, there is no existing network on which to deploy the technology to which I referred for Grid Link series compensation to maximise the usage of it.  It is a case of needing additional infrastructure and examining what are the options for it.  I hope I have managed to explain that.</p><p> The Deputy's next question, if I understood him correctly, was on the analysis of other impacts besides just the economic impact on energy prices.  There has been extensive analysis of other impacts on communities.  The planning application requires us to look at a broad range of environmental impacts and effects.  The terms of reference set out by the independent expert panel chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness sets out terms of reference for both Grid West and Grid Link, including effects on the environment, technical impacts and cost impacts.  So that range of other impacts is considered and we have engaged with the community on them.  The Deputy mentioned some of them relating to tourism, for example.

We are seeing more of a need to do this as growth in demand is predominantly on the east coast and centred in Dublin.  There is increased generation capacity, largely from wind power, which tends to be generated on the west, north-west and south-west coasts.  This did happen in the past, with generation stations being sited in Dublin and recently in Cork.  The most recent generator was built in Waterford city, at the site of the original Great Island station.  The ESB built the Moneypoint power plant in the early 1980s and, although it sited the station on the Shannon Estuary to facilitate the importation of coal, it built two 400 kV lines to Dublin which was the demand centre at the time.  The plant at Moneypoint feeds demand almost directly in north and south Dublin for the very reasons the Senator has articulated.</p></speech>

Such facilities require huge amounts of power, significantly more than we would have typically seen in the case of industries connected to the transmission system.  We are working very closely with IDA Ireland to make sure, as it engages with companies to try to encourage them to come to Ireland, it is doing so with the knowledge of where the infrastructure would best suit them is located.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to one benefit in his point about the security of supply issues arising for Northern Ireland after 2020.  However, we also set up an all-island electricity market in 2007 but we do not yet have the transmission grid to allow it to operate seamlessly.  Therefore, while one of the benefits of the project is that we will address the security of supply issue for Northern Ireland, another benefit is that will allow us to deal with a bottleneck which is costing customers across the island approximately &euro;30 million per annum in additional constraint costs.  Over the long term the security of supply benefits will accrue to everyone on the island.  While Northern Ireland faces an issue in the short term, an all-island energy market will allow consumers on every part of the island to access the most efficient source of generation irrespective of where on the island it is located.  While the immediate issue for Northern Ireland arises in 2020, beyond that point generation capacity will be developed in various locations in Northern Ireland.  This potentially includes redevelopment of Coolkeeragh, Ballylumford or Kilroot.  It is important that consumers across the island are able to access the benefits accruing from these developments.</p></speech>

Has EirGrid whetted the appetite for underground transmission by allowing people to see that it is much nicer than using poles?  As Deputy Colreavy noted, it affects the value of properties nearby.  People see that as a positive benefit, and they contrast the legislative requirement for a pole with these miniature factories scattered across the country.</p><p>As a former director of Bord F&aacute;ilte, I am aware of our efforts to promote Ireland as a green destination.  This is particularly important because we are never going to attract visitors on the basis of our climate alone.

All of these are part of the tool box of options we look at to ensure, in coming up with a solution, that it balances all of the relevant factors and represents the right answer for Ireland Inc.

Mr. Slye indicated that expenditure on the project had reduced from an estimated &euro;4.2 billion to &euro;3.2 billion and, ultimately, to &euro;2.7 billion.  He talked about how the international panel had found in 2012 that undergrounding would cost three times as much as proceeding with the overground option.  He suggested that he disagreed with that estimate, but one would assume an international panel would have some expertise in the matter.  Will he clarify that point?</p> <p>  As I understand it, there is an intention to provide an interconnector between France and Ireland in due course.  Looking to the long term, does it make sense to go around the country installing pylons and wind turbines when the probability is that in ten to 15 years time we will not be able to produce electricity more cheaply than the price at which it can be imported?  In England, for example, they have kicked the wind turbines to touch and given a contract to the French to build five plants.  In Mr. Slye's opinion, is the most likely scenario one in which it will be cheaper to import electricity than to produce it here?</p> <p>  Mr. Slye referred to working with IDA Ireland in the regions.  That must be a recent development because everything that organisation has been doing has been focused on Dublin.  It is not in the past three, four or ten years that consideration has been given to the regions.</p> <p>  Investment in motorway infrastructure in recent years has left us with a good network.  By and large, that development managed to avoid, as much as possible, impacting on home owners.  In deciding the location of pylons and other infrastructure why does EirGrid not seem to give the same consideration to avoiding building near people's houses?  Why has it not worked in conjunction with the National Roads Authority in devising these projects rather than imposing a blight on the landscape in all parts of Ireland?</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Colreavy and Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the impact of this infrastructure on property prices.  Has EirGrid undertaken any analysis of the extent to which the homes of people living 50 m or 100 m from these unsightly pylons will be devalued?  The delegates have indicated that they took account of the impact on tourism and referred to community grants, which seems to be the buzz phrase.  Community grants are being talked about like the pill the doctor will give to the patient to make him or her better.  However, ordinary people, many of whom are in negative equity, are understandably concerned about the impact of pylons and turbines on the valuation of their property.  We have seen how much the technology has advanced in the past six months throughout Europe and the world in dealing with cryptosporidium and other types of water pollution.  I am sure that if similar progress is made in the case of electricity infrastructure, networking could become a very efficient and cost-effective way to go.</p><p>Has Mr. Slye looked at the cost base analysis given that more people are working, be it digging or whatever, and more tax is returned to the Exchequer and it may be a better option for everyone's sake?  I ask Mr. Slye to address particularly the issue of England and France.  Are we going down a road where there will be wires and pylons all over the country?</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, in 2012 we completed the east-west interconnector, a 500 MW link to Wales from Ireland, which has been in commercial operation since then.  We are investigating further interconnection.  That is part of our overall remit and mandate.  The one that is most advanced that we are looking at is an interconnector to France.  We are working with our colleagues the French transmission system operator, RTE, on evaluating that.  We have done an initial analysis of it to see whether it stacks up from an economic perspective and it does.  It appears to work and we have commissioned a seabed survey which will take place over two years.  The first half took place last summer, the second half will be completed this summer.  That largely informs the cost of building it.  Once one knows what is on the seabed one can better estimate the cost.  This will lead us to a detailed rigorous cost benefit analysis of that project in the first half of next year with a decision as to whether, at that point, to bring it to the next stage of development in association with the French.</p> <p>  In terms of interconnectors and their effect on electricity prices and electricity flows I will look first at the east-west interconnector.  About nine months after it was in operation at the end of the first calendar year, we conducted a retrospective analysis as to effect on electricity prices.  We found that the existence of the interconnector and the ability to move power over it had reduced wholesale electricity prices by 9% from what they would have been had the interconnector not been in place.  That was due largely to power moving from the UK into Ireland.  The typical profile of the interconnector for a large part of the time since it has come into operation is that cheaper power comes from the UK into Ireland; its cheaper base load power being nuclear gas traded over the interconnector and into Ireland brings down wholesale prices.  When it is very windy in Ireland the flow tends to go the other way as we have a surplus and sell that excess energy to the UK. </p> <p>  In looking at an interconnector with France, obviously for it to go ahead it would have to be a 50-50 joint venture with the French.  It needs to work both overall but also for each country individually.  It needs to make sense for Irish consumers to make an investment of that level in an interconnector.  In looking at the cost benefit analysis of the interconnector we have to ensure it stacks up overall.  The French will look at it from a French perspective and we will look at it from an Irish perspective.   In broad terms the way it pans out, similar to the UK interconnector to an extent, is that at times of relatively low renewable generation across Ireland and the UK, French based nuclear power which is largely nucular would flow into Ireland and have the effect of depressing electricity prices at a wholesale level.  At times when it was relatively windy, the flow of large amounts of renewable resources on these islands reverse and be sold into the UK.  Obviously, that is a very broad generalisation of what would happen on those interconnectors over time.  The French electricity system is quite different from that of the UK electricity system hence the diversity in the two sources works quite well.</p><p>The French electricity system is dominated by nuclear power, which has a relatively low incremental cost of production.  It is also relatively inflexible, so that works in terms of interconnecting and getting cheap electricity.</p></speech>

In ten to 15 years' time, does Mr. Slye think that when England builds five new plants they will be bothered about taking electricity from us?  They have kicked wind energy to touch.  If we have an interconnector with France, does Mr. Slye think that we can compete?  We have had meetings here to talk about energy security throughout Europe.  In a business frame of mind, does Mr. Slye think it would be produced in England and France a lot cheaper than here, given the investment we have to put in?</p></speech>

If one looks ten, 20 or 25 years down the road, for example, if there was an interconnector with France in addition to one to the UK, one would see benefits accruing to both.  We would produce it more cheaply and efficiently than in either of those two other jurisdictions, with large amount of wind and renewable resources here.</p></speech>

We would have very low incremental cross-generation, potentially at zero, if it is coming from renewable resources.  At that level we can compete against nuclear power stations.  As the Deputy rightly points out, in the UK they have moved away from onshore to offshore wind energy.  Offshore wind energy is significantly more expensive, so onshore wind can compete with that quite effectively.  Therefore, some 30% of the time, I think one would see-----</p></speech>

The case for interconnection will have to stand on its own.  It is a single investment in a single piece of infrastructure and it is a big price-tag.</p> <p>  The other part of the Deputy's question concerns energy policy.  With the 40% target, for example, and that level of renewable generation, what will be the impact upon electricity prices in, say, ten years' time?  A detailed analysis of that has been done.  It is currently being finalised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We provided some modelling expertise for it.  The SEAI, ourselves and one other party were involved.  They are finalising that study and, as I understand it, they hope to publish it soon.  That specifically examines the question the Deputy is getting at in terms of going to the 2020 target of 40% renewables in electricity and the net costs and benefits, versus a system that, for example, keeps today's levels, which are about 20%.  That study gets to the heart of the Deputy's question.</p><p>It has not yet been published, although I understand it is being finalised.</p><p> Interconnectors tend to increase the value of the renewable resource because at times of high wind and low demand when it cannot be used, they provide a market into which one can sell and obtain some value.  As I indicated, an interconnector represents a very large investment in a single piece of infrastructure and the business case for it would have to stack up and be rigorously analysed on both sides.  This means that the French and Irish sides would have to come together to undertake the analysis.  That may be an issue that is slightly separate from the question the Deputy asked.</p></speech>

This reduction reflects the decrease in the underlying projections for electricity demand until 2025 and beyond and the potential to use advanced technology to maximise the use of additional infrastructure.  The range in cost figures is due to the fact that for many of the projects we have not determined what will be the choice of technology.  Therefore, if the more expensive technology is chosen, the figure will move towards the upper end of the range.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked a question about the international expert panel and how the multiple of three in terms of costs related to EirGrid's higher projected costs for the North-South interconnector.  The reason the panel and EirGrid arrived at different costs was that two methodologies were used to produce the figures.  I do not disagree with the findings of the international panel of experts which benchmarked broadly similar projects and arrived at an estimate of three times the cost of overgrounding.  It used, if one likes, a top-down approach, whereas EirGrid took a bottom-up approach involving an engineering analysis and the identification of a route.  We costed the route and all of the individual components and produced a higher figure for overall costs.  The difference in the two figures can be attributed to the methodology and approaches employed.  I hope that explains the difference. </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about working with the National Roads Authority.  When EirGrid is examining the options for routing overhead transmission lines or underground cables, we consider how best to route them.  For example, the underground cable for the east-west interconnector, a 500 MW interconnector, uses existing roads from Rush beach to Woodlands station.  Typically, it is better to use second class roads than motorways because they do not need to be closed and the works can be accommodated.</p> <p>  For the North-South interconnector, the best option we identified was to use agricultural land owing to a much larger land use requirement for the project.  We work with the National Roads Authority and examine options alongside motorways.  However, the routing principles for transport infrastructure along motorways tend to be different from those for transmission lines.  We consider all of these issues.  The key factor is that when one is examining routes for an overhead transmission line, one is trying to mitigate the visual impact and the proximity to houses and community facilities.  In Ireland there is a large number of one-off houses and we try to keep as far away from them as possible when routing a transmission line.  While EirGrid works with local authorities and the NRA on routing, placement alongside roads is not always a viable option.</p></speech>

Mr. Slye has confirmed that the interconnector to Wales is a 500 MW cable and obviously there are no pylons on that route.  What is its length in kilometres or miles?  What is the length of the interconnector to France?  Is it a 500 MW cable?  Is it correct that the interconnector to Northern Ireland is a 400 MW line?  It is not.  I am trying to compare the North-South interconnector with the east-west interconnector and with the interconnector to France.  It all depends on the distance and the length of the cable to Wales.  I suggest that the North-South interconnector should be a maximum length of 400 kV underground cable and overhead where it is less conspicuous and then back underground.  I presume that the interconnector between Ireland and Wales would be 60 or 70 miles, from Rush beach to Wales.  Could the North-South interconnector combine both overhead and underground lines for a similar distance?</p></speech>

Along with other Deputies here I represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  The communities in Cavan-Monaghan are very concerned that they have not been treated in the same fair and equitable manner as people in Grid Link and Grid West.  There is a fundamental difference in the way they have been treated in terms of consultation compared with the people in the west and south.  We are coming to the commemoration of the 1916 centenary.  There is a concept of cherishing all the children of the nation equally but we do not feel that we have been treated equally with people in other parts of the country.  I asked the landowners of County Monaghan to sign a petition to the Minister, Deputy Alex White before the committee meeting of 31 March.  Some 95% of the landowners affected are opposed to overgrounding.  They want a specific underground route option and they want to be consulted on it.  Some 350 fifty people attended a meeting last night in Aughnamullen community centre and they are all totally opposed to the overgrounding of this project.  There is huge community disquiet about the approach taken by EirGrid.</p> <p>  On the point made by Mr. Slye about regional gain, there is absolutely no regional gain in Cavan or Monaghan from this project because the company has not included any converter stations.  The previous application included converter stations at Kingscourt but there are no converter stations planned as part of this application so therefore there can be no community gain nor regional gain in the area affected by the project.</p> <p>  The company has pointed out here for the first time that it is technically feasible to put this project underground for the length of the line and that is welcome.  The company has said that it will take &euro;500 million more to put it underground than the cost for overground.  A number of questions were asked at last night's meeting about the fact that the valuation of property has not been included in the cost of the overground option when compared with the underground option.  There is also the question of the effect on tourism in the region if the lines are overground.  A number of technical questions were asked and I have some technical questions which I wish the company to address.  Mr. Slye said that the project was needed in its current form because of bottlenecks between transfer of energy between the North and South.  It is my understanding that the daily flow of electricity between the North and South is between 150 MW and 170 MW and that based on the company's own figures and safety requirements, the current interconnector can take a capacity of 400 MW per day but only 150 MW to 170 MW is being used at a maximum at tea time while the average is around 100 MW per day.  There are three power stations in Northern Ireland producing up to 2,300 MW of energy per day.</p><p>The average daily consumption of energy in Northern Ireland is 1,200 MW to 1,300 MW.  They can produce 2,300 MW per day.  The maximum daily use ever of energy in Northern Ireland was 1,700 MW in December 2010 during the very bad weather.</p><p> They say the maximum flow they can take in is 400 MW per day but the daily average, according to the website, is between 150 MW and 170 MW.  I question the need for this project at a 400 kV line.  In EirGrid&rsquo;s technical guide to the project there is no technical analysis whatsoever of a 220 kV underground option which would cost much less than a 400 kV underground option.  It could produce an additional 500 MW per day with a 220 kV line underground.  That would be technically possible and that option should be before the people.  It has not been put before them and that needs to be done before the project goes ahead.  I have communicated this message to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Delegates from the Irish Farmers Association attended the meeting last night and they were unequivocal in saying they believe a 220 kV line is sufficient, given that the three power stations in Northern Ireland have not been closed down and there is new private gas generation contracted to produce an extra 250 MW through traditional sources.</p><p> Mr. Slye mentioned the Tobin report.  The independent expert panel chaired by Ms Justice McGuinness did not have access to the Tobin report before it made its analysis.  There is a complete variance between what the Tobin report and PB Power say about the best options.  The Tobin report said the preferred route options were underground along roads.  PB Power said that was the least best option.</p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la was appointed the competent authority for the project of common interest, PCI, element.  Under European law there should have been a Chinese wall placed between the people evaluating pre-project the draft proposal and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which would consider the proposal at an oral hearing.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la put the draft application on its website.  So much for Chinese walls and complying with European legislation.</p><p> We were told at the meeting last night that since EirGrid consulted with An Bord Plean&aacute;la it has changed the pylon locations again.</p></speech>

I went to Gibbstown yesterday.  There is deep anger there about putting pylons on historic ground such as the site of the Tailteann Games.</p> <p>  What is the distance pylons have to be from the habitat of the whooper swan, which is of international importance, and of the golden plover, which is very important in the Blackwater Valley?  How far does a pylon have to be from a proposed wind turbine?  I have been told that there is an agreement between EirGrid and Element Power that there must be a specific distance between the two.  What does the distance have to be between a person&rsquo;s home and a pylon?  I understand it has to be 400 m between a whooper swan&rsquo;s habitat and a pylon and that between a pylon and an Element wind turbine it has to be 800 m, and 50 m from a person&rsquo;s home.  I regard the whooper swan habitat as extremely important and I do not want EirGrid to destroy it but can the witnesses explain the logic of setting a 400 m distance from a whooper swan&rsquo;s home but only 50 m from a person&rsquo;s home in the same area of County Meath?</p><p>It does not make sense to people.

The draft review indicated that an underground line would be feasible and Mr. Slye confirmed that here today when he stated it would be technically possible engineering wise.  He also indicated there are other advantages that have to be taken into account, not just the issue of cost.  This is something we have argued with EirGrid over many years.  There are other advantages, some of which can be quantified in euro and cents.  It is about the people who are so dramatically impacted by what is proposed.</p> <p>  Mr. Slye stated that consumers should not be burdened, given there would be no enhancement of service by taking the underground approach.  He cited the cost of converter stations, AC to DC, at either end and also stated that they cannot "pass on" to consumers.  What cannot be passed on, and over what period of time?  We are looking at a project with a suggested life expectancy of 40 years.  Therefore, what are we talking about in terms of the per annum additionality or the two-monthly billing period most of us are subjected to from Electric Ireland?  What additionality are we talking about and over what period of time?  What is the maximum period this could apply to?</p> <p>  As somebody who is not impacted immediately, in terms of living in close proximity to the line, I believe the additional cost per consumer would be marginal over a period.  I am quite willing to pay, because I know what my constituents and those in neighbouring counties, not only in this jurisdiction but North of the Border, would have to face.  We must face up to this.  Does Mr. Slye have the figures on that rather than just saying "we cannot pass it on to consumers", as if he was particularly concerned about consumers.  I mean no disrespect, but we are all consumers, including the families and individuals who will be dramatically impacted if this presents in close proximity to their homes.</p> <p>  Mr. Slye's opening remark was that the interconnector is needed now and he stressed the word "now".   I do not believe there is any likelihood this will happen any time soon.  We must also recognise there are significantly reduced demand forecasts, right up to 2025 and beyond.  What does he mean by "needed now" when those forecasts apply not only in regard to the economy in this State but across the island?  The forecasts in terms of demand are significantly reduced from what would have been believed back before the current more difficult economic climate. </p> <p>  EirGrid has engaged with people on a range of issues, such as land valuation, which is a huge concern for land and homeowners.  This is understandable.  The issue of the environmental impact has also been raised and reference has been made to tourism.  However, this is also about the people who live in the area concerned.  Perhaps some of the subtext to the decision not to take another look at the North-South connector is because it does not belong to the traditional tourist destinations, such as the west or the south east.  However, those of us who live in or visit the area are very concerned in terms of the visual impact for the potential market for the development of the north east.</p> <p>  I have a range of other concerns, including one everyone dismisses, namely, health.  This is not just about being unwell.  Health is about being well and having a sense of wellness.</p><p>I have heard of one instance of a young man, whose mother spoke to me last evening.  They live in immediate proximity to a 36 kV line and they know the facts.  This young man has special needs and is unable to leave the family home and use anything around the periphery of their smallholding because of the continuous crackling from the line.  Even in damp weather conditions, there is also occasional flickering.  There is a noise factor, even with a 38 kV line.  This will be replaced and there is no consideration given to the fact that this young man has a very severe level of autism and all the complicating factors it entails in terms of the health and quality of life of that family.  There has been no care whatever shown in any of the so-called consultations that have taken place.</p><p> Time is against me and there is a range of issues I would have liked to raise with the delegation.  The Tobin Consulting Engineers report was mentioned earlier.  Why was the information in that report not presented to the independent expert panel in the consideration of its extended brief?  It was a minuscule responsibility in terms of taking on the North-South interconnector.  It was a number of days after the publication of that report that the content was shown with respect to the width and depth of the channels to accommodate roadside undergrounding.  The PB Power report indicated 20 m to 22 m working swathes but the reality from the Tobin report was that the width is 1.1 m and the depth is 1.35 m.  That is absolutely achievable along the greatest lengths of the regional road infrastructure that serves the counties of Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone.  It is absolutely achievable and there has never been any serious consideration, despite all that EirGrid and its voices have claimed, of the undergrounding approach with respect to the North-South interconnector.  It has not happened and the PB Power report does not tick the box under any circumstances.  There has been no consultation with the people on the ground on this real alternative.  The figures on potential cost have decreased and this will continue.  Some day, EirGrid will wake up and wonder what all the fuss was about and how it should have considered this approach all along.</p></speech>

I welcome the chief executive's clear statement in response to my party colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, that it is feasible to underground the North-South interconnector project.  I suggest that in advancing the project, EirGrid should consult the local community about undergrounding options.</p> <p>  Another issue that has not entered the debate much is that the project is for a relatively short distance interconnector, making it completely different from the western project and the example in the South and midlands.  The technical analysis document states that Grid25 was predicated on forecasted electricity demand at a peak of 8,000 MW daily by 2025.  The forecast is now over 5,000 MW daily, which is the same as the 2011 peak.  Will the witnesses confirm which figures are correct in that respect?</p> <p>  I attended the public meeting referred to by Deputies Conlan and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in last night in Aghnamullen, County Monaghan.  More than 400 decent, honourable local people attended that meeting to voice their concerns, anger and their absolute frustration with the inability of EirGrid to have a meaningful consultation to date.  They gave a clear message that they will not be treated as second-class citizens.</p><p>Whereas there was a meaningful external panel assessment of the grid projects for the west, the south east and the midlands, the North-South interconnector was an add-on without a meaningful review being undertaken.  It is welcome that two of the other projects were substantially changed in terms of how they would be completed.  Why can it not be the same for the people of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath?</p><p> Deputy Michael Colreavy asked about the adverse impact of the interconnector on land values and the devaluation of property.  It certainly beats Banagher to hear Mr. Fitzgerald refer to an international qualitative assessment.  What about the man or woman who milks 40 or 50 cows a day and whose holding, if traversed by these pylons, would be decimated and no longer be in a position to carry on his or her existing farming practices?  One does not need to have any international assessment to know that the real adverse impact of these pylons would be on these individuals, families and communities.  We need to get real in the consultations with people and communities.  When the project was first initiated in 2009, the cost of putting the lines underground was put at 20 times more than that of overgrounding.  Today EirGrid has stated it will be a small multiple of the cost, if at all.  The clear message has to go to EirGrid that the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath want the North-South interconnector project, if it is to proceed, to be put underground.</p></speech>

While I may be from Dublin asking about an interconnector that does not affect my area, I am a Senator for all of Ireland.  I have had questions on this matter e-mailed to me by constituents from right around the country.</p> <p>  Two years ago EirGrid stated it would be six times more expensive to put the North-South interconnector underground.  However, in a review published several weeks ago it stated it would be only 1.57 times more expensive.  That is a significant variation in the costs involved.  A child could have the done mathematics better.  Why is there such a significant variation in costs?</p> <p>  In the original plans all three lines were supposed to be 400 kV overhead lines on pylons.  Now EirGrid claims 200 kV lines are needed for the Grid West project, with partial undergrounding.  Why was this change introduced?  Why can this not be done in the case of the North-South interconnector?</p></speech>

Perhaps the answers might be emailed to me.</p> <p>  Was the consultation process the same for the North-South interconnector project as for the other grid projects?  I would have believed all consultations were the same.  If they were different, why was that the case?  The Tobin report indicated a trench 1.1 m wide and 1.35 m in depth was required, whereas the McGuinness panel recommended a 20 m to 22 m working swathe.  Again, why is there another significant variation?  Why was this information not made available at the time?  One would have believed this was common European information.</p> <p>  Will EirGrid consider reviewing the distance between pylons an people&rsquo;s homes?  Does it agree or disagree that homes and farms could be devalued?  Some people may be put out of business, but others could gain because of the better interconnection we all hope to have.</p><p> Mr. Slye has a hard job of work to do.  It is hard to satisfy everybody.  People will examine the question of community gain in this project.  I have received e-mails from people in Cavan and Monaghan stating that there is no community gain deriving from this project.  The question of community gain also arises with the erection of wind turbines.  One of the Deputies said there would be no converter stations and raised the issue of employment creation.</p><p> With regard to planning applications, the reference to this project devaluing homes is a huge issue, not only in terms of a property but in terms of people's health.  I do not know if Mr. Slye can answer that wide-ranging question.  I have asked six or seven questions and if he cannot answer them now or if he answered them previously, I would appreciate if he would reply to them by e-mail.  I can put them in writing to him, if he would like and I would appreciate a brief answer to them followed up by a longer response in an e-mail.</p></speech>

The east-west interconnector is approximately 260 km end to end and it is a 500 MW link.  Its power transfer capacity is 500 MW.

Between Ireland and Northern Ireland we have a single energy market.  The single electricity market was established in 2007 and that is a single energy market for the island of Ireland.  Underpinning that, however, are two distinct and different transmission grids.  They have developed separately and differently and they have a single link today between them.  We need to put a second link beside them so that those two grids can operate seamlessly together as part of the single electricity market we have on this island.</p> <p>  Interconnection to either France or the United Kingdom is a different proposition.  It is not about having a single market that operates seamlessly between the two jurisdictions.  It is about the trade of power between the two jurisdictions.  It is a different proposition.</p> <p>  I was asked about the ability to mix overhead and underground for the North-South project.</p></speech>

That was its estimate based on a top-down review of similar projects around the world.  We did a bottom-up analysis in the Parsons Brinckerhoff, PB, report which indicated that it would cost an additional &euro;500 million to put it underground.  That answers the multiples question.</p><p> We have looked at mixing overhead and underground lines for the North-South project, and some of the additional information we supplied to An Bord Plean&aacute;la was on whether short stretches up to 10 km of the North-South overhead line could be put underground to mitigate specific local concerns.  That information has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as part of our discussions with it on the draft application in terms of additional information it sought on that project.  We are acutely conscious that that is an option we examined.</p><p> I apologise to Deputy Conlan if I do not get to answer all his questions.  If there are any questions to which we do not have the answers, we will send him those, but in the interests of saving time I will try to get through as many of them as quickly as possible.  The first question was on the treatment of the analysis done on North-South versus the analysis done on Grid West and Grid Link and the perception of communities in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan that they were not afforded the same level of analysis as was done on those other projects.  I believe that undergrounding has been examined in great detail to a similar level as now proposed for Grid West and Grid Link.  To that end-----</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  However, a specific underground route was examined and published.  Members who have looked at the back of the PB Power report will see an Ordnance Survey map that sets out the route corridor.</p> <p>  The next question was on regional gain on which I will make two points.  First, the existence of a high voltage AC transmission line such as this one affords opportunities to interconnect into it, even without the station being there initially, and a great example of that is Apple in Athenry.  It is not connecting in to an existing station.  We are building a new transmission station for it, tapping in to an existing high voltage transmission line.  The existence of that corridor, therefore, provides access to high quality, high voltage electricity that will allow for developments into the future.  We see that with Apple, and we are seeing it more frequently with other companies that are looking to develop and tap in to an existing line.</p> <p>  I would point out also that we have in place a proposal on community gain that includes both a community fund for the wider community and also a proximity allowance payable to householders in recognition of the fact that transmission infrastructure has a greater impact on those immediately adjacent to it in terms of their visual amenity.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of bottlenecks in the current flow of the existing line, power capacity in Northern Ireland and projections for security supply in Northern Ireland.  If I might, I will group those three issues in my answer.  Every year we review the security of supply on the entire island.</p><p>We look at it in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and on the island as a whole.  It is updated every year based on best projections for economic growth and electricity demand growth resulting from that.   The document, called the Generation Capacity Statement, is published every year, and it is approved by the regulators North and South before it is published.  That document clearly articulates the security supply issue that is emerging in Northern Ireland in 2020 as security of supply margins dip below what is acceptable.  That is due in part to the impending closure of some of the power stations in Northern Ireland.</p><p> For those who are not aware, two of the power stations in Northern Ireland use coal and there are European directives around the continued use of those power stations.  A number of power stations closures are imminent in Northern Ireland and they are set out in our report.  However, the security supply margin dips below what is acceptable from the end of this decade onwards.</p></speech>

A single event would be able to take down the systems in Northern Ireland and the Republic if we did that.  The Deputy correctly articulated broadly the size of the system in Northern Ireland.  It has an average load of 1,400 MW or 1,500 MW.  If all of that was flowing, in the Deputy's example, on that single set of towers between North and South and someone drove a truck into one of the towers, the power system in Northern Ireland would be immediately collapsed.</p></speech>

It is called the N minus 1, N-1, principle.  The transmission system and the power grids around the world are operated so that no one thing, no matter what it is, should take down or damage supply to the grid.  It is a fairly basic principle.  The situations outlined by the Deputy in terms of Coolkeeragh, Moyle and all of those issues have been analysed in the generation adequacy report.  Under all of the reasonable scenarios around those issues, the security supply margin in Northern Ireland becomes inadequate at the end of the decade and needs to be addressed.  Security supply is incredibly important to business, industry and the economy.  Hence, reliance on the single line between North and South is limited by the fact that it is a single line and any one thing could potentially take it out of commission.</p></speech>

He asked why those costs would be passed on to consumers and the impact over the lifetime of the project.  In the context of transmission development, at the end of the day consumers end up paying for the cost of the transmission network.  It is broken down and differentiated depending on the consumer group, with industrial consumers tending to have a greater percentage of their bill relating to transmission charges than domestic customers.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact on people's bills, I am aware of one piece of analysis that was done.  The energy regulator reported to this committee that if the transmission infrastructure development bill was to increase by &euro;2 billion through the undergrounding of a series of the major projects, it would raise prices by 3% to 5% at domestic level.  This is on the record of this committee and I may not have it 100% right.  The one point I want to stress is that industrial customers pay significantly more as a percentage of their bills in transmission chargers.  For some of those industrial customers, who are among the largest employers in the country, the additional energy bill in a year could exceed &euro;1 million.  Therefore, 3% to 5% in some contexts might not seem like a large amount of money, but we need to consider the effect on all users of the system and how that affects Ireland's competitiveness.</p></speech>
