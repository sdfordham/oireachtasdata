We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahoney.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Marc MacSharry and Josepha Madigan.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 2 February 2017.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I do not think there is anything specific arising from the minutes that we will not cover in the normal course of our work.</p><p> The next item is correspondence received.  Let us go through the correspondence received since the last meeting.  No. 294A is the briefing document from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  No. 295A is the opening statement from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We will note and publish that.</p><p> Category B correspondence is from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings.  The first item is correspondence from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, providing clarification on a couple of points on Project Eagle.  This is noted.  That letter was from 22 December.</p><p> Category C correspondence is next.  We will put it up on the screen.  It is dated 8 February 2017.  It is an e-mail, not a formal letter.  It has points of clarification and we will circulate it as quickly as possible.  It deals with the dates of the meetings.  Did we get the difference between board-----</p></speech>

They call some of them "board only", and they call some "board meeting".  I asked what the difference is.  I am told that the "board only" were the board members without any of the executives present and that the "board meeting" included the executives who were recording it.  We never asked anything about what notes were taken at the board meeting, but maybe none were taken.  It was probably just board members having their own chat.  Maybe that is where the real business is done.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  I just wanted to clarify and distinguish them.  Who took the minutes at the board only meetings?</p></speech>

Fine.  If there is an issue, we will come back to it, but it seems to be a minor point.  We will circulate that if it has not been circulated.</p> <p>  Correspondence category C is from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Item No. 281C, formally notes correspondence received from Deputy MacSharry, which has been circulated.  It was mentioned at the last meeting.  The correspondence relates to a property acquisition by Galway County Council in 2007.  We have agreed to note it and we can specifically raise it with the Secretary General of the Department.  I think he is coming in.  We will talk to Deputy MacSharry about it.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will be before the committee in the next couple of weeks.  We will formally put him on notice that we will raise that topic, and we can decide if we want to take it further after that.</p> <p>  Item No. 282C is a letter from Professor William Donnelly, the president of Waterford Institute of Technology, clarifying a comment that he made at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting in December 2015 regarding directorship of a campus company.  We note this.  Deputy Cullinane wants to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#B02500"><p>For the record of the committee, I was contacted by telephone by Professor Donnelly.  He had informed me that he had been before the Committee of Public Accounts and had made an error in information that he gave.  I advised him to write into us to correct the record, which he has done.  He has been in contact with me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#B02600"><p>That is appreciated and we have noted the letter and we have read it.  I thank Deputy Cullinane.</p><p>Item No. 284C is a letter dated 1 February 2015, from a company called Flow East that was involved in a bid process run by NAMA for a property portfolio in the Czech Republic.  The letter raises concerns about the process conducted in the disposal of the Savarin portfolio.  The letter states that a full review into all NAMA projects should be conducted.  While the correspondence refers to information already received from NAMA, we should look for a note from NAMA on this case for the information of the committee.  We will seek a note from NAMA and then we can decide what to do next.</p><p>Item No. 285C is correspondence from an individual regarding the committee's role in the review of the wards of court fund.  The individual in question has been in regular contact with the committee about this matter.  We are still awaiting a departmental response.  Once we receive it, we can decide what action, if any, we can take at that stage.  We had a report, and we have recently asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to respond to the most recent comments.  We are waiting for the Department to come back to us.  It is an item that will not be dropped off our agenda.  If we do not receive a reply within the next seven days, we will ask for a reminder to be sent to the Department.</p><p>Item No. 286C is a copy of correspondence dated 20 January 2017 from an individual to the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, regarding the <i>guardian ad litem</i>service.  I suggest that we note this.  Somebody wrote to the Minister on the topic as this is all being discussed here, and provided us with a copy of that.  The original letter was for the Minister.</p><p>Item No. 287C, 1 to 3, is from an individual about the leasing of properties at Howth Harbour.  The previous committee looked at this and published a report which had been circulated to members.  As the correspondence required some clarification, the clerk contacted the individual in question.  The person has raised issues about the lack of transparency about leasing in Howth Harbour, the points or weighted system used to allocate leases and the lack of full feedback to unsuccessful applicants.  The person also raised concerns that there was not a suitable mix of building sizes being made available to cater for the different business needs.  The relevant Department is before the committee today and I suggest that we ask the Secretary General for a comment on this.  It comes under the domain of agriculture and fisheries because it is Howth Harbour, so it is within the remit of the Department here today.  We will specifically raise that and, if needs be, we can follow it up.  I understand that the previous committee went out and visited Howth Harbour, looked at the situation, did a report, and the gentleman said essentially that even though we did a report, nothing has changed.  We can raise it with the Department again today.</p><p>Item No. 288C is correspondence from Deputy Mattie McGrath regarding the overrun of costs in the building of the national children's hospital.  The national paediatric hospital development board is accountable to this committee, so I suggest that we schedule them as part of our work programme to get an update on the costs and construction.  It could be a while before we get them in.  We should specifically write to them to ask for an update about the cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#B02700"><p>This is very topical.  It started out of &euro;480 million and then it went to &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million.  Now it has gone to &euro;1 billion, and now we are talking about &euro;1.2 billion before even a surcharge.  It is important to know why.  Where are these figures coming from?  Is it realistic accountancy at all?  They are talking &euro;1.2 billion before even a sod is turned.  It needs to be investigated and we need to put our finger on it and say, "This is not good enough."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#B02800"><p>I agree and this is something that we should come back and spend a bit of time on.  It is obviously quite topical.  Outside of being just topical, there has to be some learning from the legacy of how this was costed.  What the Deputy has outlined is accurate.  Not only that, but the figures have changed, not just in the totality but also individually.  For instance, the &euro;200 million for fit out.  Where did that appear from, all of a sudden?  It just appeared all of a sudden.  As regards long-term decision-making, are we really saying that the decision that was made, if we had all this information, would have been the same?  I am not sure, and I say that as somebody who was party to decision-making on this at one level.  I encourage this committee to come back to this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#B02900"><p>We will seek a detailed letter first with a view to inviting them in to discuss it.  I can only think of the motorways project.  They all started at a figure which escalated as time went on.  Eventually, they began to get their original estimates and the final prices to come a little bit closer.  It looks as if all those lessons on what were the biggest capital projects at the time have not transferred to the people over this project.  It does lead to the question of the whole issue of competence and these commercial matters in the public service.</p></speech>

Have we or does the Comptroller or Auditor General have any influence on the situation before money is spent?  I know we can investigate it afterwards.</p><p>I know that we will be able to investigate it afterwards, but can we check it out in advance?</p></speech>

The note states they are accountable to the committee.  They have incurred a lot of expenditure to date.  We can bring them in immediately to discuss their future plans.  That is for definite.</p></speech>

As this has been a long-running saga, I assume a substantial amount of time has elapsed since the costings were drawn up, but I do not think time is the only reason.  If we could get as much information as possible, that would be helpful.</p></speech>

An audit is retrospective; it is an exercise in looking back.  We are very careful to ensure we do not try to become involved in making decisions.  If we are involved in the making of decisions, we cannot be independent when looking back at such matters.  The Chairman has referred to previous large capital programmes on which there were cost overruns.  The lessons from these cases need to be learned and rolled back into all other projects.  This is not the first time we have heard about or seen large escalations in costs in the case of a hospital or a large capital project and it is certainly something at which I will be looking, but that does not prevent the committee from asking the board to come in in the meantime to discuss its financial statements for 2015, for example.  That would enable the committee to receive an update on the progress being made.</p></speech>

Without prejudicing or prejudging, I suggest it is likely that the root causes of any escalation in costs in this case will be the same as in others.  I take Deputy Alan Kelly's point about making a decision at the start on the basis of one set of financial figures, before having to deal with changes in project costs as the project rolls on.  The framework should be the same.  It should be quite clear why a escalation in costs has occurred and where it has occurred in the project.</p></speech>

When a presentation was made less than two years ago to the regional health forum in Galway, of which I was a member, the figure was nowhere near the one we are hearing now.  As councillors and public representatives, we gave the thumbs-up to a project on the basis of a presentation.  Nobody ever came back to us to say things had changed.  This makes a nonsense of the involvement of the regional health forum in information-sharing.  All that is wanted is a thumbs-up and a public campaign of positivity.  Nobody comes back after it has been achieved.  That is where the concept of accountability falls down.</p></speech>

If there are structural or systemic failures in the costing of projects, we need to know about them.  In recent days concern has been expressed about the manner in which this project was allowed to reach a certain point with a low estimate.  If full and final figures had been known at that stage - we have not yet seen them - people might have come to a slightly different decision.  The worry is that people are happy to engage in the low-balling of prices until their projects have got through the Cabinet and the Government and reached the point at which they are so far gone that they cannot be stopped, even if costs are escalating.</p></speech>

I can do that at the health committee, but it is worth looking at how the framework is managed.  Simply put - the Chairman articulated this well - the decision-making process has to be and is influenced by the potential cost.  That is the nature of life and decision-making.  Obviously, there are clinical needs and requirements in this case.  If the cost is X at the point of decision and Y at the time of implementation, there is a need to look at how it came to be X at the time of decision.  What were the motivations?  How were the figures arrived at?</p></speech>

No. 4.1 is the statement and accounts of the Insolvency Service of Ireland which has received a clear audit opinion.  </p> <p>  No. 4.2 is the statement and accounts of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board -Caranua.  This is important, but it also involves a clear audit opinion.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the statement on internal financial controls disclosed that weaknesses in the board's control over grant payments continued in 2015.  This created a risk that in some cases the grant might not be used for the purposes intended.  The statement also sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the weaknesses identified.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General might explain, this is a hangover from the residential institutions redress scheme.  Over &euro;30 million was paid out in 2015.  A great deal of money was also paid out in 2014.  Therefore, as the board must be close to winding up, there is no point in telling us it is going to take steps.</p><p>It might be out of existence by the time that happens  We have formal requests to come and address the committee from some people who sought funding from the board.

It confirms what we have agreed.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are here today and next Thursday it will be the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  On Thursday, 2 March it will be the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dealing with the environment, community and local government and Comptroller and Auditor General report, chapter 4, on the central Government funding of local authorities and their progress on land aggregation.  A couple of other items have been mentioned today, and at previous meetings, which will come up at that meeting.  On Thursday, 9 March the Department of Health and the HSE will be here on the HSE's patient's private property accounts.  The HSE financial statements have a note regarding the fair deal scheme and the health repayment scheme donation fund 2015.  It is not a general meeting with the HSE but is specific to those points.  On Thursday, 23 March the Department of Education and Skills will be here and on Thursday, 30 March it will be the third level institutions.  On Thursday, 6 April there will be further third level institutions while Thursday, 13 April is to be confirmed.  On Thursday, 4 May the Revenue Commissioners will be in and on Thursday, 11 May it is the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

The Department was also the accredited paying agency for additional EU payments amounting to just under &euro;1.2 billion for 2015.  EU payments directly to farmers are accounted for separately from the Vote, but a summary is disclosed in note 6.1 of the account.</p> <p>  The Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across four major expenditure programmes: &euro;387 million, or 31% of the total, was spent on agrifood policy, development and trade; &euro;196 million, or 15%, was spent on food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health; &euro;355 million, or 28%, was spent on rural economy, environment and structural changes, and &euro;326 million, or 26%, was spent on direct payments to farmers.</p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the six fishery harbour centres, for which separate accounts are also prepared.</p> <p>  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;104 million was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in December 2015.  This was required to provide funding of &euro;68 million to finalise European Commission disallowances related to the period 2008 to 2014 and a further &euro;39 million due to an unanticipated delay in receipt of EU funding for rural development in 2015.  In addition, the supplementary process reallocated savings on certain subheads of the Vote to fund additional expenditure for fishery harbours, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the World Food Programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment.</p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was approximately &euro;69 million less than provided for, including in the Supplementary Estimate.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;12 million in unspent allocations - mainly under the rural economy, environment and structural changes programme - was carried over for spending in 2016.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, totalling &euro;56.6 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Chapter 7 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2015 examines two substantial and unusual transactions between the Department and the EU in 2015.  The first transaction was the refund by Ireland to the EU of &euro;68 million for non-compliance with regulations governing the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  In look-back reviews of a sample of land parcel-based payments funded by the EU made in the period 2009 to 2012, the European Commission identified concerns that could have resulted in substantial amounts being disallowed.  The Department contested the Commission's findings and conducted a further review of more than 900,000 land parcels on its system using newly acquired, higher resolution imagery.  It found that there had been an element of overclaiming in respect of 180,000 of the land parcels, or 19% of the total.</p> <p>  Arising from that finding, the Commission in May 2014 proposed a flat rate disallowance of 2% of funding in the period, equivalent to &euro;182 million.  The Department entered a conciliation process to negotiate the disallowance and, in July 2015, agreed with a Commission proposal for a disallowance of &euro;64.1 million for the period 2008 to 2012.  A lower rate of disallowance of &euro;3.6 million was agreed for 2013 and 2014, reflecting improved controls.  The Department also incurred costs of &euro;3.2 million during the review and negotiation stages, principally for new imagery and software, internal staff costs and external contractor costs.  The final agreed rate of disallowance for Ireland for the period 2008 to 2015 was equivalent to 0.8% of the funding provided.  This compares favourably with the average of 2.4% disallowance across all EU member states.</p> <p>  The second transaction examined in the report was the handling of milk producers' liability of &euro;71 million to the EU because they exceeded their milk quotas after they increased production in advance of the end of the quota regime on 31 March 2015.  Due to a fall in milk prices in 2015, the EU approved an optional scheme allowing member states to pay the liability and then recover it from milk producers over a maximum of three years.  Ireland was one of seven EU countries to introduce the scheme.</p> <p>  The Department required milk producers, before they could avail of the deferral scheme, to sign a legally binding agreement to repay their liability.  Approximately a quarter of the total liability was paid up front by milk producers who chose not to avail of the scheme.  The remaining liability is being recovered in instalments.  At August 2016, the Department had recovered over 99% of the amount due to be repaid at that time in line with the instalment agreements.</p></speech>

People might be surprised.  Mr. McCarthy stated that, although the Department's Vote was essentially &euro;1.26 billion, the Department "was also the accredited paying agency for additional EU payments amounting to just under &euro;1.5 billion for 2015."  Those payments were accounted for separately from the Vote and are summarised under miscellaneous in note 6.1 to the account.  Where are these payments accounted for?  I would have expected the &euro;1.5 billion to form part of today's work.  The Department is the paying agency for these EU payments, but take me through the process.  What is before us today is just the Department's own Vote, which excludes the &euro;1.5 billion in payments to farmers.  Who audits the accounting of these payments and when is that presented to the committee?  Logically, should it not have formed part of today's work?</p></speech>

Explanatory note 6.1 is provided in order that there is some opportunity for the committee to discuss these amounts with the Department, but there is a separate accounting system for them under EU rules.  The Secretary General will be able to elaborate further.</p> <p>  There are other funds that come from the EU.  A number of years ago, it was agreed that there would be a consolidation account to give a view to the committee of EU transfers to Ireland that did not go through appropriation accounts.  That account is produced and it is audited by me.  It is submitted.

Mr. O'Driscoll can help us.  There is a simple question: &euro;1.2 billion in payments is going through the Department which are not part of the account but is included under section 6, "miscellaneous", on page 26 of the Vote of the Department under EU funding by way of a note.  It is not the record of the accounts, it is not the audit and I would like that account to be sent to the committee during the week.  Mr. O'Driscoll can understand our question as to why those payments are not part of today's discussions.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll help us on this point before we discuss his Department?</p></speech>

Pillar 2 refers to the various schemes encompassed in the rural development programme.  These are co-funded by the Exchequer and the EU.  They appear in our Vote because they are co-funded by the Exchequer and are part of the Vote.  These include the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, or the disadvantaged areas, now areas of natural constraint scheme, which appear in the Vote.

The witnesses can understand that.  It is not a criticism of what is front of us but that is only 50% of the story of the payments that go through the Department and Mr. O'Driscoll as a paying agent - I am putting the two together - especially if the fine relates to Pillar 1, which is not before us but we have to pick up the tab.  Are there no arrangements in place given that the payments come through Pillar 1 that whoever is responsible should pay the fine?  Why is it falling to the Department?  Can it not be attributed back like the super levy to individual farmers?  I am not suggesting it should but the milk levy was sent back to farmers to pay, not to the Exchequer.  Is there not a similar arrangement in place for this for those who over-claimed because the taxpayer is picking up the tab for that whereas the farmer has to pay the super levy fine directly?  Will Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll explain the two different processes?</p></speech>

It started with a threat of flat rate disallowances which if they had come to fruition in that form, and the Commission was very attached to that approach, would have been a flat rate cut across our payments.  It would be difficult to attribute that to farmers except as a flat rate cut across everybody's payment.  By implication the problems the Commission says it found would not have been present on every farm so it would have been quite difficult in Irish law to sustain the idea that a flat rate cut be made across all farmer payments.  As the history of the disallowance went on, Ireland's basic point of contention with the Commission was not that there was no fault.  We did not try to maintain that position but we did say the fault was such that it could be quantified and did not merit a flat rate correction.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General's report there is a figure which shows the evolution of the negotiation.</p></speech>

Some money had already been collected from farmers.  There is reference in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to &euro;950,000 in this regard.  There was a subsequent amount of &euro;3 million collected, which I can also explain.  Of course, it is important to say that farmer payments were cut as a result of the LPIS review undertaken in 2013.</p></speech>

Could the next one be shown, please?  This is farmland.  One can see the clarity of the image on the right is far greater than the clarity of the image on the left.  Key to this was that the Commission felt that the imagery we were working off was inadequate and, as a result, it found that land that the farmer had declared as eligible, and which we had accepted as eligible, was ineligible.  In 2013, we acquired new higher-quality imagery, which is shown on the right of the slide.  Obviously, this made it much easier to determine what was and was not eligible.</p></speech>

The images on the screen come from planes and satellites.  However, there was a particular difficulty in that, as the committee knows, Irish weather is what it is and we have much less opportunity to get clear photographs.  The imagery on the right of the screen derives, I think, from better use of satellite photographs, oddly enough, because satellites can adapt more quickly to lack of cloud cover, whereas with planes, one must arrange in advance that the plane will fly over on a particular day, and if there is cloud cover, that is it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#G02300"><p>My opening statement will be relatively short.  I am sorry but it covers much of the ground already covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Nevertheless, I ask the committee to bear with me.</p> <p>  The Department's gross allocation for 2015 was &euro;1,260 million, including a capital carry-over of &euro;18 million from 2014.  Towards the end of 2015, the Department sought a Supplementary Estimate, which provided funding to address the exclusion by the European Commission of &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period 2008 to 2014, to which I will return again.  It transferred savings in certain areas of the Vote to fund expenditure under the fisheries harbour scheme, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, the world food programme and a top-up to the EU market volatility payment, as well as providing an increase of &euro;39 million in the Department's permitted net expenditure to deal with a Commission decision, applying to all member states, to delay payment of some of their expected 2015 rural development receipts.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure in 2015 was &euro;1,264.6 million, and appropriations-in-aid were &euro;438.7 million, resulting in a net expenditure of &euro;826 million.  Gross expenditure savings amounted to &euro;60.5 million and &euro;12 million of the capital saving was carried over into 2016.  When the Supplementary Estimate was under consideration in late 2015, we were confident expenditure levels would be lower than the original provisions under some subheads, so some &euro;36 million was transferred as part of the supplementary to other areas of the Vote.  Our view at the time was that it would not be prudent to reduce allocations further, given the outstanding potential requirements, particularly in the agri-environment schemes, food safety and research.  In retrospect, given the eventual savings, it may be that less funding could have been requested by way of a supplementary allocation.  However, receiving the additional allocation did allow us to fully address a number of new pressing needs without compromising our existing schemes.</p> <p>  The Department is exceptional, as alluded to by the Chairman, in also being responsible for large EU payment schemes which do not appear on the Vote.  In 2015, these amounted to expenditure of &euro;1.2 billion.  The total expenditure by the Department, though the Vote and the fully funded EU schemes, therefore, amounted to more than &euro;2.4 billion.</p> <p>  During 2015, the agriculture and food sector continued to play a vital role in Ireland's economic recovery.  Food and drink exports reached &euro;10.8 billion, marking growth of more than 51% since 2009.  As this export figure does not include things like hides and skins and forestry, the total export figure from the sector was well north of &euro;11 billion.</p> <p>  The year 2015 was also marked by a number of major policy and operational developments, including the implementation of new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, schemes following the 2013 CAP reform, the adoption of the new co-funded &euro;4 billion rural development programme and the &euro;240 million seafood development programme, publication of the new overarching sector strategy Food Wise 2025, publication of a new forestry strategy and, crucially, the abolition of EU milk quotas.  The implementation of a large range of new schemes and measures was a major challenge for the Department but one to which our staff responded with great commitment and skill.  Among the new schemes implemented in 2015 were the new basic payment scheme, greening payment and young farmer top-up, which together accounted for the &euro;1.2 billion I have already mentioned; the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme, two tranches of which were opened to 38,000 beneficiaries in 2015; the new organic farming scheme; the beef genomics programme, which is a very innovative programme focusing on delivering accelerated genetic improvement in the national herd to deliver both environmental and economic sustainability; and the new targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS II, investment support vehicle, which includes the young farmer capital investment scheme, the dairy equipment scheme, the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme, the low emission slurry spreading scheme and the pig and poultry scheme.  Many schemes were opened in 2015.</p> <p>  As noted in Chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, milk quotas in the EU were abolished on 31 March 2015.  Milk production in Ireland in 2015 was 6.6 million tonnes, an increase of 13.3% on the 2014 annual total.  The vast majority of this increase was in the post-quota timeframe, bearing in mind that it ended on 31 March.</p><p>While farmers continued to make substantial efforts over recent months to manage their supplies, the ending of the milk quota regime saw significant production over quota in the 2014-2015 year, the final year of the quota regime, resulting in a levy being incurred by Irish producers amounting to &euro;71 million.  Facilities for farmers to pay the bill in instalments and to help them to deal with the cashflow challenge were put in place by the Department following European Commission agreement.  It was pressure from Ireland and several other member states which led to the system being put in place.</p><p> The Department was required to pay the superlevy in full to the European Commission by the usual deadline of 31 November 2015 with the terms of the scheme requiring farmers to repay minimum one third payment each year between 2015 and 2017.  The Department paid almost &euro;71 million, of which &euro;35.6 million had been collected from producers with the remainder sourced from funds the Department had on deposit.  Just over 2,700 producers opted to pay levies of &euro;16.7 million to the Department upfront by 1 October 2015.  They elected not to use the provision to defer their payments.  The remaining 3,700 producers paid &euro;18.9 million to the Department by 1 October 2015 and agreements were signed with those farmers to repay the balance of &euro;35.6 million in 2016 and 2017.</p><p> A second issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to a large EU expenditure disallowance in 2015.  In mid-November, the European Commission adopted a decision to exclude a total of &euro;278 million from 18 member states.  The net Irish disallowance amounted to &euro;67.6 million from EU funding of various agricultural schemes for the seven-year period, 2008 to 2014, inclusive.  This consisted of two elements, namely a &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 to 2012 and a &euro;3.6 million exclusion for 2013 and 2014.  It represented 0.57% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven-year period.  The exclusions related mainly to Commission findings that some aspects of Irish control systems were insufficiently robust at excluding ineligible land from payments to farmers in EU funded schemes.</p><p> This decision was the outcome of a prolonged process which began with a proposed exclusion of &euro;181 million for the five years between 2008 and 2012 suggested by the Commission in May 2014.  The Department opposed the application of the proposed flat rate correction and sought a hearing with the EU Conciliation Body.  The Conciliation Body acknowledged the amount of work done by the Department in reviewing over 900,000 LPIS, land parcel identification system, parcels to identify and exclude ineligible areas to calculate the risk to the fund.</p><p> The report of the Conciliation Body in early 2015 concluded that the Commission and the Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to settlement.  The implication of this moved us away from the idea of a flat rate correction.  During the year, the Department undertook considerable additional work at the request of the Commission to give assurance to the calculated risk and was subject to a further verification audit by Commission officials.  The reduction of over 60% in the final correction clearly indicated the Commission's acceptance of the Irish approach.</p><p> From 2008 to 2016, the total EU disallowances incurred by Ireland amounted to 0.79% of agricultural expenditure.  This compared with an average of 2.74% for all member states.  These figures are an update on those in figure 7.4 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

It is the fourth.  Although it is not in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, I want to raise the implications of Brexit.  It is coming down the track next month when the British Prime Minister instigates it.  Has the Department thought about the impact of Brexit on our trade between Ireland and Britain?  Trade to and from Britain comes to &euro;1.2 billion a week.  Britain, our nearest neighbour, is our largest trading partner.  Has the Department contingency plans in place, considering how important the agrifood sector is to our economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#H00600"><p>Speaking to some stakeholders recently, I described Brexit as the most important negotiation the agrifood sector has faced since the 1972 negotiations to enter the then EEC.  I completely agree with the importance the Deputy attached to it.  The UK accounts for approximately 40% of our agrifood exports.  Some sectors are much more exposed than that.  About 50% of our beef exports, for example, go to the UK.  This is particularly crucial because the UK beef market is the highest priced beef market in the world.  Accordingly, the importance of that to the beef sector is obvious.</p> <p>  Other subsectors, such as the mushroom industry, consumer foods and horticulture, are exposed sectors to the UK market in a number of different ways.  Their exports are heavily concentrated on the UK but they are also subject to import competition from the UK.</p> <p>  Within the dairy sector, the exposure is somewhat less.  Nevertheless, within some subsectors of that it is high.  For example, we produce a lot of cheddar cheese in this country, of which 60% goes to the UK.  This is a particular challenge because no one eats cheddar in such quantities.  We cannot just divert the cheddar off to France.  There are many challenges built into Brexit.</p> <p>  Have we done preparations for this?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has pointed out on several occasions in public that the day he was appointed I handed him a large file of briefings, a large chunk of which were on Brexit.  It showed the research work we had done well in advance of the UK referendum.  We have been working hard on it since.  We were one of the first, if not the first, Department to set up a dedicated Brexit unit.  We have set up an elaborate process of consultation with stakeholders, which is our norm in major negotiations.  We have done this before in Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and trade negotiations.  I must acknowledge the first-class quality of input we have received from farming and agrifood industry organisations, the co-ops and so on.</p> <p>  As for the negotiations, we are engaging in an intensive round of discussions with the Commission, other member states and with the UK and Northern Ireland to make clear to them how important this issue is to Ireland and to put forward our demand.  Our demand is crystal clear.  We want to retain unfettered access to the UK market after whatever happens.  We also want to keep the UK market as a valuable market for the future.</p> <p>  We also have a major challenge on the fisheries front.  The Common Fisheries Policy is a complex construct.  In fisheries, one has this unique fact of a single common resource, the fish in the sea.  That resource has to be divided up and the Common Fisheries Policy is how we do this.  The UK accounts for a large proportion of EU fisheries waters.  UK waters account for one third of the catch of Irish fishing boats, for example.  The issues around fisheries are complex.</p> <p>  Are we doing any work on contingency planning?  A second strand of the work we are doing involves engaging with the agriculture sector, but also with the Commission and with our colleagues in the UK, especially in Northern Ireland, on the practicalities of managing any kind of border with exports and imports after Brexit.  I have told several sectoral groups that we have to negotiate strongly and clearly for the absolutely best outcome.  We also have to prepare for the worst outcome.</p><p>It would be foolish not to do both of those things.  That is a flavour of what we are doing.  I am happy to elaborate in more detail if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

I am relieved to hear that the Department is taking the matter seriously.  </p> <p>  On compliance issues and the reviews from 2009 to 2012, perhaps Mr. O'Driscoll would outline why the issues identified by the Commission, in terms of non-compliance on behalf of the Department, arose.  Why did the Department not comply with the requests?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#J00300"><p>There were a series of audits.  The Department is subject to EU audits all of the time.  I do not wish to in any way minimise the importance of the disallowance because it is a very large disallowance and we are unhappy that we incurred it but this matter needs to be looked at in the context of the overall scale of the Department's payments and the size of disallowances in other member states.  The disallowances in other member states that are much larger than in our case are in member states that have excellent records.  They are not in member states in respect of which one might take the view that that is to be expected.  Why did it arise?  The primary reason is that when the Commission came here on various visits it identified issues on the ground.  When the Commission visits in the context of an audit it looks at a sample of files.  It looks particularly at a sample of cases in respect of which we have conducted inspections.  They also visit a selection of farms.  They then move randomly from the farms selected into neighbouring farms, for example, or other farms in the same areas.  The Commission makes its own judgment on whether land is eligible or not.</p></speech>

We have EU audits all of the time on all of our schemes.  As the Deputy said earlier, the EU is putting enormous sums of money into these schemes and so the level of audit is not surprising.  We do not have any difficulty with the fact that EU auditors investigate and trawl through the schemes in great detail.  We are visited by auditors from a number of different units in Brussels as well, as I mentioned earlier, by the certifying body, which is the private accounting firm in Ireland that works on behalf of the Commission.  We have all of those audits going on all of the time.</p> <p>  In this case, there was a series of audits from 2009 onwards.  These audits would usually have been brought to a conclusion much earlier than occurred but there were a number of things that happened.  We gave a robust response to each of the audits.  We raised issues where we thought the Commission had got it wrong.  The Commission engaged with us in this regard.  There is a good deal of respect in Brussels for Irish systems.  I do not believe they think we are engaged in anything nefarious.  There was a lot of engagement but also a delay due to a tragic death of a Commission official who was key to the investigation which knocked back the audit for another period.  It was 2013 before it came to fruition.  By then, we had undertaken a large review of 900,000 parcels.  A land parcel is, in most cases, a field or part of a field.  We undertook a very detailed assessment of all of the land parcels.  I know from talking to senior officials in Brussels that they were struck by this.  Other member states had generally taken the hit and tried to negotiate a lower flat rate correction and so people in Brussels were struck by the fact that we undertook such a detailed re-assessment of the land parcels.  In the process of that assessment, using the imagery which was shown earlier on screen, we found problems.</p> <p>  As Deputy Aylward will be aware, Ireland is marked by a lot of marginal land.  The assessment of whether land is eligible or not is a tight assessment.  There are some instances of where land is clearly ineligible.  For example, if a house is built on a field that land is clearly no longer eligible.  In situations where rushes or scrub encroaches on a field there is an assessment to be done and a judgment to be made.  The orthophotography is very useful in, at least, pointing us in a direction to indicate where land might not be eligible.  We conduct 5% inspections.  We are required to do so by EU rules around land eligibility.  The final disallowance includes a number of different elements, some of which we could have collected from farmers because it was possible to pin a disallowance to an individual farm but the bulk of it could not have been collected.  Of the &euro;67 million, the amount that could have been identified to farm level would have been, maximum, &euro;20 million.  The nature of the disallowance was extrapolated in nature such that it could not have been pinned on an individual farm.</p></speech>

Is Mr. O'Driscoll satisfied with that?  In my case, an area was overgrown with bushes and I incurred a cut.  I did not incur a penalty but I did have to accept a cut from then on.  Is it right that the taxpayer should pay the fines incurred by the Department?  Should there have been greater pursuance of individual farmers for money owed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-16a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017021600002#J00700"><p>Yes we could have done so regarding the &euro;20 million.  This is where I hide behind the policy decision read out earlier.  I will go through the debt, which may be helpful.  The debt for the years 2013 and 2014 was very low.  There was only &euro;3.6 million of a disallowance for those years.  The reason it was so low is because, effectively, the Commission was happy with the systems we had in place by 2013, for example, the orthophotography and so on.</p> <p>  On the other debt, which is the &euro;64 million for 2008 to 2012, of that &euro;950,000 had already been paid to the Commission and so that amount fell away from the subsequent amount.  There were then a number of what are called "specified risks".  These amounted to &euro;21 million and were determined by the Commission.  This related to the kind of issue mentioned by the Deputy.  It may seem extraordinary but what weighed very heavily on the Commission was that in three individual cases more scrub was found adjacent to a hedge than we had allowed for.  Another issue rose in respect of an incorrect percentage reduction for scrub.  For example, there could be a field which has grass and animals but some of it is scrub.  The question that arises is whether to apply a percentage reduction of 20%, 40% or 50% to that field.  Another case involved a garden that was included in parcel.  I am told that the crucial issue was that there were some children's toys on the land and that resulted in it being identified as a garden.  Those specified risks which the Commission determined and then extrapolated across the country amounted to &euro;21 million.  It would have been difficult to pin those on individual farmers.</p> <p>  We collected another &euro;3 million from farmers in December 2014.  We did not send on that money to the Commission and so it does not appear in the figures we have given.  It will appear in the 2016 Vote because it brought to account in 2016.</p><p>One could include that as something also farmers have carried.</p><p> We then had another &euro;19.8 million, which was for 2008 and 2009.  There is a provision in EU legislation which provides that debts must be collected within four years from the date of the debt accruing and this was outside that period.  Although maybe, theoretically, one could have identified this at farm level, by the time this was all resolved it had gone beyond that time limit.</p><p> One then had a remainder of &euro;16.4 million, after the deduction of all of those figures.  No, I apologise, I forgot about another &euro;3 million, which is the carryover on commonages.  Commonages have been a regular feature of difficulty in EU audits.  Anybody who is familiar with commonage land will be aware it tends to be very high up in hills.  It is almost always marginal.  It has all the issues that I have just identified but it has the additional complication of multiple owners.  Commonage also came into it for &euro;3 million.  The final figure was &euro;16.4 million, which could have been then pinned on farmers.  What could have been pinned on farmers was the &euro;16.4 million, the &euro;1 million that we did and which was sent to the Commission, and the &euro;3 million which we did and which will be brought to account in 2016.</p><p> The one other thing I would say about the cost of this to farmers is what does not appear in those figures is that farmer payments in 2013, after all this was done, were &euro;12.5 million less than they would have been.  Of course, that is a permanent loss because that goes on.  As a result of the new determination of what land was eligible, farmers got &euro;12.5 million less than they would have got in 2013.</p></speech>

They were looking for a lot more and the Department got it reduced.  I just want to know on what grounds did it yield on that.  That is the last question I will ask on this.</p></speech>

As I say, and I am not blowing smoke here, I know that colleagues in other member states and senior colleagues in the Commission were quite surprised that we did not lie down and just take our bigger hit, particularly with the 2% flat rate, but there was a very strong feeling among our own staff that this was wrong and that we had a case.  Therefore, the case was fought through all the various stages that are identified in another graphic in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, each of which steps, if the Deputy likes, I could take him through.  One will see, in summary, the blow by blow we went through there as we put our first figure of &euro;33 million on the table and we continued to engage with the Commission.  Its representatives said, "Well, all right then, but what about this?  What about that?", and we went off and we looked at this and we looked at that.  The figure crept up and, eventually, the Commission offered this final figure of &euro;67 million, which we could have contested again.  We could have said, "No, we are going to court."  That was the next step but I think that would have been very unwise for all kinds of reasons.  We had got it down to a reasonable level.  One has to maintain a relation with the Commission.</p></speech>

We have no intention of giving up on the &euro;50,000 either - just to get that message out.  We would be pretty confident on this one.  Dairy farmers are familiar with superlevy payments.  It is not the first time they have incurred superlevy payments.  They do know that this was of particular benefit to them.</p> <p>  Interestingly, 2,700 farmers decided to pay upfront.  They decided not to use the deferred option.  I can actually understand that.  If one had the cash at that time, it was a matter of just getting it off one's back and going.  In fact, those who opted for-----</p></speech>

As a politician and farmer, many people have made representations to me about trying to build for dairying, trying to get dairies right and milk machines etc. in starting up in the business.  I spent three or four frustrating months getting on to the Department to get the all-clear for the farmers to go and build to start milking in the spring, in January and February, like most do.  I am getting the same with GLAS.  Why is the system so slow?  With modern technology, why cannot the system be up and running, particularly when it comes to buildings?  All they need is to be allowed to go ahead and build and then, of course, the farmer has to go out physically and build it.  I wonder why are the payments from TAMS or GLAS under any of its headings so slow?  Can the Department quicken the process, in particular, when a farmer is waiting to get a building in place to start up dairying in the following spring?</p></speech>

It is a fairly contested area.  I will make a couple of points.  Again, I do not want people to misinterpret this, but with these schemes we are way ahead of other member states.  One of our neighbouring countries or regions has only launched its agri-environment scheme this year.  We launched the new agri-environment scheme in 2015.</p> <p>  Second, of course, the great majority of people on GLAS have been paid - with 38,000 in the scheme and &euro;105 million paid to 30,000 so far - but our systems do indicate that there are issues in respect of the outstanding claims.  A total of 7,000 farmers have yet to be paid.  Technically, it is an advance payment but, anyway, 7,000 of them have yet to be paid.  In the last two weeks alone, &euro;8 million was paid to 2,250 farmers.  Therefore, we are whittling that figure down as rapidly as we can.  In quite a few cases, we need material back from the farmer.  To give an example I was given the other day, some farmers under GLAS are claiming a payment for low-emission slurry spreading, which is an important action in climate change emissions, air quality etc.  In that group that has not been paid, 300 of them have been identified who have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have indicated they are claiming it but they have not submitted the necessary evidence.  They have been contacted and asked to send in the form.</p> <p>  There are other issues.  For example, again, to go back to these famous land parcels, if our system finds that there is something different between our record of land parcels and what the claimant has submitted, the matter has to be looked at.  It has to be eyeballed, as we say.  It might be when our staff look at the detail they think they find that it is okay, it is a small issue or they understand why the issue is arising.  It might be that they have to go back to the farmer.  What we are trying to do, and where I will put my hand up a bit, is better communications to the farmers as to what exactly the issue is, and we are trying to deal with that.</p></speech>

The Department's computer system last year was the cause of a lot of delays, that it did not have the proper IT system in place and that it has this rectified now.  Is that true?</p></speech>

By the way, for the 2015 payments which are referenced in the report, we did have to put a manual system in place for the final quarter of 2015.  There is a system up and running and it is the IT system that is identifying that there are issues with some of the payments, but one cannot automate everything.  There are some things a human being has to look at to see what is the issue.  The computer will say there is something amiss but a person must engage with it, look at it and examine it.  Some of the cases are quite complex.  In many cases the farmer may need to send us something or something has changed and the computer has identified that and we need to be satisfied that the change is okay.  It may be a slight change in the land parcel area or it might be, for example, that a partnership has been established since the GLAS plan was submitted, and that affects things, or they are flagged in the system.  We have to work our way through those things.  Many people have been paid and we are working through the remainder as fast as we can.</p></speech>

That is the EU fund drawdown.  The total value of the rural development programme is &euro;4 billion, including EU and non-EU.  We believe, on our current projections, that we will have spent that in 2020 or thereabouts.  One can go on spending for three years after 2020.  We think we will have fully drawn it down by that date.  The reason I draw attention to the EU drawdown is that it is the only comparison we can do and it is with our own previous performance and with other member states.  We have the second highest drawdown in the entire EU at 33%.  I think the Finns are at 36%.  The average drawdown is 14%, but that is from memory.</p></speech>

In trying to speed up the payments as best we can - we have priority teams working on it - we hope we will be able to identify groups of farmers who qualify for payment under some category or who clearly are not eligible.

It is difficult to say whether we are confident.  There has definitely been a difficulty in the transition to the shared services system.  The number of overpayments rose significantly in the transfer.  I do not think that is a huge surprise.  The new system is taking a while to bed down but there is an interdepartmental group working on it and there is a plan in place to tackle the overpayments.  What has been done is that some of the overpayments have been allocated to the Department itself to be pursued.  There are recoupment plans in place at the moment for &euro;306,000.  The total overpayment figure, as I understand it, for the end of 2016 is &euro;508,000, but recoupment plans are in place for 97 cases totalling &euro;306,000.  The Department is pursuing 102 cases for a further &euro;180,000 and PeoplePoint is pursuing 162 cases for &euro;21,000.  The answer to the question is, yes, plans are in place.</p></speech>

If the accounts were late we would have asked why they were late.  Deputy Burke will be aware that Bord na gCon has had a change of leadership recently but that would not have been a factor in this regard.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the State body to meet the requirement.  I agree with Deputy Burke that Bord na gCon should meet the requirement in a timely way.</p></speech>

On the face of it, the governance procedures do not look very transparent.  I will draw Mr. O'Driscoll's attention to the salary increases in the organisation.  The amount of administration expenditure through salaries is incredible when one looks at the average employees in the accounts.  One would imagine in such a sector there would be casual staff and others earning the minimum wage.  Making a raw calculation, which I know is very crude, one is talking about average salaries of &euro;47,000 and that has not changed much from 2014 to 2015.  That indicates a number of individuals are on very significant salaries within that organisation which is not delivering.</p><p>Have we undertaken any review of the funding that we have given it and of its administration and salaries?  Has the Department a handle on the matter?</p></speech>

A series of reviews have been undertaken, including the Indecon report on greyhound racing.  Leading up to the preparation of the greyhound racing Bill, which will be before the Oireachtas shortly, there were further reviews.  It is an area that has been subject to significant scrutiny, including public scrutiny.  People have different views.</p> <p>  I am not washing my hands of anything, but the board of Bord na gCon has core responsibility for Bord na gCon's operations and it would be improper of me to start micromanaging all of our State agencies.  That would be to remove the responsibility that rightly rests with their boards and senior managements.</p></speech>

The figures are incredible.  In 2007, Bord na gCon had a turnover of &euro;63.5 million.  That has decreased to less than &euro;30 million, or a 56% reduction.  Prize money has reduced significantly in the sector.  Owners and breeders have been giving more than ever before.  The State is increasing the amount of subvention to the sector, yet we do not seem to have a handle on the basic issue of wages.  According to Bord na gCon's accounts, it had an average staff of 183 in 2014.  That has increased dramatically.  It is now suggesting that it sell off regional tracks.  That has been mooted in the media.  Harold's Cross has made a declaration and there is a board meeting on the matter this week.  I understand that "Prime Time" is due to investigate this issue next week.  Were I Mr. O'Driscoll, I would get my facts and figures correct.  Will he assure me that the Department will conduct a detailed analysis of wages in the headquarters in Limerick?  The increases seem colossal.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, we are locked into an 80:20 relationship between what we give to horse racing and what we give to dog racing through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which the Oireachtas considers regularly.  My understanding is that the contribution from the State to Bord na gCon is approximately 30% of the latter's income, so it raises quite a bit itself.  I also understand that, in recent years, it has been more successful in raising funds through its food and beverage offering and so on at race tracks.  It took that operation back into the board.</p></speech>

I do not understand where Mr. O'Driscoll is coming from when he says that it is improving in certain regards.  The last accounts that we can get sight of are stark.  It is incredible that we must go back to 2014 to get any handle on the performance of a governing body to which we are giving so much money.  That is a disgrace.  We need to get our act together.  We should have been asking questions about this a long time ago.  I understand that, when the Oireachtas was examining reports on this matter, Horse Racing Ireland and other sectoral bodies were invited to Leinster House, but many of the representatives of greyhound breeders and owners were not given that opportunity to air their views on the matter.  They are the poor relation, yet we are providing the sector with significant moneys.  We must pull up our socks.</p></speech>

Nowadays, that is done through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, as the committee is aware.  People express an interest in being appointed to specific boards.  They go through the PAS, which draws up a short-list for ministerial decision.</p> <p>  We have a division that has oversight of State bodies in the horses and dogs sectors.  It is headed by an assistant secretary - my colleague, Mr. Gleeson - who is currently dealing with the dog racing legislation.</p> <p>  We have a system of constant interaction.  We do not leave Bord na gCon off.  All that I meant to imply in my remarks was that we must be clear as to where responsibility lies.  If a Department or Minister rushes in and takes responsibility away from an agency, it is comfortable for that agency.  Agencies are given specific responsibilities and they must exercise them.  They have chief executives and boards to oversee that work.</p> <p>  I will examine the salaries question.</p></speech>

That is how it works because Mr. O'Driscoll is the Accounting Officer for Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  I am unsure as to how many people have confidence in Bord na gCon.</p><p>It is obvious that there will be a disclosure regarding Bord na gCon in the media in the near future.  The dogs in the street - pardon the pun - know that the media have been all over this issue recently.  I know this because I have received calls about it.  I presume the fact that the accounts for 2015 are not up has set off alarm bells in the Department.  That Mr. Gleeson only meets it once a year is alarming.  That his Department currently only meets it once per quarter is alarming.  At this stage the Department literally needs to be on top of it.  I accept that the board has responsibilities and that the Department will not micro-manage an organisation, but the organisation receives an incredible amount of money and has many questions to answer.  It is one which, to many, is making decisions on the future of the industry that are highly questionable.  It is selling assets.  One person has told me that it is proposing the sale of assets to cover for "questionable decision making," inefficiencies and high salaries for a core group.  How can the Department stand over this?  Does Mr. O'Driscoll agree that serious decisions such as the one taken recently on the sale of an asset should be suspended?  As the overseer, the Department should suspend making such decisions until we find out what, in the name of God, is going on?  The accounts for 2015 have not even published, yet the organisation is making decisions which will change the face of the industry.  We do not know if these decisions are to cover up what has happened because we cannot even analyse the accounts for 2015.</p></speech>

Bord na gCon made the decision but were the procedures of the Harold's Cross board adhered to?  Did it make the decision beforehand?  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to look at this immediately and suspend any action until, as the Accounting Officer, he is satisfied that all procedures have been adhered to.  If the board at Harold's Cross and the decision-making process have been bypassed, it says a lot about Bord na gCon.</p><p>My other favourite topic is CEDRA.  The CEDRA report is very important and I am sure Mr. O'Driscoll is a big fan of the chair, Pat Spillane, who has been involved for years.  CEDRA has done a huge amount of work but the Department pays lip service to it.  I do not think it has much interest in anything that goes on outside the farm gate.  Given the fact that the national planning framework is coming in, I encourage the Department to change in this regard.<b></b></p></speech>

The Department needs to change its attitude to CEDRA and the whole Department needs to realign itself, given the challenges we face as a country, not just with Brexit but in repositioning our country from the point of view of planning.  I encourage the Department to engage more in this and to try to work more closely with other Departments.  The lack of engagement, funding and overall will from the Department in this area has been astounding.</p> <p>  I want to say a few positive things about farm safety, which is a real issue.  I thank the Department for its initiatives in this regard and for the way in which it has co-operated in the programmes.  Unfortunately, expenditure is lower than expected and progress is not happening.  We are having more farm deaths than ever before and I ask the Department to redouble its efforts in this area.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to work with the line Minister to find more funding and look at other measures to help.  A chap from Galway was caught in a PTO shaft and lost his leg.  He goes around to schools, takes his prosthetic leg off and puts in on a table to shock the agriscience students in the class.  He is accompanied by a man whose own brother, someone I knew well, died.  We need to redouble our efforts on the schools programme because that is where we affect people.  Younger people have a bigger impact on older people and we need to start on the ground, which is inside schools.  As this chap cannot go around all the time explaining how he lost his leg, we need more funding for this.</p> <p>  My next point relates to the intergenerational nature of farming.  We need to get involved in mobile devices and apps.  Farming is seasonal and the safety mechanisms which work in autumn do not necessarily work in summer.  I encourage the Department to look at programmes to address this and I will write with some ideas.  Testimonials on public media, TV and radio are very important and the Department should redouble its efforts to put forward more funding in this area.  People across politics would support the Department in this regard.  It is unfortunate that expenditure is lower than anticipated.  I know the Department can only put forward programmes and cannot do everything itself but we would all be appreciative if a specific unit was set up to push it forward.</p></speech>

There is a perception that there are very good schemes and lots of money but it is not drawn down.</p></speech>

That was a very small scheme at the end of the old rural development programme.  It is important to acknowledge that within the targeted agricultural modernisation, TAM, scheme one of the major investment areas is animal handling facilities for farm safety purposes.  In addition, in our knowledge transfer groups that we are rolling out, farm safety is a major feature of discussion.  This is a cultural issue.  We do put money into handling facilities and so on but that is not the core of the problem.  The core is behaviour, and the knowledge transfer groups may play a significant role in that.  We are embedding farm safety into their work.</p></speech>

It could be thought of as a training course.  As an integrated part of that and to get the payment, the person must complete certain training in farm safety.  We are hoping that will have a bigger effect ultimately.</p> <p>  I agree completely with what is being said.  This is a major challenge for the entire sector and we need a joined-up response with voluntary groups and others.  The Embrace Farm organisation has done tremendous work, for example, in heightening awareness of this issue through various activities, especially through its very moving annual event which includes a service where, among other things, the names of people are read out.  It gets a lot of publicity and Embrace leverages that publicity to try to encourage a change in behaviour.</p></speech>

As part of the TAMS farm investment grants, a half day of safety training is required before we pay unless the person already has a green certificate which would include farm training.  Those two areas are the big things we are doing.  It does not appear separately as a farm safety item but they are integrated into two of our biggest and most important measures.</p></speech>

We rented the buildings in Portlaoise at the time of the decentralisation decision.  The intention at that time was to build an entirely new building for the Department.  That did not materialise for reasons that are well known, connected with decentralisation.  We share a Government building but because of the number of staff we had down there, several other buildings had to be rented for us.</p><p>I have been regularly engaged with the OPW.  I do not like our staff being scattered across a number of buildings.  I would like them all to be in the Government building, but that would require building an extension on it, which I still hope will happen.</p><p> I have been given a figure for rental of premises.  The outturn for 2015 was &euro;882,433.  The outturn for 2016 was &euro;536,168 so it is on the way down.</p></speech>

I can go through them in detail.  One is a group of areas where we are now putting together a request for tenders and competitive processes that were difficult to do in the past.  However, with the Office of Government Procurement now available, we are doing that.  Another relates to hiring veterinary staff in emergency situations.  It is a little tricky, but we are trying now to put that into a tender arrangement.  There are a number of other ones where I think it is inevitable that there will be very short-term, urgent needs and where tenders are not possible.  For example, removing animals at short notice and the need to get-----</p></speech>

The figure for claims by the public is &euro;134,000.  Does Mr. O'Driscoll see in the report that the legal costs in respect of these claims were phenomenal?  If one looks at the claims by employees under the Vote, one sees that the legal costs for the Department are &euro;92,000 for 183 cases.

I want to make one or two other points.  I notice in the Department's report, under land mobility measures such as the early retirement and installation aid payment schemes, that the Department paid out &euro;10 million in 2014 on the early retirement scheme.  This decreased to &euro;7 million in 2015.  Obviously, some of the people availing of the scheme are getting the State pension and, consequently, the payment from Mr. O'Driscoll's Department decreases if they clock into that.  I wish to link and relate this to a fact sheet Mr. O'Driscoll sent us on Irish agriculture for January 2017 which refers to farm structure data in Ireland.  The fact sheet refers to 139,000 farm holdings and an average farm size of 32.5 ha.  It details the proportion of family farms held by age and shows that 6% of farms are held by people under 35 years of age.</p><p>It states 53% are held by people over 55 years of age.  Therefore, 41% of farms are held by people in the 35 to 55 years age group.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll drill down into those figures and send us information relating to the total farmed land in the country for that age group?  I am seeking data not by the number of farms but by farmed land.</p><p> The figures could mask the situation.  While there may be a high percentage of farm owners who are elderly, this might not correspond to the amount of farmed land held by elderly people.  Many older farmers have land below the average farm size.  It would be useful for us.  The figures would be preferable to those for farm holdings, because they do not tell us how much of the farming land in the country is held by the various age cohorts.  I do not expect that Mr. O'Driscoll would have the figures here and now.</p></speech>

The national farm survey would have survey evidence on this.  We could provide that to the committee.  Certainly, I will provide the information to the committee.</p> <p>  This is a persistent problem in Ireland and throughout the EU.  Several countries have good age structures relating to the farming population.  However, by and large, they have got there through radical means.  For example, a farmer may not be eligible for the old age pension unless he retires.  That is the situation in Germany, for example, so Germany does not have this problem.  We have put in place several systems to encourage leasing.</p></speech>

That has already been alluded to.  Since 2007 and through the recession, the board's financial position worsened.  This was exacerbated by a large debt.  We had a long session relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Limerick previously.  The fact is the board is in a difficult financial situation.  We commissioned an Indecon report to examine various things, including governance, financial issues and issues of regulation.  We are trying to deal with those bit by bit.</p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the report was that Bord na gCon had to reduce its debt levels and improve its financial situation.  To achieve that, the recommendation was that the board would sell assets.  While the report was not prescriptive about what should be sold, Harold's Cross was one of the assets named.</p> <p>  Since 2014, we have known of a recommendation that the track at Harold's Cross would be sold.  Part of the reason is that the asset is likely to have significant value.  Second, it is only 4 km from another flagship stadium.  If we were starting from scratch, we would not plan things that way.  That is the position.</p> <p>  The board has been wrestling with this for some time.  It is obviously an emotive issue and has attracted strong feelings on various sides.  The decision on whether to run a track is a matter for the board.  The decision on the sale is a matter for the board.  However, the sale has to be consented to by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the position.  At the moment the board has made a decision to close the track and sell it.  I do not know whether the local board was consulted.  I will come back to the committee on that.</p></speech>

I wish to make one last point before I call Deputy Burke.  Obviously, there is an issue with the 2015 audited accounts and they are nearly here.  Far more important is the question of the 2016 management accounts.  Getting the 2015 accounts alone will not be much good.</p> <p>  The Estimates for this year are going through the D&aacute;il at the moment.  Before the Department agrees to hand out a further &euro;14 million, it will have to examine up-to-date 2016 financial figures.  These figures may not be audited but the management accounts should be close enough to the final accounts.  We will ask Mr. O'Driscoll not only to give us a copy of the 2015 figures but to give us an up-to-date financial report, notwithstanding the fact they are not audited.  That is the information on which decisions are being made at the moment.  I am referring to the 2016 outcome.</p></speech>

A total of eight or nine people from the Department are present.  We are giving an agency &euro;260,000 per week.  We have been here for a long period but we have been unable to get an answer to a simple question.  That is absolutely incredible.</p> <p>  My information is that the board has not approved this.  Those involved are looking to bring the board down the country to approve it.  That is a Dublin board.  That is my information.</p> <p>  It is incredible that we cannot get that simple information.  It is all well and good to talk about selling tracks but we have to ensure the industry is sustainable.  It is not good enough simply to embark on wiping off debt by cutting the industry to the bone.  We are talking about regional tracks as well.  This has been well cited in the media.  We are talking about regional Ireland and regional tracks.  These mean a great deal to the local economies.  The integrity of greyhound racing is at stake.  No decision should be made until we are able to bring Bord na gCon before the committee to explain this behaviour.  We need to drill down into this.  These are big assets.  They mean a great deal to people and local economies.  We should ensure this decision is put on hold until we can ask the right questions.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the policy committee on this area.

At issue is a decision for the future.  Perhaps we should convey our views to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

We are projecting that it would be good to bring about a 50% increase in production to meet growing global demand.  Broadly speaking, global demand for dairy products is growing at between 2% and 3% per year.  Ireland is aiming to take an increasing share of that global market, albeit the share would still be rather small.</p><p>When, with our support, the Food Harvest committee stated production would increase by 50% by 2020, a lot of people doubted it, but it has already increased by approximately 30% from the Food Harvest base figure.  Therefore, we are on track towards meeting the figure of 50% or perhaps more.</p></speech>

That was done, I think successfully.  It had the effect of putting a floor under the market, which was very useful.  Second, we provided co-funding.  We provided payments for farmers from money provided by the European Union and national funds.  We provided payments of, I think, &euro;1,360 per dairy farmer, with an &euro;800 top-up for young farmers, on the back of moves at EU level, combined with national funding.  The answer to the question is that we took action in terms of the markets, which action is always taken in co-operation with our EU partners as the market is managed at EU level.  We made payments directly available to dairy farmers to support them during that difficult time.  As the Deputy knows, prices have since recovered substantially and are now averaging 35 cent per litre.</p></speech>

The milk processing year runs to the end of March.  It was for the year to the end of March 2015, the last period for milk quotas, during which we went over quota as our farmers essentially geared up for the ending of quotas.  We fought very hard, with a number of other member states, to have the regime to be changed in order that penalties would not be imposed for that year.  We lost that battle, but we did secure the arrangement referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, as part of which the superlevy was to be paid in instalments.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the young farmers and the national reserve.  There was provision of &euro;24 million in 2015 for young farmers from the national reserve.  There was no funding in 2016.  Can the witness explain why that happened?  What is the Department thinking about in the future?</p></speech>

The automatic one is from a claw-back on sale of entitlements without land and from unused entitlements.  Typically, very little comes into the national reserve from those sources.  It can be that there is then not enough money in the reserve-----</p></speech>

I have been lobbied by several people who are not in the system at all who got into farming late and did not qualify because of age and had not the qualifications in respect of land at the time.  They are always trying to make the case that they are forgotten about.  They call themselves the forgotten farmers.  Is there anything in the pipeline for them?  I have raised this with the Minister on several occasions.  Is there anything in the pipeline for those forgotten farmers, as they call themselves?</p></speech>

I agree that we have all heard from them.  They are an ill-defined group but, nevertheless, our best estimate of the number of farmers that might fall into this category is about 3,900.  If we were to make provision in the national reserve for all of those farmers, it would cost about &euro;12 million.  The difficulty with that is the way in which the national reserve is set up by the EU.  Preference must be given first of all to young farmers and new entrants.  If we wanted to deal with the forgotten farmers, we would then have to find another &euro;12 million on top of what is spent.  That would mean a further cut to everybody's payments.  I realise that this group of farmers feels hard done by, but it does fall outside the conditions of the various schemes, which relate to age and the number of years that one is in control of one's farm.</p></speech>

To me, it was one of the best schemes to entice older farmers to hand over their farms to their children and so on.  Could it be looked at again in the future?  I know it comes down to funding but it was a very good scheme and it was taken up and used.  It brought a lot of young farmers into the system.  Could it be looked at again or is cost-preventative?</p></speech>

I cannot answer as to whether it will be in a future programme.  That will be for post-2020 and I really cannot answer at this stage.  For a start, we do not know what the shape of the rural development regulation itself will be, as it might change by then.  That scheme was successful in encouraging some farmers to move to early retirement.  However, it was often criticised - I think with some justification - that it addressed early retirement rather than retirement.  The figures read out by the Chairman relate to farmers over 65 and so on.  The early retirement scheme did not really address that.  It actually encouraged people to go early.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on the beef data and genomics scheme, which I am in myself.  I have raised this with the Minister and have spoken to the Department about it previously.  We all tag calves at birth.  I am talking about particular females for the genomics scheme.  One uses one ear for a bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, tag and one takes a sample.  However, one is also putting a tag on the other side and it is a waste.  It is not a waste, it is an identity tag, but I cannot understand why farmers such as me then have to go back in July and August and then - in my case for 20 cattle every year - put a third tag into them just for genomes.   I am actually tagging a calf that is idle for the year.</p><p>I have said this several times and it makes common sense.  One could have a big scheme, especially for the genomes and the genes.  There could be a proper scheme whereby, if a farmer had a spare tag, every female animal in the country could be tested at birth.  I cannot understand why they could not introduce such a scheme for a reasonable cost instead of a farmer having to bring in adult cattle and take 20 cattle samples every year which is another tag in an animal's ear when it could be done at birth, even for the animal's sake.  It is so simple when one thinks about it; the BVDP tag could be in one ear and the genomic sample in the other ear, and the farmer is doing it anyway.</p></speech>

We also looked at the option of a dual tissue tag.  I will not say that it has had huge difficulties but it has not worked out for us.  In this regard we must work with the tag companies, the laboratories and with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.  For now, we are sticking with the current arrangement and that is what we propose to do for 2018.  The BVDP tag is a scheme with a limited life.  The tagging arrangement around the conventional tag and the tissue tag is a permanent, ongoing arrangement.  Putting in a third button tag - as it is called - for BVD may seem a bit over the top, but it is for that specific scheme.  It is a different function to the other two tags.</p> <p>  The other possibility to suggest itself is to have two tissue tags and no conventional tag, but there would be concern around the security of that.</p></speech>

What is the situation there? The clean up of the site has been a subject for a long time.  The proposed expenditure for 2015 was &euro;4.328 million.  Was that money spent?

It contains an old slag heap from the days of the steel plant on the island.  It is the subject of an environmental finding against Ireland because there is a danger of leaching into Cork Harbour.  We have acquired the job of fixing that issue on Haulbowline Island, of ameliorating the site of the old steel plant itself and of rehabilitating some attractive old cut-stone buildings on the island.  When that work is done we will hand the site over to the Department of Defence because the main occupant of the island is the Irish Naval Service.  The Government has approved a plan costing &euro;64 million for total works on the island.  We are currently working through that.  There has been some advance in the project with a tender put out, to which there has been a response, and discussions are continuing with the chosen tenderer on the costs of the most important parts of this work.  The committee is seeing some of the very early costs mainly around planning and engineering expertise costs, but there will be a peak in the work on Haulbowline, due to fall around 2017-18, and after that it will trail off to nothing as we complete the work, and happily hand the whole thing over to the Department of Defence.</p></speech>

Sitting here at each meeting, having listened to officials and having heard the questions that were raised about Bord na gCon today it occurs to me that we are giving out money even where there are governance issues with parent bodies which distribute the funds.  For example, we have had the HSE before the committee with regard to Console.  The issue keeps arising.  Is the Department looking at this?  Money goes to Bord na gCon, the Marine Institute and Horse Racing Ireland and then the Department is in here facing questions.  I would love to see a proactive approach.  Consider the HSE, for example, which was before the committee and justifying and auditing retrospectively.  The Department is funnelling public money and then it is being asked how many times a year it is meeting - once a year in Mr. Gleeson's case or four times a year.  What is the proactive plan with regard to the substantial moneys given to these bodies by the Department? The Marine Institute and Horse Racing Ireland have been mentioned here on occasions.  What is the plan?</p></speech>

We are currently examining all our interaction with our State bodies to see whether they conform to the requirements of that new guidance.  It is likely that this examination will lead to some changes.  The Deputy's question is very well timed in the sense that we are reviewing the matter.</p></speech>

We should not have to be here asking how many times has the Department met with Bord na gCon, the Marine Institute or Horse Racing Ireland when we are giving out substantial funds.  The Department should be able to come in and tell us.</p></speech>

I shall be quite honest with the Deputy; when we come to the Committee of Public Accounts we have no idea what it is we shall be questioned on.  One of the reasons I have a collection of excellent people around me is because I come in to this committee with no idea of the line of questioning.  That is fair enough, that is the system and no one complains about it.  The Deputy is quite right that I did not know how many times the principal officer-----</p></speech>

The more general issue is in holding to account the bodies to which the Department gives money, so that the Department is satisfied.

I take the Deputy's point that the Department should be in that position.  It is our responsibility to make sure that the reports that are required from the State bodies come in on time and are done on time.  I have already taken on the point that the Bord na gCon 2015 accounts clearly should have been prepared earlier.  I accept all of that.  We do need to improve our engagement with them on such matters.  I would, however, draw the distinction between the responsibility of the Department and that of the board.</p><p>It is very important to not blur that line, or nobody is responsible.</p></speech>

Maybe this committee should insist on that as a matter of form and it would probably be good practice for us, and for the Accounting Officers, across the board - not just in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
