    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600003#B00200"><p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his officials.  There are two items for discussion.  The first is a D&aacute;il and Seanad motion regarding the horse and greyhound racing fund regulations 2013.  The second is an update on the next EU Council meeting.  Members will be aware that on 19 November D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann referred the motion to the committee for consideration.  Members have received a briefing note on the motion.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600003#B00300"><p>The most recent estimates available suggest that the horse and greyhound racing industries combined underpin in excess of 24,000 jobs and stimulate approximately &euro;1.6 billion in economic output.  The industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Payments are made from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon by my Department.  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;841.77 million has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  State resources provided from the fund are pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.</p><p>  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2014, contained an allocation of &euro;54.22 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed 80% to HRI and 20% to Bord na gCon in accordance with section 12(6) of the Act.  To allow the Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2014, it is necessary to comply with a technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Acts, which requires increasing the cumulative limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;54.22 million to facilitate the budgetary decisions.  This is achieved by way of the regulation submitted before the committee.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in this manner in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.</p><p>  The funding of HRI and Bord na gCon supports two important indigenous industries and helps to sustain the role of thoroughbred horse and greyhound breeding, training and racing enterprises and in the development of the rural economy.  These industries produce a good return to the State's investment and are a significant net contributor to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the Irish bloodstock industry provides approximately 14,000 jobs, almost &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and exports worth &euro;174 million.  In fact, exports are more than that.  Ireland holds a pre-eminent position in the thoroughbred racing world.  We are the largest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest producer in the world.  Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of total worldwide output is produced in Ireland.  The fund has helped Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing and has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.</p><p>  Bord na gCon has estimated that the greyhound industry employs a little over 10,300 people and contributes an estimated &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around the tracks, which have a wide geographical spread.  Bord na gCon has reported that, since 2002, more than 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600004#C00300"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the Minister and his officials here today.  Over the past few years cuts to expenditure have come under scrutiny in every Department, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is no exception.  One must scrutinise the overall expenditure on the horse and greyhound racing fund.  Today we have an opportunity to do that.  It is a huge sum, notwithstanding the employment that the sectors create, at 24,000 jobs, and their value to the Irish economy.  The proposal here is to impose requirements on the taxpayer to fund an industry which is also a sport.  Both the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and Indecon in their reports raised serious questions about the viability of the fund and how it is spent.  One can compare the &euro;50 million available to the horse and greyhound racing fund with the &euro;25 million available to the Irish Sports Council, which represents 57 national organisations, 32 local sports partnerships and 18 high performance sports at Olympic level.  We saw some results of its work at the recent World Championships.  The Irish Sports Council contends, as did the ESRI report, that it is very difficult to justify funding horse and greyhound racing while cutting the funding to it and our international athletes.  An athlete who won a gold medal for Ireland at the recent World Championships, comes from the Minister's constituency.  There has to be a balance.</p><p>  According to the Indecon report, the horse and greyhound racing fund provides on average &euro;179,000 per race meeting.  I accept that these figures may be outdated because the report was published in 2004.  None the less, at that time, for every person who attended those race meetings the fund provided &euro;38.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600005#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for his annual report to the committee.  The greyhound industry and its contribution to the rural economy in particular to small farmers is very significant.  I draw a clear distinction between the greyhound industry and the horse racing industry in so far as greyhound racing is a poor man's sport, in my view.  It provides employment and the greyhound tracks all over the country provide a social outlet for low income families and for people involved in that sector.  I would find it very difficult to oppose subsidies because it is a very positive industry for rural communities.</p><p>  The Minister states that the breakdown of the &euro;54 million is 80% and 20% between the two sectors.  He said that exports are worth &euro;1.1 billion to the Irish bloodstock industry and &euro;500 million to the greyhound industry.  There are 10,300 jobs in the greyhound sector and 14,000 jobs in the Irish bloodstock industry.</p><p>  I regard this an unequal allocation of funding.  I would like to see more money going towards the greyhound sector.  I note the sort of money spent on trailers, for example, in the horse breeding and racing industry and in my view there is a significant difference in the people involved in both industries. </p><p>   I ask the Minister to consider increasing the percentage contribution to the greyhound industry.  I would support funding being sourced from online gambling in order to take pressure off the Exchequer.  I will not oppose the measure in so far as I think both those industries must be allowed to develop and flourish in our communities.  I speak personally about the greyhound sector.  I know the value of the sport to rural Ireland and to small farmers and breeders.  I know the knock-on effect of the money - even prize money - coming back to the local communities.  I am not so sure if this is the case with regard to the horse industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600005#D00500"><p>Members have asked valid questions which I will answer.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill makes a comparison between general sports funding to the Irish Sports Council and the funding for the sports of horse racing and greyhound racing.  It is important to reinforce the message that horse racing and greyhound racing are not just sports - each is an industry.  Some 90% of horses are bred on farms with two mares or fewer.  This is about farmers breeding horses, wanting to live the dream of having a winner at Cheltenham or at the Curragh, for example.  Deputy Ferris is very committed to the greyhound industry.  The people one sees walking country roads, training and breeding dogs, are part of an industry.  This industry generates business for those involved in providing animal feed, bedding, housing and veterinary services; in effect, a whole series of contributors to rural economies across the country.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris referred to Rob Heffernan whom I know quite well.  In many ways he has performed a minor miracle by being a world champion - given the financial resources available to him - compared with the competitors he has beaten in the recent world championships in Russia.  I agree that elite athletes and sports people are also part of an industry.   The actual sport element of horse racing and greyhound racing is only one part of the activity of the sector which the Department funds.  We are funding a whole industry which is massive in size.</p><p>  I recently visited Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.  Both of those countries have significant investments in Ireland.  Investors are pumping multi-millions of euro into Ireland.  They employ large numbers of people in the management of their stud farms which provide further employment in the surrounding areas.  Other sporting activities do not result in economic investment in this country. I refer as an example to Sheikh Mohammed who employs over 130 people in his horse breeding activities here.  People need to understand the broader picture, that this not just funding sport.  They need to understand that many farmers and service providers are linked to the activities of the greyhound industry and the bloodstock industry. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600006#E00200"><p>The Minister was a little more measured in his response to colleagues than I would have been.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's comments were reckless and potentially extremely damaging.  He began by paying lip service to economic activity in the industry before going on to suggest its funding should be cut.  His attitude is not altogether surprising given the proposal by his party in a pre-budget submission last year that there be a reduction of &euro;10 million in the allocation for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  That proposal, if implemented, would have decimated the industry.  The Senator also lamented the loss of revenue from the betting industry, without mentioning the successive reductions in the duty that were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il governments for whatever reason and in the context of whatever linkages it had to the betting industry.</p><p>  The horse racing industry never wanted to be in a situation where it would be reliant on taxpayer funding.  On the contrary, it was happy to be a stand-alone entity in its own right, with betting revenues matching State funding.  It is not the industry's fault that it is now in this position.  In that regard, I welcome the proposed extension of betting duty to online betting.  It must be done sooner rather than later.  I understand it is being examined by the Department of Finance, but it is frustrating that it has taking so long to bring it forward.  I agree that once that change is implemented, we must then have a debate on whether we should review the rate.  It is very difficult to justify the decision to reduce it from 2% to 1% in 2006, whatever about previous cuts.</p><p>  The Minister indicated that in excess of 90% of horse breeders own four mares or fewer.  Many of them come from my own county of Kildare.  It is important to note that this section of economic activity is happening in areas where there is very little other economic activity.  The horse racing industry is the second largest employer in Kildare, which is an indication of how much it is worth and how much it feeds into other areas.  Picking up on what the Minister said in his presentation, on the one hand we have a strengthening bloodstock industry on the sales end.  Irish horses are making very good prices which has, in turn, a benefit for the overall Exchequer in sales terms.  However, to maintain a vibrant racing sector, we must keep those horses in the country.  My concern is that the best horses, which are being sold for the best prices, are being exported.  If we do not keep these animals in training here, there will be a knock-on effect on jobs.  Will the Minister comment on his recent visit to Qatar and elsewhere in the Middle East where he met some of those high net worth individuals we need to target as the next major funders of the industry into the future?</p><p>  The changes in European law in regard to VAT are a major concern for the breeding industry.  It is somewhat frustrating that the Minister is obliged to come in here every year to discuss the allocation for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This ongoing dependency and uncertainty as to how much money the Minister can win at the Cabinet table is causing stagnation in the industry.  Everybody in the industry would accept that we need to move to a more sustainable model of funding.  It is very difficult for the industry to plan from year to year for the larger capital projects that need to be done.  Perhaps this committee has a role to play in examining international best practice as part of our work programme.  Adopting a multi-annual approach to funding would be useful, and I understand the Minister is already doing significant work in exploring that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600007#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I am probably one of the few present who was a member of the select committee in 2001 when one of his predecessors, Joe Walsh, brought the existing legislation before it.  I welcomed the Act at that stage and I welcome it again now.  One of the matters which left a sour taste in people's mouths at that time was the tax exemption for stallion breeders.  Many could not understand how those owners - many of whom are well to do - were allowed to avail of this exemption.  The exemption in question benefited a small number of individuals, but small stud farms such as those at Charlestown, at which the winner of Irish Grand National was trained, and Tullaghnasleek.  These farms are responsible for a great deal of direct and indirect employment in the county and they also give rise to downstream employment, even in the transport and haulage sector.  Anything that can be done to assist the industry is welcome.</p><p>  Huge numbers of ordinary people get the opportunity to participate in point-to-point events in Castletown Geoghegan, Kilkenny West, Durrow, Ballymahon and Doory.  This is a sport but it is also a significant industry for the areas to which I refer.  It can be the lifeblood of many rural areas.</p><p>  I concur with what the Minister and Deputy Martin stated in respect of the greyhound industry.  Two of the nation's 17 greyhound stadiums are located in Longford and Mullingar.  Both are excellent facilities and they play host to many activities other than greyhound racing.  What are the Minister's plans to continue to improve, upgrade and refurbish the type of facilities throughout the country to which I refer?  Kilbeggan Racecourse, which is under the management of Mr. Paddy Donegan, is probably one of the finest examples of a significant return being garnered on foot of the investment made.  It is a premier venue and hosts seven or eight race meetings each year.</p><p>  I recall that the funding contribution was to be equivalent to the betting duty that was to be raised.  The ultimate aim is that those who operate the courses would wean themselves off this form of funding.  I do not believe those involved in racing want to be dependent on outside funding.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill was supposed to be a priority.  Why has it taken so long to progress it?  I accept that there are difficulties involved but while we are waiting for this legislation, many of the ordinary bookmakers operating in rural areas are closing down.  Many of them are being wiped out by online betting - I refer to it as "remote control" betting - from which not a shilling comes back into the country.  The bookmakers to whom I refer are obliged to pay tax, employ people, etc.  Online betting and other developments have hit these individuals hard.  Two or three people are employed by the bookmakers who operate in small rural villages.  The Minister will be obliged to pursue this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Public Expenditure, Deputy Howlin, or whomever is responsible for causing the delay with the legislation.  When enacted, the Bill will give rise to a much-needed source of revenue for the Exchequer but if nothing happens prior to that point, many ordinary bookmakers will be wiped out.  The owner of Connolly Racing in the town in which I live has been in constant contact with me for the past 12 months, basically asking me what is happening.  As already stated, I accept that there are difficulties involved.  However, we very capable, efficient and effective in the context of overcoming difficulties relating to taxation.  We should be no less effective and efficient when it comes to tackling the anomaly that exists in this area.</p><p>  Like Deputy Martin Ferris, I would like further funding to be given to the greyhound industry.  Many of the small operators in this industry could do with a boost.  People tend to consider the top line.  However, I deal with many involved in horse racing, the owners and operators of stud farms, etc., and I know that those with only one or two mares are always hoping for that breakthrough which will put them into a position of reasonable sustainability.  Those people have been very supportive of the industry.  Perhaps in the future the Minister might consider making a greater investment in the greyhound industry.  Those involved in it often do not have a sufficient number of avenues to explore in order to ensure that they might place their businesses on a solid footing going forward.</p><p>  I welcome the introduction of this secondary legislation, of which I am supportive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600007#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I compliment the Minister on maintaining his Department's budget for next year at &euro;54.2 million, particularly in these difficult times.  This is money well spent and it equates to just over &euro;2,000 per job in the industry.  The latter is crucial to rural areas because all of these jobs relate to such areas.  All of those present represent rural constituencies and we are well aware of the importance of the industry to our constituents.  Deputy Martin Ferris used the term "the poor man's sport".  There are two well known horse trainers in my constituency, namely, Jim Bolger and Willie Mullins.  Even though both are at the top of their profession, they employ many people who would be regarded as being at the lower end of the scale.  The type of employment for which Mr. Bolger and Mr. Mullins are responsible is crucial to rural communities.  In addition, they reinvest a great deal of money in those communities in the form, for example, of sponsorship for local clubs.  It is important that such assistance is provided and matters would be much more difficult if this sponsorship was not forthcoming.</p><p>  Many people in rural townlands are involved with greyhounds.  It may be that they own an animal or at least have a part interest in one.  There is no doubt that they would like there to be an increase in the 20% funding available, if possible.  I am aware that review of the greyhound industry was instigated in recent weeks.  The Minister referred to the fact that the horse racing industry includes an international dimension.  Are there any plans to expand the greyhound industry in order that it might attract a greater level of international interest?  Some of those involved in the industry have informed me that there is a great deal of potential in this regard.  What plans does the Minister have in this regard?  I notice he has set a deadline of 31 March next for the completion of the review.  When it is completed, will a committee or working group be put in place to implement whatever recommendations are put forward?  If so, has a timescale been decided in respect of the implementation process?</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Penrose's comments in respect of online betting.  The legislation is overdue.  Will it be introduced before Christmas and what is the envisaged timescale for its enactment and implementation?</p><p>  I again welcome the fact that the Department's budget has been maintained and I support the proposal before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600007#F00400"><p>Unlike Deputy Heydon, I avoided taking the political bait.  People just need to consider the records of different Governments in respect of these issues.  The important issue is that we should ignore what happened in the past and instead consider what now constitutes value for money.  We must ask whether this is a good way to spend &euro;54 million in the context of all of the pressures faced by the Exchequer, the Government and the country.  In my view, it is a good way to spend &euro;54 million.  What is proposed constitutes good value for money.  We are supporting a sector that does an phenomenal job in terms of maintaining its competitive position internationally.  The latter is particularly the case in respect of horse racing.  The greyhound industry has a huge impact across large parts of rural Ireland, which would not be the case if we did not fund an infrastructure which allows the industry to maintain its presence in these areas.</p></speech>

If the Minister was aware of the revenue generated by sport in general, apart from horse racing, in the Irish economy, he would know that revenue from sport in general is worth more to the Irish economy than is revenue from the horse racing industry.  That is a fact based on figures from the Irish Sports Federation.  It is worth &euro;1.8 billion in GNP and it employs 38,000 people; they receive less funding and more people would benefit from funding, if available, through Irish Sports Council than the horse racing industry.  That industry is hugely important to the Irish economy and I support it and the great work that has been done since 2001.  However, I do not support the fact that taxpayers' money is being allocated to support an industry that is perceived, and it may well only be a perception, to be an industry that is elitist in nature.  If the funding for 2014 was as important to the industry as everyone around the table is saying it is, then steps would have been taken to broaden the tax base in regard to online betting and the &euro;4.6 billion which is generated-----</p></speech>

The legislation has been in preparation for some time and if a 1% tax was imposed across the board on even online betting, it would almost let the industry pay for itself.  I have an issue with asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for an industry which, albeit an important one, is not reflective of the part of the Ireland where I live in County Donegal or of the west.</p><p>  I have a number of questions for the Minister.  The Indecon report contained 13 recommendations on a funding model for the Irish horse racing sector.</p></speech>

In effect, it is a horse racing fund and a greyhound racing fund.  Is the purpose of the fund to promote horse racing meetings and to try to get more punters through the gate to attend them, and the same on the greyhound side?  Could we have clarification on the average number of people attending horse racing meetings in Ireland and whether the number is increasing or decreasing?  Could the Minister provide the same statistics for greyhound race meetings?</p></speech>

In 2008 the previous Government contributed just under &euro;40 million as a top up.  In the following year, approximately &euro;31.5 million was contributed.  In 2010, the sum was &euro;28 million.  This year the contribution will be less; it will be &euro;27 million.  There seems to be a change in approach from Fianna F&aacute;il because the party has moved from government to opposition in order to seek a political opportunity.</p></speech>

In fact, he thought it was a worthwhile expenditure.  I am trying to understand what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is proposing.  Does he propose that we reduce the fund and by how much?</p></speech>

My point is that we made a minor reduction to the horse and greyhound fund because every part of the Department&rsquo;s budget must take its fair share in terms of reduced expenditure.  I also make the strong point that the allocation represents very good value for money.  If somebody else thinks that there should be a different amount allocated then let us hear it.</p><p>  In terms of the recommendations in the Indecon report, we have got agreement to implement practically all of them but in order to make the changes we must introduce new legislation.  Many of the recommendations were about changing the board&rsquo;s structure.  That is happening and it will be in the legislation.  A focus of the recommendations was to ensure that we do not duplicate the work of the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland in terms of taking a joint service approach to human resources, HR, pension management, administration and such matters.  The vast majority of that has been agreed.  There are one or two outstanding issues which I have asked both the Turf Club and HRI to resolve.  I am hopeful those issues will be resolved within the coming weeks before the legislation is introduced.  The recommendations in the Indecon report will be implemented practically in full.  Any of the decisions in the report that we decide not to implement will be decided on the basis that we do not think it is the right thing to do, as opposed to not being able to do them.  We have taken the report very seriously, as we should, and we will do the same with the greyhound industry.</p><p>  In terms of the fund being for racing, it is spent to ensure we have an infrastructure in place for a horse and greyhound racing industry.  If one does not have top class horse racing and greyhound racing in Ireland one will not have the industry that feeds into it.  This is not just about getting numbers to race meetings.  It is about ensuring that we are breeding, training and developing horses in Ireland as that plays to our natural competitive advantage in terms of having a limestone-based grass production system.  We are privileged to live on this island in terms of its grass growth potential that allows us to produce dogs and horses in particular that have very strong bones and good muscle development.  That is the reason people who have a lot of money to spend and who are very committed to the industry choose Ireland as the place to develop their bloodstock.  We will maintain that.</p><p>  The total attendance at race meetings in 2012 was just under 1.2 million people.  To give an idea of scale, that is approximately the same number of people who attend the GAA hurling and football championships.  The average attendance at a race meet in 2012 was just under 3,500 people.  These are not insubstantial numbers.  The numbers attending race meets is just an indication of the level of support for the industry but it is a significant indication.</p><p>  In terms of the funding of infrastructure for other sports, it is important also to note that the State does from time to time, rather than on an annual basis, invest heavily in infrastructure such as the Aviva stadium or other pieces of sporting infrastructure in various parts of the country through the sports capital grant programme or significant one-off capital expenditure.  That does not happen generally in the horse and greyhound industry because we ask them to use the horse and greyhound fund for that purpose.</p><p>  The questions are fair and I do not wish to become party political.  I am sorry if I did.  I am protective of the industry because it is genuinely world class.  We have done a reasonably good job through recessionary years in this country to maintain an industry that is world class in terms of its standard.  Now that our economy is starting to grow again I hope we will be in a position to start increasing the horse and greyhound fund again in the future to allow the industry to grow and expand to its full potential.  It does have the potential to grow beyond where it is at the moment.</p></speech>

That is a much more complicated process than one might think.  We have a number of different online platforms where betting takes place.  We have betting exchanges and online bookies and some companies do both.  We must also ensure that if somebody is operating outside of the State but taking bets from Irish punters that we are capturing the revenue.  We needed to design a system that ensures that when people make a bet in Ireland online, whether the bookie facilitating the platform is based in Ireland or elsewhere, that we get a tax take or duty take from each bet.  We have a system now that will allow us to do that which will be based on a licence fee to take online and remote bets from people in Ireland.</p></speech>

Nobody will make big money out of the greyhound sector unless they are lucky enough to have a Derby winner or something like that.  The social side of it is of huge importance to my town of Tralee.  When greyhound racing takes place in Dundalk and across the country it is a big social occasion.  I feel very close to those people because I can see the value of the sport and its knock-on effect on the local economies.  That is why I would be reluctant to tamper with it.  I would like to see the greyhound side increase more but as the Minister stated, we cannot do it because of legislation and so on.</p></speech>

What we do not want to see, therefore, is our best horses moving out of Ireland to other countries that have higher prize money and, as a result of that, reducing the status of the horses in terms of the number of group 1 classifications we can run in Ireland.</p><p>  There are different pressures on the two industries.  The competition from abroad in terms of horse racing is intense and therefore we must maintain a level of prize money here to remain competitive.  In terms of greyhound racing, to encourage and incentivise breeding in and development of the sector we must have prize money that is at a certain level but we do not have the same level of international competition we might have for horse racing.  It exists to a certain extent because of the industry in the UK but we do not get quite as many people travelling, literally on a weekly basis, between the two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

There does not appear to be any disagreement that the horse racing and greyhound racing sectors are vitally important.  If these industries were allowed to continue unsupported I imagine the report on the economic development of rural areas the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has commissioned would lament that fact.  There is general agreement on the need to get the betting tax extended to a broader base.  Whether it should be increased from 1% is an issue on which we should have an honest discussion to ensure that when we meet to agree a fund we can say without doubt that it is matched by direct revenue.  Apart from PAYE, VAT or other ancillary taxes collected from those employed in the sector it should be directly funded, euro for euro, with revenue from the betting industry, which is available to be tapped into.</p><p>  Is it agreed that the joint committee recommends there should be no further debate on the motion by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  Agreed.  That concludes our consideration of the motion.</p><p>  I propose that a report on the proceedings of today's meeting will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will suspend for five minutes to allow the withdrawal of the witnesses.  We will resume on the pre-Council agriculture and fisheries meeting, which is particularly important for the fishing industry.  We will resume just after 3.30 p.m.  We have to conclude our consideration of this part of the meeting by 5 p.m.</p></speech>

It is a difficult time for that family and it is important for members to recognise that.  While I hope this search can be brought to a conclusion soon, as the joint committee is discussing fishing, it is important to recognise the difficult search currently under way off Kilmore Quay for a fisherman who went missing yesterday.</p><p>  Has a division been called in the Seanad?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600011#K00800"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make those remarks.</p><p>  As members are aware, the annual fishing opportunities for the Community&rsquo;s fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Agricultural and Fisheries Council.  This year, the arrangements for 2014 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 16 to 18 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and the quotas for Ireland again will be determined at that meeting, following negotiations with member states and the European Commission.  The  Agricultural and Fisheries Council also will decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2014.</p><p>  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way with the publication of detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland on 30 October last.  The Commissions&rsquo; proposal for nephrops in the Irish Sea was, however, only received last Friday, 22 November and consequently the sustainable impact assessment, SIA, does not cover that stock.  The proposal also does not cover stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations, such as mackerel and blue whiting, as well as whiting in the Celtic Sea.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, which is the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.</p><p>  In order to inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had undertaken an assessment of the effects of the Commission's proposal.  The  preparation of a sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment is provided for in the programme for Government.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation process was initiated whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2014.  From November 6, an online web portal on <i>www.fishingnet.ie</i> was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 13 November, which gave a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position on the many aspects of this proposal.  In all, five submissions were received by the closure date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline are available on the aforementioned website and have been laid before this joint committee for those members who are interested.  On examining the various contributions to the consultation process, there is a general acknowledgement that the national consultative process is a positive addition to the debate.  While there is acknowledgement of improvements in recent years in respect of some stocks, particularly in the Celtic Sea, there is understandable concern about certain whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet. </p><p>  I agree with the sentiment in many of the contributions, which call for greater adherence to the scientific advice available to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  However one criticism, which I share, is that of the arbitrary cuts proposed by the European Commission for fishing opportunities in 2014 and the overly narrow interpretation of some of the scientific advice.  There is justifiable concern that these cuts in certain quotas will only lead to further discarding.  The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, have undertaken an evaluation of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, which is contained in the sea fisheries SIA.  While noting an improvement in the status of some fish stocks, others remain a concern, namely, in areas west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea.  Much needs to be done to rebuild all stocks to sustainable levels, including further reductions in fishing opportunities and improving selectivity to avoid by-catch.  Implementing the new reformed Common Fisheries Policy, especially the phased ban on discards, and ending overfishing will require continued work and commitment by all member states, including Ireland.</p><p>  The new regionalisation model in the reformed Common Fisheries Policy provides for member states with a direct interest in fisheries in a region to work together with the EU advisory councils of stakeholders for the same region to develop appropriate conservation measures for the fisheries in the region.  Ireland hosted the first meeting of the regional group of member states, involving the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands, earlier this month.  The first major task will be preparing for the effective implementation of a discards ban for fisheries in north-western waters.  I also appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to chair a national discards implementation group, involving fishing industry representatives, to develop appropriate measures for fisheries in which we have an involvement.  This group will develop and support Ireland&rsquo;s input into the advisory group of stakeholders and the EU regional group of member states.</p><p>  As for TACs and quotas for 2014, the sustainable impact assessment summarises the pressure on the 59 stocks dealt with in the 2013 stock book.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600012#L00300"><p>The fact the Minister states that these are only proposals offers some hope.  I do not want to be negative or critical.  I would say at the outset that the Minister is talking here about the sustainability in the future of many sectors in the Irish fishing fleet and as it stands, it makes worrying and disturbing reading.  If this was implemented in full, it would be a disaster and it would finish many sectors.</p><p>  All of us here who are from coastal communities, such as Deputy Harrington, the Minister and I, will be aware how difficult it has proven for fishermen to be able to remain in the sector with the exception of a few small sectors and we are also conscious of its knock-on effect, social implications and consequences for coastal rural communities, and the importance of getting as good a deal as possible here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013112600013#M00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials from both the Department and the Marine Institute.  Proposals always make bleak reading at this time of year.  Negotiations will take place at Council level.  I am concerned that the prawns or Nephrops are not included in the assessment.  What is the potential impact of this?  I am glad the Minister outlined in his statement that he will defend the existing allocations, presumably based on the scientific interpretation of the Marine Institute.  I hope the proposals can be countered very strongly.  The prawn fishery is a very significant one right around the coast.  After the mackerel fishery, it is our second most important.  It is critical that it be defended, particularly where every demersal species faces a cut.  Megs and hake appear to be the only two demersal species in respect of which an increase is proposed.  The Minister has been consistent in recent years in defending the argument for increased allocations because the science backed up his positions.  However, the proposals affecting haddock, monkfish, cod and whiting have been crippling.  We often hear the debate pitting the scientific argument against anecdotal evidence gleaned from experience on the ground.  Such evidence suggests cod is much more plentiful this year because of the recovery plans.  It is a question of how the circle will be squared.  How can the scientific advice justify a proposal to cut haddock quotas by 75%?  This seems very severe.</p><p>  How does this subject link with maximum sustainable yield?  There is always a balancing act.  Ultimately, fishing communities will have to buy into the idea of maximum sustainable yield.  In the herring fishery in the Celtic sea, short-term pain has yielded a longer-term gain for the industry.  The idea that maximum sustainable yield is factored into the proposals is significant but even more significant is communicating that to a community that is entirely dependent on demersal species.  It is the whitefish fleet proposal that affects that vast majority of communities right around coast.  It is encouraging to note the increases regarding the pelagic species.  Mackerel is extremely important to the Irish fishing industry but, in terms of numbers, bodies and even the inshore fleet, which comprises 85% or 90% of registered vessels that fish quota species, it is the critical demersal sector in respect of which the greatest cuts are proposed.  Could the Minister take the opportunity of tying the concept of maximum sustainable yield, which is a noble but painful objective, to the proposals?  His doing so would be worthwhile.</p><p>  With regard to mackerel, which is being debated at a higher level in the European Union, I am concerned we may be tempted into a deal whereby we might again see a short-term gain in terms of the TAC but a detrimental result for the Irish fishing industry in the longer term.  Could the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

It is true that the recommendations in advance of Council meetings are sometimes more stark than the actual results because the Commission takes a precautionary approach regarding some stocks.  If there are insufficient data on which to draw a more accurate conclusion, it applies a cut of a certain percentage.  We have to use all the available data to be as accurate as possible.  If a stock is under significant pressure and is being overfished, we must reduce the level of fishing; otherwise we will use the stock.  What will happen to other stocks if we do not take action is what happened to cod in the Irish Sea and other areas.  We must not allow that to happen and must take the difficult decisions required by scientific analysis in order to conserve fish stocks and prevent them from being dramatically overfished and, therefore, subject to damage that may take years to undo.</p><p>  Having said that, I believe there is a detailed analysis required.  This is why the most important member of our team in the December discussions will be the Marine Institute.</p> <p>We do not have sufficient data on the biomass of 58% of stocks in Irish waters to be able to draw significant conclusions.  We cannot simply apply a 20% reduction because of lack of data.  That is a principle that most Ministers in the Council would completely reject.</p><p> Maximum sustainable yield, or MSY, is a major part of the new Common Fisheries Policy.  The policy has a number of big initiatives, including fishing to maximum sustainable yield.  In normal language, that means catching as much fish as one can in order to return the maximum commercial benefit from fishing that stock, while at the same time not undermining the health of that stock.  That is essentially what MSY is.  We need a lot of data to make an accurate MSY figure or guesstimate.  We will have an MSY fishing figure where possible by 2015 but for all stocks by 2020.  In other words, this is an information gathering, scientific exercise to get as much data together, linked to the various stocks, as we can.  We have enough data for some stocks to make an assessment of MSY.  We are trying to move towards MSY by 2015 where possible.  </p><p> There are other scientific arguments which cannot be ignored.  As regards Nephrops, or prawns as most people would call them, we have multiple prawn fisheries in Irish waters, including the Porcupine Basin, off the south coast and in the Irish Sea.  We treat Nephrops as one fishery, as opposed to dividing it into different geographical regions.  In some of those fisheries, countries that have Nephrops quotas are simply not catching them at all, so a major portion of TACs are not filled.  We need to factor such anomalies into the TAC and quota allocation decisions for next year. </p><p> In other words, we need to conserve stocks.  However, we also need to look at the broader data to ensure that we are not unnecessarily reducing the level of fishing effort and quotas that will damage an industry by taking unnecessary steps to preserve or protect stocks.  That is the kind of discussion that is ongoing between the industry and the Marine Institute.  We have an industry-science partnership which involves a healthy and, at times, intense discussion.  However, that relationship is probably better than it has ever been and the fishing industry understands the scientists' recommendations.  </p><p> We also have industry observers at ISIS meetings, so these decisions are made in a transparent way.  We might not agree with all the decisions but we can certainly see the process whereby they are made.  The negotiations in December will be difficult for us.  The numbers are harder and starker than in the preceding two years.</p><p> I am conscious of Deputy Harrington's point that the vast majority of fishermen in Ireland are not operating in large pelagic vessels - they are in medium-sized, white fish demersal vessels.  That is how most fishing families derive their income, but we can only catch fish if they are there.  That is the bottom line, so first and foremost we must protect stocks while at the same time trying to protect the incomes of fishermen and their families to the greatest extent without fundamentally undermining fish stocks.  That is the basis of our preparations with the Marine Institute in advance of the December discussions, just as we did in 2011 and 2012 when we got pretty good outcomes given what was predicted going into those discussions.  Sometimes people assume that the Minister will sort this out in December, as if we will have some sort of miracle solution.  It is not as straightforward as that.  We are facing difficult negotiations this time around and the outcomes for some in the fishing industry will be difficult.  I will do the best I can, however, to try to make the scientific case for maximising the returns to a sector that needs to have somebody fighting for it.  We will try to get the best outcome we can.</p></speech>

I am sorry I was delayed but we had two votes in the Seanad.  I have read the Minister's contribution and the attached documentation.  The most worrying aspects, which are outside our control, are the European Commission's proposals on horse mackerel and mackerel quotas.  The Commission seems to be using that quota as a bargaining tool for Iceland and the Faroes.  The Minister has gone through the implications.  I thank him for the detailed work which, in conjunction the Marine Institute, BIM and other agencies, has provided us with today's update.  It is important for this committee to be aware of developments and we have been briefed in that respect.</p><p>  How does the Minister see this matter panning out given the commission's standpoint?  What is the timeline involved?  If these quota reductions are implemented there will obviously be a quota reduction as well as a drop in income for the Irish fishing and processing sectors.  Some of the proposed cuts will be catastrophic.</p><p>  I am not sure what discussions have taken place with the European Commission, so perhaps the Minister can outline them and what the next steps are.  Are member states being asked to make submissions to the Commission?  </p><p>  Mr. Patrick Barry, a fisherman who went missing off the Wexford coast recently, is in all our thoughts and prayers.  His family must be going through a most painful experience at the moment.</p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the excellent work of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service in detaining the Dutch vessel <i>Annelies Ilena</i>.  The ship was detained 100 miles north west of Tory Island and the case if before the High Court today.  While I do not wish to refer specifically to that case, a large number of huge factory ships are currently operating in Irish waters, including the north west coast in particular.  Those vessels were previously fishing in Mauritanian waters off the coast of Africa, but they have been expelled from that area.  As a result they are now off our north west coast and are effectively hoovering up horse mackerel and mackerel.  I support the efforts of the Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service in this regard.  </p><p>  Fishing industry representatives in Killybegs think that shoals of fish are being caught and graded by such factory vessels, while smaller fish of less value are being discarded.  That is happening on a wholesale basis.  The Minister has our full support in tackling that matter.</p></speech>

Depending on where one comes from, different fisheries are important.  In value terms, the mackerel fishery is significantly important, particularly to the north west and the south west.</p><p>  We are in the process of negotiating on the north-east Atlantic waters, a mackerel fishery shared by the EU, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  There has been a dispute for nearly five years about these waters.  In our view, Iceland and the Faroe Islands have ignored all scientific advice and have been catching as much mackerel as they can catch and process.  The EU has been trying to get back to a place where there was an agreed share-out of quotas between the stakeholders in that fishery, recognising where the fish spawn, grow and breed and that the mackerel stock has expanded into the north west.  The proposed outcome is very different whether one comes from Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands or whether one is on the Commission.  We had discussions last week in Clonakilty on this issue but there is still no resolution.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests to get an outcome that is fair and does not reward dramatic overfishing.</p><p>  I met the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Maria Damanaki, recently and made clear to her the Irish position that the Commission&rsquo;s current proposals are not acceptable and we strongly oppose them.  This is an unfortunate position.  I want to support the Commission in trying to find a conclusion to this matter but what is on offer is not the basis for a fair conclusion.  Norway also shares our concerns.  We cannot simply allow countries outside of the European Union to do what they want in terms of the amount of mackerel they catch.  We will continue to be as constructive as we can be.  We do, however, have to recognise the legal mandate of the Commission to be the negotiator on the European side.</p><p>  Ireland only offers an opinion, but one that is strongly held.  We have the second largest mackerel quota allocation in the European Union after the UK.  We stand to lose a significant percentage of our access to stocks if the offer to Iceland and the Faroe Islands is too large.</p><p>  I would rather not comment of the detention of the trawler, <i>Annelies Ilena</i>.  That is in the hands of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and will be resolved in court.  The SFPA and the Navy are doing their best to be fair in the tough job of ensuring people respect the rules.  We saw an example of that in Kilmore Quay last week which was a difficult process for the industry to deal with but it was necessary.  We are seeing it now with a non-Irish registered trawler in the north west.  I hope the outcome will send a strong signal that people need to keep to the rules regardless of boat size or fishery.</p><p>  The Council process is that the Commission makes a proposal based on advice from ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, and other organisations.  We go through a process of assessing this.  Both Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and the Marine Institute have been helpful in this.  We prepare a scientific argument whether to agree with, oppose or amend the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  That happens at an intense Council meeting on 16 and 17 December.  The outcome will probably be seen at 7 a.m. after 48 hours of non-stop discussions and negotiations.</p><p>  As regards alliances at this meeting, member states tend to share scientific evidence.  For example, we are working with the UK on nephrops in the Irish Sea, with Spain on megrim and with France on Celtic Sea white fish.  We have agreed with France to change fishing gear to reduce juvenile fish catches, an effective way of reducing discards in that fishery.</p></speech>

I propose to postpone housekeeping matters until next week since the Minister is waiting outside.  Before I invite in the Minister, do members have any questions to put to the EU policy clerk on any of the issues?  No.  Everyone got a briefing document on potential issues.  Are members satisfied?  Okay.</p><p>  We will hear a briefing from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the forthcoming meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, ESPCO, Council, in Brussels on 9 December 2013.  The Minister will brief the committee on the agenda and then members will have an opportunity to engage with the Minister.  Later, we will discuss progress on the negotiations on the EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership agreement.  I welcome the Minister and his officials, Mr. Paul Cullen and Mr. Dermot Sheridan.</p></speech>

The agenda falls into some legislative and non-legislative items.  I will deal with the items that fall into my remit.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, can be involved in different parts of the council.  The agenda is still a little fluid, but the key non-legislative item will be the so-called European semester.  This is the fourth European semester.  Commissioner Andor will present on the annual growth survey, the joint employment report and the alert mechanism.  These documents precede the setting of recommendations for member states.  This is the start of the process.</p><p>  The main legislative item that falls into my area relates to posted workers.  It is a little too early to say whether the Lithuanian Presidency will seek to get a general approach or broad agreement from the Council on the issue.</p><p>  I will brief the committee on the annual growth survey.  This is the start of the European semester, a calendar of policy co-ordination whereby national policies are reviewed collectively and recommendations are made to member states.  The Commission has published its growth survey and has set out that the main challenge is how to sustain the recovery that is now under way.  It has put forward five main priorities for member states for the coming year.  Broadly, they are the same priorities that the Commission listed last year.  The first is pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  The second is restoring lending to the economy.</p></speech>

It is very beneficial to us to have the data before the meeting.</p></speech>

This morning we must acknowledge the very strong figures from the Central Statistics Office on employment.  We all welcome them as a very positive indication of a recovering economy.</p><p>  Is there any timeline in place for the conclusion of the posting of workers directive?  Can the Minister outline why we oppose Article 12?  There was always a concern about the potential impact of the posting of workers directive on our construction sector.  That is more particularly the case now that we are in the recovery phase.  Strong companies within the EU could use the posting of workers directive to get around tendering or to put in lower tenders for some of the large-scale capital projects planned here.  Is there any work under way within the Department to protect against that?</p><p>  One of the aims of the annual growth survey is to restore lending within the economy.  That is one area where we still struggle.  The specific aim is to look at alternatives to bank lending.  What work is under way in that area?  Given that the schemes rolled out here as alternatives have not really taken off, are there any lessons the Minister can learn from colleagues in Europe to inject some action into those schemes?</p><p>  I will leave the questions on the youth guarantee to Deputy Lyons.  The quality framework for traineeships is very important.  Where are we on that?  Is there a timeline to complete discussions and actions on that, so that we can implement the recommendations as soon as possible?</p></speech>

At what stage will that proposal filter down to the people in traineeships?  One of my concerns - not a political one - is that it all takes so much time and we do not have time.  In order to put down a foundation for resolving the EU-wide unemployment crisis, there needs to be rapid action and the quality framework is very important.  Will this go back to member states for their input?  Will it rather be 4 December 2014 before we see anything tangible?</p></speech>

It is not my direct area of responsibility but I understand that a review of apprenticeships is under way which will report shortly.  While this is a framework across member states, Ireland will be taking action with the review of apprenticeships and the establishment of SOLAS. There will be national initiatives as well as this broad framework which sets out the principles and practices that ought to inform such national approaches.  The national dimension is running in parallel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600005#D00400"><p>The posting of workers directive relates to workers in a firm who are temporarily transferred between member states in order to fulfil contract work.  The directive is to ensure that workers receive the minimum protections in the state in which they are working and is intended to circumvent the movement of cheap labour and the race to the bottom.  The problem in this State is that the minimum protection would be the minimum wage.  At the moment the registered employment agreements, REA, are in abeyance and are not replaced by any collective agreements.  For example, some construction workers and local contractors and workers might find themselves protected by the minimum wage but not by the agreed rates which were agreed under the REAs.  This is a concern.</p><p>  Article 9 has more or less split opinion among member states into two groups, one of which is comprised of Germany, Belgium, Italy and France.  This group is in favour of a regime that would leave each of the member states free to impose any national controls on service providers.  The second group is led by the UK and this State seems to support that group's policy of giving the European Commission a strong role in ensuring that measures adopted by the member state are compatible with EU law.  </p><p>  Will the Government move to support the position that member states should have the freedom to impose national controls?  Can the Government move to place these collective agreements back on a legislative footing?  This would give proper minimum protections and a standard or agreed protection for those who work in the construction sector.</p><p>  Article 12 proposes the mandatory introduction of a concept of joint and several liability to subcontracting contract arrangements in the construction sector.  Why is Ireland supporting this proposal?  If it is uniformly applied across the EU, will this provide a level playing field with regard to protection for workers? </p><p>  The EU semester is the economic planning process for the EU and member states.  The assessment by the EU sets out a number of growth and target figures for this State.  It is interesting that with regard to 2014 it forecasts GDP growth of 1.7% and inflation of 0.9% but that unemployment will fall to 12.3%.  For 2015 it forecasts GDP growth at 2.5%, 1.2% inflation and unemployment down 11.7%.  It would seem that the figures and the targets forecast indicated that we will have very modest growth, that inflation will still be with, yet there will be but very ambitious figures regarding employment.  Something is not quite right.  I wonder are the unemployment figures and the targets factoring in more emigration or low value work.  There is a forecast for inflation to remain and very modest GDP growth levels but much more ambitious targets for reducing unemployment.  I ask the Minister to clarify.</p></speech>

We have had extraordinarily strong employment performance in the past 12 months.  The figures are suggesting 3.2% growth in employment against a pretty subdued GDP growth background.  At the moment, I think GNP is a better indicator of true activity because of the impact of the so-called patent cliff on nominal values of pharmaceutical exports and profit repatriation.  We are delivering very strong employment performance which is reflected in the increasing activity across the sectors of the economy.  I refer to the strong performance of agriculture and food and IDA and Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in the areas of industrial exports, business services, ICT, for example.  We are seeing the emergence of strong sectors which are creating employment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600006#E00300"><p>We were initially in favour of a closed list, but the consensus is now moving towards an open list, with a Commission verification that what is being put into the open list is not unreasonable.  That is the direction in which the proposals are moving and it is a consensus we would be happy to support.</p><p>  I accept there is a problem in regard to registered employment agreements in light of the Supreme Court decision to strike down the REA framework.  We are seeking to rebuild that framework in a way that is constitutionally robust.  That work is ongoing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600006#E00500"><p>Workers will be protected in our law under the REAs when the latter are restored.  The existence of legally backed agreements is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the posting of workers directive, that contractors from outside jurisdictions who may be using employees from lower wage economies do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.  The existing agreements are recognised within European law.  From an Irish perspective, we need to repair the legislation.</p></speech>

It clarifies the conditions citizens need to meet to be entitled to free movement to benefit from social assistance and to social security benefits.</blockquote>Will the Minister clarify whether anything has changed in respect of the entitlements of EU citizens who move from one member state to another?</p></speech>

As I understand it, it is simply a matter of reviewing established practices in this area.  An example of an existing practice would be the requirement to work one stamp in order to activate one's record from country to country.  There are several of these types of restrictions in operation.</p></speech>

No proposal for a legislative initiative has been brought forward.  The communication is essentially a research exercise.</p></speech>

It seems that if one talks about something often enough, one essentially becomes branded with that particular issue.  It then becomes hard to get a job in another movie, so to speak.  The main point when it comes to youth unemployment is that most of the actions that need to be taken must be taken on a national basis.  At the same time, it would be remiss of me not to point out, while we have the Minister in the room, that it is often during the tea breaks of meetings that most politics is done.  It is important that he take such opportunities at EU meetings to speak to counterparts with similar portfolios from other member states.  There is a great deal of positive engagement on the youth unemployment issue, but we have a responsibility to do more.  Given our status as a country about to emerge from a bailout programme it has always been acknowledged that any roll-out of the youth guarantee and other initiatives to address the horrendous youth unemployment situation we are currently facing will be done on a phased basis.  To a certain extent, we run the risk when we talk about youth guarantees and youth employment initiatives of overselling ourselves and thereby possibly letting ourselves and our young people down.  It is important that we get the message across at meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council that more needs to be done to address this issue and no stone should be left unturned.</p><p>  As to what can be done nationally, it is important to note that this is an issue which cuts across Departments.  I understand an interdepartmental group, led by the Department of Social Protection and including the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs, is examining youth employment initiatives.  There are actions that are encouraged by the EU but which we have thus far failed to take.  Social clauses, for example, do not contravene European legislation.  In fact, if done right, they are encouraged.  There is a great deal of good practice in this regard from which we can learn.  Scotland, for instance, has implemented social clauses exceptionally well.  The Welsh, unfortunately, did less well with their notion of Welsh jobs for Welsh people, but they are learning from that.  Another area in which we can do more is that of social enterprise.  At a meeting of the committee last week we heard that Ireland is at half the level of other European countries in this regard.  Local enterprise offices need to start treating social enterprises as equally important as, if not more important than, standard businesses.  These are businesses by another name, with the same objective of making money but an added dimension of a social mission.</p><p>  As I said, much positive work is being done in the area of youth employment initiatives.  However, Ireland needs to convey the message to its European partners that we can and must do more.  I am sure the Minister is cognisant of all these issues, and I do not even need a response from him.  If Deputy Calleary had not landed me with the opportunity to make these points, I would not have said anything at all.</p></speech>

As he knows, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is actively engaged on this issue and is examining how we can fulfil our obligations in this regard.  An implementation plan is due at the end of the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1114" speakername="Deirdre Clune" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600007#F00200"><p>I am interested in teasing out the position with regard to the quality framework for traineeships, a matter in respect of which Deputy Calleary posed a question.  The Minister indicated that the apprenticeship scheme is being reviewed and that SOLAS has been established.  I read a newspaper article yesterday which indicated that the City &amp;amp; Guilds has produced a report on the value of vocational training, while today's headlines relate to the number of students different schools send on to third level.  Vocational training should have been a bigger story, particularly in view of the fact that we are living in a period of flux.  The Minister referred to Germany and Denmark, in which much greater emphasis is place on vocational training.  In the context of the review of the apprenticeship scheme, does he foresee a move back towards manufacturing?  The food production sector is doing well but there is a dearth of quality training programmes in the hospitality sector.  Does the Minister agree that we should shift the emphasis away from third level and move towards vocational training?  I am sure he is aware of the value of traineeships and of ensuring that they are adequately resourced and that there are proper quality frameworks in place in respect of them.  This is a point which we must continue to make.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600007#F00500"><p>Yes.  That will have to be grown over time.  The MOMENTUM programme is interesting and operates more along the lines of an apprenticeship model.  It runs from 20 weeks to 40 weeks and there are 6,500 places available on it.  The jury is still out with regard to how successful it can be.  However, I am of the view that it can serve as a very useful bridge.  Germany has a much more structured, long-term apprenticeship model which is connected to manufacturing but MOMENTUM has the potential to be the start of something.  Obviously, there is a need to branch out.  The apprenticeship model which previously obtained here was quite rigid and was very much linked to the construction sector.  Traineeships can provide a more flexible model and they can be used in a wider range of sectors.  There was a training structure of some sort in place in the food sector in the past but this seems to have been damaged during the boom.  We need to restore that structure.</p><p>  The review of the apprenticeship scheme does not fall directly within my remit.  However, there has been a consultation process and I understand recommendations will be presented to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The recommendations to be made relate to legislative changes,  model of delivery, curriculum, range of crafts and occupation and funding and finance mechanisms and the review is due for completion in December.  Much of the material involved will be available for the committee to assess in the very near future.</p></speech>

Does it concern the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that matters may get lost between the cracks?  In the context of where we need to be in terms of focus, is there an argument to be made for one focused department of jobs in each of the member states across the Union?  Would that not be better than having different Ministries dealing with various aspects and resulting in genuine initiatives being watered down because of the need to compromise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013112600007#F00700"><p>I will give the Deputy an honest answer but I do not know whether it is the right one.  One can waste a great deal of time restructuring institutions.  What is required is joined-up thinking on policy.  In the context of the process relating to Action Plan for Jobs, we are trying to ensure that everyone is on the same wavelength rather than engaging in a huge structural reorganisation.  I am aware of some organisations which spent 12 months trying to reorganise themselves and decide who has responsibility for what.  In such circumstances too much effort goes into the process of merging responsibilities or whatever rather than on developing a clear policy.  That is not to say that structural change is not necessary because at times it is necessary.  However, one should look first at policy integration and whether it is possible to develop a policy which encourages joined-up thinking across Departments.  It can be awkward at times because three different Ministers must speak in respect of different parts of the brief.  It is possible, however, to defend training being placed within the education remit, particularly as it is about standards, progression, etc.</p><p>  Once it is open to sufficient influence and connection into the world of real employment, that is a good model and that is what must be built.  The challenge for SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills is to build that connection.  We are also working to try to help build it.  In a time of crisis, one works as best one can with the structures on already has in place in order to deliver.  Some structural changes have had to be made.  The difficulties with F&Aacute;S, which has been replaced by SOLAS, were inherited from the previous Government.  The change that has occurred has been worthwhile because F&Aacute;S, as it was constituted, was not working.  We have brought the employment placement service within the remit of the Department of Social Protection and a much more developmental model - which can be improved on over time - is being used.  We need to build a bridge with the Department of Education and Skills in order to strengthen the position.  We have already done this in certain areas.  For example, a good model is in place in the area of ICT and the two Departments work well together as a result.  As more skills opportunities emerge in the economy, we will have to ensure that SOLAS and MOMENTUM become better integrated in the context of employment needs.  There is a challenge for both Departments in this regard.  I apologise for the long-winded reply.</p></speech>

Multinationals are flagging that the biggest challenge facing them is finding a sufficient number of skilled employees in the country.  Does the Minister consider that the new structures being put place are adequate to address those shortages?  The figures announced today are welcome and the fact that 58,000 more people have been in employment in the past 12 months is significant.  Is the Minister optimistic that employment will be as strong in 2014?  I would support the concept of strengthening and developing manufacturing much more than we have done, particularly in encouraging small businesses and industries in the more peripheral regions of the country.</p><p>  We very much welcome the fact that a number of multinationals are creating significant levels of employment here but the problem in towns like Ballinasloe, from where I come and where there was a good deal of labour-intensive manufacturing,  is that 1,000 industrial jobs have been lost during the past decade.  The Minister mentioned apprenticeships and many fine apprentices were trained in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s to support that level of manufacturing.  As labour costs increased here many companies that were located in the west relocated to lower cost economies.  We face the challenge of replacing some of those jobs and that will be only done through small indigenous companies providing services and small manufacturing-type operations.  Is the Minister satisfied that the structures we have in place will help bridge those skill shortages?  We have had many meetings with representatives of the hospitality industry in recent times and they have spoken about significant skill shortages, particularly a shortage of chefs.  Will we be able to meet the demand that exists with the new structures that are being put in place?</p></speech>

F&Aacute;S training is being integrated with the VECs and we will have a good capacity to deliver training.  The issue is to make sure that delivery is to a standard and meets the needs of employers.  The challenge for SOLAS is to build those quality interventions that move people into the areas of opportunity.  The Senator is right is pointing out that the areas of opportunity are changing.  We cannot provide training for skills that are not in growth areas.</p><p>  Manufacturing is not to be written off by any means.  The food sector is thriving in terms of growth and it is very strong.  The Irish whiskey sector is also thriving.  The medical devices sector is a strength in our economy, as is the pharmaceutical sector.  There are many strong manufacturing sectors, including engineering, across the country.  One has to be smart to survive and there are some excellent companies that are growing to scale.  Combilift is one of them and I could name dozens but there is no point in naming only some of them; they are doing well from rural bases and they are adapting skills and delivering a quality product at a price point that people will buy.</p><p>  We would write off manufacturing at our peril.  It is one area that we need to develop and one of the plans we have for the coming years is to try to lift the capacity of our manufacturing sectors which, as the Senator rightly said, have a skill spread.  He is also right in saying that start-up is key.  We are reviewing entrepreneurship policy and we want to promote start-ups.  Two thirds of all new jobs come from companies in the first five years of their existence.  Therefore, we want to try to build a better start-up environment.  Start-ups took a big hit in the collapse but those companies are resilient and that is the area we can develop.  It has mixed skills requirements.  The Deputy is right in saying that skills shortages are a challenge but it is also fair to say that the Department of Education and Skills is doubling its output of ICT graduates.  It planned to do so by 2018 but I understand it will beat that target and it will be delivered before 2018.  The institutions we have are delivering but the more one does and the more one bangs the door for more to be done, the better.</p></speech>

It would include active labour market policy, which is very much the area in which the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is actively involved, which covers the matters we have been discussing, those of education, training and traineeships.  I doubt that wage setting mechanisms will be an issue for us as we have reformed them and we are continuing to introduce change.  In terms of research and development and innovation, sweating the assets as best we can and creating a good environment for commercialisation, we have been working in that area.  Another area is access to finance, as Deputy Calleary said.  There will be familiar themes in the country-specific recommendations, there will not be some startling new areas.  It is a question of pushing on and getting new initiatives embedded.</p></speech>

In June the Council of Ministers gave the Commission a mandate to start the negotiations on an EU-US trade agreement.  The US is Europe's biggest trading partner.  The EU-US corridor represents two thirds of all global trade.  It is a significant area of opportunity.  The idea behind it is to take the standard step of reducing tariffs and quotas, which is the bread and butter of trade agreements, but also to examine regulatory and non-tariff barriers and seek to reduce unnecessary barriers to trade, not by reducing the regulatory protection but by reducing the administrative burden that accompanies them.  This is not about the EU telling the US what food protection measures it should have in place or vice versa but rather it is about making sure that artificial barriers to trade are not being created.</p><p>  The third element of it is to evolve standards over time.  If the EU and US are evolving product standards over time, that sets a standard, helps global competition in terms of the EU and US and encourages the opening of trade generally, as people move to a common standard.  </p><p>  It is a very significant potential agreement.  Tariffs are generally low.  At European level they are about 3% and in the US they are about half that level.  The meat of these negotiations will not be in the tariffs but in reducing the administrative burdens or hurdles that prevent trade.  The easiest example to highlight this point can be found in the pharmaceutical sector where there is an FDA test - an American test - for a product to be approved for use.  </p></speech>

The defensive interest for us would tend to be agriculture, beef in particular, as was the case in the agreement with Canada in terms of lifting barriers or quotas and allowing in an increased quantity of product.  It cuts both ways.  In the Canadian agreement it was agreed to allow in 50,000 tonnes of beef carcases, 30% less in meat terms, but Europe was getting access to the Canadian dairy sector.  There are swings and roundabouts.  In the Canadian case, I understand they do not have hormone-free beef so they will not be able to supply the quota in the short term.  It will be several years before they will be able to supply the quota.  In these agreements there are always opportunities and defensive positions.  The key is that there is mutual gain from dropping the barriers.  It is the first lesson one learns in economics that if one takes down the barriers and one trades, everyone gains.</p><p>  The US has already agreed to lift its protection against Irish meat, which was being banned on health grounds dating back to the incidence of BSE.  That is a new opportunity even before any agreement is in place.</p></speech>

It would be an issue of contention.  The EU itself is looking at its intellectual property rights framework.  Many feel it is not sufficiently modernised to allow business exploit opportunities but at the same time I do not think there would be many in Europe which go to the extent of the US system which is based on fair use.  That will be an issue of contention but the agreement will not necessarily require countries to change their regulatory environment.  We are seeking to find a common approach.  There might be harmonisation in some cases where it is agreeable but this is not about forcing a change in data protection, for example, where there would be concerns.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputy Crowe.</p><p>  The first item on our agenda is a discussion on the social dimension of the economic and monetary union, EMU.  I welcome representatives of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI; IBEC; and European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland.  We have Professor Tim Callan, associate research professor at the ESRI; Mr. Philip O'Connor, chairperson of European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland; and Mr. Tony Donohoe, head of education, innovation and social policy at IBEC.  As we know, there is a growing debate at European and Irish levels on how social indicators can play a role in EMU.  We have had a communication from the Commission very recently setting out its thoughts on how this can be done.  Last week we were lucky enough to have a representative from the Commission talk to us about what the indicators should include.  We have had one meeting with representatives of Irish bodies.  Last week we heard the perspectives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, and Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy of Social Justice Ireland on this topic.  Today we look forward to hearing the valuable perspectives of the ESRI, IBEC and the European Anti-Poverty Network.  The views they express will form part of a contribution we will make to the European institutions on the social dimensions of EMU.  That contribution will hopefully be made by Christmas.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, is a European-wide alliance of organisations in member states, which focuses on European policy and its impact on poverty levels and so forth.  We welcome very much this belated communication from the Commission to strengthen the social dimension of EMU.  Ireland's stance since the 1970s has been that economic and social progress are two sides of the same coin as regards the development of the European project and economic progress should not be regarded purely as an end in itself but as a vehicle to improve living standards and create a more inclusive society.  It is also obvious and patent that the EU cannot continue to be a competitive economic bloc if a quarter of its population is suffering deprivation or excluded from the basic services of society.</p><p>  These are fundamental values not just of groups such as ours, but also of national policy.  What is still in place, although it has taken a battering over the past few years, is the policy developed by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, in 2005, The Developmental Welfare State, which set out a balanced approach to developing the type of welfare state this country should have.  A balanced approach was also the aim of the Lisbon strategy and it is also written into the current Europe 2020 strategy while it was reiterated in the recent communication on the social investment package  The values of social cohesion and so forth form a central part of the Structural Fund regulations, which will govern the use of such funds in Ireland for the next six years.  The Irish EU Presidency adopted and argued for the social clause in the Lisbon treaty, as proposed by the EAPN.  This requires the EU to take equal account of the impact of social exclusion on all aspects of policy at Union level.</p></speech>

The economic crisis has revealed many underlying issues with European economic competitiveness and social policies.  Careful consideration needs to be given to ensure that solidarity mechanisms in the EMU context support a reform agenda that will restore Europe's global competitiveness and reduce our high levels of unemployment.  Good economic performance and improved social protection are not intrinsically opposed.  They can be made to support each other.</p><p>  I propose to deal separately with each of the Commission's three major proposals on: reinforced surveillance of employment and social challenges; enhanced solidarity and action on employment and labour mobility; and strengthened social dialogue.</p><p>  IBEC is convinced of the value of monitoring the progress made in implementing the EU 2020 growth strategy through a set of well-chosen indicators.  An early warning system under EMU such as the macroeconomic imbalance procedure is also necessary to prevent undesirable economic and fiscal developments at an early stage, and correct macroeconomic imbalances before it is too late.  Likewise, the so-called scoreboard of macroeconomic indicators is an important tool to shed light on central aspects of the global competitiveness of economies, for instance, the trade balance, unit labour costs and export market shares.</p><p>  The business community also values existing EU labour market indicators, such as the 75% headline employment rate target or targets in the field of education and training.  These targets are useful to encourage policies and reforms at national level that boost employment demand and participation, and improve educational attainments in line with labour market needs.</p><p>  Committee members will be aware that the European Commission is proposing the addition of employment and social indicators to the macroeconomic imbalance procedure, and the creation of a separate key employment and social indicators scoreboard.  We have some concerns that the multiplication of indicators and overlaps between the different instruments developed in the context of the European semester will cause confusion.  This could undermine the objective of ensuring proper monitoring of the progress made in implementing policies which improve competitiveness, growth and employment. </p><p>  Indicators to measure purely social developments, as opposed to labour market developments, belong in the employment and social scoreboard, not among the macroeconomic imbalance procedure indicators.  Any new scoreboard should provide information and incentives for member states to reform their labour markets regulations and policies, social protection systems and-or education and training systems where the data gathered give evidence that they do not function effectively.  The Commission and the European Council should also ensure that sub-indicators are consistent with the headline indicator.  For example, the inequality ratio indicator links precariousness to flexible forms of work.  This is completely at odds with the positive role that flexible forms of work such as fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work play as a steppingstone into the labour market, particularly for the vulnerable groups such as the young or the long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

Three excellent opening presentations were made.  Perhaps the most important comment came at the very end from Mr. Donohoe that within the debate on labour activation and other measures, what Europe needs is growth.  We see it here with unemployment reducing below 13% and quite a fantastic 5,000 jobs per month being created.  With regard to how the macroeconomic balance procedure could be worked in, we spoke about this last week with reference to the Federal Reserve in the United States compared to the ECB.  It has an absolute mandate to consider unemployment figures in the United States in conjunction with its broader remit for monetary policy.  If the overlap may be confusing, would we be better to push it further up the line to the ECB altogether?</p><p>  To an extent I agree with the point on having unemployment insurance at national level, but we have had a very poor debate in Ireland on labour mobility.  Perhaps understandably it was badly handled with regard to unemployed people and suggestions on job opportunities in places such as United States.  Nonetheless Europe has 2 million job vacancies and in our country we have job vacancies in certain areas.  How do we address the issue of social insurance for people who are working so they can come back and have access to benefits again?</p><p>  My next question is to Mr. O'Connor with regard to active inclusion.  The committee is the first in the European Union to have this discussion with the Commission, which was quite glad to have been invited by the Chairman.  We had an opportunity to make very strong representation.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned encouraging people to engage with services and supports.  Does he not see such encouragement to engage as positive?  How would he improve it?  If people are not encouraged to engage, in what other ways will they achieve?  It is a very strong point and a new one for the committee.</p><p>  My next questions are a little technical with regard to the mean and median.  What are the headline indicators?  This is one of the areas on which the committee was fishing for advice last week, particularly from the representative from the Commission.  Will Mr. Callan give us an example of the choice between the mean or the median indicator on gross disposable household income?  Why is going with the median more preferable?  With regard to coherent principles underlying the measurement process, Mr. Callan did not make suggestions.</p></speech>

Professor Callan mentioned symmetry in the adjustment process and pressure on deficit countries.  It is fair enough, as pressure is presumably applied to reduce their deficits, but he stated that the European Commission "fails to impose similar pressure on the surplus countries".  Will he expand on this point?  Does he mean a surplus country should be required to invest in job creation, to spend more and so on?  Regarding his analysis of income poverty versus household joblessness, is he suggesting that the social welfare regime within jobless households is not being taken into account?  These may be generous in certain countries.</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor mentioned in-work poverty in Ireland.  Are there EU comparative figures?  He also mentioned the Irish Presidency and the social clause under the Lisbon treaty.  Were the enhanced measures to which he referred, including the poverty impact assessment, put to the Irish Presidency?  Was a set of indicators settled on following a cross-EU discussion?  Mr. Donohoe referred to the indicators as being a source of confusion.  Was that not unfair?  Is there no ability or scope to consider a range of indicators that would not undermine policies aimed at improving competitiveness, growth and employment?  The number of people not in employment, education or training, NEET, is one such indicator.  Mr. Donohoe might expand on his point about skill sets in Ireland being fine compared with the EU.</p><p>  Will our guests comment on whether the lack of repercussions for member states that fail to implement social indicators is good or bad?  What suggestions would they make in this regard?</p></speech>

They are not strictly directed to anyone, but our panellists may want to comment.  The Quarterly National Household Survey, QNHS, was mentioned in terms of the increase in employment, but one of its features that has emerged today points to a significant decrease in employment among young people, particularly those in the 25-34 year bracket.  For the European Commission, one of the headline indicators is youth unemployment.  While employment across the board seems to have increased, it has decreased significantly among that cohort.</p><p>  The European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN's presentation on social inclusion mentioned that social welfare supports had been cut, trapping people in poverty and undermining their capacity to seek work.  How will the recent budget cuts to young people's social welfare payments affect their capacity to seek employment?  How does this age discrimination affect our social indicators of active inclusion?</p><p>  There seem to be differences between the information on part-time work and working hours.  One presentation referred to the increase in precarious work, flexible working hours and low pay whereas another referred to the positive role played by flexible forms of work.  A recent study showed that many young people who emigrated had a job at the time.  This stems from part-time, precarious employment that does not lead to career progression.  Will our guests elaborate?  Sometimes, a few hours per week is a step on the job ladder, but if it does not provide career progression and it leads to young people emigrating to pursue their career paths, it can be problematic.</p></speech>

The rankings were published this morning.  It is fascinating to note that, notwithstanding the number of private second level school students accessing top colleges on higher point professions, for example, medicine, dentistry and so on, there has been an increase in the number of students from working class schools throughout my constituency.  I have in mind schools such as Loreto College in Crumlin.  Something like this was unheard of in the past.  Some 50% of its students are now entering third level.  This is phenomenal and ties with the increase in employment.  We have discussed educational attainment as a means of boosting our status.</p><p>  Has anyone considered family size as an indicator of poverty?  Does it contribute?  Lone parents are at risk of poverty, but none of the categories refers to family size as a potential measure.</p><p>  Should any action or sanction be triggered if an indicator reaches a certain level?

A question was asked about the difference between the mean and the median and why one would be preferred over the other in terms of income measures.  The mean income, what people often think of as the average, can be strongly influenced by the number of high incomes.  If average incomes rose swiftly, it could mainly be due to what was happening at the top of the income distribution.  The median income, which is best thought of as the half-way mark when ranking people from the lowest to the highest, is not influenced.  Incomes at the top could rise and fall regardless.  I do not know whether this illustration can go into the evidence, but we will supply a graph later.</p></speech>

I will try to focus on a few of them.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of active inclusion and encouraging engagement.  Of course we encourage engagement.  What is important is that we keep in mind what active inclusion is about.  It is not solely about encouraging people to engage with labour market services in order to regain access to employment, rather it is about having proper income supports in place, engagement with a positive system of supports which will assist people into appropriate training or employment and quality services.  Without any of these three aspects, all of which have been stitched into national policy with the development welfare state and various other things, what one has is a system that punishes people with poverty where activation is not successful.  While we understand the need to relativise benefit payments and so on, including for very young people coming into the system and to incentivise involvement in training, the reduction in welfare benefits for young people up to the age of 25 years, which includes large numbers of people who have families or are living in family homes, was out of court.  This will drive people into poverty.</p><p>  As pointed out by Senator Reilly, recent data on the growth of employment shows a less than impressive improvement in the employment rate among young people.  A lot more needs to be done.  We are all waiting with bated breath for the youth guarantee that is supposed to come into play at the same time as the cuts in benefit rates for young people.  Unfortunately, the experience in this country is that while the punitive bits will be efficiently implemented, we will have to wait until the new year to see what shape the supports which are supposed to make available appropriate and quality training provision will take.  We are not confident that the same level of determination will be applied in that regard.  However, hopefully it will be.</p><p>  The issue of in-work poverty was raised.  I do not have the figures with me for averages across the EU.  These figures vary enormously.  Mr. Donohoe made the point that a foothold in the labour market can lead to a better, stronger and more secure foothold in the labour market.  However, people who often acquire a very tentative foothold in the labour market remain in that situation.  We have seen a growth in zero hour contracts and, in the retail sector in particular, an increasing level of precariousness of employment.  We do not see a trend towards this type of work becoming more stable or long term.  We need to monitor the pattern of precarious employment.  The Mandate trade union produced a well researched report on the growth of precarious work in the retail trade two or three years ago.  We are not seeing improvements in this area or in some other sectors.  In-work poverty in an issue, in particular in the area of precarious work.  Often what precarious work means is a mix of people who are partly reliant on welfare but are gaining access to employment of a part-time nature, often scattered over a week, with which the welfare system often cannot cope.  There is a decreasing level of income in these particular categories.</p><p>  We are also seeing, although in other European countries rather than here yet because immigration is such a recent phenomenon, people being encouraged into self-employment.  While this is often a good thing, it often also leads to incredible levels of in-work poverty because in many small businesses which produce the income of only one person there are nine or ten members of a family working long hours to produce that income.  This has been shown to be a grave problem in terms of the ghettoisation of immigrant populations in several European countries.  </p><p>  On the issue of indicators, an Irish initiative which secured the social clause of the Lisbon treaty was meant to maintain supervision of convergence of social standards across Europe along with macroeconomic aspects.  It is an area in which there has been little progress.  An element of member states are retaining sovereignty over their rights to governance social standards.  There may be something in that.  It has also been the promise of EMU that we would have convergence not only of economic performance but of social standards and the standard of living across the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013112600008#G00200"><p>With regard to Mr. O'Connor's penultimate point regarding the NESC, I still sit on it and it still exists, despite what one could call the demise of social partnership, or at least the disappearance of much of the formal structure around social partnership.  It is a table around which all the social partners, plus the environmental pillars, sit.  It carries out excellent analysis.  Much of the thrust of its analysis formerly was as a precursor to the national partnership and pay agreements.  They are no longer in place, but the analysis goes on.  It began with a series on Ireland's five part crisis approximately four years ago, examining the social, economic, banking, fiscal and reputational crises.  The third iteration of the report has just been published, and it is a very valuable piece of work.  In the context of today's discussion, there has also been much research about the social consequences of the crisis.  We often tend to see these discussions in terms of inputs, but it also considers how to improve services, which makes a difference to people's lives.  That is as much about the efficiency of our services as how much money is invested in them.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy mentioned the macroeconomic imbalances procedure and the Federal Reserve versus the European Central Bank.  I do not see the European Central Bank as the appropriate body for measuring these types of indicator.  To be clear, I am not saying that employment and social indicators should not be measured, as they plainly should, but the macroeconomic imbalance procedures are already complex enough, and they are what they say on the tin.  They are for measuring macroeconomic balance and not the social consequences, apart from the labour market, which is a related factor.  It is important that these measures are in place, but there is a problem when there is duplication of measures.  We should remember the European semester and the five flagship targets in that respect, which have a raft of indicators under them.  Poverty is one of those.  Once there is an overlap of instruments we are in dangerous territory, as indicators have less value.  That leads to confusion and very little added value.  If indicators can support reform, they are valuable, but they must be carefully selected and robust as well.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about the skills indicators, which is interesting.  This is where measurement becomes more important than what is measured.  One can consider the Europe 2020 indicators and targets, of which Ireland has already achieved two.  As Deputy Byrne highlighted, the numbers going to third level education far exceed the 2020 target, and I am thankful that rates of early school leaving are below 10%, which is another Europe 2020 target.  Nevertheless, we still have youth unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  It is great and encouraging that we have met these targets, but this also shows how indicators by themselves are not the full story, as there are a range of other factors involved.</p><p>  There were questions from Deputies Byrne and Kyne about sanctions, but such a process is not appropriate, particularly with social indicators.  By definition, the countries that are probably least able to afford to pay or respond to punitive sanctions will be in the worst economic shape.  I do not know what would be gained by the implementation of sanctions.</p><p>  Senator Reilly asked about youth unemployment.  This morning's figures show a decline in the rate from 31.1% in quarter three of last year to 26.5% now.  The rate has declined but that does not make it acceptable.  There is still a long way to go, which is why we are fully supportive of initiatives such as the youth guarantee.  Like Mr. O'Connor, we look forward to seeing the details.  My organisation is involved in a pilot project in Ballymun that involves the youth guarantee, and it is interesting to see where disconnects can exist in the system.  This is not just about resources.</p><p>  Senator Reilly also asked about flexibility and the interesting Cork study that considered the motivation of people who are emigrating.  Ultimately, employment must lead to some sort of career progression.  I still do not fully understand the word "precarious".  Many people have five or six careers in their lifetime.  The idea of the permanent and pensionable job for life disappeared well before this crisis emerged.  It is important that those opportunities are there for young people.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy referred to European mobility, and it is ironic that decades after our accession to the EU our young people are emigrating to Australia and Canada rather than EU countries.  That may be more related to issues of language and culture.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013 which was referred to the select sub-committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 13 November.  The sub-committee is required by the D&aacute;il to report on its consideration of the Bill not later than Thursday, 28 November.  The times by which the sub-committee must complete its consideration of specified groups of sections and the amendments addressed to these sections are determined by an allocation of time order made by the D&aacute;il on 21 November.  The order of the D&aacute;il provides that any division claimed on the proceedings of the Bill must be postponed until immediately before the time set for the relevant guillotine or, if proceedings conclude before the time for the guillotine is reached, on completion of those proceedings.  The putting of any question contingent on a postponed division must similarly be postponed.</p></speech>

I mentioned this on Second Stage also.  There is no point in challenging that decision - we have learned that from having had a few years' experience - but we come to the same point time and again.  I introduced a Bill in the D&aacute;il that was not out of order proposing a reduction in rates, which I was told we were allowed to do, and which would not pose a charge on taxpayers.  In the four amendments I tabled to this Bill I proposed reducing the rate the Minister suggested, and my reason for doing that is that the business community is well aware that this measure is coming down the tracks.  The Minister is providing for the relief to be phased out over a number of years up to 2017, yet no consideration is given to phasing in or out other measures the Minister has brought in through the Finance Bill - for example, the single carer's allowance for single fathers.  They do not have four years over which they will lose that tax credit, yet some of the wealthier in society are being given a phasing-out period for this relief, during which the rate is being reduced from 75% to 50% to 25%.  My amendments propose the phasing out of the relief over a shorter period, which would be fairer.  I ask the Minister to consider amending the section on Report Stage to deal more quickly with the phasing out of this relief.</p><p>  There is a bigger point at issue here - namely, that if we are to have a proper debate on the finance legislation, a change to the Standing Orders is required and also, possibly, a constitutional change.  I have had 13 or 14 amendments ruled out of order.  I tabled 32 amendments in total and I hope my amendments to later sections will be accepted by the Minister.  I desire in some of my amendments to correct what are, in my view, errors or omissions in the Finance Bill, while in other amendments I disagree with the Minister's policy choice and direction.  I ask him to take that on board if we are to have real political reform.</p><p>  With regard to the section, as the Minister is the only person who can bring forward a proposal to reduce these percentages and phase out the relief more quickly over a shorter period, I ask him to consider doing that for Report Stage, when this Bill will come before the D&aacute;il again.</p></speech>

That is in line with the rules of debate for finance Bills and that has been the position for as long as I have been here and longer.  Even if the Deputy's amendments were in order I could not accept them.</p><p>  The time period proposed in the Finance Bill to phase out the relief is a reasonable one and there is no necessity to bring forward either the date for the phasing out of the relief or the rate at which the relief is phased out.  It is in line with similar phasing-out arrangements for loans used to invest in companies.  The reduced period proposed by Deputy Doherty in his amendments is unnecessary and would be unduly harsh on persons currently in receipt of this relief.</p></speech>

The Minister said that my proposal would be unduly harsh and that he is phasing out the relief.  I welcome the fact that it is being phased out.  The Minister has come to a decision that the relief is no longer acceptable and that it will be phased out, and because its abolition is unduly harsh he is providing for it to be phased out over a period up to 2017.  Where is the consideration for separated mothers and fathers who are providing for their children?  The ending of a relief such as that is unduly harsh.  That is what the Minister has done, as set out in a later section of the Bill.  As we kick off proceedings, I ask him how he decides what he considers to be unduly harsh.  What are the criteria he uses in his Department-----</p></speech>

How does the Minister categorise or measure what is unduly harsh for this group of individuals?

The amount of relief used by these individuals was &euro;314,426; in 2010, 38 individuals were affected, using &euro;764,550.  It is a judgment as to what additional imposition can be placed on individuals.  The most recent figures available are for 2011.  The relief cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;4 million.  This relief is subject to the higher earner restriction, which limits the amount of relief that can be claimed in full by individuals to &euro;80,000 in any one tax year before restrictions begin to apply.  Obviously, the measure of what is harsh and what is not harsh depends on the people who are affected and the extent of the change being made in any one year.  The precedents arise from reliefs in company law, where a similar time period applies.  I suggest that what we are proposing is reasonable and what the Deputy is proposing, in my view, is unduly harsh, but he can argue the opposite.</p></speech>

We are not making it easier for these people.  We are abolishing an allowance which they have.  That is the purpose of this measure.  The Deputy is twisting it around as if we were giving some kind of new relief to these people but we are not, we are abolishing it for the reasons to which the Deputy alluded.  We do not think it is necessary in the tax code.  We think it is giving an advantage to people in difficult times when the advantage is not needed.  A lot of these measures crept into the tax code.  Various people lobbied for various groups.</p><p>  To precisely answer the Deputy's previous question, based on the 2011 taxpayers' data, it is estimated that the cost of the tax relief on loans applied in acquiring an interest in a partnership is approximately  &euro;4 million and it is availed of by approximately 1,100 claimants, but we are abolishing it, not introducing it.  We are abolishing it over time to avoid undue hardship to the individuals who are claiming it.  One could make a case that it was never justified in the first instance, but usually when we have reliefs such as this one that we want to abolish we allow time to phase them out.</p></speech>

In particular, we looked at company law.  A phase-out period would be quite normal when credits such as this are being abolished.</p><p>  Because it is partnerships and companies, there is a question of the jobs of employees in companies.

It also clarifies a contractor's obligations in terms of qualifying under the incentive.</p><p>  Amendment No. 8 is simply to improve the readability of section 2 and to clarify the transitional arrangements which apply in the period to the end of this year and also for the early part of 2016.  Amendment No. 11 is purely a technical amendment.</p><p>  Amendment No. 12 is in response to concerns which were raised on Second Stage about the entry point to the incentive.  Accordingly, I am happy to say that I have decided to reduce the minimum threshold, from &euro;5,675 inclusive of VAT to &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT.  This means that a homeowner incurring the minimum expenditure of &euro;5,000 will be entitled to relief of &euro;595.  The maximum relief remains &euro;4,050.</p><p>  Amendment No. 16 is a straightforward amendment.  Rather than the contractor having to provide to Revenue the name of the liable person for LPT purposes for the qualifying residence, the contract will simply have to provide the name of the claimant.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 17, 18, 20 and 21 are to reflect minor drafting points.</p><p>  Amendment No. 22 is a useful amendment which provides that a contractor must inform Revenue of the name of the individual who paid for the work carried out.  This will ensure that only those entitled to the relief will be in a position to claim it.</p><p>  Amendment No. 23 is a purely technical amendment arising from inclusion of a new subparagraph (<i>v</i>).  Amendment No. 25 is to reflect a minor drafting matter.</p><p>  Amendment No. 26 is an important amendment which ensures that the receipt of a grant, insurance or compensation payment is not taken into account in determining eligibility for the incentive.  Such payments will only be taken into account in determining the amount of relief to which an individual is entitled.</p><p>  Amendment No. 27 concerns LPT obligations.  This amendment extends the obligations such that a claimant will only be entitled to claim relief if his or her LPT obligations are up to date, not only in respect of the qualifying residence for which relief is being claimed but also in respect of any other residential property for which the claimant is a liable person within the meaning of the LPT legislation.</p><p>  Amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment.  The subsection, as drafted, only refers to reliefs under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  However, reliefs under the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act  2010 should also be included.</p><p>  I commend the amendments to the House.</p></speech>

Under the amendment, where the qualifying works require planning permission such planning must be granted by 31 December 2015.  I am curious as to why that is the case.  If I am carrying out works in a house, I can carry them out in February 2016 and still be deemed eligible but if I need planning permission to carry out those works, the planning must be granted before the end of the previous year even though the works would be completed within the time frame of 31 March 2016.

There are some small jobs for which planning permission is not required.  If planning permission is not required, work must be completed by the end of 2015.  If it is required, work can continue until the end of March 2016.</p><p>  Another clarification I made - in respect of which an amendment was not required - is that the &euro;5,000 minimum can comprise costs relating to different jobs.  In other words, if one painted one's house and landscaped one's garden to include a water feature - in a rural situation, this might require connection to a pump house - each job could be registered separately by electronic means and would be eligible.  The Revenue Commissioners have a role in adjudicating what is and is not contemplated and examining invoices in order to establish the value of the work and in the context of the timeframe.  That is because what is involved is costly and it becomes more costly as it proceeds.  It has been introduced as a temporary measure in order to stimulate the construction industry.  It is not to be availed of indefinitely and we want it to come to a close at the end of 2015.  However, a grace period is being provided up to 31 March 2016 in respect of the completion of and payment for work.</p></speech>

However, we will deal with that matter when we discuss the section.  In the context of what constitutes a qualifying residence, two criteria are laid down in the legislation, namely:<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) which is owned by the individual and which is occupied by the individual as his or her only or main residence, or<br />(<i>b</i>) which has previously been occupied as a residence and has been acquired by the individual for the purposes of occupation by the individual as his or her only or main residence on completion of the qualifying work and which is so occupied upon completion ...</blockquote>I wish to add two further subparagraphs to this provision, as detailed in the amendment.</p><p>  The Living City initiative was introduced by means of the Finance Act 2013 and has been expanded upon further in the Bill before us.  To say the least, it provides generous tax reliefs for refurbishing qualifying properties, which must, of course, be people's permanent places of residence.  I am of the view that the reliefs involved should not be extended to the Living City initiative, with which I have a number of issues.</p><p>  The main part of the amendment is that which relates to newly built properties.  Under the Bill, a property will be eligible if it is a place of residence which was previously occupied and which, following purchase, is renovated by its new owner who will then take up permanent residency.  The issue I have is that the provision is not made for people who want to buy residences that have never been occupied before and renovate them in order that they might take up residency.  The Minister may well ask why we should do this and what would be the pitfalls involved.  The danger is that houses that are half-finished and that are not residences could be purchased by individuals who will claim the tax relief in order to complete them.  Under my amendment, which is carefully worded, in order to qualify it would have to be a newly built property rather than one which is half-finished.</p><p>  I accept that taking account of individual cases does not make for good legislation, but I am aware of a person whose young daughter is wheelchair-bound and who has purchased a new property into which he intends to move with his family when the necessary renovations have been completed.  Those renovations involve adapting the house for wheelchair usage.  One could provide many examples of similar cases.  Under the section, as it stands, the individual in question would not be allowed to avail of the home renovation incentive because the property he is purchasing has never been previously occupied.  I have an issue with this aspect of the legislation and I want to amend it in order to make provision for people who purchase brand new properties which may need to be adapted for their use and which, upon completion of the relevant works, will be their permanent place of residence.</p></speech>

There are two elements to the definition of "qualifying residence".  The first is that the residence is owned by an individual and is occupied by the individual as his or her principal private residence.  The second is that it is a property which has previously been occupied as a residence.  Where such a property is acquired for the purposes of occupation by an individual as his or her principal private residence and is occupied on completion of qualifying work, it comes within the definition of a qualifying residence.</p><p>  The proposed amendment seeks, in the first instance, to bring newly built houses within the incentive.  There are a couple of points I will make in this regard.  First, the incentive is aimed at repair, renovation or improvement works.  The reason for this is to facilitate homeowners in carrying out such works to their homes, while at the same time acting as a stimulus to the construction industry.  In general, the only instance in which a newly built house would require works to be carried out would be in the fitting out of such a house to make it habitable.  Fitting out is an intrinsic and essential feature of building a new house.  Inclusion of that type of work under the incentive would in reality constitute deadweight and would not, in my view, provide added stimulus to the construction industry.</p><p>  The second part of the proposed amendment seeks to exclude from the home renovation incentive any residence which gets relief under the Living City initiative.  This matter is already covered by subsection (12), which stipulates that any expenditure on a residence which is covered by another tax relief is excluded from the terms of the home renovation incentive.  In such circumstances, I think we can agree that the Living City initiative is not an issue.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to a person - perhaps a neighbour or some other constituent - with a disabled child who wants to adapt a room in his house in order to make it suitable.</p></speech>

While fittings may be added to a house afterwards, certain disability specifications, including door sizes and bathroom designs, must be met regardless of who will occupy the house.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013112600006#E00300"><p>We would not have to walk far from this building to find many buildings that were not constructed in compliance with building regulations.  Unfortunately, such buildings are a scar on society.  We have recently seen the consequences of this practice.</p><p>  I understand the logic behind the restrictions.  For example, I acknowledged the reason for restricting the incentive to previously occupied houses.  It would be wrong if the scheme were used for carrying out works associated with unfinished or unfitted houses.  The case to which I referred is not an isolated one.  The only way the family in question would be eligible to avail of the incentive would be if they were to first move into the house first, as this would satisfy the criteria on residence.  However, they cannot move into the house because it is not suitable for their daughter's needs.  In such cases, families may need to have works, such as a wheelchair ramp to the front entrance, completed to make the house suitable for the person with a disability.  If the family were to move before such works had been completed, they would experience the discomfort of living in a house that had not been adapted to their needs.  On the other hand, a family that buys a second-hand house could continue to rent or reside in their current accommodation while the necessary works are carried out to make the house fit for a wheelchair-user or person with particular needs.</p><p>  The Minister indicated that the measure was targeted at homeowners.  The scheme provides for two categories - namely, homeowners and people who are purchasing new homes that they intend to use as their permanent residence.  My argument is that the provisions must satisfy individual needs.  Some people who are trading up or down or moving into a new area may wish to buy a new house that may not be suitable for them.  Such persons will only become eligible for this incentive if they move into the house before having the necessary works done.  </p><p>  Many of the empty houses that are on the market at low prices were previously occupied.  Anyone purchasing one of these homes would immediately rip out the fittings because the house may not have been occupied for the past ten, 12 or 15 years.  The Minister referred to deadweight.  It is impossible to design a scheme that addresses all the examples I have cited.  The scheme was not designed for persons who purchase a second-hand house and wish to repair a kitchen that is in poor condition.  We must recognise that not all second-hand homes do not have appropriate fittings.  Anyone buying such a house will immediately replace the fittings.  Disallowing the scheme for the category of persons I have highlighted is wrong.  One can change the wording.  My amendment refers to a newly built property.  It would be sensible to provide protection against potential exploitation of the measure.  For example, the Minister could give the Revenue Commissioners the power to prevent people from availing of the incentive where they install fittings that were not previously in the residence.</p><p>  The definition of a qualifying residence is flawed.  While I understand the Minister's argument, it excludes some people, especially persons with a disability who need to renovate a house.  We all know such individuals.  The Minister cited the example of a room which may require an <i>en suite</i> bathroom or a house which may require a shower at ground level.  It is wrong to disallow works to modify a shower for an elderly or infirm person in a newly built house while allowing its use for such works in a second-hand home.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</p></speech>

The category to which Deputy Doherty draws attention is new houses that require modification for one reason or another.  I want to avoid circumstances in which the owner of a new house uses this tax scheme to finish the house.  It is the job of the original builder to finish a house and sell it on in what one would consider to be a finished state.</p><p>  If the disabled person to which the Deputy refers was one of my constituents, I would point out that grants available for adapting houses for disability purposes would be of much greater benefit to the person than this scheme would be.  We have not excluded any particular category.  Grants are available for someone who buys a new house that needs to be adapted for a disabled relative or family member.  These grants fall outside the scheme before us.  That is the route that people in such circumstances should follow.  I will re-examine the section before Report Stage to ascertain whether any deserving categories of homeowner are being excluded as a result of the way in which the scheme has been designed.  As matters stand, however, I do not believe that is the case.  Significant grants are available to adapt houses for disability purposes.</p></speech>

It is a positive measure which I hope will encourage people to carry out refurbishment and so forth.  It may complement the pay-as-you-save installation programme about which there has been much discussion.  It could link in very well with that scheme and is a much better-conceived incentive than others that will be discussed later.  Sadly, I missed the discussion of a scheme provided for in section 2, which is misconceived as its beneficiaries could include people and large companies who are doing very well for themselves, rather than small builders, householders and so forth.  The JobsPlus scheme and similar schemes are highly problematic.  This, however, is a good thing.</p><p>  The job of the sub-committee is to scrutinise and consider legislation.  Deputy Doherty raised a valid point.  He described cases in which adaptations are required to houses that have not been occupied previously with a view to assisting a disabled person.  Another category of works also arises.  As the Minister is aware, the census found that there are 320,000 empty houses in the State.  Many of these will have lain empty for a long period before being purchased, whether from the National Asset Management Agency or someone else.  It is possible, therefore, that they will have deteriorated in various ways.</p></speech>

The social reasons are to provide extra accommodation or better facilities in the family home for those who need them.  The economic reason is to get people back to work.  The live register includes a cohort of 80,000 people with skills that are primarily related to the construction industry.  I do not believe all the retraining in the world will turn a lot of them into employees who are suitable for the IT or farming industries.  We have to do something about the construction sector.  That is the purpose of the measure.</p><p>  I have previously said that standing still and doing nothing are not solutions.  We have to try things out but we must also be focused and be able to measure the cost to other taxpayers of what we are doing.  By and large, what we are doing is proving successful.  Member may have seen the figures published by the CSO this morning, which indicate that 58,000 net jobs have been created between September 2012 and September 2013.  That is more than 1,000 jobs per week.  If we can keep that trend up, we will be getting there.  However, we must also examine the categories.  One of the categories comprises long-term unemployed people with building skills.</p><p>  As I have already said to Deputy Pearse Doherty, if there is a gap that excludes some deserving group from the benefits of the measure, we will examine it between now and Report Stage.   Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to an earlier provision in the section.  That is not the extension of a relief; it is a restriction on a relief that previously existed.  We are taking out reliefs that were misdirected, as well as providing reliefs that we think are better focused.  In regard to the Deputy's plea on empty houses, many of the people who purchase empty houses are getting them very cheaply.  They are already benefiting as a result of the recession.  In the part of the country with the highest tranche of empty houses per capita, the upper Shannon Basin, most of the houses were built with the benefit of a tax incentive.  We want to direct our focus where we can get the biggest social benefit and the highest economic activity.  I do not think applying the measure to empty houses and carrying out works that should have been part of the original construction is the way to proceed.  I am sympathetic to the case that Deputy Pearse Doherty made regarding special categories of people who need additional accommodation which may not be covered by disability grants.  I am prepared to consider the issue, although it is not yet evident to me that such a category exists.</p></speech>

The economics of supply and demand do not consider the morality of a situation.  If there are benefits to be gained from encouraging economic activity on the margins, it may be worth considering houses that have lain empty or even incomplete for a number of years.  It is preferable to complete them with contemporary economic forces and if it means that an incentive is required to erect hall doors and turn on the lights, it is probably a good idea.</p></speech>

He referred to the housing adaption grant, in which respect two issues arise.  The first is that it is means tested, with the result that the grant is not available to households with incomes in excess of &euro;65,000 regardless of whether the work involves a stair lift, a ramp or an additional room for a spouse or child.  The second issue is that the person for whom the grant is sought must be occupying the house as his or her normal place of residence.  This means the category of people to which I refer would not be eligible for the grant.  These people are not currently living in a house that is suitable for their needs and they want to purchase a new house with, for example, a stair lift or a ramp.  Such facilities are not provided in every newly built house.</p><p>  I take the Minister's point in regard to ensuring the measure is not used to fit out or finish houses but how does one define a newly built property?  In my head it is not just bricks and mortar; it is a property that is suitable for living in that has fixtures and fittings.  Revenue has to deem that the work qualifies and the contractor has to provide Revenue with a list of the works involved.  Revenue will, therefore, have sufficient tools at its disposal to see, for example, that a kitchen is being put into a house that never had one previously.  As it is not a replacement feature, it is not eligible.  However, a stair lift or a ramp may be involved, or else a room may need to be adapted to allow for a walk-in shower.  They may be few and far between but there is a category of people who should not be excluded from this scheme.  They can purchase a second-hand house and do all the work I have identified.  As the Chairman noted, if they purchase a new house it may have to abide by the standards in any case so that, for example, the switches would be lower and it would be possible to bring a wheelchair into the bathroom.  However, that may not be enough.  There may be requirements for a walk-in shower, a ramp or a stair lift.  The kitchen may need to be adapted so that people can access their presses.</p><p>  I will not press the amendment now because we can investigate further its wording to ensure the measure is not abused but I believe the section as it stands is not accommodating a certain category of people.</p></speech>

The Deputy will see how it is combined later in the Act.  Residual amounts after a certain allowance for the grant can be applied for tax credit purposes if they relate to the insulation of houses and the general area of grants sponsored by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></speech>

The Minister referenced multiple works earlier on, and I gave the example where somebody could employ a qualifying contractor to put in a stair lift and then have a different contractor to build the extension out the back, and have a plumber qualifying contractor to do the shower.  The total sum of all three pieces of work could be in excess of &euro;5,000, so the entirety would be eligible but each individual contract would be ineligible because it did not reach the threshold.  This allows for multiple contractors, instead of &quot;contractor&quot;.</p></speech>

The section is currently constructed so that in the two years after the year in which the work is done, the person will get the benefit of the tax credit.  Why is it necessary that no credit at all can be given in the year in which the work is done?  If there is a solid logistical or practical reason for that from a Revenue point of view, why does the benefit have to be spread out over the subsequent two years, as opposed to the single tax year in the year immediately following the year in which the work is done?  We need to make this as attractive as possible to encourage people to avail of it, so perhaps the Minister could give us the logic behind that.</p></speech>

This incentive represents a measured response to the significant downturn which has been experienced by the construction industry.   It is designed to stimulate increased activity in the sector and to boost employment.  The backdrop to the measure is the continued pressure on our national finances.  With this in mind, it was considered appropriate to spread the cost of the incentive over two years and that the initial cost would begin in 2015.  It is also important to bear in mind that the granting of the relief is by reference to payments actually made by homeowners to contractors.  It is simply not sufficient to say that works have been carried out.  The relief only applies where payments have been made.  Taking all of the above into account, I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</p><p>  If the credit is split over two years, the lower income individual is also brought into the scheme.  A person can have lower income tax liabilities in 2014 and 2015 and avail of the credit.</p></speech>

Therefore, a greater number of homeowners will be able to avail of the incentive which will stimulate increased activity in the construction industry.  I regret, however, that I cannot accept the suggested lower thresholds.  The incentive represents a measured response to the significant downturn experienced by the construction industry and the provision is designed to stimulate increased activity and boost employment in the sector.  The backdrop to the measure is the continued pressure on the national finances; therefore, I cannot agree to a further lowering of the minimum threshold.  I point out once more that one can aggregate work up to a value of &euro;5,000.  The argument has been made that many contractors involved in the black economy will not carry out work in excess of a value of &euro;5,000 and that, consequently, the provision will not counteract the black economy.  That is not true.  Let us look at the situations I described previously involving activities such as painting, landscaping work at the back of a house, getting in a plumber or installing new doors in a bedroom.  In aggregating the outlay is divided into small quantums of money, the kind of projects contractors who operate in the black economy are involved in.</p></speech>

He now proposes to reduce the threshold to &euro;5,000, inclusive of VAT.  One of the purposes of the scheme is to redirect activity away from the black economy to the mainstream economy.  Much of the work will be labour intensive.  If a significant element of the cost involves materials, the VAT issue will be of a different nature.  However, the Minister has set the bar high by setting the threshold at &euro;5,000, inclusive of VAT, for painting and landscape work.  When it comes to jobs involving windows, doors and other such items, many people will fall short of the figure.  I am curious to know how the Minister arrived at the figure of &euro;5,000.  Was it because administering a scheme involving lower sums would have been burdensome for Revenue?  What is the logic behind choosing the sum of &euro;5,000?  On the surface, it seems high for a lot of small jobs that people might think of doing around the house, particularly where there is a strong labour element involved.  In many cases, such work is done by contractors operating in the black economy.</p></speech>

In reality, he is allowing work on a house at a cost of &euro;1,500 to be eligible under the measure as long as work done by other contractors bring the value to over &euro;5,000.  That shows that he has moved in the right direction.  He has restricted the measure for a lot of people who simply do not have a lot of money available.  To enable them to stop the draught from whistling through the window on cold nights, they can only replace their windows by opting for the cheapest quote available.  They will have the work done for a sum nowhere near &euro;5,000.  If they have extra spare cash to have their house painted or the garden landscaped, all of the work will be eligible.  The only people who will be eligible are the ones who can afford to spend &euro;5,000 on renovations.  What about the poor creatures who do not have additional cash available?  They will not benefit from the tax rebate, which is wrong.  The scheme is overly burdensome and cumbersome.  Revenue will have to administer it and cater for individuals who spend &euro;500 on a job, as long as there are enough multiples of &euro;500 to bring the total value to &euro;5,000 simply because the Minister has allowed for work done by multiple contractors.  What about individuals who simply do not have &euro;5,000 available?  Many people do not have that amount of money and cannot afford the luxury of having their garden landscaped to have someone plant rose bushes or tidy their lawn.  All that they can consider is doing what needs to be done, what is leaking and draughty and getting as much done as possible for &euro;1,500, &euro;2,000 or &euro;4,000.  Under the proposed measure they will be ineligible.  However, a person who has an extra few bob around and puts another grand with it will be eligible.  That is unfair.</p></speech>

One must measure it on the basis of the additional quantums of work carried out; otherwise the scheme will fails.  It is not my intention to include routine maintenance works and repairs in the scheme as such works will be carried out in any event.  That is not the purpose of the scheme which I must measure against the additional quantums of work carried out to stimulate construction industry activity and provide employment.  One calls the plumber when one's electric shower goes wrong and when one cannot turn on the hot top.  If the plumber spends half a day working on it, it may cost &euro;550 or &euro;560.  It is not the intention of scheme to cover that expense because that is deemed to be normal repair and maintenance work in a house.  A reasonable or decent quantum of work that would fit the purposes of the schemeis what is required to stimulate activitiy and employment in the construction industry.  That is the purpose of the scheme.</p><p>  As we examined the measure and as I listened to the Second Stage debate, I said "Yes" to lowering the sum to &euro;5,000 which, when one adds VAT, becomes &euro;5,675 and then to adding a number of contractors.  I think the amendment meets the need identified.  Members may argue about the exact amounts, but we had to pick a value that would be significant enough to stimulate the building industry and provide employment.  I do not want to include what I regard as normal repair and maintenance works in the scheme because that is not its purpose.  One could argue for lower figures in using the black economy as an example.  In doing so one puts the black economy and the legitimate economy on the same line as if they were both reasonable choices for a householder.</p></speech>

People could claim the tax credit based on the limit of &euro;34,050 but some may not be able to afford to spend the full &euro;34,000 needed to do the work.  Can they divide the work over a three year period and claim the tax credit in the following two years for the individual items of work done in a specific year, up to a maximum-----</p></speech>

One can do all of the work in the 12 month tax year and aggregate the cost or do it over two tax years and make two separate applications but the maximum figure will apply at all times.  It is worth pointing out that if one wants to do a job worth &euro;50,000, the only restriction will be that one will get tax back only on expenditure of &euro;30,000, plus VAT.  There is nothing stopping a person from doing a more expensive job if he or she wants.  One will not build a big extension for &euro;30,000 at present, even though building costs have decreased substantially.  An extension to the side of the house, with a kitchen, utility room and bedroom overhead, costs &euro;65,000 or &euro;70,000.  This work will still be eligible, but the limit of &euro;30,000, plus VAT, will apply in respect of the tax credit.  One will not get the credit on the balance.</p></speech>

It is a question of their finding a mechanism to claim the tax credit, although they may be unable to afford all of the work in a given year.

The Minister has stated this is the purpose.  In so many instances people under pressure are not carrying out routine work because they are not sure whether they should spend the money.  If the scheme can tip them in favour of adopting the view that it is worthwhile employing somebody to do certain work, it is beneficial.  In my area builders, tradespeople and, in many cases, self-employed tradespeople are at their wit&rsquo;s end because there is no work forthcoming.  Hundreds of people are looking for the same work.  Any proposal that would increase the amount of work available for this large cohort of building workers and tradespeople would be very welcome; therefore, I do not see why the Minister makes a distinction in respect of what I accept is a good idea.  What is the problem with lowering the threshold so as to encompass smaller refurbishment projects and redevelopments?  I do not quite understand the Minister's comments on the black economy.  Surely, if he were to lower the threshold to include smaller refurbishment jobs and redevelopments, he would help to eliminate the black economy and encourage people to enter the legitimate economy.  It seems self-evident that this would be the case.</p></speech>

There is no point in giving tax breaks for work that is being carried out in any case.</p></speech>

There is a considerable number of small jobs being done.  People still paint their houses and refurbish their homes.  There is a lot less work being done than there used to be, but there is still work being done.  The tax break has to be paid for with someone else's taxes or the taxes paid by the beneficiaries in due course.  If the State is providing incentives and there is no additional activity in the construction industry owing to deadweight, it is wasting taxpayers' money.  The pitching of the threshold involves a judgment call.  It would be a waste of taxpayers' money to give tax incentives for small jobs that would be carried out in any case.  Socially, one could have a different argument, but, economically, it does not make sense to incentivise work that is being done in any case.  We must have additionality before we have extra jobs or activity in the building industry.  The way we have designed the scheme is pretty good.</p></speech>

In making his last argument he missed the point because of the scale of the black economy.  He spoke about quasi-criminal and illegal activity which obviously describe work done in the black economy, but it has been normalised for so many people.  They do not see it like the Minister; that is the reality, regardless of whether we like it in this Chamber.  The black economy is all around us and probably most dominant in the construction sector.  Does the Minister have any assessment of its size in respect of contractors as small as those in question?  There are 80,000 construction workers unemployed.  Some of those who are employed put some jobs through the books, while there are others who do jobs for cash in hand.</p><p>  This scheme forces those who may not be registered to register and it makes the claimant who wants to have work carried out the watchdog for the Revenue Commissioners.  This is because the claimant will not get relief if the construction worker is not registered or declaring his or her income to the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, the Minister's argument is flawed.</p></speech>

What the Minister said is disrespectful of my opinion and what I have stated at this committee.  I have brought forward genuine amendments, one of which - relating to multiple contractors - has already been accepted.  He brought forward an amendment in that regard himself.  I am arguing in favour of a reduction in the price and I also tabled an amendment which the Minister stated he would consider in the context of the category of people who would not be eligible as a result of their properties being new builds.  I did not say that every person in Donegal who has experience in construction is working in the black economy.  I actually stated the opposite.  Let us not get off on the wrong foot.</p></speech>

I deliberately phrased in that way in the event that someone such as the Minister might misrepresent me.  He acknowledged that one of the reasons for bringing forward the measure and allowing the involvement of multiple contractors is in order to deal with the black economy.  I pointed out that not reducing the threshold will allow for the black economy to remain in place.  The latter will result in a loss to the Revenue Commissioners because even though the jobs will be done, tax will not be paid in respect of them.  Reducing the deficit would allow citizens - who will want to avail of the tax incentive -  to act as the watchdog in respect of those small contractors who are not in compliance with Revenue.</p></speech>

We have stated in a non-partisan, non-political way that this is a positive measure.  There will be plenty of opportunities, in the context of the Bill before us, to criticise the Minister for things he has either done or not done.  We will certainly be voicing such criticism.  There will also be plenty of opportunities for him to engage in the cut-and-thrust of debate with members.  When an attempt is being made to be constructive and to engage with what we believe to be a positive measure, however, the Minister should respond in kind rather than making cheap political points or misrepresenting people in the context of what they have to say.</p><p>  There is a serious issue regarding where the threshold lies in the context of maximising the impact and benefit with regard to employment creation.  We must also consider the extra revenue which might accrue to the State if the threshold is pitched at the correct level.  I accept that if it is pitched too low, problems might arise.  I accept the Minister's argument in that regard.  However, there is another argument, namely, that a threshold of &euro;5,000 is too low.  I can think of quite a number of different jobs which could be done and which might lead to tradespeople gaining employment in the legitimate economy.  Such individuals might sometimes not take on such jobs because they do not believe them to be worthwhile or because the person getting the work done thinks that he or she can get it done a bit cheaper.  We all know this happens.  I do not believe that most people doing that want to do it.  In fact, I do not believe they want to do it at all but many of them - both tradespeople and those who might get works done to their homes - find themselves in a difficult position.</p></speech>

If someone were to spend a combined total of &euro;5,000 over three years, could he or she make a claim?  If the person concerned was to reach the threshold of &euro;5,000 by 2015, would he or she be entitled to the credit based on when the work was included and when the value reached &euro;5,000?  If he or she was to reach the threshold by 2015, he or she could submit the claim and obtain the credit in 2016 and 2017.  Perhaps that would be a practical way around this measure.  There must be stimulus measures.</p></speech>

It was never my intention to do so.  Of course, I listen to them.  It is because I listened to them on Second Stage that I have brought forward the amendments to reduce the threshold to &euro;5,000, inclusive of VAT, which gives a reduction in the threshold of &euro;675.  It is also because I listened to them that I brought forward the clarification on aggregation across a number of contractors up to a limit of &euro;5,000.</p><p>  What Deputy Kieran O'Donnell has suggested is already provided for in the section.  From the day we published the Finance Bill I made an announcement that works carried out from that Friday morning, three or four weeks ago, up to 31 March 2016 would be eligible and could be aggregated.  If one does a piece of work before Christmas, a piece next year, in 2015 and at the start of 2016 and if any planning permission required is obtained by the end of 2015, one can aggregate and receive the tax rebate.  Revenue is putting an arrangement in place whereby both the applicant and the contractor register electronically in order that there will be an accumulation of claims.  Once the value goes beyond the &euro;5,000 threshold, eligibility for the tax credit arises and Revenue will make the appropriate arrangements.  We have covered most of the Deputy's suggestions.</p></speech>

Subsection (3)(a) on page 10 reads, "Subject to the provisions of this section, where an individual (in this section referred to as &lsquo;the claimant&rsquo;), on making a claim [we will deal with the issue of is what a claim] in that behalf, proves that in a year of assessment...".  Will the Minister point out if there is a part in the legislation that allows for this?  I presume the year of assessment will be 2014 or 2015.  On making a claim, the claimant must prove that in the year of assessment "he or she has made a payment or payments to a qualifying contractor in respect of qualifying expenditure to which this section applies, the income tax to be charged on the claimant, other than in accordance with section 16(2), shall be reduced...".  It then states 50% next year.  What do the words "on making a claim" mean?</p><p>  Subsection (3)(d) on page 11 reads, "No claim shall be made under this section unless the payment, or where there is more than one payment the aggregate of those payments, in respect of qualifying expenditure made to a qualifying contractor exceeds &euro;5,675".  One cannot make a claim under subsection (3)(d) unless the qualifying expenditure or aggregate thereof exceeds &euro;5,000, but subsection (3)(a) states that on making the claim one must prove that in the year of assessment one has made a payment to the contractors.  It does not state it must be in the year of assessment.  If I pay &euro;2,000 to the plumber in 2015 and &euro;4,000 in 2014, in the year of assessment I will have paid only &euro;2,000 to the qualifying contractor.  Therefore, I will not be able to make a claim.  If that is the intention, there must be an amendment to this section.</p></speech>

The incentive applies to repairs, renovation or improvement works carried out on or after 25 October 2013 and up to 31 December 2015.  Payments made between 25 October 2013 and 31 December 2013 will be treated as if they were made in 2014.  There are transitional provisions which allow for work to be carried out between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2016 where planning permission is in place by 31 December 2015.  The relief is granted over the two year period following the year in which the work is paid for.  However, where the credit cannot be used in these two years owing to insufficient income tax, the relief may be carried forward to the following year and each subsequent year until the relief has been used up.  Not only can one aggregate, but if one has insufficient income tax to avail of the credit, one can carry it forward into subsequent years, but the work must be carried out within the designated period I have described.</p></speech>

If one spends &euro;3,000 in 2014 and &euro;3,000 in 2015 and makes the claim in 2015, under subsection (3)(d) one can make a claim only if the qualifying expenditure is &euro;5,000 as per the amendment.  One cannot make a claim before that date.  There is an issue in that regard.  Subsection (3)(a) must be amended to allow for aggregation.  It was news to me that aggregation was intended to be provided for.  It goes some way towards addressing the issue we had about the reduction by allowing for multiple contractors and aggregating over a two year period.  It is getting closer to my thoughts.</p></speech>

If someone were to spend &euro;2,500 in 2014 and a further &euro;3,000 in 2015, the scheme would be triggered in 2015, as the &euro;5,000 threshold would then be exceeded, at which point he or she could claim on the &euro;2,500 spent in 2014.

When we speak about the section, I will come back to the issue of the claim because there is still a problem with subsection (3)(<i>a</i>).  We could argue about whether it should be seven working days or ten working days, but a period of ten working days would give the contractor two weeks.  There is a bigger issue with the section and clarification would be helpful as to what would happen if the contractor did not comply with or fulfil the terms of this section of the legislation within the timeframe set down.  How would the claim stand?  Would it be void as a result of the law not being followed because this is part of the claims process?

Contractors will have 10 working days to dispute the payment claim, at which point the Revenue will process the claim, once legitimate receipts are provided.&quot;.</blockquote>The Minister has confirmed the expenditure would not be qualifying expenditure and, therefore, the claim would be void if the contractor, after being paid, did not contact the Revenue Commissioners with his or her name, tax registration number, VAT registration number, the unique reference number for the work, the amount of the payment, separately identifying the amount of value added tax, and the date of the payment and did not provide the individual with a statement showing the amount within ten days.  Is it the case the claim would not be eligible if this had not been complied with as set down in legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013112600013#M02800"><p>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  A number of issues arise.  The relationship between the homeowner and the contractor is important from the outset.  The first thing a homeowner must do before engaging a contractor is to ensure the contractor is tax compliant.  The homeowner should ask to see the building contractor&rsquo;s up-to-date notification of determination of relevant contracts tax, RCT, rate.  This must be 0% or 20% for the contractor to qualify to carry out work under the incentive.  Alternatively, an in date tax clearance certificate is also acceptable until such time as Revenue&rsquo;s new online system is in place.  If the contractor is not tax compliant, he or she is not eligible to operate under the incentive and any work carried out by him or her will not qualify.</p><p>  When a homeowner makes a payment to a contractor, the contractor is required to provide a receipt or a statement showing the amount of the payment.  The VAT amount must be identified separately.  It is important in building a relationship with a contractor there be a common understanding that for the homeowner to get relief, the contractor is required to notify Revenue of the works and the payment made by the homeowner.  When the Revenue electronic system comes onstream early next year, it will be possible for homeowners to track whether the contractor meets his or her obligations in terms of notifying Revenue of works and payments.  This should mean a situation where a homeowner would only become aware at the claim stage that a contractor had failed to meet his or her obligations would not arise.</p><p>  I should add that any failure by a contractor to meet his or her obligations is an offence subject to a fine of &euro;3,000.  Also, a failure to meet the obligations under the incentive could render the contractor in a position where he or she would not be tax compliant.  This would rule a contractor outside the terms of the incentive and, therefore, he or she would not be a qualifying contractor.  The net position is the contractor would be acting improperly and outside the terms of the scheme and subject to penalties but the claimant's claim would still be eligible, provided late notification was the only issue.  The onus is on the claimant to establish in the first instance that the contractor is tax compliant.  If the contractor was not tax compliant, the claim would be void.</p></speech>

Is the claim void on any occasion if the contractor does not comply with the terms of this section?  What happens if the contractor does not inform Revenue?</p></speech>

What happens if a contractor is tax compliant but did not submit the information within the timeframe?  What if the contractor does not provide the information to the Revenue?  I worked in the construction industry for several years.  Getting people to complete a snagging list is quite difficult.  The claim, which could be as much as &euro;4,000, could be at issue if the contractor has not provided the required information.  The contractor could have gone out of business or there could be several contractors with one compliant and another not.  This amendment proposes to penalise contractors who are at fault, not the claimant who may have everything in order.</p></speech>

The contractor would destroy his own business, as well as incurring penalties.  The claim is made once payment is made, not when the work is finished.  Once the Revenue has the electronic system up from early January, the householder can see at all times what the contractor is doing and not doing.  There is a protection in place to allow the householder access the information on the Internet to see if their contractor has registered.  Supposing for some reason a contractor does not register, then he is outside the terms of the scheme, has broken its rules and is liable for penalties.  I will get clarification from Revenue on what system is there to protect the rights of the householder making the tax claim.</p></speech>

All of us are aware of the compelling research showing that while long-term unemployment is not a binary state that begins directly after 12 months, it is associated with a range of socioeconomic problems.  As the Minister has already stated he will not accept the amendment, I will be brief and ask him to reconsider it on Report Stage.  Rather than waiting for someone to become long-term unemployed, it leaves a sufficient gap, of nine months, to prevent people from gaming the system by, for example, making themselves unemployed and waiting two or three months to avail of a tax credit for a new company.  If we are accepting the principle of introducing this measure at the 12 month stage, a case can be made to go a little further in order to prevent those concerned from going into long-term employment given what we know about the bad things that tend to happen at that point.</p></speech>

In regard to the amendment, I respect the Minister's desire to take special measures to deal with long-term unemployment but there is a problem with doing it this way.  Whether the period is 15, 12 or nine months, people who have just lost their jobs or have come out of education and do not want to be unemployed for any period of time are being told they will have to remain unemployed in order to benefit from this and similar schemes.  People think that is crazy.  It will end up pitting the long-term unemployed against those who have recently lost their jobs.

While this is the definition of long-term unemployment in the Social Welfare Acts, in practice a period of 12 months is generally applied.  To be in keeping with initiatives by the Department of Social Protection on activating the long-term unemployed, it is proposed to reduce the qualifying period for the scheme to 12 months of unemployment.  Individuals who are in receipt of partial capacity payments were not originally included on the list of individuals who would qualify for this scheme, although they can equally be long-term unemployed and can benefit from other activation measures.  It is, therefore, proposed to include individuals in receipt of this payment within the initiative.  Individuals who have been unemployed for a period of 12 months will be able to claim the relief.  Individuals who can qualify are those in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, the one-parent family payment and partial capacity payments.  Where an individual who would otherwise qualify attends a training course akin to a F&Aacute;S course, the period of training will also count towards his or her period of unemployment.</p><p>  I ask Deputy Doherty to repeat his question on credit contributions, as I did not quite grasp the point.</p></speech>

If one sees it in combination with what we discussed before the break, it makes sense.  If a carpenter is long-term unemployed and has a friend or a brother who has another skill in the building industry, rather than seeking work from another contractor, they can decide to set up as small contractors and do the work that is eligible for the tax credit.  One can see how that would work in a rural or urban community.  They do not have to incorporate.  They have the tools of the trade.  They would register with Revenue and then look for work.  As the tax relief is up to &euro;40,000 on income tax, they can earn up to &euro;40,000 in two consecutive years without having an income tax liability.  That might be a better route back for people with building skills rather than seeking employment from another contractor.  We will see how it works.  I envisage the two working in tandem.  That is not to say the home extension scheme is the only outlet, but it is an obvious one.</p></speech>

We have a serious long-term unemployed problem which the Minister is trying to address and it is a good initiative.  I can think of three reasons to reduce it further.  First, if we were to bring the period of eligibility to nine months, we would give more people this opportunity.  Second, if it works, as I hope it will, by reducing it to nine months, we will prevent people from becoming long-term unemployed.  Third, the longer a person is out of work the less chance he or s he has of successfully re-engaging in work, starting a new company or working for somebody else.  I am straying into opinion, but we know this from the figures.  It is not unreasonable to assume that one's potential to engage in entrepreneurial activity reduces the longer one is unemployed.  That is suggested by the data.</p><p>  In summary, the reasons for reducing the period of eligibility to nine months are that more people could avail of it; it would reduce the number of long-term unemployed by catching people before they fell into it and people at the margins would probably have a greater chance of success if we did not let them go the full 12 months.  Will the Minister consider it or is there a specific reason we should not go less than 12 months?</p></speech>

In practice, it regards somebody who has been unemployed for 12 months or longer as long-term unemployed.  Bringing it lower than this figure would be to move in advance of the Department of Social Protection.  I am not ideological in any of these matters but doing nothing is not an option when so many are long-term unemployed.  Therefore, we will try a series of initiatives.  If they work, they work; if not, we will drop them.  If this measure works well, I will consider the suggestion that the period be nine months.</p></speech>

It is also in line with the social welfare provision.  It might make sense that the proposal come into line when the social insurance period expires.</p></speech>

The 12 month eligibility period allows both claims to be made.  Bringing it down to nine months could make a person worse off.  There is always a problem in combining schemes.</p></speech>

There might be something very useful in offering someone the chance before he or she becomes long-term unemployed.  As I said, this morning's CSO figures are optimistic.  Some 58,000 net new jobs were created in the 12 months up to the end of September.  Some 4,000 of these jobs are in construction and 15,000 in the hospitality industry.  In targeting the construction industry in the budget the Minister was targeting the area most in need of assistance.

These amendments to section 7 give effect to the announcement I made on Second Stage that I intended to permit this credit to be claimed by persons other than the primary carer in certain circumstances.  Since the budget announcement of this change was made, I have listened carefully to the views of Deputies and I am bringing forward an amendment which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations where the primary carer relinquishes his or her entitlement to claim it.</p><p>  The single person child carer credit replaces the one-parent family credit from 1 January 2014.  It will operate differently from the one-parent family credit by being available in the first instance to the primary carer, the individual who cares for the child for the greater part of the year.  The one-parent family credit was available on the basis of the child residing with the claimant for part of the year, which led in certain cases to multiple claims in respect of the same child by different individuals.</p><p>  The main features of the amended section are that the primary carer is the individual with whom the child resides for the greater part of the year; and that the primary carer can be the child's parent or the individual in whose custody the child is and who maintains the child at his or her own expense for the greater part of the year.  This claimant is entitled to the credit in respect of that child.  If the primary carer relinquishes that credit, another person, the secondary carer, may claim it.  The child must reside with this individual for more than 100 days in aggregate in the year, which is indicative of a level of involvement in the care of the child which is supportive of the primary carer.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, we live in an imperfect world.  Relationships break down, whether inside or outside marriage, and sometimes children are involved.  It is no surprise this provision has attracted the most attention and criticism.  Any reasonable analysis of it would conclude that its effect is quite brutal and it will, whether by design or otherwise, disproportionately and negatively affect one particular social group, namely, single men who are parents.</p><p>  I am not here to fly the flag for fathers who are playing no tangible or practical role in the upbringing of their children.  It is anomalous that people in that category are currently availing of the credit and I have no difficulty with that loophole being closed off.  However, my main concern is that the children involved will end up paying because it will inevitably result in the father's financial situation being significantly disimproved, which may well result in less maintenance payments being made to the primary carer.  It may also mean his ability to take care of the children when they are in his care will be greatly diminished.  The children will ultimately pay for this measure.  The Minister does not need to be reminded that it is a breach of the programme for Government commitment that tax credits would not be, in any way, changed.  They are being changed here for one particular group.  </p><p>  The Minister's amendment No. 39 states that the credit can be transferred to the other parent where the primary claimant relinquishes it.  He might elaborate on how that would work in practice because very often relationships can break down quite acrimoniously and there may not be any, or very little, co-operation.  Does this require the primary claimant to make it clear to the Revenue Commissioners that he or she is prepared to relinquish the credit even if he or she has no requirement for the credit or cannot use it because he or she has no income tax liability to offset the credit against?  </p><p>  We need to stand back and take a second look at this.  For somebody on even the average industrial wage of approximately &euro;37,000 per year, the effect of losing the credit and the reduction in the band of approximately &euro;4,000 will hit him or her to the tune of &euro;2,500 per year.  I do not know of any other income category which will be hit by that amount of money as a result of budget 2014.  Will the Minister take another look at this and get an independent analysis done of both the economic impact on the people involved and the social impact on the children who will be affected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013112600017#R00300"><p>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this measure which is ill-thought out and will really hit a big cohort of families.  I am afraid the modern family is different from what families used to be.  That is just the way it is.  This is a discriminatory move against families that do not accord with what some people consider the so-called normal family set up.  Relationships break up but that does not mean the father or the mother who is not the primary carer of the children is somehow unlikely to play a full part in the rearing, maintenance and nurturing of their children.  I say that from a personal point of view because I am in that situation.  I am not the primary carer of my children but I can tell the Minister that I play a full part in their lives.  As it happens, I do not claim the credit because I was not aware of it until recently but other people who have spoken to me have told me what a huge hit this will be.</p><p>  Even some of the amendments trying to improve this measure or minimise the damage the initial proposal would do are also failing to get the point.  It is not about the number of days.  There are all sorts of circumstances.  For example, many people have had to leave this country for work but their kids may have had to stay here with their former partner.  They may not have wanted to do that but have to do so.  They may be contributing very substantially financially and use every opportunity they can to see their kids and may speak to them on the telephone every night.  They may not want to be in this position but they will potentially be hit by a measure like this.</p><p>  There are all sorts of other scenarios where it is not the number of days that indicate the role the non-primary carer parent might play in a child's upbringing, so it is simply unfair to hit them.</p></speech>

This is a wrong tax measure.  It is a tax on single fathers.  It is mean spirited, in my view.  There are other options available to the Minister.  It is estimated that 15,400 single fathers are availing of the tax credit.  The design of the original tax credit was flawed, of that there is no doubt.  I cannot justify it and I know Deputy Michael McGrath has suggested that it is not justifiable.  There is a spirit here to work with the Minister in trying to design a tax credit that is fair on single fathers and fair on their children.</p><p>  The Minister has acknowledged that there is a problem here through his own amendment regarding the secondary claimant and the 100 days aggregate condition.  We could argue about whether 100 days is excessive, but the Minister has acknowledged that the father - it is primarily fathers being targeted here - who cares for his child or children for an aggregate of 100 days should be able to claim this tax credit, if the primary carer forgoes it.  There is already a distinction being made as to who should and should not claim the credit and we could build on that during Report Stage, if the Minister was open to that.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, the provision sends out the wrong signals.  I welcome the Minister's move on the secondary claimant but I believe we must go a little further.  While it would not be to my satisfaction, at least it would be going in the right direction.  I would encourage the Minister to be open to considering this matter again on Report Stage.  The sum of &euro;2,490 is a lot of money for many single fathers to lose if this takes immediate effect.  I encourage the Minister to reconsider.  That said, I wish to address one or two issues raised by the Minister's own amendment.</p><p>  I suggest that the best way of trying to move this forward in a non-confrontational manner is to put in a commencement order.  Lots of items in Finance Bills can be the subject of commencement orders.  The housing section we dealt with earlier replaces the environmental tax credit which never took effect because it was the subject of a commencement order.  We should put in a commencement order for this provision, study it to determine the effect it will have on the parents concerned and try to come up with a better way of reshaping the original tax credit while also ensuring that fathers who care and provide for their children are not unduly burdened as a result of this Bill.</p><p>  In terms of the specifics of the amendment, subsection 462B.(1)(a)(iii) provides that a child who is 18 years of age or over will be deemed a qualifying child if he or she is receiving "full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment".  The section also deals with those who are in training for two years, but I wish to focus on the subsection dealing with school and college.  A child over 18 years is a qualifying child so a primary claimant can claim the tax credit on behalf of a daughter or son who is 19 or 20 years old, for example,  and who is attending UCD, Trinity College or DIT or other educational establishment on a full-time basis.  However, that is subject to the provision that the qualifying child is resident with the claimant for the "whole or greater part of the year".  Therefore, the mother must prove that the child resides with her for the greater part of the year of assessment.  Furthermore, subsection (8) states that for the purposes of this section, "a child shall be treated as resident with an individual for any day where the child so resides for the greater part of that day".  I come from Donegal and it takes me four hours to travel to Leinster House.  When people from Donegal go to college, they do not jump on a bus for Dublin and get dropped off at UCD or Trinity College.  They rent apartments and reside in those apartments for five out of every seven days.  Their mothers or fathers are their carers and the people who maintain them but they are residing in Dublin for five out of seven days for nine months of the year.  Under this section, as it stands, there is no way that a mother or father can prove that the child resides with them for the greater part of the year if that child is in college and living away from home.  The Minister's residency stipulation refers to where the child resides "for the greater part of that day".  This amendment will actually make every claim for the tax credit by the primary carer of a student who is living away from home invalid.  We have spoken already about the fact that the Minister is really hurting fathers who will not get the credit any more but the primary carer will not get it either if the child is in full-time third level education and living away from home.  Under the definition provided, neither parent could prove that the child is resident with them for the greater part of the year.</p></speech>

However, in terms of practicalities, there are situations, unfortunately, where the mother and father do not get on.  If the primary carer is not paying tax or cannot effectively use the tax credit in a tax year, a practical option might be to provide that after the end of the tax year, if the credit was not or could not be used by the primary carer, it could be availed of by the secondary carer without the need for agreement.  That would allow the primary carer to retain the credit for the tax year so that if he or she takes up work during the year, the credit is available.  If the primary carer is unwilling to relinquish the credit during the year, due to communications problems or other difficulties, then an independent assessment could be carried out at the end of the year to ensure that if the credit is not used by the primary carer, it can be transferred automatically to the secondary carer.  That would address the situation whereby one party, who could not use the tax credit, would not agree to its transfer to the other party.  Communications difficulties are a reality when relationships break down.</p><p>  I welcome the broad thrust of the amendment, particularly the subsection which allows for the tax credit to be relinquished.  The Minister might consider including a provision whereby an independent review could be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that the tax credit is availed of by one parent or the other.  That would address those situations where there are communications difficulties between both parties.</p></speech>

The point of the tax credit is to offset the cost of raising children for separated parents.  I propose three changes to make the credit work much better.  The first of these is amendment No. 40, which proposes to reduce the qualifying period from 100 to 50 days.  Greater care is needed in respect of children who are in college.  This goes to the point that Deputies Doherty and Boyd Barrett made about mothers and fathers being out of the country.  It is a matter of opinion whether the qualifying period should be 100 or 50 days.  The lower figure is reasonable for a person who resides with a child for ten full weeks in a year and works abroad or whatever for the rest of they year.  The requirement of 100 days in residence is excessive.</p><p>  The second change I propose relates to the permission required.  As Deputy O'Donnell noted, in the case of an acrimonious break-up where the main carer does not use the tax credit, he or she may, for whatever reason, refuse to relinquish the credit.  I propose a win-win scenario where such circumstances apply.  I would like couples to be able to use the tax credit as they see fit.  Not only should the person who is not living with the children be able to avail of the credit where it has not been used by the primary carer, but the value of the credit should be up to the full amount, even in cases where the primary carer is claiming it off a lower tax base and irrespective of whether he or she chooses to relinquish it.  The win-win scenario would be if we were to link this option to the payment of maintenance.  Some parents do not pay the amount of maintenance they should pay.  I ask the Minister to consider providing on Report Stage that the credit could be used without the permission of the main carer.  If, however, the secondary carer is not providing maintenance, a case could be made for refusing the credit. </p><p>  The third opportunity for improving the system relates to subsection (5), which provides that the credit applies to only one child.  If we return to principles on this, the point of tax deductible provisions is to offset the costs of raising a child for separated parents.  I have two children and the cost to my family is much higher than if we had one child.  There is obviously a link between the number of children one has and the costs involved, as we see in the case of child benefit.  I ask the Minister to review subsection (5) on the basis that having two or more children staying with one for 50 or 100 days is much more expensive than having one child staying with one.  Perhaps a case could be made for a phased tax deductible which may diminish as the number of children rises and would not only be for one child.</p></speech>

As Deputy Boyd Barrett noted, these issues include the definition of a family in the modern age and the entire debate surrounding families.  In debating this topic, we should be careful to provide a context for everything.  In making comparisons of families, one must bear in mind that married or cohabiting couples living together with children do not receive any tax credit for children under the tax code.</p><p>  I did not pull this proposal out of thin air.  I refer to the findings of the 2009 report of the Commission on Taxation on the one-parent tax credit.  As with all the commission's findings, it first describes the issue before providing a conclusion.  The description of the issue regarding the one-parent tax credit was as follows: <blockquote>A single parent, whether widowed, single, separated or divorced, with a dependent child or children may be entitled to receive the one-parent family tax credit...  The one-parent family tax credit, where due, is given in addition to the basic personal tax credit.  The tax credit can be claimed in full by each parent provided the child resides with the claimant for a whole or part of the year of claim.  This condition is deemed by the Revenue Commissioners to be fulfilled if a child resides with a parent for at least one night in the year. The relief was originally introduced to assist single and widowed parents who work outside the home and who have dependants.  The underlying purpose of the relief, therefore, is to support labour market participation of single parents with sufficient income to avail of the value of the credit.</blockquote>The purpose of this tax credit is not, as Deputy Donnelly stated, to alleviate the cost of rearing children.  It was envisaged as a labour activation measure to encourage participation in the labour market.  Part of the abuse or, if that word is too harsh, the way in which the credit operated in practice was that, arising from the Revenue's definition of one night residing, we had circumstances where three people were claiming the allowance.  If the grandmother was looking after the child for at least one night in the year - I do not wish to exaggerate the position as in practice the grandmother will often look after the child for one night a week - a third payment was made.  When one contrasts this with the position of the families to which I alluded who do not receive any tax credit for children, one can see where the problem arises.</p><p>  I refer to the conclusion of the Commission on Taxation's 2009 report on the issue of one-parent tax credit.  It states: <blockquote>We acknowledge that this tax relief plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents. We therefore recommend that the tax credit should continue. However, we also note that the annual cost of this relief is considerable. We recommend that Government should seek to minimise or eliminate the inefficiency (or deadweight element) associated with this relief in relation to the allocation of the full credit (and the additional standard band which applies as a result) to both parents. Such a move would help restore greater balance between the cost of the tax credit and the benefit derived from it.  Accordingly, we recommend that the credit be allocated to the principal carer only in accordance with the current arrangements for child benefit.</blockquote>The recommendation of the report, in paragraph 8.9, is the following: &quot;The one-parent family tax credit should continue and the credit should be allocated to the principal carer only and in a similar way to the current arrangements for child benefit.&quot;  This recommendation is reflected in my announcement on budget day and the measure included in the Finance Bill.</p><p>  Deputies argued on Second Stage that this measure would operate unfairly, particularly in circumstances where the primary carer did not have a taxable income and called for at least one tax credit to be paid.  I considered this argument to be reasonable.  Rather than having two or three tax credits payable, the purchase of the amendment is to ensure that, in normal circumstances between agreeable couples, one tax credit would apply to the value of what has been paid until now.  If, as in many circumstances, the woman partner of a separated couple is the beneficiary of child benefit and is consequently regarded as the primary carer but does not have a taxable income, her estranged partner may claim the tax credit in circumstances where he would be involved in the care of the child.</p><p>  While one could argue about the threshold of 100 days, as I noted, a day can be reckoned as a significant portion of a day.  If the husband takes the child overnight one day a week and returns the child the following afternoon, the period can be accounted as two days, thus giving more than 100 days in one year.  On the basis of that definition by the Revenue, the proposed approach appears reasonable. </p><p>  The measure does not contravene the programme for Government as there has been no change.  The commitment in the programme for Government was not to change tax rates, credits or bands.</p></speech>

In effect, without this amendment the section as published would have allowed only the reduced ceiling of &euro;500, applicable to children, for such students.  I am introducing an amendment of the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; which provides for the higher adult rate of relief to apply where the premium charged in respect of that student is not a reduced premium.</p><p>  As I advised during the Second Stage debate, I am bringing forward an amendment in regard to what constitutes a relevant contract.  This change will provide that tax relief will be available where an individual effects a policy in respect of any other person.  Previously this was restricted to an individual, their spouse or civil partner and any children or dependants of the individual, spouse or civil partner.</p></speech>

On budget day, the Minister characterised the change as one that would affect so-called gold-plated policies, but even he would acknowledge at this stage that this was not a fair characterisation.  The Department estimates that over 50% of policies will be affected by this change and the industry estimates a much higher percentage.  The final figure will emerge over time.  We know that increasing numbers of people are relinquishing their health insurance, although it is one of the last items of expenditure they are prepared to let go.  People are prepared to forfeit many other items from their lifestyle to maintain health insurance for as long as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013112600024#FF00200"><p>My budget day speech has been misquoted and misconstrued.  What I said about the measure was that this "will restrict the exposure of the Exchequer in relation to premiums paid for gold-plated medical insurance policies, while not affecting the majority of individuals who avail of more standard levels of medical cover".  That is what I said and that is where the big tax take is.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment is taking the level up from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 and from &euro;500 to &euro;750.  The effect of that would be roughly to halve the yield from about &euro;120 million down to about &euro;60 million, but the maximum saving for any individual that such a change would make is &euro;100 in one year.  While many policies are affected, a lot of them are marginally affected.  I heard figures being quoted in the D&aacute;il of &euro;800 to &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200, and different premiums were quoted, but the relief is at the standard rate of tax, which is 20%.  Therefore, if somebody's premium goes from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 for one adult,  then that is one fifth of &euro;200, which is &euro;40.</p><p>  The big imposition occurs only on the very high level of premium, and that is the point I was making on budget day.  If I was making the speech again, I would have made it clearer.  The justification of my decision is as follows.  About 45% of citizens have medical insurance, and the tax relief on medical insurance has risen year after year over the past four years, worth up to &euro;500 million.  All taxpayers, of which 55% do not get any benefit from this, contribute &euro;500 million so that 45% have access to private beds and private care in hospitals.  On equity grounds, that is not fair.</p><p>  The industry does not seem to be making any attempt to control costs.  Over the past four years, the cost of medical insurance has gone up by 86%.  Any consumer price index, even the medical consumer index, has not gone up by 86%.  That is an astronomical increase over four years, and the taxpayer is tied to the wagon because, as it goes up, we must contribute more.  I cannot justify, in very difficult times for taxpayers, continuing to allow the health insurance industry to dictate the amount of tax that is transferred from the generality of taxpayers to benefit those who have private health insurance.  That must be restricted.</p><p>  This is not just a hunch of my own.  The Commission on Taxation recommended this as well.  In 2009, the commission, in its recommendations, acknowledged that medical insurance is expensive and that medical insurance reliefs play a role in attracting and retaining individuals within the medical insurance system.  It went on to state there is a sizeable dead weight element as many individuals would pay these premiums in the absence of income tax relief.  In addition, the commission acknowledged that without medical insurance, it would be necessary for the State to provide treatment to more individuals through the public health system.  On that basis, the commission recommended that the relief from medical insurance should be continued, but on a more limited basis.  I followed the commission's advice, which is what I have done here.  If we take a premium of &euro;3,000 per adult and people are insuring for private hospitals and are paying &euro;6,000, then 20% of that is a sizeable amount of money.  For the generality of policies, which give people reasonably good cover, while there is a loss in the amount of extra income tax they will have to pay, it is marginal for many people.  On the grounds of equity and on the grounds of tax management, this is a good proposal.  I would be one of the last people to be accused of being motivated by left wing sentiment, but on the grounds of equity, this is fair.  I do not think people who will never be able to afford medical insurance should have a portion of their taxes used to provide very big relief to people on high premium insurance.  I do not think that is fair.</p><p>  The purchase of medical insurance is very inelastic, to use the economic term.  Even though the premiums have gone up by 86% over four years, the number insured has gone down by much less than one would expect.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the people who are dropping out of medical insurance are people who have lost their jobs rather than people who are not paying any more because it is getting more expensive.  In the interests of the taxpayer, that relief needs to be limited.  I do not think there will be a big fall off for this reason.  It is inelastic.  The consumer price index shows the cost of medical insurance increased by 86% between December 2008 and June 2012.  Health Insurance Authority figures show that the number of individuals covered by private medical insurance fell from 2.297 million to 2.13 million over the same period.  That is a reduction of 174,000 people, or 7.5%.  Following an 86% increase in the cost of health insurance, the numbers availing of health insurance reduced by 7.5%.  Again I would challenge the predictions that this measure will drive a lot of people out of health insurance.  The evidence does not suggest that at all.  I am not going to wear a situation where the medical insurance industry can expect the taxpayer to pay &euro;500 million per annum while they do not make an attempt to control costs.  I think the increases in medical insurance in recent years have been outrageous and the industry should control costs.  Looking at the progression of the tax contribution over the past four years, if we had not made change, by 2020 the taxpayer would be contributing &euro;1 billion to subsidise health insurance.  I cannot justify that.  I cannot stand over that.</p></speech>

He was correct to state that health insurance is quite inelastic. I would submit that the main reason is that people are afraid of relinquishing their health insurance because they hear the horror stories about the public health system, which works very well for many people.  In many cases people are afraid to rely on it, however, particularly if they have health needs or they must go for elective surgery and so on.</p></speech>

When one thinks of what people have gone through in the past five years with the loss of income, the loss of wealth and the loss of value of family homes it is pretty amazing that only 7.5% cancelled their private health insurance.</p><p>  One person&rsquo;s tax relief is another person&rsquo;s tax.  We lost the connection between tax and expenditure in this country and between tax reliefs for one group in the community and payment by another group.  I cannot see why an open cheque should be given to the insurance companies effectively to fill for the amount of tax to be transferred from the generality of tax payers to 45% of taxpayers, when 55% of general taxpayers do not benefit from this at all.  I do not think that is equitable.  This is a modest proposal to cap this so that it does not get totally out of hand and at the same time to give some relief to encourage people to maintain their health insurance and to encourage other people to take out health insurance.  The costs were becoming unsustainable.</p></speech>

It is moving sums.  The closest correlation is between being employed or unemployed for accessing private health insurance.

As the insurance sector decides to increase the cost of premiums what is the extent of the vulnerability?  I am not asking about where we are now based on the cost of premiums but, as the Minister rightly said, we do not decide how much tax we pay as a State, the insurance companies do because they can decide to increase the premiums and therefore the cost of the tax relief increases automatically.</p></speech>

They put up the premium as if there was no contribution, so the taxpayer paid &euro;200 of the &euro;1,000 premium on a 20% basis.  If &euro;800 goes to &euro;1,000 and the extra payment is 20% of &euro;200, that comes to &euro;40, which 5%.  That increases as the cost goes up.  As the tax relief is capped if somebody pays a premium of &euro;2,000 it would be 20% of &euro;1,000, if that is what the person was on.</p></speech>

Maybe I am not articulating this properly.  Certain adults are paying premiums of &euro;800 and &euro;200  for children but they are eligible for relief up to &euro;500 under this section.  What is the State&rsquo;s exposure if the insurance companies were to increase premiums?  I know that will not happen overnight but the Minister said that premiums have increased by 86% over five years, since 2008.  If they continue to rise to the point that children&rsquo;s premiums became on average &euro;500 and all adult premiums were in excess of &euro;1,000 what would be the State&rsquo;s exposure?</p></speech>

I am against a two-tier health system.  I do not think people should have to take out private health insurance so I am not particularly in favour of the principle of giving tax breaks to copper-fasten a two-tier system.

I note he has redrafted it by including this amendment which I agree is welcome.  However, the amendment to the budget day proposal is a retrograde step because, bizarrely, the proposal put forward on budget day, as drafted, would actually encourage more families to come into the system because they would earn the additional tax relief for children and it would have removed the pressure on the system as a whole. Some insurance cover is less than &euro;500 and in the case of some insurance policies, children are free.</p><p>  There seems to be a lack of understanding of the implications of these proposals on the health insurance market.  The Minister makes the point that 7% of people have cancelled their health insurance policies but that is not correct; there are 7.5% fewer people with private health insurance but the trends will show that while younger are leaving the system, older people are joining up for the first time.  That is the reason for the variation.  I agree with the principle that people with very high policies should be given a subvention.  However, the difficulty is that the average family will have to pay more, based on the reduction in the tax relief.  The Minister is attempting to give the impression that it is only &euro;40 or &euro;100, spread over the policy and that it will not be a significant amount of money.  The difficulty is that this is just one aspect of the increasing pressure on private health insurance.  The insurance levy will add additional charges.  It has doubled in the past three years and the cost of a public bed in a public hospital has increased by 60% in the past five years.</p><p>  It is very easy to see how the 86% of an increase in health insurance has come about when this upward pressure is noted.  The health insurers have been pleading for the ability to negotiate directly with public hospitals because the cost of procedures in private hospitals has come down significantly.  I raised with the Minister for Health the issue of comparing the price of carrying out a procedure in a public hospital compared to a private hospital - which can be stark in some cases - but the length of stay can be significantly different between those hospitals.  It is the case that sicker people go into the public hospital system because tertiary treatment and good ICU support is available.  However, it is not all justified by that issue.  There is not a clear understanding of the trends and pressures.</p><p>  Many families have sacrificed a lot of things to try to hold on to their health insurance.  It is the very last thing that many families will let go.  Quite a number of families have taken their children out of the health insurance system.  One in ten children have left the health insurance market in the past three to four years.  This shows the significant pressure on young families who are really trying to hold on to their health insurance.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to explain his point that 55% of taxpayers do not benefit from this relief.  Approximately 45% of the population have private health insurance - a far bigger cohort of taxpayers.  Many of those in receipt of medical cards are not paying tax.  I ask the Minister to clarify those figures because it does not seem to add up.  The Minister thinks the health insurance market will grow as employment grows.  This is a misnomer because the difficulty is that young people are not joining the private health insurance system.  Young families are leaving the system while younger people are not joining.</p></speech>

I have already stated that I was misquoted in that regard, the point I made being that gold-plated premia are the most costly policies on which to give tax credits simply because they are more expensive.  I never said the holders of such policies would be the only people affected by the budget change.  In fact, holders of more modest policies also will be affected, but in a much more limited way.  To give a typical budget example, Paul and Sin&eacute;ad are married with two children aged seven and nine and have a medical insurance premium with a gross cost of &euro;3,400 in 2013, before tax relief at source is applied.  Their cover breaks down as costing &euro;1,100 per adult and &euro;600 per child.  With tax relief at source of 20%, the cost is &euro;3,400 minus &euro;680, giving a cost in 2013 of &euro;2,720.  In 2014, the new cap on tax relief at source means they will get &euro;600 rather than &euro;680 back, giving a total cost next year of &euro;2,800.  It would be fairly average for a couple with two children to be paying &euro;3,400 for medical insurance.  One could argue that they might be under a great deal of pressure and cannot afford the additional &euro;80, but it will not bring the house down nor force them out of health insurance.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Naughten for his interesting and well researched contribution.  The point I made in regard to equity was that 45% of the community benefit from this relief while 55% do not.  Of course those 55% pay tax - not necessarily income tax but excise, VAT, universal social charge and other charges that arise under our multifaceted tax system.  In fact, sometimes people in that group pay proportionately more tax than do better-off people.  In other words, there is sometimes a transfer of tax from the poorest sectors of the community to the relatively well-off.  That happens for very good reasons.  The whole basis of justified tax breaks is to influence economic and social behaviour in a beneficial way.  One cannot otherwise justify a tax break.  If one is simply massaging people in order to win votes or trying to favour curry favour with one particular cohort in the community, then the tax break is not justified.</p><p>  What then is the justification for a tax break on medical insurance?  The answer is that it is there to encourage people to take out medical insurance.  However, if that tax break is excessively generous and is driving up costs, then it must be examined.  The information from the health insurance market report compiled by Millward Brown for the Health Insurance Authority included information on the answers people gave as to why they had let their private health insurance lapse.  By far the most common reason was cost, with more than four in ten of those surveyed citing it is as the reason.  The other main reasons were also based on economic decisions, such as the loss of a job, at 16%, and the discontinuation of cover by an employer, which accounted for 11% of lapsed policies.  No longer being covered by parents' insurance was also a significant factor, although that is more of a default option than one based on a proactive decision.  Nevertheless, it is another pointer to the factors influencing the decision to let one's private health insurance policy fall off.  In the year of the survey, the decline in the number stating their entitlement to a medical card as the reason for dropping their health insurance cover suggests it is being seen as less of a fall-back position for people.</p><p>  When one considers that there has been an 86% increase in the cost of health insurance but only a 7.5% decline in the incidence of insurance cover, one must conclude that it is a very inelastic product which does not respond to price very significantly.  When it comes then to seeing how one can make ends meet in a budget, the fact that the cost of the associated tax break has increased so rapidly over the years, such that a figure of &euro;500 million in 2013 would increase, if the system remains unchanged, to &euro;1 billion by 2020, it seems clear it is time to do something about it.  I do not accept that the change will have the dire consequences to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  There has been a great deal of talk to the effect that we will all be ruined and everybody will cancel their health insurance policies.  The evidence does not in any way point to that.  In fact, the effect on most ordinary policies is fairly marginal, as in the example I gave of a loss next year of &euro;80 on a premium of &euro;3,400.</p><p>  The State provides universal hospital care, subject to some co-payments for non-medical card holders, and private health insurance is, therefore, an optional extra within the system.  Of course there are pressures on health costs.  I am assuming, however, that everybody here is supportive of community rating.  If we simply price health insurance on the basis of risk, then elderly people and those with a history of illness will be deemed very high risk and, as such, will face enormous rises in premium costs.  The levy to which Deputies referred is charged so that community rating can continue.  Within the system, as organised in Ireland, the young and the healthy subsidise the old and the ill.  That is what it comes down to, without putting too fine an explanation on it, and it is why prices increase.  Health insurance is a very expensive commodity.  At the same time, however, insurance providers certainly could do more to control medical costs because it is they who pay the maintenance and medical bills.  I have seem some of those bills and they would make one wonder at the amounts being paid out for very short stays in private hospitals and minor surgical interventions.  The Deputies probably hear more about this issue than I do these days.  Having to spend so much time in Dublin means I am not behind my clinic desk as often as I used to be.  I am sure people are contacting Deputies about the hospital charges levied under their insurance policies.  The insurance companies have a case to answer in this regard.</p><p>  There are options for people to reduce the cost of their insurance.  The many hundreds of products on the market offer scope to switch to a slightly lower level of cover and thus offset the &euro;80 or &euro;100 being lost in tax relief under the new arrangement.  This particular provision is one of the areas in the budget which we can justify on social grounds and on grounds of equity.  Deputy Naughten argued that it will encourage people to let their policies lapse.  However, it was, in fact, one of the changes for which industry representatives argued strongly in their engagement with my officials.</p><p>  Regarding the uncertainty surrounding cover for students, the position is that some insurance providers treat students as adults while others treat them as children.  Without changing the internal policies of the providers, we will follow their practice.  In other words, if they treat students as adults, the cap of &euro;1,000 will apply, and if they treat them as children, the cap of &euro;500 will apply.  I introduced that particular amendment after taking advice from the industry.</p><p>  The second amendment in this section relates to situations where, for example, people wish to insure a parent who is residing with them.  Up to now, in such cases, one simply paid the adult premium.</p></speech>

However, one aspect of this matter relates to the amount of money the State pays on private health insurance and the fact that the full cost is still not being imposed in respect of private patients in public hospitals.  I do not have any opposition to people who have private health insurance.  I am of the view that people take out such insurance because they believe it to be in their best interests to do so and as a result of the fact that the public system is in chaos.  Deputy Boyd Barrett made a very valid point, namely, that it is going to get worse.  Under the new service plan, savings of &euro;666 million have to be made.  That will exacerbate people's fears about the health system.  It does not appear that the Government has a joined-up approach to this matter.  What is involved is saving money on the taxation side.  What the Minister for Health is doing involves cutting the health budget.  In the middle of it all are people who have been obliged to take out private health insurance because they believe the public system does not work.  Those individuals are being squeezed as a result of the imposition of higher premiums and additional measures.  The public sector is being squeezed by another Minister and chaos is the result.</p><p>  The Minister stated that tax reliefs are aimed at trying to deal with behavioural issues and to provide incentives.  When we wanted people to build hotels, nursing homes or houses in Leitrim, incentives were provided or measures to effect behavioural changes were introduced.  The provision in this section is designed to encourage people to take out private health insurance.  The measure is designed as a relief at source and I do not see how it will encourage people to take out such insurance.  As the Minister stated, one will approach one's insurance provider and check the position.  One will not see the tax relief the State pays.  If it were structured in a way which meant one would pay the full amount and receive a rebate, would this not be more effective in terms of encouraging behavioural change?  Has the Minister considered amending the provision?  I do not understand how it is going to change people's behaviour.  It will reduce the premiums but because the increases in the past five years have been so great, whatever benefit people receive from the State will represent only a small proportion of the overall cost involved.</p></speech>

I am of the view that this is an ideological matter.  That was highlighted by the Minister's statement to the effect that this is an expensive commodity.  That is the problem.  It is not a commodity nor should it be perceived as such.  Decent health services are very important and should be a right for people.  Such services involve providing for people when they are at their most vulnerable.  That is what we should aim towards.  I agree with the Minister's point about everybody being a taxpayer, although I hate that word.  People are human beings and citizens and they all pay taxes.  To a certain extent, they are paying towards the provision of private health insurance.  I accept that point.  The key aspect is that most people who take out private health insurance do so because they are of the view they must so as a result of the public system not functioning.</p><p>  If the Government genuinely wants to address this problem, the way to proceed is to strengthen the public system.  It is not doing so.  The Minister stated that what is being done involves trying to make it somewhat fairer.  If the other side of the equation involved building up the public system and making it something in which people could have confidence, there would be something to his argument.  The exact opposite is happening and the public system is being slaughtered.  If anything, people probably feel that if they could afford private health insurance, they would take it out.  At precisely the moment at which they may be contemplating going down that route, higher insurance premiums and the Minister's removal of the tax break have made it more difficult for them to do so.  We do not have hard evidence - neither, I suspect, does the Minister - about what will be the effect on the margins.  Working families are being hit for &euro;80 here, &euro;100 there and &euro;500 for the property tax, and all of these costs accumulate.  While the Minister, as he sits in the Department of Finance, might think that a certain measure might involve a small hit, in cumulative terms it might be the thing which tips someone over the edge.  In that context, the measure in this regard is unfair and wrong if it is not going to be accompanied by additional resources being invested in the public system.</p><p>  I wish to comment on the Government's commitment to move towards a system of universal health insurance.  Most people think that such a system would be available to everybody and would involve individuals paying for health services according to their means.  In terms of that longer-term project, it is incumbent on the Minister to put to the people the options with regard to whether - from a financial and every other point of view - this is the best way to deliver a health service for everybody.  It is also incumbent on him to put forward and cost the alternatives and indicate how well they would deliver health services.  Some of us believe the way to proceed fairly and deliver a universal health system would involve proceeding on the basis of the National Health Service model in Britain.  Such a system would be funded through progressive income taxation and not by means of a health insurance system that would allow private companies to cream money off the top.  The latter is the case in America, which spends more on health than any other country.  There are massive problems in the context of the lack of universality of health services for US citizens.</p></speech>

The last two contributions have been substantially about health policy in general rather than about the Finance Bill provision.  I do not believe I should be expected to reply to that.</p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty made a valid point that the incentive might be higher if people got a rebate.  The justification for the way it is done is that the purpose of the tax relief is to encourage people to take out health insurance by providing a subsidy.  I believe we can all agree with that.  Given the relief at source is no doubt the most efficient way to give the relief, it is costly to have to give the relief individually to claimants and, especially, if people who are ill have to claim, that is another liability.  </p><p>  There is also another issue, that of the way in which the insurance companies behave, which the members may not have noticed.  When they put the information up on their websites, they cost it without any reference to tax relief, but that has the advantage that people with no income tax liability still get their health insurance premium as if they had a tax liability.  In other words, their premium costs 20% less, even though they do not have a tax liability, and that is a benefit to less well off people.  When the health insurers are putting the information up on their websites, they should at least specify gross cost and net cost in order that people can note the tax relief and realise that there is a subsidy to encourage them to take out health insurance.  To disguise it is to pretend it does not exist.  It certainly diminishes the incentive, as Deputy Doherty rightly said, simply because many people are aware that the incentive is there.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten made a fair point also, namely, that there are other moving parts, both in health policy and in the course of the budget and in other decisions, that have been taken but despite all that one of the budget announcements was that children under the age of five will have free medical services in the community - free GP care - and that cost &euro;37 million.  There are still almost 2 million medical cards in circulation.  The health expenses relief is still there without a discount and it can be claimed at the standard rate of tax of 20%.  If the health expenses are for maintenance in a nursing home, the claim can be made at the marginal rather than at the standard rate of tax.  In addition to that, there is medical insurance relief and even though it is capped, it is still there and is of benefit to many people.  It is not all one-way traffic.  There are reliefs as well and new reliefs were included and other reliefs were maintained in the budget.  </p><p>  I am disappointed with Deputy Boyd Barrett's intervention.  I would have thought that he would have been cheering for this when we take into account the ideological position he usually takes up on matters such as this one.  It seems he is getting sucked into the system.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Minister for Health is supportive of this idea.  The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists supported the Minister for Health on this move.  This makes sense.  We cannot press the amendments as they have been ruled out of order because they impose a charge on the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to indicate the reason this proposal will not be allowed.  It would have the effect of reducing the number on waiting lists for orthopaedic and rheumatology services.  Therefore, it is an important proposal.  People who know that they need to go to a physiotherapist should not have to be referred by a GP.  It is health policy and, as I understand it, the Minister for Health is supportive of this idea of self-referral to a physiotherapist.  Why can it not be allowed for within the scope of this Bill?</p></speech>

It is the practice now of a Sunday evening after a match for the coach to tell everybody on the team to get physio the following day or before they come to training again.  We could not cope with that cost.  There would be no cost control on it.  A great number of people - as I said, whole teams -  could be claiming this.  I do not know what the cost would be but it would be quite large.  If a person is referred by his or her GP to a physiotherapist and gets a receipt for that treatment, that is a claimable expense and they will get tax relief at standard rate on that, the same as for any other medical expense.  We cannot have it open-ended where a whole range of healthy young people after playing a match of a Saturday or a Sunday go to their physiotherapist a few days later to get ready for the next match.  That is what would happen.  It is the practice now.</p></speech>

It is not as if people go for the craic.  They are not getting the full cost back.  They are only able to claim 20% of the cost.  I must watch my language.  No one would waste 80% of their money if they did not need the service.</p><p>  It is not just the physiotherapist involved.  A professional society is also involved.  One should not have to go to another profession.  We have spoken about trying to unclog the system.  It does not make sense to go to another health professional for a referral.  I understand what the Minister said about having to restrict access, but GPs are likely to refer people anyway.  The only difference is that it will cost an extra &euro;45.</p><p>  Three members of my family were sick this week, including me.  It cost &euro;120 to visit the doctor.  People are making different choices.  They are asking how sick they are and whether they need to go to the doctor.  If they have to go to the GP first, it will cost &euro;40, and if they have to go to a physiotherapist, even if they get the 20% rebate, it will cost an additional amount.  That is making people take decisions that result in them becoming more unwell.  Their problems build up and it will cost the State more at a later stage.  I would like to see the statistical evidence.  A total of 2 million are able to get the referral.  Is it the case that we do not trust physiotherapists on the basis that they will just treat every Tom, Dick and Harry who walks through their door and charge them but GPs will be trusted because they will charge people between &euro;40 and &euro;60?</p></speech>

If self-referral for physiotherapy were allowed, an estimate of the additional cost to the Exchequer would be unquantifiable, but it would undoubtedly increase the overall cost of the relief.   In addition, the amendments tabled by the Deputies, if passed, would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to qualify similarly for relief, which could greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the control and cost arguments, allowing for these amendments could inevitably lead to self-diagnosis of ailments which could be detrimental for patients where such diagnosis proves incorrect and he or she subsequently embarks on the wrong course of treatment in the absence of the correct medical advice.</p><p>  Two issues arise: cost and cost control.  I do not know what the cost will turn out to be but I know there is no cost control on it.</p></speech>

It is part of the policy to move manufacturing in Ireland up the food chain to have a more highly skilled base to the manufacturing industry.  By and large, if a manufacturing plant has a research and development unit attached, it is moving up the food chain, as they say.  We allowed an employer to assign 10% of the tax break available for research and development purposes to a significant employee.  We are raising that to 15% this year.  That is the bones of the provision.</p><p>  The Finance Act 2012 introduced a provision that allows a company with an entitlement to the research and development tax credit to surrender some or all of the tax credit to an employee who meets the definition &ldquo;key employee&rdquo;.  This allows the employee to reduce his or her income tax liability subject to a minimum rate of 23% applying in addition to universal social charge and PRSI.</p> <p> This section makes a number of amendments to the so-called key employee provisions, most of which are technical in nature.  The amendment in respect of paragraph (f) is the main substantive amendment.  It operates in conjunction with section 21 of this Bill and together they provide that where a credit has incorrectly been surrendered by a company to an employee, the sum involved will be clawed back from the company rather than from the employee.</p><p> The review of the research and development tax credit, which was published on budget day, identified that the potential for a claw-back from the employee was acting as a barrier to take-up of the scheme.  The amendment recognises that it is the company that has control over the claiming of the research and development tax credit in the first instance and for surrendering it to the employee.

We found there was a barrier in that respect because if it was mistakenly applied, the employee had to repay rather than the company while the company has full control of the assignment.  This amendment is to make it clear that it is the company that has the liability for any claw-back that occurs if it is misappropriately applied to a key employee.  The change announced on budget day as part of the research and development tax credits was that the 10% increases to 15% in terms of the amount of the tax relief the company can reallocate to key employees.</p></speech>

However, this is the third Finance Bill in which we have amended this key employee tax credit for companies to be able to use the research and development credit and provide it to a key employee to write down their tax liability.  This is the third year we have brought forward measures to assist this cohort of individuals.  How many are availing of it this year and what is the effect on jobs as a result of it?  Would there have been an effect anyway?</p></speech>

The reason we are coming back to it again is that last year the Deputy will recall I announced a review of the research and development tax credit.  It was published on budget day and it identified that the potential for a claw-back from the employee was acting as a barrier to take-up of the scheme.  Furthermore, the independent survey identified that despite more than 70% of companies being positively disposed to this provision, only a small number - seven - who responded to the survey have availed of this provision.  Based on a review of corporate tax returns filed to date in respect of 2012, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the returns indicate that credit has been surrendered by seven key employees.</p><p>  This amendment recognises that, generally, an employee will not be aware of or involved with the claim of the research and development tax credit and therefore should not be held responsible for an incorrect claim of this nature or subject to any penalties.  Instead, the changes being made in section 21 of the Bill will ensure that the tax foregone will be reclaimed from the company, which will be subject to penalties in the event of a deliberately false claim.</p><p>  To address situations where an employee may have had a degree of control over his or her entitlement to qualify for a credit, the existing Revenue powers under self-assessment rules can still be used to reclaim credit given to an employee in such circumstances.</p><p>  The bottom line is that this is a modest measure with no cost to the Exchequer.  It removes a barrier that was preventing people from accessing the key employee relief.  Given that there is no additional cost to the Exchequer, it does not make sense to wait a further year when we can help companies now.  We are talking about people who are inventive.  They are the kind of people whose research leads to the patenting of new products or new ways of doing things.  By its nature, therefore, it applies only to a very small select group of people.</p></speech>

The restriction is in place for a reason and I would like to see an analysis of how it is working, after various restrictions have been lifted, and also to hear the rationale other than that it is all about creating jobs and investment.  There is a reason for the high earners' restriction and when we lift measures from it, even with good intention and motivation, it weakens the restriction.  I am suggesting, through this amendment, that we review this within one month of the passage of the Act to examine the effect of the exemptions on the restrictions so far and the effect of the temporary removal of this restriction for a three-year period.</p></speech>

The additional 11% was never subject to the restriction.</p><p>  This amendment temporarily removes the initial 30% relief for a period of three years.  After that time it will be examined to see if it has achieved the desired effect of increasing investments in Irish SMEs and the subsequent job creation that would follow.</p><p>  Section 16 also provides for the inclusion of capital allowances on plant and machinery where those allowances are being claimed by passive investors.  If section 16 were to be deleted, the potential for individuals to shelter income by investing in plant and machinery would remain.

However, that is not its intention, which is to have a review.  Consequently, I do not understand the reason this would be the effect of accepting it and it is not its intention.  A three-year period is a long time.  If one waits for three years and allows these individuals, who are higher earners subject to this restriction, to be exempt therefrom if they invest in this way, one will not know how meaningful this will be.  Members have just dealt with the section in the Bill pertaining to the research and development tax credit for key employees and while they have had three years of dealing with this section, there are still only seven individuals who avail of it.  That is not the fault of the Minister, of me or of anyone else, but is due to whatever way the provision is written or in whatever way companies are structured.</p><p>  However, the opposite might occur, in that there could be a flood of investment from high earners who normally would be restricted from reducing their income tax liability to the State as a result of the high earners' restriction.  The restriction was put in place as a result of considerable public pressure on the ability of high earners to reduce their tax liability to a very low base.  The public demands that everyone pays his or her fair share, particularly those who are in the highest earner category and that such people do not use tax reliefs to write down their tax liability.  These are investments and it is not as though they are charities or that those concerned are giving away their money.  They are getting a return on the back of it, despite the possibility that it is risky.  However, this provision is both an incentive for them to invest and get a return and an opportunity to reduce their tax liability.  Consequently, although members do not know, it is possible that in three years' time, a huge amount of money could have gone in this direction.  A huge amount of tax could have been foregone to the State and I suggest the Minister should build in a review.  Even if that did not involve formally asking a consultant to carry out a review, one could track the numbers of people who have availed of this provision after the next tax year and then reassess it before members return to deal with the finance Bill for 2015.</p></speech>

However, I am against it, which puts to bed the Minister's idea that I have been corrupted and do not wish to say things that are unpopular in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, because lots of high earners live there.  However, they should not get exemptions from this high earners' restriction.  Regardless of whether they live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or anywhere else, high earners do not pay enough taxes as matters stand and should not be given more tax breaks.  I do not accept there is a need to give such people more tax breaks to get investment going.  There are other ways in which to do this and one should not be obliged to give more tax breaks to those who already have a lot to convince them to do some good for society and the economy.  I do not accept the rationale behind it.</p><p>  While the Minister might not agree with me in this regard, the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty proposes there at least should be a proper analysis of the measure.  It could easily be the case - I suspect it probably will - that some higher earners will benefit from it but that it will not have any great benefit for the economy.  Consequently, while I disagree with the entire principle, if the Minister is putting forward this proposal as a measure to encourage investment, he at least should be able to put forward some evidence that it will produce a positive economic effect.  Otherwise, it is simply another tax break for the rich and we have had enough of those.  We need some relief for the ordinary people who are being hammered and not more tax breaks for the rich.</p></speech>

The first item amends item 47A of Schedule 25B to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for the temporary removal of the employment and investment incentive from the high earners' restriction.  The restriction ensures that a minimum rates of tax is paid by high income individuals by limiting the amount of tax relief that can be claimed in any one year.  The employment and investment incentive provides tax relief for investments in small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in recognition that such investments are risky.  As a temporary stimulus measure, amounts subscribed for shares under the employment and investment incentive between budget day 2013 and January 2017 will not be subject to the high earners' restriction.  At the end of this period, a review will be undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of the measure.  At that point, a decision will be taken on whether these investments should return to being subject to the high earners' restriction or whether they should continue to be excluded.</p><p>  Both Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pearse Doherty have argued in the D&aacute;il in the course of other debates that there is a dearth of credit to SMEs and that the banks are not providing sufficient credit.  I believe the Deputies agree with me that alternative credit to bank credit for SMEs should be explored.  While the old business expansion scheme was in place, high earners invested in risky investments in SMEs and this employment and investment incentive is the replacement for the business expansion scheme.  I am attempting to encourage people of high net worth to invest in risky investments in SMEs in order that an alternative to the bank credits, which quite frequently is not available, will be available for SMEs.  In addition, there is a cap of &euro;150,000 on the investment in this regard.  Consequently, it is not the case that people can put in astronomical amounts of money, as there is a restriction it.  I believe it is worth finding out whether this will provide equity to SMEs.  Many SMEs now are accessing credit and bank credit but because of the crisis, they have very little equity and because of the way in which property values have gone, the equity base they had in respect of property is now negative.  If they could build up equity, it would help the SME sector.  These are the economic reasons for doing it and the risk is limited because of the cap on individual investors of &euro;150,000 and then there will be the review after three years.  If I, or whoever is here in three years' time, finds it is not working, is being abused in any way or is not stimulating equity investment in SMEs, then I assure Deputies it will be taken out of the code again.</p><p>  The second item deals with Deputy Doherty's point.  The Deputy's amendment would, as a consequence, delete section 16 but there is a second amendment in that section that deals with capital allowances on plant and machinery, which is leased to a manufacturing trade by an individual as part of his or her leasing trade.  This currently is not one of the reliefs that are subject to higher earners' restrictions.  The amendment provides that where those allowances are being claimed by passive investors, then there will be a specified relief for the purpose of the high earners' restriction.  Active traders will be unaffected.  This is an anti-avoidance measure to prevent passive investors from using the relief in a manner for which it was not intended.  The point I was making in reply to Deputy Doherty was that because his amendment implies the deletion of section 16, the anti-avoidance measure also would be deleted, which neither I nor the Deputy wants.</p></speech>

However, there is no point in arguing about this.  It does not call for the deletion of any lines but simply proposes the insertion of additional lines to provide for the review of the measure.  I revert to the original point about the three-year period being far too long.  This measure should be reviewed before three years elapse.  I presume that a review of some sort on this measure will be done next year in any event.</p></speech>

It harks back to the sort of practices that got us into the mess that we are in.  It is a worrying trend that in the past few budgets new versions of so-called tax incentive measures, which led us into the mess that we are in, are starting to reappear in the form of tax breaks in the areas property and share-trading, derivatives, etc., for wealthy investors and individuals because we need to provide them with a so-called incentive.  I do not buy it.  It smacks of not learning lessons.  In so far as the people get to know about these matters, it infuriates them that when they are getting hammered we are talking about having to give tax breaks - so-called incentives - to the wealthy.  There is no evidence that it works.  It only adds to the suite of measures from which high-powered accountants, who are employed by wealthy investors, can pick to minimise the amount of tax their clients have to pay.</p><p>  I accept that small businesses needs credit, although mostly they need demand.  The best place to look to provide credit is not by giving further tax breaks to wealth investors.  Overall, we lose.  We simply redistribute wealth or say that the cost of economic growth and development is that the rich must get richer and that the gap between the haves and the have nots must grow.  That is dangerous for the economy.</p><p>  It is not only that it is unjust, although we can put it those moral terms.  If one were to ask what is the fundamental problem with this economy, the European economy and the global economy, it is that there is too much money sloshing around in private hands and the rest of us are held hostage by those wealthy individuals and wealthy corporations.  We must do something about it, that is, implement an old-fashioned idea called redistribution of wealth.</p><p>  This is going in the wrong direction.  It is a small measure but I do not accept it.  It is not the way to help small and medium-sized businesses.  We could do that by starting to stimulate demand in the economy.</p></speech>

It is important that we constantly keep tax breaks under review.  Tax breaks which are designed to influence particular social or economic behaviour often do not have the incentive value as time goes by and when circumstances change.  While a tax break might be valid for a year or two, it may lose its validity as time goes by.  I agree with the general principle.</p><p>  I practice that principle as well.</p></speech>

In the budget documentation released at the time, the Minister estimated that the measure would bring in approximately &euro;200 million over a three-year period.  He pencilled in &euro;100 million for 2013.  I understand the figure fell well short of that.  The last figure I saw, pertaining to the end of June, indicated approximately &euro;10 million extra had been brought in.  The Minister might give us the up-to-date position on that.<br /> The purpose of my amendment is to try to stimulate debate and ascertain the Minister's current position on widening the scope of early access to pension contributions, in particular for those who have experienced some shock in their lives, be it through an unexpected redundancy, critical illness or debt problems, or those seeking to buy a home for the first time.  The scope of the Minister's initiative last year, while welcome, was very limited.  Could the Minister give us an update and outline the level of activity and draw-down?  With that knowledge, we might be able to move on to the wider issue of broadening the scope.</p></speech>

There is a little bit more than tidying up to be done but I do not expect it to change the drawdown very much.</p><p>  The section also amends AVC access provision legislated for in the Finance Bill 2013 to address concerns that the existing override arrangements contained in the legislation may not give pension scheme trustees and PRSA administrators sufficient scope to allow such withdrawals where a trust scheme&rsquo;s rules or a PRSA&rsquo;s contract terms prohibit them.  The amendment specifically provides that the AVC option may be exercised by an individual, notwithstanding the rules of the retirement benefit scheme or the terms of the PRSA contract concerned.  The change applies to options exercised on or after 27 March 2013.  It is a tweaking to deal with a difficulty that was brought to my attention.</p><p>  The figure in question is over &euro;100 million but it is hard to predict.  As economic circumstances improve, people will be less inclined to drawdown AVCs and more inclined to make provision for their pensions.  There are pluses and minuses to budgetary measures.  We still believe we will end up the year with the tax take we predicted.</p></speech>

Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against this legislation because the Government has failed consistently to undertake independent assessments on its two budgets&rsquo; impacts on people&rsquo;s incomes or on groups already disadvantaged.  This is all about having an evidence-based attempt to understand the distributional and equality impact of the Government&rsquo;s policy on real people.</p><p>  During the debate on our legislation, it was suggested the Government was committed to equality budgeting.  I recall on the Finance Bill 2013, the Minister claimed it was more a task for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but I believe it is a job for both.  Measures dealing with single fathers, private health insurance, for example, would be part of the assessment.  While I know the Minister will not budge on this, the Government did give a commitment that it was in favour of introducing some type of equality budgeting.  I believe we will be forced to do it anyway by Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013112600036#SS00200"><p>I recall Deputy Doherty proposing this amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill earlier this year.  His colleague, Senator Reilly, raised it as a Seanad recommendation.  I recall also that we had a long and interesting discussion on this issue on the last occasion.   Fundamentally, my position remains unchanged and I do not believe there is a great deal of difference in principle between us.  Analysis can play a very important part.  It should not, however, be applied to everything, particularly in instances where we do not deem it necessary.  If the cost in terms of time and resources is totally disproportionate to the yield from the analysis, we do not do it.</p><p>  This Government has carried out more economic impact assessments in respect of tax proposals than any other.  Of course, there is also a concept in politics and public administration which is generally summed by the phrase, "the paralysis of analysis".  We do not want to get into that situation.  The Government must govern.  We can look at things all our lives but there is a principle of proportionality.  The level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate not only with the scale of expenditure involved but the scale of resources available, not least the demands already placed on those resources in the preparation of budgets and finance Bills.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  We do review budgetary measures periodically.  We had a full review of the research and development tax measures, the film industry incentives and the building and development tax incentives.  In this budget, I announced a full review of all those tax incentives for farming and the agriculture sector so we have reviews.</p><p>  The ESRI does a lot of very good work, which we very much appreciate, but its model does not take all budgetary decisions into account.  It gives a partial analysis of the budget and people taking the ESRI model attribute too much to it.  The Deputy is probably aware that the programme for Government contains a commitment to require all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions.  Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on equality and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in memoranda to Government.  Consequently, the Government does consider each of those important issues at an individual policy or programme level.  Furthermore, I remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies take the provisions of equality legislation into account in the development and delivery of policies and services.  </p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that distributional analysis of taxation measures is performed based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners.  These categories include single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children.  A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI tax benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various taxation options.  Illustrative examples continue to be included in the budget documents.  </p><p>  In future, as part of our annual budget, Ireland will submit a draft budgetary plan to the Commission no later than 15 October.  This is a requirement of Regulation (EU) No 473/2013, which specifies that all euro area member states not in a macro-economic adjustment programme will be required to submit this plan.  As part of the materials supplied, Article 6(3)(d) requires that, where possible, indications on the expected distributional impact of the main expenditure and revenue measures should be included.  This distributional analysis will be conducted using the SWITCH model, as has been the case in previous budgets.  Information contained in the draft budgetary plan sent to the Commission will also be included and the budget booklets will be distributed to Members of the Oireachtas.  As the Deputy said, European policy is moving in the direction he advocates and we will be moving in that direction as well and submitting some of the elements he is requesting in his amendment in our submission to Brussels before the 2015 budget not later than 15 October 2014.  </p><p>  Last Friday, we had the first meeting in Brussels on the new arrangements.  We were not included in the review because we are still a programme country but 13 states were included.  Only two of them got a completely clean bill of health on what they submitted.  There will be some post-programme supervision of Ireland but it will generally be the same as that which applies to all members of the eurozone.  The movement is in the direction advocated by the Deputy.  I do not have a big difference of opinion in principle with what he is saying.  My difference of opinion relates to issues like cost-effectiveness and taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  It relates to whether we can get the information without a major cost-benefit analysis and some of this is readily available both from Revenue and the ESRI.  </p></speech>

We have been harping on about equality budgeting for a long time and there is a very good campaign group in terms of equality budgeting which has spearheaded a community campaign which has been endorsed by many different progressive groups.  It is sad that Europe is forcing us to do this.  What Europe is doing in terms of policy is a good thing in terms of getting us to look at the distributional impact of tax increases and expenditure cuts.  We will have to do it.  Now we are outside the programme, we will have to do it next year and Members will get it in the booklet as a result of that.  To me, that is sad because we are sitting in the Irish Parliament.  Great initiatives come from Europe and it is good that it is at least making this Government do this but we should be asking what we need for our particular circumstances.</p><p>  The Minister says this will be very burdensome.  We believe in the concept of equality budgeting and think it important, proper and right that society has a view of who is carrying most of the weight and whether it will impact disproportionately on one section, gender or social class over another but the question is how we do that in a cost-efficient way without taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  That is not what the Minister is offering.  He is saying that Europe is telling us to do it so we will do whatever Europe does and if Europe tells us to do what he wants us to do, we will do that as well and Members will get the information.  That is sad.  There are other countries in Europe that carry out independent equality budgeting, some more effectively than others.  As I explained to the Minister previously, certain departments in Northern Ireland send their budgets for equality proofing independently so it is not as if we are re-inventing the wheel.  There is a way of doing this.  It is disappointing, particularly in the spirit of the Labour Party which said it and this Government are committed to it.</p><p>  Perhaps the European programme will be very good and perhaps we will all be delighted at the amount of equality budgeting we will have when we see the details of it.  I do not think so.  I believe we should figure out what we need to do to best make informed decisions for this State as we bring in finance Bill after finance Bill.  The Minister will not be sitting in that chair forever and a day.  It might be some other Minister for Finance but we should put down a marker here.</p></speech>

I am joined by the authority&rsquo;s head of communications and stakeholder engagement, Mr. Marty Whelan.</p><p>  HIQA operates as an independent authority reporting to the Minister for Health and to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, pursuant to the Health Act 2007 and other Acts of the Oireachtas.  My objectives for the first three years of my tenure as its chairman are set out in HIQA&rsquo;s corporate plan 2013&ndash;2015, which was approved by the Minister for Health on 12 September 2013 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand that copies of the corporate plan have been previously circulated to members for today&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>  Before discussing the corporate plan, I would like to give the committee some background on myself and to outline my personal perspective in what I would like HIQA to achieve during my tenure as chairperson.  Since qualifying as an accountant in the early 1990s I have specialised in the area of advisory services in health care.  My first personal experience of health care delivery was gained while studying, and during summer holidays I worked as a care assistant in a psycho-geriatric home in the West Midlands in the UK.  The experience was different for a young accountant but it helped define my professional accountancy life as one specialising in health care consultancy.</p><p>  For the past ten years or more, I have provided financial, operational and strategic advisory services to acute, older person and primary care services throughout Ireland.  I interacted with HIQA prior to joining the board and I have the utmost of respect for the role of the authority and the way in which the authority carries out its functions.  I applied for the position of chairperson because I am passionate about the need for an independent health regulator having been a care assistant and an adviser to health care operators.</p><p>  As chairperson of the authority I want to ensure HIQA continues to build on its reputation and standing as a regulator.   The agenda of the authority is evolving to cover new areas on monitoring against standards which are applied in a risk-based methodology in a proportionate way.</p><p>  I would like to focus today on HIQA&rsquo;s corporate plan 2013-2015, the authority&rsquo;s third corporate plan since it was established in May 2007.  It builds on the achievements and impacts of the earlier corporate plans that have shaped the work of the authority to date.  The development of the plan started in September 2012 and involved a review of the authority&rsquo;s existing corporate plan and legal mandate, consideration of the internal and external environments and related priorities, our learning from our work over the past six years and the challenges and opportunities facing our health and social care system both today and into the future.</p><p>  HIQA&rsquo;s mission is to promote sustainable improvements, safeguard people using health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.  The mission will guide and direct all of the activities of the authority and the corporate plan clearly sets out the vision to achieve this over the next three years.  It also outlines the priorities that will need to be met to enable us to meet our strategic corporate objectives during this time.</p><p>  The corporate plan is the result of an extensive consultation process which ensures we are fully conscious of the external environment in which we carry out our work and enables us to plan accordingly.  I wish to express my gratitude to all of those who took part in the process.  I hope that the final plan, which commits us to working with our stakeholders in a collaborative and constructive manner, has addressed all of the issues raised during the consultation.  The final plan reflects the authority&rsquo;s core values of putting people first, being fair and objective, focusing on excellence and innovation, being open and accountable and working together with internal and external stakeholders.</p><p>  As the authority&rsquo;s chief executive, Ms Tracey Cooper, outlined to the committee last September, the role of the authority is set to expand considerably over the next three years.  The corporate plan will enable us to carry out new functions as efficiently and effectively as possible while prioritising areas where improvements in services are needed most and providing increasing developmental improvement support to people providing services.  The plan also provides a robust framework to ensure that we continue to carry out our existing functions to a high standard.  As the work of the authority expands, the corporate plan will guide the incorporation of these new functions while ensuring that they are properly planned, are cost-effective and are adequately supported.  This is particularly important at a time of economic uncertainty and ongoing reforms of the health service, which we are particularly conscious of, and these factors were taken into account during the development of the plan.</p><p>  The corporate plan reflects HIQA&rsquo;s primary focus of improving outcomes for people using our health and social care services.  One key area is the continued growth in our regulatory functions for adults and children over the coming years, some of which will happen in previously unregulated areas.  This includes the registration, oversight and scrutiny across a range of health and social care services for both adults and children, including the recent commencement of the regulation of residential services for people with a disability from 1 November 2013, and the move towards a health care licensing system.  We will continue to report publicly on the safety, quality and effectiveness of health and social care services, enable the health and social care system to reduce the risk of harm and abuse to people using services, inform decision making on investment and disinvestment service-based decisions and share the learning from activities to ensure continuous improvement in the planning, management and delivery of services.</p><p>  As well as working with external stakeholders, successful delivery of the new corporate plan will also depend on a number of internal factors.  We have placed particular emphasis on these within the authority as a means of optimising the delivery of our functions in an efficient and effective way.  Further development in these internal factors will enable our continued improvement in areas which include having a professionally competent and supported workforce; a robust and effective corporate governance structure; effective planning and performance management; ensuring our work is informed by evidence and research; communicating in an open and responsive manner with stakeholders; and using and managing information effectively and in accordance with best practice. </p><p>  These key enablers will ensure our success in carrying out our four core activities of regulation, supporting improvement, improving outcomes through information, and health technology assessment.  More broadly, we want to ensure that we use our talented staff and resources in the most efficient and effective manner in order to have the maximum impact for people using and delivering services and to inform decision making in a resource constrained environment.  In doing so we will aim to continue to reduce the overall burden placed on service providers wherever possible while maximising our approach to safety and quality improvement.  The authority will continue to work with other health and social care stakeholders in this respect.  It will further develop memoranda of understanding with other key organisations, including other regulators, to ensure that patient safety and the broader public interest are always the priority.</p></speech>

Democracy really is in action here.  I thank the witnesses for appearing here today.  I know a little about this area.  As well as being involved in medicine, I studied health care quality formally at masters degree level in an MBA programme.  What struck me about the formal study of quality is that it has little to do with quality and everything to do compliance, that is, compliance to a predetermined standard which is set at an arbitrary level of performance, against which those whose quality is being assessed can be measured.  Unfortunately, these predetermined standards almost never include the actual outcome of the health care itself.  That is why the society which has the most intensely regulated health system, the one which in many cases has acted as the poster child for HIQA-like model, namely, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, has such poor outcomes.  Figures which have just been released by the OECD from a survey of cancer survival rates show yet again what everybody in this business knows, that is, if a system is desperately short of doctors, nurses and resources in general, the thing which will fix poor outcomes is not building another bureaucracy and throwing it at the problem.  That is what the British have done and what we have done with the development of HIQA.</p><p>  To me, the idea of having appropriate regulation is critically important and perhaps HIQA, in some other parallel universe, could provide it.  However, the extraordinary disproportion between the focus of HIQA on process in individual hospitals, together with its complete and systematic neglect of the big picture, which is the bizarre nature and structure of our health system and the bizarre under-staffing levels we have, was perhaps best exemplified in the Savita Halappanavar report, which was very inadequate.  I will not use any specifically derogatory term but it absolutely skirted around the key issue, which was not that there were poor processes in place but that a tiny number of trained people, in the most medically under-served part of the most medically under-served country in western Europe, in terms of the number of specialists per head of population, were asked to do a job that would have been done by six, eight or ten people in another, more normal, environment.  </p><p>  In truth, if at some stage we fix the health system, making the appropriate investment in it and reorganising its structure so that it behaves in a rational fashion, we will need regulation.  We are putting the cart before the horse right now.  What is happening - and I shuddered a little when I heard the description of how HIQA's regulatory tentacles are going to spread into every other aspect of health care - is that HIQA is in danger of becoming the armed wing of the HSE.  That is what it looks like from my perspective and that worries me.  I am very worried about one particular issue.  In recent months I have become aware of mission creep with respect to the regulation of clinical trials, where HIQA is going way past regulation and will be managing those trials.  HIQA is going to be setting up-----</p></speech>

Such money could be redeployed, at a time when we are trying to find out how we can save money on cancer drugs.  The fact that what we will spend in one year on cancer drugs the Government will blithely spend in three weeks on bailing out the banking sector indicates that our priorities are wrong.</p></speech>

I know why HIQA was set up.  We want quality assurance and no matter what individual doctors and other employees of the health services do, we were let down by those services, particularly in nursing homes.  Is HIQA confident that the services being offered and delivered to older people in private and public nursing homes are now better and safer?</p><p>  There has been some discussion recently about setting up new preschools.  I previously worked in a school which provided an aftercare service, which involved giving food to the children.  The first people to knock on our door were inspectors from the HSE, who checked the kitchens and so forth.  Do the HIQA representatives see any role for the agency in terms of the delivery of preschool services?  </p></speech>

Has HIQA any input into the question of resources for the health services?  If the agency is checking the standards in hospitals or health agencies and clinics, surely an important factor is the level of resources available in the particular hospital or health care centre.  In recent years, over 11,000 staff have been taken out of the system-----</p></speech>

A total of &euro;3 billion has been cut from the health budget.  I am aware of a hospital near my home which has lost 25% of its budget and almost 200 staff members.  Surely these are issues that crop up when HIQA is carrying out inspections and checking standards across the board in various health care settings.  Is it reasonable that HIQA reports would not refer to the question of resources?  As I understand it, HIQA reports do not recommend a particular level of funding, resources or staffing for the institutions it inspects.  This is a huge issue.  Does HIQA have a function in that regard?  If so, what is its function?  If not, should it have such a function?</p></speech>

It is clear that increased resources will be required if HIQA's plan is to be implemented.  Have discussions taken place on how the resources needed to implement this plan might be obtained?  Are the witnesses satisfied that these resources will be made available?  We can have all the plans we like.  They might look good on paper but that is where they stay if we do not have the resources to implement them.  With the indulgence of the Chair, I would like to make the point that I would like HIQA to inspect psychiatric institutions as well.  I know this is not directly within its remit at present.  We are extremely concerned about the quality levels in some, but not all, of those institutions.  I know that the Mental Health Commission, rather than HIQA, is responsible for this area.  We have made some points in this regard over the years.  I am very interested in what Senator Crown has said.  Perhaps we will have a discussion on that at another time.  Mr. McEnery might not want to comment on HIQA's role with regard to mental health and psychiatric institutions, but I would welcome some remarks on the issue.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McEnery for his presentation.  I wish him every success in his role as chairperson of the authority.  I believe HIQA is playing an important part in setting standards and making sure they are implemented.  The question I would like to raise relates to an important report on this country's maternity services and the consultation that took place during the Galway investigation.  Medical personnel from a certain institution have advised me that management at another hospital, which was regarded as not having implemented the recommendations in the Drogheda report, did not consult the medical personnel in that hospital before the reply was sent to HIQA.  It was suggested that they had not complied with a recommendation in the Drogheda report.  I have been advised that the recommendations in the Drogheda report had been fully implemented at the hospital in question.  I wonder whether the relevant cross-checking procedures were in place in that scenario.  HIQA has identified that 12 or 13 of the 19 units have not implemented the terms of the Drogheda report in full.  I have been advised by people working in one of those units that they have implemented the recommendations fully, but that this has not been recorded because the staff in question were not consulted by management when the submission was being prepared.  I wonder whether a cross-checking exercise was done.  I raised this matter with the chief executive of HIQA when I met her this morning on her way to Dublin.  This issue needs to be examined.  I apologise for having to be excused in order to attend an Adjournment debate.</p></speech>

I hope it will go further in the years to come as HIQA's remit is developed.  I would like to ask two questions about the plan.  Do the plans for expansion that have been outlined depend on funding, recruitment and Government policy?  If so, what level of engagement has HIQA had with the Minister and the Department and what was the outcome of that engagement?</p><p>  The removal of funding from patient advocate organisations over the last year is a bugbear of mine.  One of the first parts of HIQA's mission statement involves "putting people first".  What is Mr. McEnery's view on how the patient experience in our hospitals is managed and monitored?  There is no advocacy agency measuring the patient experience and feeding that information back to the Department of Health and the HSE.  I am reminded of the old adage to the effect that if one does not monitor something, one certainly cannot manage it.  What are Mr. McEnery's views in this respect?  I do not mean to downgrade the efforts of individual hospital managers to provide for patient advocacy in their hospitals when I say that inconsistency is a feature of such initiatives across the country.  In some cases, there is a complete lack of any engagement with patients.  Does Mr. McEnery feel it might be within HIQA's remit to establish a patient advocacy arm, or at least to collect data on the patient experience that can be used as we try to ensure we are spending the health budget of &euro;13 billion effectively?</p></speech>

I welcome him to this meeting.  We have been missing each other, as Mr. Whelan will confirm.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to welcome him and wish him every success in his new responsibilities.  I believe HIQA has an important role to play.  I would like to add a little codicil to that, as I have done previously.  There is more than anecdotal evidence, regrettably, that HIQA's best efforts are sometimes misapplied subsequently by a system that is all too happy to use the evidence that has been accumulated for other ends.</p></speech>

I am offering my thoughts to Mr. McEnery now.  I do not intend to go into the detail of the corporate plan.  I have some concerns.  I draw Mr. McEnery's attention to the recent closure of Rath na n&Oacute;g in Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  It is well within his compass to know that the reasons given for the closure of that facility apply in other facilities that are not closed.  The report was initiated after issues were raised by the highly trained and professional staff of the facility.  It is most regrettable.  It grates with me that this has happened to a centre that was tasked with caring for children from difficult circumstances.  This problem is not confined to the child care area.  There are other instances of it, for example, relating to the care of older people.</p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I wish HIQA every success.  I wish Mr. McEnery well in his new responsibilities.  I wish Mr. Marty Whelan, Ms Tracey Cooper and all the team the very best in what they undertake.  I would like them to flex their muscles a little at some point.  It is not good enough always to be used for the ulterior motives of others.  The report process needs to be examined carefully.  I refer particularly to the consequences of certain presentations.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for listening to me.</p></speech>

I will begin by responding to Senator Crown's observations about the remit of HIQA.  While I am relatively new to the position of chairman of the authority, I have seen the work of the authority on the ground since its initiation in 2007.  I believe the work of HIQA has resulted in the quality of many people's lives being improved.  I am thinking particularly of HIQA's work on the provision of care to older people, which is one of the most obvious reasons I was delighted to be asked to become the new chairperson of the authority.  I know it makes a significant impact for older people.</p><p>  We have just started to get involved in the area of disability services.  I believe HIQA will have a significant impact on the improvements in services delivered to people with disabilities, as it has done in the cases of services delivered to older persons and services delivered in other areas.</p></speech>

The official date for commencement was 1 November 2013.  The overall budget for HIQA in 2013 was just short of &euro;18 million of which &euro;12.7 million was the Vote amount and &euro;5.2 million came from registration and licence fees.  In 2014 the Vote amount is due to be cut to &euro;12.3 million but the amount in terms of licence fees will grow to about &euro;7 million, therefore, the projected amount of income for the authority is about &euro;19 million for 2014, of which about 76% of our overall income is on payroll.  I believe the resources are sufficient to enable the authority to carry out its functions.  We expect 220 staff to be <i>in situ </i>by the end of the first quarter of 2014 which will allow us carry out the increased function in the disability area.</p><p>  In regard to other areas for which we may be given responsibility, obviously this depends on Government, in terms of licensing and other matters.  We will be interacting with the Department in due course as that is rolled out to outline the level of resources that will be required. I can assure the committee that as of now the resources are either <i>in situ</i> or about to be <i>in situ</i> to deliver our services for 2014.</p></speech>

First and foremost, in the whole area of the reconfiguration of hospitals which is now part and parcel of the roll-out of the Government's strategy to move towards universal health insurance with the establishment of hospital groups, hospital trusts and what flows from them, there is a concern, that certainly those in opposition would hold but also in communities throughout the country, that sometimes HIQA reports can be used in a way to close down facilities.  I do not mean that in the context of Roscommon, we all know about that, but in terms of ensuring that where there are deficiencies in services they are highlighted at the start of a programme rather than at the end when it becomes almost arbitrary that they are closed.  I believe HIQA has a role to play in highlighting deficiencies and making recommendations and allowing time for those recommendations to be implemented.  I am concerned that, as stated in the HIQA plan, fiscal constraints are causing difficulties for key stakeholders.  The State is also a key stakeholder and it also has fiscal constraints imposed on it.  When HIQA inspects a facility and finds deficiencies in the area of patient safety it makes a report.  As that does not give stakeholders an opportunity to address those particular issues it is a matter that will have to be looked at both from the point of view of HIQA but equally from the point of view of hospital groups themselves.</p><p>  That leads to another key issue.  We have a shortage of hospital consultants and posts that cannot be filled for various reasons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013112600008#H00200"><p>We are here to discuss the corporate plan and we are staying on that.</p></speech>

We have a situation where CEOs of a hospital have expressed concern, but does that ring alarm bells for HIQA or does it just say that is normal politics in the play for resources?  Does HIQA go in and examine whether there is a serious issue?  As a spokesperson on health, I believe we now have a situation where consultants are working under huge stress.  I am no friend of consultants, nor am I their enemy.  I am not saying this because Senator Crown is here next to me.  All of the front-line medical staff in our hospitals, particularly the acute hospitals, are under huge stress and duress.  Has HIQA a role to play in that regard?</p><p>  In regard to social services for adults and children in the disability area, I am aware this is a new area for HIQA and that it has published guidelines on it.  However, we need to understand that many of the facilities in place are home for these people.  HIQA must be very conscious of this when it conducts inspections.  This is true not just in the area of disability, but also in regard to visiting homes for the elderly.  I know the overriding consideration must be the safety and quality of care, but HIQA must be mindful that some of these places are home for these people and are the only places they know and are comfortable with.  Immediate upheaval because of some problem or other can have a profound impact on these vulnerable people.</p><p>  I do not expect a response to my points because I must go to the D&aacute;il to deal with a Bill on health.  I wish the new chairman of HIQA well and thank HIQA for its willingness to provide information to the committee regularly.</p></speech>

I know he will focus on the job.  Since we first met with HIQA representatives in this committee, including Ms Tracey Cooper and Mr. Marty Whelan, I have found them honest and open.  This has led the current position and status of HIQA.  I believe it is important we recognise HIQA as the eyes and ears of our communities and of people whose loved ones are in hospitals or who need care.</p><p>  My advice to the new chairman is not to get lost in the job or to spend his time behind the desk.  He must be the eyes and ears of the community.  We do not want another HSE or organisation that is top heavy with management or where the service is not provided at ground level.  I heard a debate the other day in which it was argued that people who become members of parliament should have a degree.  My opinion on that is there is nothing better than common sense and the ability to deal well with people.  That is what HIQA should be about.  It should be about having the common touch and being able to identify with people.</p><p>  In the past few months, HIQA has proved it can do this and where it has seen faults in the services, it has tried to bring about a change.  Unfortunately for some people, this has meant some places have had to close.  My main advice to HIQA is that its staff should not be brought in to sit behind a desk, but to go out to do the job they are being paid to do.  We do not need more people sitting behind desks.  As politicians the golden rule for us is that while this is the job in here, the bigger job is outside.  If we do not communicate with the people we represent, we do not get re-elected.</p></speech>

HIQA is an independent authority and its focus is on the safety of patients and residents in nursing homes.  This is its agenda and the authority's focus will be to continue to apply a risk-based approach to our health services.  We have no agenda other than that.  This has been our mandate since our commencement and will remain the case for both the executive and non-executive boards which oversee our operations.</p><p>  Deputy Doherty mentioned managing and getting feedback on patient experience.  This is a significant part of our work and the HIQA inspection service seeks resident feedback and the feedback of the families of residents.  This will be part of the inspection process of any of the additional services HIQA is mandated to inspect.  I reassure the committee that we conduct our inspections and make decisions from a practical perspective.  We do not just inspect the physical environment, but try to get an understanding of the experience of residents and patients and this will continue to be the case.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned Rath na n&Oacute;g.  HIQA has investigated the issue in this regard appropriately.  This is an area on which HIQA, applying its risk-based approach, will continue to focus.  Deputy Kelleher alluded to the shortage of consultants.  Deputy Healy commented on resources in facilities and where we believe shortages cause clinical risk, we will allude to that when producing our inspection report.  Currently, we do not have a mandate to inspect hospital resources.  Our mandate for hospitals only relates to infection risk in hospital services.</p><p>  I concur with Deputy Byrne in regard to the role of HIQA and the need to be out on the ground.  I believe the authority operates in a cost effective manner.  The expenditure on the authority is 0.1% of the health care budget and it is intended that we maintain a nimble, cost effective authority that is not overburdened with management at staff level.</p></speech>

A technical adjustment of &euro;1 million is also required to reallocate savings between subheads within the Department's Vote No. 23.  In June of this year, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced additional Exchequer capital investment of &euro;150 million to be funded through some of the proceeds from the lottery licence and-or State asset disposals.  This represented the first phase of the Exchequer element of the 2012 infrastructure stimulus plan.  It was designed to create employment while providing much-needed economic and social infrastructure, including schools, home insulation and local authority housing.</p><p>  One third of the additional &euro;150 million was earmarked for local road maintenance and repairs.  This additional &euro;50 million was a welcome boost for the road improvement programme.  It allowed road surfaces to be repaired and renewed on an extra 600 km of roadway.  People will have seen some of the really good work that was done with this money over the summer and the autumn.  The proposed funding is being allocated to councils for use primarily on the restoration of road pavements, by which I mean road surfaces as opposed to footpaths.  It is in addition to the &euro;350 million that was allocated for pavement works at the beginning of the year.  While resources are limited, my Department is very conscious that two successive severe winters took their toll on the road network.  If repair and maintenance works are not carried out according to a regular schedule, there is a risk that roads can deteriorate quite rapidly and roads can become very expensive to repair.  This additional funding will help to address the shortfall in this area.  I am happy to say that the 2014 budget will see a similar level of stimulus funding for regional and local roads.  This is a demonstration of our commitment to addressing this issue.</p><p>  With regard to the technical adjustment I mentioned earlier, the Commissioners for Irish Lights, who run this country's lighthouses and electronic aids to navigation, have adopted a number of cost saving initiatives in the recent past.  These initiatives, which have led to a saving of &euro;1 million this year, include the elimination of major floating aids and their replacement with much more cost-effective aids to navigation, technological improvements leading to greater reliability and cost-effective service provision, a move to a six year buoy refurbishment cycle, cost-effective outsourcing of lighthouse painting and some ongoing lighthouse consolidation projects.  These savings will be moved to the National Roads Authority's budget to cover most of the estimated cost of the toll-free initiative for heavy goods vehicles, which I announced over the summer.</p></speech>

In principle we do not have a problem with the Supplementary Estimate put forward.  I will commence with speaking on parts with which I agree.  I welcome the reallocation of &euro;1 million to carry out the trial project to ascertain whether it would be possible to get more HGVs utilising the motorway net.  That is helpful.  The infrastructure has been put in place at considerable cost to the State and, unfortunately, it has not been utilised as well as one would have expected.  Maybe that is understandable given the pressures on the haulage sector including competition from outside, increasing oil prices and the reduction in fees.  I look forward to the outcome of the trial and if it has helped to get the shift away from the local and regional road network.</p><p>  Some &euro;50 million has already been spent.  Needless to say the money was needed.  Perhaps it identifies a weakness in the Department or between the Government and the Department in recognising at the beginning of the budgetary process the necessity to conduct a complete audit of the road network in conjunction with local authorities to understand more clearly the needs for the year ahead.  While the temptation in Government is to indicate half-way through the year that it has found some new money, that it is assisting in the creation of jobs and tidying up the road network, politically it works but I think it signals a weakness within the Department's appropriate planning.  I recognise we had a number of bad winters.  During the Estimates process significant pressures on the road network should have been recognised.  I do not wish to speak for Deputy McEntee but as transport spokesperson I had an opportunity to visit County Meath with Senator Thomas Byrne and a number of councillors during the year.  The secondary road network there is in exceptionally poor condition.  That was recognised by the local authority and the Department for some time.  I would have thought a better audit could be undertaken throughout the country, using the local council engineers to provide a comprehensive framework, to determine costs.  That is a political point but obviously we will support the Estimate.  The money is spent.  The work is largely done.  I would hope the Department would engage more wholesomely with local authorities to ensure this type of Supplementary Estimate does not have to be provided on an annual basis.  </p></speech>

That this additional funding was made available is welcome.  We make cutbacks in our budgets and then come back for more funding and make it appear as though a huge amount has been added.  The reality is that there have been cutbacks in the roads budget.  I would like a breakdown of the &euro;50 million in terms of repair and renewal of road surfaces and whether it includes the repair of potholes.  I know it is for local authorities to decide how they spend the money.  Fair play is important in terms of how local authorities get their funding.  I noticed in his statement that the Minister said that councils who have a good record of investing resources in road maintenance will get preference in terms of a top-up.  That is not the message I would like to send out.  I believe funding should be allocated on merit.  If a local authority is not using its funding properly it should not be penalised on the basis of a reduction in funding.  That would lead one to say that, perhaps, Meath County Council is not doing its job properly in terms of the repair of potholes.  We have all met those people.  That would mean that local authority might be penalised because it has not done a good job.</p><p>  Has the Minister consulted with the European Investment Bank on the possibility of providing funding for road improvements in a similar manner to that which has been confirmed for the Luas Cross City?  I recognise these are capital projects - we need more capital projects - and we are limited from a funding point of view but there may be other avenues in terms of exploring revenue.  Will the Minister explain what represents technological improvements leading to greater reliability and cost-effective service provision, which has resulted in savings?  Has the Minister plans to measure the benefits of the HGV toll-free month in order to determine its overall effectiveness for supporting jobs and industry?  Who will get the &euro;1 million?  Is it the private toll operators and, if so, how it is calculated?  Only a certain number of motorways are being targeted.  How is the effectiveness of the trial to be gauged?  </p></speech>

Following the poor weather conditions many roads were left in a terrible state.  People pay their motor taxation and deserve to have investment made in the road network. Will the Minister confirm if most or all of the &euro;50 million was spent on emergency repairs, potholes and channelling on roads?  Is an electronic asset management system in place for roads or is that the responsibility of each local authority?  A new asset management system is being established for Irish Water and also in the case of electricity and gas networks.  Our road network is an asset.  In regard to maintenance, data must not recorded electronically and shared and measured.  Coming from a rural constituency where there are many secondary roads I am well aware that where such roads are repaired but not the drainage, it is highly likely that they will have to be repaired the following year after the next heavy rainfall.  As the water has no place to go it will lift the surface and the channels will reappear.  The Department needs to adopt an overall co-ordinated role to encourage local authorities to manage the asset better rather than throw money at repairs when it should be proactively engaging in an asset management and maintenance system.</p></speech>

Any further funding will always be welcome, but we understand there are cuts in this area, like everywhere else.  The construction industry scheme, CIS, has worked in my county and that is great.  At the same time, we do not like having to ask people for money for roads.  This is an issue that will not go away.</p><p>  With regard to the toll holiday, I am very interested to hear the results of that on the M1 and M3, because it affects Slane.  As soon as the updated results of this holiday are available, will the Minister forward them to us?</p></speech>

The motorways chosen were the ones where there appeared to be the most diversion.  For example, there is little diversion on the M50.  The Westlink bridge is in my constituency, but huge numbers of trucks do not appear to avoid it.  We tried to pick the motorways truckers divert from.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52013112600005#G00900"><p>The Minister would be looking for more than &euro;1 million if he offered free tolls on the M50.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-26a.694" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52013112600005#G01000"><p>That is the point.  We tried to select the motorways where there appeared to be significant diversion.  We also took account of what the cost would be to compensate the toll operators.  The money goes to the PPP toll operators who built and own the road.</p><p>  The indication so far in regard to the tolled roads is that in the Limerick tunnel, admittedly from a very low base, there has been almost an 80% increase in heavy goods vehicles using the tunnel.  On the other roads, the increase has been more like 20% or 25%.  We are also counting the number of vehicles passing through Slane to see the impact there, though the figures may be skewed due to some other works being carried out near the town.  When we have all the figures in December or January, we will go through them to see what they mean.  Other issues, such as fuel savings for HGVs will have to be taken into account also.</p><p>  With regard to the extra &euro;50 million, believe it or not, we did not know it was coming.  It came as a pleasant surprise during the summer.  Members will all be aware that a number of other State assets are currently for sale, so I hope for some more surprises during the year.  I would not like to see any further funds just go to roads, but would like to some going towards public transport.  Whatever we have to spend on roads, it is still not enough.  Whether the funding comes from the Exchequer or local authorities, it is down.  This is a concern, but we are doing the best we can during this difficult period to maintain roads to as good a standard as we can.</p><p>  The &euro;50 million was allocated to local authorities according to a formula based on the length of road they have and the level of use.  They were given significant discretion with regard to how they spend it, but it was to be used for repair and resurfacing rather than anything else.  Some special moneys were also set aside for drainage works and Deputy Coffey articulated very well the reasons that was needed.  We also gave a top-up to local authorities that put their own resources into roads.  I felt this was important.  In law, local authorities have primary responsibility for the roads, particularly when it comes to local and regional roads.  Some authorities, not always the wealthy counties, are very good at deciding they should put a fair amount of money into roads, but others decide to put it all into housing and parks and to go to the Department for funding when the roads fall apart.</p><p>  Whatever they decide, we want to send a message to managers and councillors that when preparing their budgets for next year, which they will do shortly, they should not come begging to the Department for extra money for roads if, when they had the opportunity, they decided to put much less of their resources into the roads.  There are huge variations between counties.  Some put 35% of their discretionary resources into roads, while others put in as little as 10%.  The reason we gave the top-up to those counties that invested more was to send a message to managers and councillors that we want them to take their responsibility for roads seriously, so that if they want money for roads, they should use some of their own discretionary funds to prove they think their roads are a priority, rather than just come to the Department and say they are a priority.</p><p>  The European Investment Bank is currently helping to fund the works at Newlands Cross and at the N11 at Rathnew.  We are also confident, although I do not want to jump the gun, that it will help to fund the M17-M18.  I hope that will go to a financial close and start construction in quarter 1 of next year, but it is a PPP, which involves construction companies, banks and pension funds.  These must all go to their boards and credit committees and the rest and clear the project, which can take some time.  I believe it will happen in quarter 1 of next year, but if it does not happen then, that will not be due to a lack of effort on my part or that of the NRA.</p><p>  When we speak of the European Investment Bank, it is important to bear in mind that it is a bank and that any moneys we get from it are a debt that must be paid back with interest.  There is a certain culture in Ireland and Irish politics that hears the word European and thinks of grants.  I see that in the argument about TEN-T and the western arc and all of that, as though being on a European network means we get European money.  It does not.  What it means is that we may get debt or may be required to upgrade our infrastructure, at huge cost to taxpayers, and perhaps get 10% from Europe.  We are in a very different space when it comes to European money and we need to be aware of that.</p><p>  Mention was made of the road safety improvement scheme.  This scheme was funded last year and will be funded in the coming year, but no extra money has been provided for it.  We managed to fund many of the schemes put forward.  The scheme is a good programme and provides good value and it will continue.  Deputy Coffey asked a pertinent question regarding our asset management system.  We use a system called MapRoad and the expert on it is here with me, so I will hand over to him to tell the committee about it.</p></speech>

Essentially, it is a pavement management system for roads.  It is getting to a critical point and there should be some good results to see from it next year and thereafter.  It is one of 30 shared services which are being undertaken by local authorities and will be rolled out in that way.  It will cover the whole country, but will have a single portal for applications for road opening licences.  The idea is that the various utilities can apply through the single portal and a back office will deal with the applications.  However, each local authority will make the decision.  This will help standardise the application system and will improve consistency in the process.  It will also help improve records, in terms of when roads were done and when rehabilitation work needs to be undertaken.  The project gives a better fix on the cost of repairs, because all the information is on a single system.</p></speech>

We are trying to encourage smarter travel.  The Minister knows that and he has put considerable investment in it.  I feel that many local authorities are neglecting footpaths in towns.  I suppose it is down to costs again, but at least if there is a records management system of footpaths, it will encourage maintenance for further pedestrianisation and smarter travel initiatives, and I think it should be included at a later stage.</p></speech>
