Agreed.  That will be subject to clarification from the Department regarding the continued exemptions that apply.</p> <p>  The next one is COM (2016) 157 - marked fertilisers.  It is proposed that on the basis that there are no apparent subsidiarity concerns, these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny by this committee at this time.  However, it is the opinion of the committee that further scrutiny is warranted by the appropriate Oireachtas committee, when established.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  COM (2016) 159 - adjustment rate for direct payments in respect of the calendar year 2016.  It is proposed that on the basis that there are no subsidiarity concerns, this proposal does not warrant scrutiny by this committee at this time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Regarding COM (2016) 198, the proposal is that this committee will request further submissions from interested parties to be considered by this committee at its next meeting.  Those requests will be sent out and this will come back for decision at the next meeting of this committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On the adjournment, particularly in regard to material coming back to us, I propose that we meet again at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 1 June 2016.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
