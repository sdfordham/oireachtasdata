I thank them for appearing before the committee to brief us on the role of the newly established investigations division within the Department.  I apologise for the change in the time of the meeting, but the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il had changed, and it has changed again since we notified the witnesses of the rescheduling.  The committee has agreed that the meeting will conclude by 5.20 p.m. at the latest and that we will got into private session between 5.20 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. to discuss the contributions of the witnesses.</p> <p> I draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Mr. Carroll to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900004#G00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me this opportunity to outline the role and functions of the new investigations division set up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine last July.  He has already introduced my colleagues, Mr. Richard Healy and Mr. Pat Flanagan.</p><p>  As the joint committee will be aware, the Department is responsible for the expenditure of substantial amounts of money, both from the national Exchequer and the European Union.  In addition, it is responsible for implementing and enforcing a considerable volume of national and EU legislation which is generally aimed at protecting human and animal health.  For these reasons, it is not surprising that it deploys a substantial number of general control and inspectorate staff members to ensure food safety, animal health and welfare and safeguard the expenditure of public funds.  These controls underpin and safeguard public confidence in agrifood production and processing in Ireland and contribute to a very significant export market, worth &euro;10 billion in 2013.  Occasionally, the enforcement of these controls leads to further investigations into matters of possible wrongdoing and prosecutions.  </p><p>  The investigation of illegal activity and the prosecution of such activity can be a complex process requiring particular expertise and many organisations have set up specialist units to conduct these investigations.  The then Department of Agriculture set up the special investigation unit back in the mid-1980s to provide specialist inspectors within the Department to investigate and deal with serious practices and problems in the use of illegal substances such as hormones, angel dust and so on.  Apart from the risk to human health, the abuse of illegal growth promoters was posing a huge risk to the reputation of the agrifood industry and needed to be addressed urgently.  I am pleased to say this problem disappeared relatively quickly in the 1990s following a series of convictions.  The scope of the unit was subsequently extended to include a wide range of legislation, including legislation relating to the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, other animal health legislation, animal welfare legislation and legislation relating to animal identification.  Its remit was also extended to investigations into potential fraud with regard to national and EU funds.</p><p>  I mentioned the success of the special investigations unit in addressing the issue of the illegal use of growth promoters.  I believe the work of the unit, in encouraging greater compliance with legislation, made a significant contribution to the huge progress we have seen in the past ten years in disease eradication.  This is particularly the case with brucellosis which has now been eradicated and BSE which has been more or less eradicated.  There has also been very considerable progress in the eradication of bovine TB, the incidence of which has been reduced to a record low level in the past two years.  The progress achieved in eradicating these diseases has resulted in very significant savings to the national Exchequer.  For example, expenditure on tackling TB and brucellosis which amounted to &euro;76 million in 2002 fell to under &euro;32 million last year.</p><p>  The world does not still and the work of the Department is growing increasingly complex all the time, as was evident in the horsemeat scandal last year.  The Department responded to the challenge, as part of an ongoing modernisation of its structures and as part of the wider public service reform process, by reviewing and updating its investigative procedures.  Committee members will be aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, announced in September that, following a review of the governance structure around the conduct of all investigations by the Department, it had been decided that a new investigations division would be established.  In making this announcement he formally acknowledged the dedication and commitment of the staff of the Department who carried out investigations, sometimes in very challenging circumstances.</p> <p>He specifically referenced his first-hand experience in the context of the equine DNA investigation which, he said, had been conducted by departmental officers in a highly pressurised environment where their focus and sense of purpose had been highly visible and extremely successful.</p><p> The new arrangement brings all of the Department&rsquo;s investigation capabilities, both internal and external, into one division.  It is headed by a senior superintending veterinary officer, Mr. Flanagan, supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team, with others to be drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial in the conduct of particular investigations.  The new division reports to an investigations steering group which is chaired by the assistant secretary responsible for corporate affairs - me for the time being - and will comprise the Chief Veterinary Officer, the assistant secretary with responsibility for direct payments and the heads of the legal services, internal audit and human resources divisions.  The group will, in all new cases, determine whether matters should be referred back to the relevant inspection areas of the Department for follow-through, whether an investigation is warranted and, if so, whether it should be conducted by the investigations division or referred to the Garda.  Where investigations are being conducted internally, the steering group will oversee their conduct and, in conjunction with the head of the division, determine whether the submission of cases for prosecution is warranted.  The new investigations division includes the functions previously undertaken by the special investigations unit.</p><p> I stress that the objective of the Department in performing its enforcement and investigative functions is to promote the highest levels of legal compliance to protect the health of consumers and promote and sustain a vibrant agrifood industry in Ireland and protect public funds.  This is vital to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.  In altering the inspection capability in the manner outlined we have enhanced our capacity to protect Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation, while also providing for enhanced governance arrangements in respect of when and how investigations are carried out.  We now have in place a strong, cohesive, consolidated and effective investigation capability to ensure and protect the reputation of the expanding agrifood industry and public funds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900005#H00200"><p>I thank Mr. Carroll for his presentation.  We all agree that there is a need for an investigations unit where there is serious wrongdoing.  However, to say the change resulted from a simple reorganisation within the Department is not what some understood.  My understanding is that it was a response to some high profile court cases in which the Department's case had not been sustained and where farmers who had maintained their innocence for many years had been vindicated in the courts.  Serious issues were raised about the operation of the special investigations unit and these farmers believe they have lost thousands of euro because their credibility was destroyed over a long period.  I will not name them because it would be invidious to do so.  The Chairman would rule me out of order, even though I would be naming them in their defence.  These farmers believe an investigation should be carried out into the operation during the years of the special investigations unit in these cases.  Would the Department have any objection to an independent investigation into the operation of the unit prior to the putting in place of the new arrangements?  Does Mr. Carroll believe it is important that the issue of how the unit conducted itself be resolved once and for all?</p> <p>If an investigation by an independent person vindicates the SIU, that is in the interest of the Department, and if it does not, we need to know about that.  My main issue is not whether we need an SIU.  The arrangements in place at present appear to be adequate.  My main question is how the SIU operated when it was the SIU, as opposed to the new investigations division, and whether it operated in a fair manner.  Have there been cases in which it destroyed the livelihoods of people who, it was then discovered when it came to court, had not been involved in illegalities - the case made by farmers from the beginning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900006#J00200"><p>I thank Mr. Carroll for his presentation.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has outlined many of the concerns relating to investigations carried out by the SIU that ended up before the courts, which cleared and exonerated the farmers involved.  Are the members of the SIU that were involved in those cases currently members of the new group?  Will they be part of the Department's investigation team?  Will there be an investigation into the investigations that were carried out by the SIU where the farmers in question were exonerated by the courts?  If not, the Department should reconsider that.</p><p>  The work that has been done on the eradication of BSE and brucellosis is to be commended, but there is a problem with TB.  Since Mr. Carroll mentioned it in his presentation, what areas in the country are most affected by TB at present?  I understand that some of those areas are in the Border region, straddling both sides of the Border.  What is the level of co-operation with the authorities and the Executive in the Six Counties in pursuing the eradication of TB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900006#J00300"><p>I have one question.  Will Mr. Carroll outline what the governance procedures will be for future investigations in terms of protecting the rights of people being investigated, and how that will be managed within the special investigations unit in light of concerns about the previous operation?  How can people have their rights protected in new investigations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900006#J00400"><p>I thank the witness for their presentation.  Undoubtedly, the special investigations unit has the role outlined by Mr. Carroll and it has an important function in that respect.  We acknowledge that, particularly in the context of having an important, sustainable and vibrant agriculture industry and, obviously, the public funds involved.  Nevertheless, the fact that the witnesses are here and that the presentation states, "We now have in place...", immediately invokes the fact that what was in place previously was not satisfactory.  There is an implicit admission in that.</p><p>  This new dispensation or new investigation group did not happen perchance or, indeed, of the Department's own volition.  It was effectively prescribed by the strong admonition of a prominent Circuit Court judge in the course of a high-profile case.  Is that not the reason it has reached this point?  The Department's response was initially to carry out an internal review.  There was a refusal to release that, and then it was released in redacted form.  I understand why redaction takes place.  Eventually, some form of it emerged.  However, simply having an internal review would not inspire confidence.  Surely there is a case for a focused external review to ensure that all rights are protected, given that people have rights as well.</p> <p>If that were not the case someone could go in and do everything but people have rights, and they are laid down in the Constitution.  They are important legal rights and in the context of the recent Supreme Court, European Court of Justice and so on people who are accused now have the right to have a solicitor present during the course of their investigation.  Is it envisaged that that right would be extended to an investigation being carried out by the Department?  Surely somebody in that situation is entitled to have legal advice when they have been taken in and not given any opportunity to respond.  This investigation must carry with it the same obligations as any investigation.  An investigation has now been launched by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it may well be part of this unit as well.  As I understand it, the Department may call in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at various times.  Surely the same procedures would be in place.  Otherwise, they may be subject to judicial review where there is a failure to meet the threshold.  Our citizens are entitled to expect that, and in that regard we are talking about members of the agricultural community.</p><p> I know the Department has a number of people involved in it but how will this work in that context, and will the same procedures apply?  The Criminal Procedure Act 1967 has laid out a number of things.  It has been amended.  It is fair to say there is a significant burden on the State but the fact that there is a burden on the State or anybody else does not mean we can circumscribe people's rights.  They are entitled to them.  They are laid down in the Constitution, which is interpreted by the Supreme Court and, ultimately, by the European Court of Justice.</p><p> I am confused as to how this will work.  I would like an outline of how it will work.  I am a farmer.  If I am on the farm and the Department official arrives because he or she has a suspicion, and the suspicion must be grounded on something, what happens after that?  What procedures will be adopted along the line?  There has been a good deal of disquiet, to put it mildly, among people about this issue.  We all acknowledge that some of the work the investigation unit has to do is important but a balance must be struck because the way those investigations are conducted operationally is extremely important.  We cannot throw rights out the window, so to speak.  If we do that we might as well say that everybody is guilty but that is not the way life works.  I would not like to subscribe to anything of that nature.  People should have an opportunity to present their case and they are entitled to legal advice in that step because even in a simple matter people are entitled to legal advice.</p><p> The impact of what might ultimately emerge can be draconian.  People's livelihoods can be washed down the drain, so to speak, as a result of an investigation and therefore every step along the way should be circumscribed with the usual rights attached to any investigation which has a criminal sanction of that severity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900007#K00200"><p>I welcome the gentlemen.  It is an issue I have been following closely for the past 18 months to two years.  I am aware of a number of cases, and various concerns have been expressed by farmers in my part of the country.  As previous speakers said, nobody would question the idea of having a unit in place that would protect human and animal health.  That is essential, but the special investigation unit, SIU, was set up in the 1980s to deal with illegal substances such as hormones, BSE, the horsemeat saga and so on.  Those major issues were topical at the time and it was important to deal with them but is the unit in place now just another name for what was in place previously?</p> <p>How many people worked in the old special investigations unit?  How many teams were there throughout the country?  Were they set up on a regional basis?  How many were involved in each team?  Will the teams involved previously be involved in the new division?  What role will those involved play in the new unit if they are to be involved?  If not, where will they be in future?  That is a big question.  I have received numerous queries from various people who are concerned at the way some of the old units and the personnel involved dealt with individuals, sometimes in a threatening manner.  This applied not only to individuals but their families and, in some cases, their children.  It was totally uncalled-for.  To me the SIU overstepped the mark in several ways.</p><p> Deputy Penrose will remember the legal regime.  It seems to me now that person is guilty until proven innocent rather than the other way around.  I used to think it was the other way around.  This is a serious issue.  No one questions the need to have a regime in place, but the unit seems to have overstepped the mark previously.</p><p> What role will the investigations division have in the determination of single farm payments, if any?  The old unit seems to have rather unfairly imposed penalties on individuals and offered them little right of appeal.  That is a serious matter.  Several questions need to be addressed in respect of the old system before we move on to the new system.  I agree fully with the call from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for a full investigation into the old unit.  That is essential to put to bed once and for all whatever issues may have existed.  It would wipe the slate clean and allow us to move on in a proper and efficient manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900008#L00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am pleased to have this discussion on the functions of the new investigations division.  As with the other Deputies here, my concern relates to governance.  It is no bad thing to have a concern over governance, because the new division has a chance to right this now.</p><p>  Most of the cases I have heard about relate to farmers who come to me because they are dissatisfied with the way they were treated in an inspection.  They have a list of complaints on issues in respect of which they believe they could have been dealt with better.  It is important that we put a good deal of time and effort into ensuring that inspections are fair, seen to be fair and carried out in an open manner.  This applies in general and not only to the investigations division.</p><p>  One thing hangs over the heads of farmers.  The coming of an inspector should not be feared, particularly if a normal farmer is trying to get on with his job and, hopefully, is doing it correctly.  However, there is the threat of withholding of the single farm payment, and at this stage the single farm payment represents the farmer's total profit.  It is simply not fair.  There are no two ways of putting it.  We all know the power the inspector has, but the inspector should respect that power.</p><p>  I am seeing it from the farmer's side and it is worth listening to that.  It would be interesting to know the legal bill of the former special investigations unit.  What was the success rate of the unit?  I am keen to see the metrics.  I came across a case involving a piggery one year ago.  It involved not only the Department but an environmental agency as well.  At the end of the day the case was lost.  The only protection afforded to the person was the courts.  We are failing if we have to run something right through to the courts and it takes a judge to decide that he is not happy and that common sense has not prevailed.  There is an onus on everyone to get this right.  What the investigations division is doing must be done - no one doubts that - but it must be done properly.</p><p>  Some of the personnel involved with whom I have spoken are overburdened.  They are trying to get through reviews and so on and simply cannot manage.  Their work is being delayed because they have a huge stack of work and simply cannot get through it.  I presume the same personnel will be in place in the new regime as were in the old regime.</p><p>  Sometimes people have to come into a situation all of a sudden.</p> <p>In such situations it would be helpful to have a third party present who can make sure the farmer is represented.  People sometimes get carried away and we do not want an unfair situation to arise on either side.</p><p> There is still an air of suspicion around the last unit.  It had a great deal of work to do but we must not understate that fact that we must work with farmers.  I presume the percentage of farmers falling out of kilter is low and the Department has a track record on constant offenders.  We now have a chance to get this right because it would be interesting to see how much taxpayers' money was spent before we finally got a judge to deal with this.  The aim of this should be to do the job properly and efficiently, without resorting to the courts.  Most farmers are reasonable and if they make a mistake and are warned will try to get on with things.  Some farmers will not respond in this way and will require strong action but we are not using the common ground that would allow people to improve.  I have thrown my eyes to heaven in some cases where farmers were fined.  I have worn a path to the door of the Department from trying to make a case for people who did not seek to create an issue and have been treated unfairly.  If this is a brave new era it would be nice to see results.</p></speech>

Perhaps the witnesses could clarify the difference in terms of the chain of responsibility and accountability.  Like other areas of the Department, this division has authority over other sectors of farming including processors and suppliers.  Does the division work with the Health Service Executive, HSE, Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the environmental health officers, EHOs?  The SIU might not be alerted to some breaches through cross-farm compliance by an EHO or a county council vet.  How will the division act in such circumstances?</p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris asked a question about those who were under investigation by the old SIU.  Will they be investigated by the new division or are those cases pending determination?  I will allow Mr. Carroll to decide whether he or his colleagues will answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900009#M00300"><p>I might ask my colleagues to help out in some respects as I address the various issues raised.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v acknowledged that the arrangements appear to be adequate and I welcome that.  He asked whether there should be a separate investigation into the SIU and that was mentioned by other members.  I cannot deal with such a matter but I wonder what the basis for this is.  Various cases in the public domain were mentioned and there have been complaints about the conduct of some investigations and inspections.  It is natural that people subject to investigations would respond like this because they are suspected of wrongdoing.  Inspections may lead to penalties so, again, it is natural that some people respond as they do.  There is a protocol for complaints relating to inspections conducted by the former SIU and very, very few have been made - far fewer than are mentioned by Deputies and the media.  In the past number of years around one complaint per year has come through the existing protocol arrangements in the Department.</p> <p>They are the figures we have, through the quality management system.  What the Deputy has told us about, and what we are aware of in the media, is different from what is addressed directly to the Department.  That is the reality and context that we are aware of.</p><p> In terms of governance in this new structure, we continue to have the same protocol in existence for complaints which is done through the quality management service and is independent from the investigations division.  The protocol feeds back into management and comes through directly from representations made by Deputies to the Minister which is completely separate again.  In addition, representations are made to the Secretary General.  Now there is another opportunity with a steering group which I chair and is independent of the investigations division.  The steering group makes decisions on how investigations and whether investigations are to be conducted.  If that involves somebody with a gripe about the former SIU or the current investigation structures then we will deal with it as a complaint.  We will determine whether the case needs to be investigated independent of the investigations division.  There is an opportunity to do that.         </p><p> Deputy Ferris asked about the current membership of the SIU and if they will continue to do their work.  My answer is "Yes."  We have not changed the membership.  Please bear in mind that we established this new structure in September.  We have been subject to an embargo on recruitment.  Therefore, we do not have the capacity right now to expand what we believe is required - an expanding investigations division.  Harvest 2020 has a growth potential in the sector of enormous proportions which needs to be protected.  Therefore, the SIU needs a heavier resource than it is getting at the moment and we are looking at the matter. </p><p> We are also looking at mobility, across the Department, into and out of the unit but first we need to identify people who are suitable for this kind of work.  This is difficult work and is not simple work.  We hear about complaints against the SIU but nobody hears about the hostility against the SIU.  We have had many members against whom false allegations have been made, allegations of assault have been made, some of them have been threatened they will be shot, they have had guns held to their heads and they have been chased down fields with slash hooks.  These are the stories that people do not hear about.  One does not hear about the SIU members who get Garda protection on their family homes and have telephone surveillance for protection.  Nobody hears that side of the situation.  We, as a Department, also have a duty of care to our staff.  There are things happening that we should also be concerned about.  The kind of people who make those threats are not people we would be comfortable with defending. </p></speech>

I believe Deputy Penrose mentioned that the Department had not published the report of that investigation.  The Minister has indicated in public that he is willing to publish that report.  It has gone to the Information Commissioner for a determination because there is a third-party objection to the publication of that report.  We are not unwilling to publish the report, but we cannot do so until there is a determination by the Information Commissioner.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, they satisfy nobody and serve no purpose because the people who believe they have been treated wrongly will ask what an internal investigation would reveal anyway.  I must note the practices I saw when, for example, tendering for ferryboats was being done.  Outside process auditors were brought in when a complaint I did not think would stand up was made to me about &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Department issued an instruction that an external auditing company be brought in to go through everything, because I believed that were an internal investigation to be carried out, the person concerned would respond by stating that the glove is going to defend the glove.  How many times over the past 20 years has one heard about internal investigations in this State?  They do not satisfy anybody, and in lots of cases it was only on foot of an external investigation that one got the truth.  While I am not pre-empting what is the truth, my point is this is a bad process.  Moreover, it appears to be getting stronger within Departments, because internal investigations also were seen in respect of penalty points, although the only thing the public will accept is an external investigation.  I asked a question earlier, and obviously it would not be an issue for the Department to decide, as it would be the Minister who decides on an external investigation.  However, I am interested in Mr. Carroll's views on an investigation, once and for all, into those cases in which farmers had serious complaints and the courts vindicated them.  Whereas Deputy Penrose stated that the learned judge was not exactly praising the Department, would Mr. Carroll not think it would clear the air considerably if an external investigation into the issue was held?  If that vindicated the Department, everyone would then be obliged to accept it.</p></speech>

If a protocol is in place in which cases are taken and lost, what is the case following such an outcome under the new structure as opposed to what was the case previously?  Mr. Carroll mentioned the moratorium.  Am I correct in stating that from January, Departments will have the liberty to recruit, as long as they stay within their Vote?  Has that been agreed yet?</p></speech>

In such a situation, many people will take note that they are being asked to complain to the very people who will bring them to court, because it is not the special investigations unit that brings one to court but the Minister and the Attorney General.  Ultimately, the State brings one to court.  I recall that in one high-profile case that was thrown out in the courts, people, including the Minister in the previous Government, were approached about it.  However, because there was an ongoing investigation, they were fairly powerless to do anything about the matter.</p></speech>

We co-operate with the North through the Garda with the PSNI, where there is co-responsibility for investigations that are being conducted.  We also co-operate with the Food Standards Agency, FSA, in Northern Ireland and with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.  This co-operation is ongoing and is a two-way process.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle asked about governance in the protection of people's rights.  People have the same rights and those rights should be protected.  I am not aware of circumstances in which they have not been, but again, if that is the case, we must understand that.</p> <p>I am at pains to emphasise that the steering group does stand separate from the investigation committee which it controls.  </p><p> In the terms of the governance, I will briefly explain the process.  Somebody in the Department at head of division or assistant secretary level indicates to me or the steering group that he or she believes there is a justification for conducting an investigation into some matter or other.  The investigation steering group considers that, how it should be done, whether it should be done, if we should allocate resources to the investigation, the nature of the investigation and why it warrants a separate investigation.  It then decides who does it and the timeframe within which it should be done.  There will always be a condition about reporting back and keeping the investigation steering group up-to-date on that.</p><p> Since September, in many of the cases we have determined that there is no reason the investigations division should conduct any investigation.  We might have believed they should be done as part of the normal inspection process in the Department, and those decisions have been made.  In other cases we have agreed to the investigations committee working in co-operation with the Garda, and not necessarily leading on those.  In another case we have agreed that it should work in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a widespread amount of co-operation across the system, including with EHOs, which one Deputy mentioned, and the FSAI.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's investigations division does not stand alone.  It usually works in co-operation with many other agencies.</p><p> On prosecutions, I was asked about success rates.  In the past five years, we have had 66 cases for prosecution and so far 44 of those cases were disposed of in the courts.  The success rate was 40, or 90%. The remaining cases are still in the court system; I understand there are 21 or 22 cases.  </p><p> I answered Deputy Penrose's question on refusal.  There was no refusal to release the particular report he referenced.  Our hope is that the report will be released soon, but it is out of our control.  I hope I have explained the procedure.  The Deputy asked me how it worked, and I am happy to come back to that if he wishes.  We do not throw people's rights out the window.  We comply with our legal obligations, as we are required to do.  </p><p> I do not know whether Deputy Deering suggested that we put a proper name in place to mask continued practice, but we have changed the name.  We want to position it within a structure of the Department because the SIU was a unit, as the Chairman mentioned, within a wider division.  It is now a division on its own.  There is no other function attached to the division.  It is solely the investigations division, headed by a senior superintendent veterinary inspector.  </p><p> Deputy Deering referred to the SIU having a function in regard to a determination on single payments.  I presume by that he means allowances.  That has been the case where cross-compliance inspections may have been referred in particular circumstances.  It is unique but that would happen.  That is an EU requirement; there is no getting away from that.  We are under that obligation. </p><p> Deputy Barry talked more generally about inspections than investigations.  I did not come equipped to explain the intricacies of inspections in regard to SPS.  </p> <p>Again, our inspections are governed by EU regulations.  There are obligations to the effect that we have to establish that where there is a risk to EU funds we ensure that we remove it, and in some cases people have compliance issues around the single payment, as the Deputy is aware.  Typically, they do not go to the investigation group.  On occasion they do, but it happens very rarely.</p></speech>

The investigation starts from a different point, and in the course of that some issue is identified which is to be cross-reported.  An issue does not start as a cross-compliance inspection, rather, it starts at the local office level.  From the investigations division point of view, an investigation which started at a different point can lead to issues being identified in the course of that investigation which are relevant for cross-compliance reporting.</p></speech>

We made some determinations on that quite recently.  Issues came forward where there was a preference for an investigation to be conducted.  We took a view, and will continue to do so, that one would need to have fairly exceptional circumstances for the investigations division to become involved in a single payment inspection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014120900014#R00600"><p>I thank the witnesses.  During Mr. Carroll's statement he commented on people from the SIU being subjected to threatening behaviour.  Rather than the impression going out from there that that was all between farmers, it was obvious where some of it came from.  The two most high-profile investigations the SIU has successfully investigated for the betterment of the reputation of the agricultural industry are the pork dioxin and horsemeat scandals.  I understand the pork dioxin matter was an inadvertent calamity as a result of a chain of events which had a consequence.</p><p>  In regards to the horsemeat scandal, there was always a feeling that criminal elements were involved.  I would like to make sure that people do not leave here with the impression that it is only because of a very hostile relationship between farmers that problems arise.  There may well be other elements in society which cause members of staff of the Department to need Garda protection and have their phones monitored.  It might be no harm for Mr. Carroll to clarify that.  </p></speech>

When we consider the number of investigations carried out annually, in the grand scheme of things very few involve difficulties.  As I said, over the past five years we have had 66 cases for prosecution, which is not a large number.  In the context of the work of the investigations division, on average there are, I understand, 130 or 140 separate investigations.  Many of them do not go beyond the point of a warning for somebody who has perhaps inadvertently done something wrong.  </p><p>  There is no imputation on farmers generally.  They are generally completely compliant with all of the legislation they have an obligation to be compliant with.  There might be 140 cases a year, and over five years only 66 went to prosecution.</p> <p>We have a huge compliance level.  I do not know how one defines it in percentage terms but it is over 99%.  There is no imputation there.  I felt it was important to call out the fact that this is a difficult unit to identify required skillsets for because one is looking for people with a legal understanding and a capacity to investigate, record information and to present that information in a form that is amenable to prosecution.  It is hard to get such a skillset.  I also wanted to bring to the committee's attention the fact that this is difficult for them to do as well and, therefore, how difficult it is for us to man that team.  That was the only context in which I was making that point.  </p></speech>

It is now mandatory.  When is the investigations unit going to prepare a page indicating to people what their rights are at the very beginning?  There would then be no ambiguity.  I said their rights were circumscribed and I did not use that word lightly.</p> <p>How many of those who have been investigated have been advised that they are entitled to legal representation from the off, rather than when the game is over, the statement is taken and their name has been signed at the bottom?  Will the committee make a recommendation that in these investigations people be informed from the beginning of their entitlements and rights when they enter a Garda station?</p></speech>

In such cases, there is no application for a warrant and the investigation unit has significant powers.  The process has been rubber-stamped by the Government.  Most farmers want to comply with the regulations.  However, let us take the example of a small farmer in the west with financial problems and living on his own who is subject to an unannounced inspection.  This creates a bad relationship between local inspectors and the farmer.  On top of this, as Deputy Willie Penrose said, people are not informed if they are entitled to legal advice or representation by the IFA or the ICMSA during an inspection.  A little support could do a lot in these cases.</p></speech>

The farmers&rsquo; charter is being redrafted.  The committee can look at this as part of its recommendations in this matter.  As members pointed out, people are not advised of inspections.  However, it should also be remembered that 140 cases a year are involved, of which 66 have gone to court.  Do these cases only involve farmers or do they include non-farming investigations?</p></speech>

Obviously, if members have any questions, we are here to answer them.</p><p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to present this request for a Supplementary Estimate for 2014 to increase the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s permitted net expenditure to deal with a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid.  This Supplementary Estimate is not required to cover an increase in gross spending.  It is more technical in nature as it is required to avoid an excess of net expenditure &ndash; that is, gross expenditure minus appropriations-in-aid, which, effectively, is money we get back from Europe.  In essence, the Department needs to increase its permitted net expenditure to deal with a delay in receiving some &euro;180 million of its expected receipts.  Accordingly, the net expenditure that had been originally set at &euro;958 million must be increased to &euro;1.135 billion.</p><p>  The Department's budgeted total appropriations-in-aid for 2014 is &euro;245 million.  It is now forecast that some &euro;66 million will be received in appropriations-in-aid, which would represent a shortfall of some &euro;178 million in current receipts.  The overwhelming factor in this overall shortfall is the absence of anticipated receipts of &euro;180 million from the EU in respect of the co-financing of expenditure under the 2014-20 European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  It is important to make the point that this &euro;180 million in receipts which are not drawn down in 2014 are protected and will be drawn down in 2015 following approval of Ireland&rsquo;s partnership agreement and rural development programme, RDP.  Hence, the issue is one of timing rather than the amount to be recouped.</p><p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine appropriations-in-aid projections for 2014 were &euro;245 million, split roughly 80-20 between funds from the EU and income generated nationally.  The non-EU part is comprised of fees for services provided and other purchases from the Department, including inspection fees at meat plants and meat export points, certain vaccine sales, farmer contributions towards disease eradication and so on.</p><p>  On the EU side, we get substantial refunds of around &euro;14 million from the EU for our work on disease eradication &ndash; TB and TSE - and modest receipts for the European Fisheries Fund.  However, the vast bulk of receipts in respect of 2014, amounting to &euro;180 million, were to come from the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development on foot of co-funded investment in rural development schemes.  The EU co-funds schemes and programmes in arrears based on the submission by member states of appropriate claims following payment of funds to beneficiaries.  Some &euro;180 million was the Department's forecast for EU co-funding contribution to 2014 expenditure on disadvantaged area payments, REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and an initial advance of 1.5% of the total RDP programme fund for 2014-20.</p> <p>The Department was confident of receiving payment because, as part of the CAP reform process, the Commission and the legislators in Council and Parliament had put in place a specific regulation dealing with the period between the two RDP periods to explicitly provide for the eligibility of payments in respect of old programme schemes such as REPS, AEOS and DAS to be drawn from the new programme budget.  While this allowed co-funding of schemes operated in the transitional period between programmes, it did not provide explicitly for the physical payment of that EU contribution to the member states in the year in question.  That payment depends on the Commission approval of a member states partnership agreement which was approved in mid-November and its new rural development programme, which is not yet agreed.<br/>Our estimates for 2014 were established before the completion of the programming regulations on 17 December 2013.  When framing the Estimates, it was not possible to accurately predict when Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme would be approved.  Despite ongoing intensive discussions, this is not yet the case.  As the final date for making a claim in order to recoup funding in 2014 was 10 November last, EU funds cannot now be drawn down this year.<br/>Considerable effort has been put into drawing up our rural development programme.  Following needs assessments and the extensive multi-consultative process required by the regulations, Ireland submitted its draft programme on 3 July 2014, well ahead of the end-July deadline for submission.  The Commission replied with its comments on 20 October, somewhat outside the three month period for reply, and Ireland has already submitted its comprehensive  response  to those comments and is now engaging bilaterally with the Commission to progress to the next stage of the approval process.  For its own part the, Commission is engaging with 118 other managing authorities each of which is as anxious as Ireland to conclude negotiations and implement all aspects of its new rural development programme.  To date, no other member state&rsquo;s rural development programme has yet been approved. <br/><b></b>As I said at the outset, the EAFRD receipts not claimed or received in 2014 will be received in 2015.  Accordingly the issue is concerned with timing of the receipts rather than quantity of such receipts from the EU in the multi-annual programme.  Our 2015 appropriations-in-aid include estimated receipts amounting to &euro;459.71 million, of which &euro;394.3 million is in respect of EAFRD receipts.  This amount includes the unclaimed 2014 amount of &euro;180 million.  The Department anticipates some minor current savings in elements of its administrative budget and its expenditure programmes and proposes to use &euro;1 million of these savings to offset partly the short-fall in appropriations-in-aid.  It is proposed that any other current savings which may arise in 2014 would be used to provide for expenditures which, if postponed, would have to take place in 2015. <br/>The amount being sought from the D&aacute;il is &euro;177 million, since the &euro;180 million receipts shortfall is offset slightly by higher than expected appropriations in aid in some other headings and &euro;1 million in expenditure savings.  This Supplementary Estimate for &euro;177 million is essential for my Department to deal with the shortfall in the appropriations in aid for 2014 and I strongly recommend it to the committee for support.<br/>I am happy to respond to any questions members may have.  In simple terms, we were due to get this money from the European Commission, but it was subject to approval of the rural development programme.  This has not been done in time for the budgets to be signed off so we must now factor in a higher figure than expected, with a view to getting the money back next year when the appropriations-in-aid come through once the rural development programme is finalised, hopefully in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies &Aacute;ine Collins and Anthony Lawlor.  All mobile phones should be switched off as they cause interference with recording equipment in committee rooms, even when on silent mode.</p><p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 32 - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 3 December 2014 with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 11 December 2014.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and his departmental officials to the meeting and thank them for the briefing material provided, which has been circulated to committee members.</p><p>  Item No. 1 on the agenda is the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 32 - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and I propose that the committee consider the Supplementary Estimate on a subhead-by-subhead basis.

Agreed.</p><p>  I remind members that, in accordance with standing orders, the discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate, and I ask members to indicate to which subhead they are referring when contributing.

These changes are largely technical.  We do not seek new money, but the changes are necessary to reflect changes to organisational structures that we introduced.  Members will know that many structural changes came to fruition in the course of this year.  Local enterprise offices were established as bodies within local authorities under a service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland, and Forf&aacute;s has been dissolved under legislation since August.</p> <p>Shannon Development was dissolved on 5 September and in October we merged the Competition Authority with the National Consumer Agency.  There has been a rationalisation of agencies, on which, as the committee knows, we are continuing to work.  Legislation will be brought before the House, the Workplace Relations Bill, which is another major part of the reform agenda.</p><p> The Department has taken on two additional responsibilities.  On 4 November the Government approved the establishment of the low pay commission on an interim basis, for which provision is being made in the Estimates.  In October responsibility passed to the Department under the construction contracts legislation which was passed in 2013 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will take on responsibility for these two new areas.  These proposals have been approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in line with the requirement to present the Estimates in a coherent way.  I hope they are clear to members and I am happy to answer queries on them.  I am armed with people who are experts in moving around Estimate lines.  It is to be hoped we will be able to deal with any issue that arises.</p></speech>

We had a discussion and parliamentary questions on the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s.  In that context, I will be looking to see what budget is available within the Department for independent research and what moneys have been spent within the Department since the end of July on research.</p><p>  Great improvements have been made in the past few years in the presentation of the Estimates.  However, under the subhead for Enterprise Ireland in the future I would like the Minister to outline how much goes to LEOs, rather than lumping everything together in one sum.  For us to make a comparison as to the effectiveness of the LEOs, we need to see the money for them highlighted.  </p><p>  I welcome the transfer of responsibilities for construction contracts.  However, I would like to see an action or a work plan laid out as to when the Bill will be commenced.  My last job as Minister of State was to bring it before the Seanad in March 2011 and it has still not been commenced.  It is a very good fit for the Department, given the impact on job creation.  </p><p>  On the low pay commission, I would like to see a work plan established.  What resources will it have within the Department in terms of staff?  What access will it have to a budget to fund independent research outside the Department to allow it to do its work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2014120900004#C00400"><p>Recently, the Minister said there were insufficient resources within the Department to carry out important activities such as referring a report on tax evasion to the Garda.  Given this, is there not a necessity to provide further resources for the Department?</p><p>  Deputy Dara Calleary touched on other important issues.  It is really important that the responsibilities for construction contracts are properly dealt with by the Department.  I have said previously that the sector is in major chaos, having regard to the experiences of subcontractors.  Staff working in the sector are being forced into subcontracting.  This has been ongoing for a long period.  The Bill enjoyed cross-party Oireachtas support and in the Government's An Action Plan for Jobs it was stated it would be finalised by this stage.  A code of practice was to be agreed to.  Is it yet to be finalised?  The sector is very volatile and needs focus.  Many cannot understand the hold up in completing the nomination of adjudicators.</p> <p>In regard to the placing of the advertisements for staff of the low paid commission, for which &euro;2,000 has been assigned in the Supplementary Estimate, why has this not happened to date?  If the advertisement for these positions is not placed before the end of the year there is little chance they will be in place by the first quarter next year.  Currently, Ireland has one of the worst records with regard to low pay and the number of people under-employed.  These are two significant challenges to the economy and family lives.  If we could garner that information today it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

It continues to work to an independent National Competitiveness Council which, as members will be aware, I have reconstituted and has been working on delivery of the various NCC reports on competitive challenges which are in the public domain.  It is also involved in work on the strategic policy and in bringing together the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, which is a key piece of work put together each year that seeks to identify key changes that need to be made not only in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but across the spectrum of Departments.  A key part of this work is reports already assembled by the Departments, including the work of the high level group on skills to drive forward changes in areas where we need to make changes.  Through integration within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation we have strengthened its capacity to drive change through the new process of the action plan for jobs.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Calleary that independence is important but I am also very strongly of the view that we need a strong policy capability within the Department.  It is the policy unit from which the agencies take policy direction.  We need to have the resources and capacity commensurate with that.  This is what Forf&aacute;s is about.  </p><p>  The capital allocation to the local enterprise offices, LEOs, in respect of pay and non-pay matters is &euro;18.5 million.  This year we are rolling out a number of improvements in this area, including graduate recruitment, which will strengthen the base within the LEOs.  As members will be aware, the business units of local authorities and LEO staff which have been merged have been very instrumental in particular areas, including the young entrepreneurs programme, which has been very successful and now includes more than 1,000 young people.  Deputy Lawlor, who is not here today, and others long advocated for this initiative.  It has been a huge success.  Similarly, the flow of money through the microfinance scheme has doubled in the past year.  Again, this has been pushed through the local enterprise offices.  I am keen to see innovation through those offices.  </p><p>  On the low paid commission, an allocation for next year has been agreed and will be included in the Revised Estimates which will be published in due course.  The sum of &euro;500,000 is being made available to cover independent research as well as pay provisions.  We are moving to place advertisements.  There will be three staff initially.  We will be moving to place advertisements through the Public Appointments Service for the membership of that commission.  We are anxious to progress that as quickly as possible and will hopefully do so before the end of the year, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is keen we would do.</p> <p>Construction contracts only became our responsibility in late October.  We are moving swiftly and the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, is keen to push ahead with codes of practice and recruitment of adjudicators, the full year costs for which will be around &euro;0.5 million.  It will require three staff which we will put in place.  A statutory instrument will be required in early 2015 for the commencement of the legislation.  We are moving to the appointment of arbitrators.  There is no delay in moving to implement that swiftly.</p><p> The Deputy raised an issue about insufficient resources but the Chair has indicated an invitation to discuss that issue separately.  I think we will take up the committee's request if the Deputy wishes to discuss that issue separately.</p></speech>

This is the allocation of the resources between the two headings, jobs and enterprise and innovation reflecting the specialisms within Forf&aacute;s.  The Forf&aacute;s responsibility is now being transferred to the HSA.  It gives rise to a transfer of costs but also gives rise to a revenue stream which is shown as a saving.  A5 shows an additional pension cost in respect of IDA and A6 shows a spend until the end of August when it is being dissolved, resulting in a switch of resources.</p></speech>

On A5, in terms of the capital spend, is the IDA on budget this year?  Will the Minister comment specifically on the advance units being built at Waterford, Athlone and Letterkenny and indicate if they are on schedule?  Is any planning under way for further advance units to be built in 2015 and, if so, is money being spent in that area?  How much has the IDA recouped in 2014 from companies that may not have reached their agreed targets and so on, or on property sales?</p></speech>

Recoupments are covered in own-resource income.  I can get the amount for the Deputy.  Obviously, it waxes and wanes through the course of the year but I can get the figure for the Deputy.  The advance units are well under way and will be an important dimension of regional strategy.  As the Deputy is aware I am keen to develop a regional strategy and we are trying to roll that out.</p></speech>

I am keen to play to the strengths of regions.  Like An Action Plan for Jobs it will require a reaching out to people outside of our own family of agencies.  On 19 December we will have our first stakeholder engagements in the midlands which means engaging with the wider body of interests within the region.  Our ambition is to have something like An Action Plan for Jobs at regional level to develop with other groups practical actions that can be taken.  That is very much on our radar.</p> <p>We will use a number of policy tools, of which advance units are one.  We will also plan for additional similar facilities in 2015.  The use of a specialist competitive start in the aviation sector worked very well in the mid-west because this approach has strength.

Does the Department have sufficient resources to meet its core responsibilities?</p><p>  Is a policy shift required to rebalance investment away from the IDA and towards Enterprise Ireland?</p><p>  Regional resourcing is also a key issue.  We have a two-tier economy, with Dublin developing at a different pace from the rest of the State.

That is true of every Department, and my Department manages resources as best it can.</p><p>  On the balance between IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, the latter receives a larger capital allocation as it is a much larger agency than the former.  That we spend more on Enterprise Ireland than on the IDA is as it should be.  The former has capital programmes of its own and supports research spending in a number of areas.  Unlike the IDA, it has a large team spread across a range of areas.  For example, it provides Lean programmes and management development programmes.  The IDA, which does not provide such programmes, has a responsibility for property across all of the agencies.  For this reason, it receives allocations in respect of property activities that span both agencies.  Favouritism is not shown towards any particular agency.  It is recognised in the establishment of both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland that the challenges facing Irish-owned enterprises are not the same as the challenges facing overseas enterprises.  </p><p>  Both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are growing apace, having both recorded very strong years in terms of employment performance.  In 2013, Enterprise Ireland exceeded the export target it had set itself for 2015.  I am satisfied that the programmes funded by each of the agencies are strong.  I expect Enterprise Ireland to consider collaborative activities and new ways of funding activity to have a greater regional impact.  As the Deputy is aware, I would also like the IDA to focus more strongly on regional strategy in its strategy statement.  Both agencies will shortly produce strategy statements that will reflect a much stronger regional focus.  Such focus is also reflected in our initiative to have a regional enterprise strategy in each region.</p><p>  We are trying to squeeze the best out of the resources available to us.  The matter is not as simple as reducing the allocation to the IDA or increasing the allocation to Enterprise Ireland.  The Department will fund innovative programmes and companies with ambitions to grow, regardless of the sector in which they operate.</p></speech>

We have been able to cut universal social charge, USC, rates, push out income levels at which USC cuts in, bring down the top rate of tax and push out the rate at which the top rate cuts in.

IDA Ireland may be a little bit behind that schedule but it is quite advanced in its work.</p><p>  Programme B reflects the integration of Forf&aacute;s staff into the Department and the transfer of staff from INAB, the Irish National Accreditation Board, to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  The figure of &euro;1.014 million in pay relates to the 54 Forf&aacute;s staff transferring into the Department.  Subhead B2, &euro;324,000, is non-pay, which is moving into the administrative subhead.</p><p>  There are several changes in programme C.  Subhead C5, the HSA allocation, is reduced by the unresourced income of &euro;680,000 that is coming in from INAB.  Then there is &euro;97,000 in INAB non-pay expenditure moving from subhead A3, and &euro;233,000 in pay for staff transferring to the Department from Forf&aacute;s.  Previously, INAB was under Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>  The Supplementary Estimate also deals with the National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority allocations, with less expenditure at October.  There is a nominal amount to open a new line for the low pay commission in subhead C18.  These reflect the changes we have been making.</p></speech>

This year has been horrific for farm deaths in particular, as well as workplace fatalities.  Farm safety in particular seems to have taken a backward step this past year.</p> <p>I cannot understand why, in the context of the discussion this committee had with the Department last year and what has happened this year, there would be a cut in the budget and it would not have the ability to spend that money.  </p><p> The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has not commenced its mandate with glory, given that one of its first missions was to write to the IFA in respect of the beef disputes and that it did not do anything in particular about those processing the beef and the prices they were paying the producers.  I made this comment in the D&aacute;il last year.  When people stand up for producer rights the commission gets involved, and it seems to do nothing about the actual barons in the processing industry.  That is just a comment.  I am particularly concerned about the HSA.</p></speech>

It is actually the new revenue coming in from the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, but that is the way it is presented in the accounts.  It is receiving &euro;1 million in own-resource income and extra staff.  It is receiving a non-pay allocation for its new responsibilities, but the revenue shows in the way it is presented as if it were a reduction.  This is the way Estimates are presented.  There is no diminution in its mandate.  There is a new board which is very confident that it will fulfil its mandate.  There was no criticism from the board.  There were some individual members who expressed concerns, as is their right, but the board has been a singularly effective body in managing its resources and introducing risk-based assessment and BeSMART methods to promote compliance in an effective way.</p><p>  The HSA has placed a big emphasis on farm safety, and I do not think it could be criticised in that respect.  It has been at the National Ploughing Championships.  It has taken many opportunities and has stepped up its inspections in this area.  There is increased activity in farming, and messages have repeatedly been put out warning farmers about safe practices, particularly where children are involved.  I believe the HSA is managing its resources very effectively and getting that message out.  I know that it is about building a network across the entire community in farming and getting the safety message out there.  Some people are not as attuned to the message.  One of the things the HSA has tried to do is to use non-traditional resources to access people and get its message across.  </p><p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a statutory responsibility to uphold competition law.  It cannot pick or choose those it will favour or not favour if there is a breach of the legislation, however popular or unpopular a group might be.  It has to be fair in its application of the law.  As the Deputy is aware, we will shortly publish the guidelines relating to the grocery trade and the commission will have a responsibility to ensure that the regulations are observed.  They are statutory regulations and will be enforced with the full power of the commission, so the same strong armoury will be brought to bear on anyone who breaches those guidelines.  There has been a general welcome for those in the committee.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is independent of any Minister of the day and that is how it should be.  The commission does its job and that is the way we would want it.</p></speech>

This is seen throughout the pharmaceutical and the cement industries and also in the beef industry.  Obviously this is a key competition challenge for the State, so any investment that is made in ensuring that there is proper competition and that market structures work properly has a massive effect on the competitiveness of the country.  As has been said, the beef industry strikes me as an example of a market structure that is an oligopoly.</p> <p>As such, it does not allow for strong competition between producers.  It would be an ideal space for the Government to ensure there was a more competitive element to pricing and that the price experienced by suppliers was relevant to the output they - farmers themselves - were producing .  It is also an issue for the cement industry in which typically we have more expensive cement than elsewhere.  One reason we were told the Competition Authority could not focus on this issue in the past was resources.  The authority has a very small resources element and I encourage the Minister to make a real blow to the competitive advantage of all these sectors by making sure the authority is properly resourced.</p></speech>

Ireland is in the top rank of countries and the Commission believes we are making good headway.  This is reflected in a comparison of our price indices relative to those of other European countries whereby we are improving year on year.  Our prices are still higher in significant areas but are improving across most of them, which is encouraging.  However, I agree with the Deputy that we need to have a stronger competition code.  We have put in place, with the assistance of the committee, stronger legislation and more effective legal mechanisms and slated additional resources for the investigative and prosecutory powers of the authority.  This will provide the authority with the flexibility it needs to provide for more effective enforcement of the new legislation.</p><p>  The merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency is a positive step.  They are both about effective markets and bring expertise from two sides.  It is well worth looking at some of the agency's work on price comparisons in key areas where it has highlighted differences across professions, including doctors, dentists, lawyers and financial product people.  The agency does great work that gives people a chance to take some of the power into their own hands.  That is work it will continue to do.  As always, if the Deputy has concerns about abuses of competition law in any sector, they will be investigated.  If there is a sector in which there are issues anyone believes need to be investigated, this is an independent body which will look at the case being made without fear or favour.  This is reflected in some of the earlier comments made.  It will investigate, regardless of who is involved.</p></speech>

It is receiving some staff resources and an income flow which it never had before.  The income flow was received within the INAB and part of Forf&aacute;s but now it will appear in the HSA's accounts.  From the authority's point of view, it will see an income flow, but it is not receiving it as additional resources; rather, its resources are being maintained.  It is what we usually see with appropriations-in-aid, where the appropriations-in-aid are subtracted.  If the authority has income flows, they subtracted from its expenditure.  The net expenditure is shown in the accounts at the end of the day.</p></speech>

It is about IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p>In regard to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, I know there has been a policy of incorporating the IDA and EI with embassies and consulates abroad and that there was a plan to roll out a number of consulates one of which was to be in Austin, Texas.  Is there funding in 2015 to allow the establishment of such new consulates?</p></speech>

Wherever possible, we have an Ireland House approach and I will find out for the Deputy whether both are sharing accommodation in Austin.  Wherever we can, we do that as it is an effective approach.  In any location where there is an ambassador, the ambassador is head of a team and co-ordinates the work across the agencies, not just our agencies but others like Bord Bia or tourism agencies.  There is a united front and a sharing of information and they share a programme within each market.  The export council which was established by the previous Government and is now chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, is currently reviewing country plans to see whether we can enhance programmes through the sort of approach suggested by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is estimated that one of the main drivers for this is the price of real estate.  The cost of housing and of industrial property is far lower in these areas.  This is a message for us in the context of prices in Dublin.  I know this is not strictly the responsibility of the Minister's Department, but the price of real estate is a major factor to be considered in regard to Dublin being a competitive space and place in which to do business for foreign direct investors.</p></speech>

This opens up new areas for us.  Much of our growth is in areas such as software, where there are huge opportunities.  Whatever the reasons, some companies would say it is not just this, but that these states have a developmental mandate generally, promote a good business environment and have been successful.  We certainly follow the opportunities.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and his officials.  Today's meeting gives us an opportunity to consider a Supplementary  Estimate for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Vote 25, in detail and to question the Minister of State on it.  I invite the Minister of State to address the sub-committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014120900002#A00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to present and discuss the proposed Supplementary Estimate for the 2014 Vote of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, for which I am seeking approval.  The Supplementary Estimate covers two elements of the Department&rsquo;s Vote, the Leader programme and recoupment to local authorities of costs incurred during the storms of last winter.</p><p>  One of the Department&rsquo;s key objectives in respect of community development is to improve the quality of life and welfare of communities in Ireland.  A key measure to address this is the Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13.  Since the programme commenced in 2009, over &euro;310 million has been spent, of which almost &euro;84 million has gone directly to support the creation and development of enterprises and the creation of jobs.  To date, the programme has provided assistance to almost 7,000 enterprises and led to the creation of almost 3,000 full-time jobs.  It is evident from these figures that Leader funding is having a real impact in rural Ireland and must be supported into the future.</p><p>  In the early years of the programme, due primarily to the challenging economic situation and the lack of adequate credit facilities for small enterprises, projects were slow in coming forward which in turn led to slower than desired spending.  As the programme draws towards an end and after a number of interventions, such as increasing the rate of grant aid and the introduction of additional phased payments to help with cash flow, it is fully committed. The majority of projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2014, with a small number of larger scale projects completing in early 2015.  The capital financial provision of &euro;50 million in 2014 for the Leader programme which was made available from savings on capital expenditure in 2013 carried forward to this year is not sufficient to meet commitments now arising.  The additional &euro;38 million sought in the Supplementary Estimate for Leader, when combined with the existing &euro;50 million, will bring the total provision in the subhead concerned to &euro;88 million.  When increased receipts of some &euro;16 million from EU funding are taken into account, the net additional amount needed for Leader by way of Supplementary Estimate is &euro;22 million. </p><p>  As regards the future, preparations for the 2014-20 programme are well advanced, with a draft operational programme submitted to the European Commission in July 2014.  My Department will be conducting a two-stage process to select local development strategies providing the opportunity to develop partnerships with full and comprehensive consultation, thus maintaining the integrity of a community-led local development approach.  An open call will be issued inviting all entities that meet the eligibility criteria to be considered as local action groups to express an interest in being selected to develop local development strategies for the 2014-20 programme.  I expect this process to commence in the coming months.  I can assure the sub-committee that I am committed to supporting our rural communities and to ensuring best use is made of the funding available at a local level in a co-ordinated and sustainable way. </p><p>  The other element of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the provision of funding for the repair and remediation of public infrastructure damaged or destroyed by last winter&rsquo;s severe storms, under those headings for which my Department has responsibility, namely, tourism-related infrastructure funded by local authorities, certain piers and harbours in the charge of the local authorities and other local authority facilities.  All areas of the country were affected by the storms, with damage to buildings, fallen trees and outages of the electricity and communications networks.  In the week from 30 December 2013 to 6 January 2014, high tides coincided with the storms and consequently the west coast was severely impacted, especially counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Kerry, with coastal damage and damage to the roads infrastructure.</p><p>  While every winter sees Atlantic storms and episodes of high winds, the events of last winter were exceptional.  A recent study by the Irish climate and research unit at NUI Maynooth in collaboration with the centre for hydrological and ecosystem science at Loughborough University found that the winter of 2013-14 was the stormiest for at least 143 years when storm frequency and intensity are considered together.  While there is evidence to suggest that severe storms are becoming more frequent, last winter&rsquo;s storms could be considered a one in 100 year event.  Such was the exceptional nature of the winter storms that the budgets of local authorities and funding by relevant Departments did not provide for expenditure on the scale now required for repair to damaged infrastructure. </p><p>  Estimates provided by the local authorities put a total capital cost of &euro;21.6 million on damage under the headings for which my Department has responsibility, with a further &euro;7.5 million current expenditure for clean-up works and necessary immediate costs.  To date, claims to the value of &euro;5.1 million for capital works have been received from the local authorities and claims for up to a further &euro;800,000 are anticipated in the coming weeks.   </p> <p>Current funding totalling nearly &euro;6 million has been disbursed to the local authorities by my Department for the clean-up and necessary immediate works following the storms.  The Supplementary Estimate before the committee makes the necessary finance available, totalling &euro;13 million, to provide funding to local authorities to repair the damage caused by last winter's storms and, in this way, supports the recovery of the householders and businesses that were so badly affected.</p><p> I repeat my appreciation to the committee for taking the Supplementary Estimate today.  As I have outlined, the proposal before us is necessary to provide essential funding for Leader, as a key driver of rural development, and to meet exceptional costs incurred by local authorities in dealing with last winter's storms.  I am happy to discuss and deal with any issues the Deputies raise.</p></speech>

There was very little detail in the document I received, and the Minister of State has explained the details regarding the Leader programme and the storm damage well.  I concur with what the Minister of State said about the Leader programme, particularly regarding small enterprise in rural areas.  People across the political spectrum recognise that Leader has been valuable to local communities, particularly disadvantaged areas that would not normally have access to matching funding to get projects under way.  While I am not totally <i>au fait</i>with Leader, I have seen reports that there may be cuts or changes to Leader funding in the next year.  Could the Minister of State address this?  We want the programme to continue.  The Irish model is recognised as a successful model and has been worked very well by the development companies across the State.<br/>I welcome the fact that funding to repair storm damage is being drawn down.  Although the local authorities have been very slow to call on it, it seems to be moving.  The communities will welcome the funding, particularly the coastal communities that were damaged.  It highlights the fact that in our planning and building we must provide for preventing such damage in the future.  Although the severe weather was said to have been a once in 100 years event, we have had some turbo-charged severe weather events over the past six to eight years in terms of rainfall and wind speeds.  Our building regulations should ensure people build with this in mind.</p></speech>

It impact is primarily outside the capital city and it is an extremely important fund.  There have been criticisms of the fact that in some areas there is a queue of projects, while others do not have the same throughput.  It is important that a close eye is kept on the funding and that it is distributed to schemes that are ready to roll.</p><p>  Storm damage is a feature of climate change.  In my local authority, we had three 100-year floods in one decade, which makes one question whether the measurement is always accurate.  If such events are this frequent, there is a need to anticipate and factor them in.  We should examine the areas that have constant problems with storm damage.  The OPW has done some good work.  We should anticipate weather damage and ensure the susceptible areas are not impacted rather than paying for clean-up costs afterwards.  How we spend the money is the issue.  This might not go into the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's budget but that of the OPW.</p></speech>

I welcome the Deputies' support for the Leader programme, which is recognised as a very important source of funding for rural development.  For 2015, &euro;45 million has been identified and secured to fund the Leader programme, comprising &euro;30 million from the old programme and &euro;15 million from the new programme.  There is a commitment of &euro;250 million for the seven years of the European development programme, 2014 to 2020, which is a substantial investment in rural development and is to be welcomed.  As time progresses, there will be solid engagement on how it will be rolled out and invested.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s points on oversight, keeping a close eye on how funding is spent and getting value for money are very important.  We should constantly evaluate how public funds are spent and there are some very good examples from past Leader programmes of funding being spent very beneficially for rural communities.  There have also been some examples of poor use of funds, and we must learn from them.  The call for new local development strategies will be put out very soon.  They will be evaluated by an independent evaluation committee which will lead to the establishment of the local action groups, from qualifying people who will know full well how best to spend the funds.  This can be a very positive programme and I will welcome further engagement on it as the Leader programme is rolled out.  I note the Chairman's points and my Department's officials will make every effort to resolve any outstanding issues of concern.  I welcome any continuous engagement on it.</p><p>  Deputy Stanley made a point on building regulations and weather.  Climate change brings new challenges, and the improved building regulations the Government has adopted have led to better inspection regimes, and I hope they will lead to better standards.  We need to build sustainable buildings that will be energy efficient and withstand any weather.  We are all experienced enough to learn from the bad experiences with building contractors who leave much to be desired regarding standards.  We also need to learn about the implications of development happening on flood plains and similar areas.  We do not help ourselves by allowing this to happen.  We can learn much about how best to plan for the future.</p><p>  I note Deputy Catherine Murphy's points on storm damage.  I described what happened last year as a one in 100 years event.  None of us wants to see more hard storms.  It is a challenge when it happens.</p> <p>I take this opportunity to thank all those on the ground, especially local authority staff and officials and those in the emergency services, who responded at that time.  The Department has a co-ordination task force led by Se&aacute;n Hogan that has put in place a strategy to deal with crises in terms of emergencies.  We learn all the time but we also need to evaluate all the time.  I am satisfied that this funding has been provided to meet the needs of local authorities and our citizens.  I thank the members of committee for their support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014120900003#B00500"><p>I am here this evening to present to the committee a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;22.25 million, gross &euro;33 million, in respect of Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, and &euro;200,000 in respect of the Public Appointments Service.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote arises from the fact that there have been approximately 250 more retirements than we had forecast at the beginning of the year, which is around 280 more than the 2013 full-year outturn.  The additional &euro;230,000 for the Public Appointments Service, PAS, arises from increased activity as a result of additional recruitment that has now begun.<br/>In net terms, the full cost of these Supplementary Estimates is covered by savings elsewhere in the public expenditure and reform Votes, so no additional money is required.<br/>The superannuation and retired allowances Vote provides primarily for pension and lump sum payments for civil servants and pension payments for dependants.  Vote 12, as the Chairman will appreciate, is a demand-led Vote.  This makes it difficult to estimate expenditure from one year to the next, having regard to a variety of changeable circumstances.  I will give some examples of things we can only estimate and the variables that cannot be exactly forecast at the beginning of a year.  These include the number of established civil servants who will opt for voluntary retirement having attained the minimum pension age but before reaching the compulsory retirement age; the number of persons who will opt to take cost-neutral early retirement; the number of persons who will retire on grounds of ill-health; the number of former employees who will become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement; the average pension benefits - lump sum and pension - that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year, depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees; and the number of cessations of pensions in any given year.<br/>The 2014 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;444.8 million.  This represented an increase of &euro;17.096 million, or 4%, over the 2013 outturn of &euro;427.7 million.  The Estimate anticipated a level of 850 retirements against the 820 actual retirements that took place in 2013.  As noted, however, the interaction of a range of variables that I have set out will determine the expenditure on the Vote.  This means that each year is unique in terms of expenditure and there is no direct correlation from one year to the next.  By way of illustration, a significant saving arose on the Vote in 2013, when we overestimated what we would need by &euro;46 million.<br/>While the 2014 Estimate anticipated 850 retirements, around 1,100 people have retired to date, an increase of some 30% over what we anticipated.  The impact of higher than estimated retirement levels may or may not have a marked impact on subheads concerned with pensions in payment, in that expenditure on each subhead is a function of both the level of new pensions coming into payment each year and the level of cessations of existing pensions in payment during the same year.  Clearly, we cannot anticipate the numbers who will pass to their eternal reward.<br/>This is not the case with lump sum payments.  Increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4 and to a lesser extent on subhead A5 in the context of increasing the number of associated one-off lump payments that must be made.  Subhead A4, which provides for lump sum payments to established civil servants, is therefore the key driver of expenditure in any given year.  By late November, more than &euro;75 million had been expended from subhead A4, for which the 2014 Estimate was &euro;58.18 million - an excess to date of some &euro;17 million.  Further expenditure of &euro;10 million by year end is estimated, resulting in an overall excess of about &euro;27 million on the subhead<font color="#0000FF">.  </font>By late November, &euro;21.4 million had been expended from subhead A5, which covers the payment of lump sums, pensions in payment and the pensions of spouses of unestablished civil servants.  In the 2014 Estimate, we had an allocation of &euro;20 million.  Further expenditure of &euro;1.5 million is anticipated, giving an overall excess of &euro;3 million.<br/>It is now estimated that gross expenditure for 2014 may be in the region of &euro;476 million - as I have said, some &euro;31 million more than the gross Estimate of &euro;444.800 million as voted by the Oireachtas on 18 December last year.  <br/>In the context, however, that a number of Departments pay pension lump sums directly to the individuals and then recoup the money from my Department via Vote 12, it is considered prudent to provide for a sum in excess of &euro;31 million to cater for the possibility that Departments have underestimated the level of lump sum payments payable before December.</p> <p>In order to ensure that the required funding is voted before excess costs associated with the additional retirements accrue to Vote 12, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;33 million gross is now being sought.</p><p> The committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  </p><p> Appropriations-in-aid for 2014 were estimated at &euro;82.25 million.  Any additional receipts over the 2014 estimate - that is, if we get more than the &euro;82.25 million in appropriations-in-aid - will have the effect of reducing the gross Supplementary Estimate further.  To date, there have been receipts of some &euro;95.4 million.  Clearly, the appropriations-in-aid are larger than we have anticipated, so the gross amount will be mitigated to the degree I have said.</p><p> As expenditure on this Vote is influenced by the number of persons who exercise the option to retire before reaching compulsory retirement age, it is not possible to estimate the numbers who might choose to exercise that option over, say, a four-month period between September and December 2014 and the associated level of pension benefits that would be payable.  It is therefore only now, towards the end of the year, that an accurate assessment may be made and an appropriate level of additional funding sought.</p><p> It must also be recognised that while some additional funding is being requested for the Vote in 2014, the fact that more people than had been anticipated have opted to retire this year has an impact on the drive to reduce numbers in the Civil Service, which is part of the overall strategy too.</p><p> We are also seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;230,000 under Vote 17, the Public Appointments Service.  This is a small enough additional amount in respect of this year.  Following the easing of the moratorium, as I explained to the House during the previous two Question Time debates, a number of traditional large-volume recruitment campaigns have, thankfully, been launched this year and will continue next year.  The absence of opportunities in recent years to recruit new applicants has ensured that this year, when we reopened the recruiting campaigns, there was a very high number of applicants.  By way of indication, the Public Appointments Service anticipates that in excess of 90,000 applications were received by it this year.  The Supplementary Estimate is made up of non-pay costs covering the testing and general assessment costs associated with that increased level of activity.</p><p> I am happy to answer questions from the committee on those two Votes.</p></speech>

First, on the details of that big figure - the Minister might tell me if the figures I am putting to him are correct - the Minister said in his opening statement that 820 people had retired in 2013.  I am looking at the Estimates figure and the outturn for 2013 was &euro;48 million in that area under Vote A5.  Would that be correct?  I want to make sure I am correct in my questions.</p></speech>

The figure is also 280 higher than the 2013 figure.  This is the principal reason given by the Minister in his opening statement for the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;27 million he is seeking.  Based on his figure of 250 more retirements than anticipated, the average cost per additional retirement is &euro;108,000 per person.  Last year, the average cost of retirement per person was &euro;56,536.  According to the Estimate provided at the beginning of 2014, the Minister had budgeted for 850 retirements at a cost of &euro;58 million.  According to the Supplementary Estimate, there will be 1,100 retirements costing &euro;87 million this year, which gives an average cost per retirement of &euro;79,000.  The Minister is saying the additional 250 retirements require a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;27 million.</p></speech>

Before the Supplementary Estimate is sent back to the D&aacute;il, I ask the Minister to provide details of this mix, specifically in terms of the grades and years of service of the 820 people who retired from the public service last year at a cost of &euro;48 million and the 1,100 public servants who retired this year at a cost of &euro;87 million, which gives an average of &euro;79,000.  By definition, the age and grade mix will be different.  The issue, however, is that it is a whopping difference in this case.  Before the D&aacute;il votes on the matter, I want the Minister to provide details on the retirement mix last year <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the retirement mix this year.  If the Minister has the relevant documentation with him, Deputies will take time to read it.  However, we want this information before the Vote is submitted to the D&aacute;il.  Does the Minister have information on the mix and the reason for the variation in costs?</p></speech>

The figure in question varies significantly from one year to the next, and average figures are provided in the documentation.  The expenditure trend for subhead A4 shows a low of &euro;39 million in 2005 and a high of &euro;140 million in another year.  The  figure is not the same in any two given years, as it depends on the mix of retirements.  One cannot take segments of the overall figure and arrive at an average, as the Deputy has done in providing an average figure for the first 850 retirements and a higher average figure for the subsequent top-up figure.  If one wishes to arrive at an average for a given year, one must take the average of the total figure.  The average will depend entirely on skills mix, experience and so forth.  I will be pleased to provide the Deputy with the relevant material before the Supplementary Estimate is sent back to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

The logic of the Minister's argument is that he should have pointed out in his opening statement that the Supplementary Estimate is required because 250 more retirements occurred than were provided for and the different mix of ages, grades and experience among this cohort of 850 was not factored in to the figure provided at the beginning of the year.</p></speech>

Unless one has the Oracle of Delphi, one cannot know in advance who will retire or become ill and take early retirement in the course of a year.  The mix is different every year.  I do not know the reason the Deputy is being deliberately contentious.  I have read some of his recent statements and perhaps the porridge he is eating has caused him to be particularly contentious about various issues.  This issue is straightforward.  While individual files are subject to confidentiality, I will provide a breakdown of the grades of those who have retired in the past year.  There is nothing untoward or odd about the issue and I do not understand the reason the Deputy is being deliberately contentious about it.</p></speech>

We also know that a specific group of people in the system are over-pensioned and receive excessive gratuities when they leave the public service.  As the Minister acknowledged, we last discussed this matter in 2012, when 84 pensions in excess of &euro;100,000 were being paid.  Since raising this matter with the Minister, I and others have engaged in some toing and froing with him on the issue, during which he has cited property rights and constitutional considerations.  Like Deputy Sean Fleming, I expect the Minister to produce figures when he comes before the select sub-committee seeking additional money.  Not only should he have broken down the subhead by providing information on lump sums, he should also have provided detail on the 1,100 persons who retired, including information on grades, the lump sums to which they were entitled and the level of their pension payments.  One would expect this to be a matter of course when the Minister comes before us seeking additional moneys.  Do any of the officials have the relevant information and, if so, will they provide it to members now?  Such information should be provided when the issue is under discussion.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that one of my first actions on becoming Minister was to impose a new ceiling on wage levels in the Civil Service and public service generally.  For example, we set a new ceiling of &euro;200,000 for the Taoiseach.  This figure was further significantly reduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, and the salaries of all senior civil servants have been reduced to below that level.  The reduction for some senior officials was 35%, which will obviously have an impact on their pensions.</p><p>  On the people who have retired, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, which commenced in January 2011, imposed significant reductions in public service pensions that were in payment at the time through the public service pension reduction, PSPR. </p> <p>Bands were used in a progressive fashion and I subsequently amended the legislation because I did not think enough was being taken from those paid the largest pensions, given the emergency.  There was legal advice saying that pension entitlements are preserved property rights so I had to be careful.  Some retired people threatened legal action and I was concerned about putting the entire FEMPI legislation at risk but I was advised that people in receipt of pensions over &euro;100,000 could be made subject to a 20% reduction on the portion above that figure.</p><p> Not many pensions fall into this category and my replies to constant questions on this matter over the past two years may be read on the record of the Oireachtas - I gave details of every individual pensioner.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming raised the issue of averaging the payments and how that might work out.  I would have thought that if the Minister is to come before the committee seeking additional moneys he would, as a matter of course, be able to give us a profile of the 1,100 people we are discussing.  Who are they, what levels were they at and how do they fit?  I do not propose that the Minister go through each individual pensioner.</p></speech>

On 28 November 2012, the last time we dealt with this Supplementary Estimate, we had a discussion on the number of people in receipt of pensions in different bands.  On that occasion the then Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, supplied answers on the basis of parliamentary questions that had been raised.  He did not give exhaustive answers but he had more information than the Minister has today.  We certainly need that information and I think the Minister should have it with him as a matter of course when he comes looking for additional money.</p></speech>

I should add, these people have a legitimate entitlement to these pensions and those now retiring have been subjected to pay reductions under the FEMPI legislation to date.</p></speech>

I sought figures and information under the A4 subhead and I stress I do not want to see names.  I do not think anyone could suggest that we would ever seek names but I want to see the lump sums of over &euro;100,000.  If there were any such lump sums, how many were there?  I want the list of the ten highest lump sums to go in descending order and I also want a list of the ten lowest.  We need to get a feel for what the highest and lowest amounts were, though I am sure there are far more people at the lower end.  People would like to know how many people received over &euro;100,000 and what the ten highest figures were so these are the specific details we request.</p><p>  My next question relates to pensions, superannuation allowances, the Haddington Road agreement and so on.  In 2013 the Haddington Road agreement placed a reduction on pensions of over &euro;32,500 and the level of this reduction was half of what applied to those on pensions of over &euro;65,000.  This question relates to the overall superannuation Vote.  How many retired public servants were affected by the pension reduction and what savings were made?  In other words, how many people were affected by the cap of &euro;32,500 and what savings did the cap achieve in 2014?  Again, I do not seek names but I want a list of the ten people most affected by this measure.  This might help us empathise with those who suffered most.  We have discussed these matters under the A4 subhead and the main A1 subhead, though only a small Supplementary Estimate in the region of &euro;316,000 applies to the latter.</p><p>  My questions so far address pensions and the impact of the Haddington Road agreement.  Perhaps I am the sort of halfwit or dimwit that was mentioned earlier but I wish to clarify that the A5 subhead mostly deals with unestablished officers and the A4 subhead relates to established officers.  Can the Minister explain the difference for the halfwits out there?  The figures today show &euro;27 million for established civil servants under the A4 subhead and a requirement for an extra &euro;3 million for unestablished officers.  Can the Minister explain this for the public, if not for my benefit? </p></speech>

There are two types of deductions and I referred to one in my answer to Deputy McDonald on FEMPI legislation and pension payments.  The reduction Deputy Fleming refers to, relating to pensions of over &euro;32,500, was introduced in the most recent FEMPI legislation and sought to mirror the reduction relating to &euro;65,000 and people still working.  I have answered questions on this and can get the details, though it is not relevant to this Vote.  If it is a matter of interest I will send the information to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Unestablished civil servants can be appointed to statutory positions and unestablished positions, such as messenger, usher and so on.  There is a range of unestablished civil servant positions.  If I recall correctly, officials of this House were once called neither civil servants nor unestablished civil servants but something completely different.  Perhaps the clerk of the committee can advise on this.</p></speech>

I thought the Deputy was asking how many people worked in PAS.  The Deputy is asking how many clerical positions we are going to fill.  It depends.  I indicated in a parliamentary reply that because of the speed with which we established PeoplePoint in my Department, for example, there is a number of people appointed there on contract.  I want to regularise this.  Therefore, I will be using the panel to backfill positions there.  As we expand, I will again use the panel.  Other Departments will also be recruiting.  The exact number to be recruited is not clear yet.  However, there will be a large panel established from which it will be possible to draw.  As I have indicated, one thing I want to do next year is devolve authority to Departments and agencies to operate within their own pay ceiling but to be flexible in terms of the skills mix they determine is required.  They might determine to hire additional clerical officers rather than a more senior grade.  As long as they stay within agreed pay norms, that will be acceptable.</p></speech>

I am not finished.  I will be upfront about this.  The Chairman was probably just about to read the statement that we have now concluded our consideration of the Estimates.  Until I receive the information, I am not happy to conclude this process.  I will have no problem if I get the information this Thursday or Friday, or even next Monday or Tuesday, with coming back for a minute to conclude the business.  However, in respect of a large bulk of the questions I asked, the information is said to be on its way.  When I receive it, I will be happy to say we have completed our consideration.  I am not happy to sign off on this in advance of receiving the information because so much of what I have asked has yet to come to me.  I would not need the Minister to come back.  However, if there is a routine meeting next week, the Committee can - just for five minutes before the routine meeting - sign off on this then, without having to trouble the Minister.</p></speech>

The committee is only empowered to &quot;consider&quot; the Estimates and cannot alter, amend or vote on them.  The committee must send a message to the D&aacute;il when it has completed its consideration of the Estimates and it cannot decide not to do this.  Under Standing Order 87 the message must be to the effect that the Select Committee has completed its consideration of an Estimate referred to it by the D&aacute;il.  There is no provision for the expression of an opinion by the committee on the Estimates in its message.  As the Standing Order prescribes the nature of the message to be sent, the content is not a matter for decision by the committee.</blockquote></p></speech>

That is precisely why I phrased what I said the way I said it.  I do not want to amend the Estimates or change the Estimates.  I do not want to not agree the Estimates; we will vote on that in the Chamber.  However, all I am saying is that we are not ready yet to send the message to the clerk of the D&aacute;il stating that we have completed our consideration.  I want the sending of the message held over until we receive the information.  I will be quite happy to come in here another time, for two minutes, and agree to send a message to the D&aacute;il that we have completed our consideration.  Hopefully, we can do it without having to ask the Minister back in.</p></speech>

There is one request he has made of me, namely, to give him a structural breakdown of those people who have an entitlement to a pension.  He does not disagree that they are all valid nor that they all should be paid.  All he wishes to know is the categories of pensioner, that is how many at each grade retired during the course of 2014.  That is one simple question he has asked.  There is no phalanx of information that he requires. We will provide the information sought.  I would be anxious that we would proceed with the Estimates so that we can ensure that everyone is paid.  People are entitled to be paid before Christmas.</p></speech>

That is a red herring.  This is not valid until it is voted for in the D&aacute;il, and that will not be until next week at the earliest.

There is a Supplementary Estimate under sub-heading A1.  This deals with superannuation allowances, compensation allowances, pensions and children's allowances.  There is a requirement under that for an extra &euro;316,000.  That is the question I asked about pensions.  Under sub-heading A2, there is a Supplementary Estimate required of &euro;808,000.  This sub-heading deals with payments under the contributory pension scheme for spouses of civil servants, children of civil servants and members of the judiciary and court officers.  We have discussed sub-heading A4 at length.  I have referred to sub-heading A5, which deals with un-established people, and the Minister is sending me a list.  All the other sub-headings are coming in with a Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;256,000, bringing the figure up to &euro;31 million gross.  The big element is sub-heading A4.  The other ones, to my knowledge, are also there.</p></speech>

The committee is only empowered to consider the Estimates and cannot alter, amend or vote on them.  The committee must send a message to the D&aacute;il when it has completed its consideration of the Estimates and it cannot decide not to do this.  Under Standing Order 87 the message must be to the effect that the Select Committee has completed its consideration of an Estimate referred to it by the D&aacute;il.  There is no provision for the expression of an opinion by the committee on the Estimates in its message.  As the Standing Order prescribes the nature of the message to be sent, the content is not a matter for decision by the committee.</blockquote></p></speech>

In a previous situation in which the information was not provided as promised, the Ceann Comhairle in the D&aacute;il told me I had no mechanism to deal with the matter and that I should not have let the matter go out of committee until I was satisfied.

The Cabinet is still meeting to discuss other items, among them the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill for next year.</p><p>  Before I address the Supplementary Estimate, I will briefly outline the funding position for 2015.  Since my appointment as Minister for Health, I have said on more than one occasion that my first priority is to achieve a realistic budget for the health service.  I believe we have achieved this in budget 2015, with an increase in the Exchequer allocation of &euro;305 million when compared to the allocation for 2014.  We have also identified one-off increased projected revenues of some &euro;330 million and savings and efficiencies of at least &euro;130 million.  Taken together, this means that the HSE will have over &euro;750 million more to fund services in 2015 compared to over &euro;300 million less in 2014 versus the allocation for the previous year.  This is a significant turnaround.</p><p>  The total additional funding being sought for the HSE for 2014 is &euro;680 million.  However, I intend to allocate savings of &euro;4 million, expected in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Vote, to meet the HSE's requirements, giving a net cost to the Exchequer of &euro;676 million.  While this is a significant amount, it should be viewed in the context of the challenging environment in which health services have operated this year and for several years.  Increasing demand owing to demographic pressures, a growing and ageing population, the absolute need to prioritise patient safety, as well as demanding targets for savings and service delivery, has meant that the challenges facing the health service in 2014 were significant from the outset.  The service has faced unprecedented challenges for several years as a direct consequence of the great recession.  I am pleased that I was able to achieve an increase in the total financial resources available to the health service in 2015, the first increase in funding since 2008.</p> <p>Daily demands on the health service are enormous and growing.  Drivers of demand and cost include our rising and ageing population and the increase in chronic conditions.  Advances in medical technology come at a high price.  Our progress in the diagnosis of and screening for cancers and chronic diseases means that more people require treatment.  Health services around the world are struggling with rising costs and Ireland is no exception.  We must recognise the additional resource demands that arise as a result of these new pressures.  <br/>In 2015 we will have more control of resources in the health service, with the HSE continuing to develop and strengthen its accountability framework.  The management of health spending within available resources next year will require an exceptional management focus, with strict adherence by all services and budget holders to their allocations.  At my request, the 2015 service plan reflects a new and enhanced accountability framework which makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to deliver on the targets set out in the service plan.  A balanced score card will be in place against which managers will have their performance managed across the areas of access to services, the safety of these services, finance and the workforce.  The new accountability framework describes in detail the means by which the HSE, in particular hospital groups and community health care organisations, will be held to account in 2015.<br/>A key feature of the new accountability framework will be the introduction of formal performance agreements.  These agreements will operate at lower levels to underpin and reflect the legislative framework, including the service plan, between the Minister and the HSE directorate.A feature of the accountability framework will be explicit arrangements for escalating actions to address areas of underperformance.<br/>A new service arrangement and grant aid agreement will be put in place for 2015 and will continue to be the principal accountability agreement between the HSE and section 38 and 39 funded agencies. <br/>As I indicated, we have achieved a more realistic budget for 2015.  I will insist that, in return, those who hold budget responsibility must plan and deliver services within the resources available.  This challenge has been taken up in the 2015 service plan and I welcome the very strong commitment from the director general and his management team to deliver services in line with the resources set out in the national service plan<b>.</b><br/>The Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014 provides for the HSE to be funded through the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Health from January 2015.  The return of the Vote will be realised in the context of the 2015 Revised Estimates.  This reform requires the establishment and implementation of a new statutory financial governance framework to govern the funding of the HSE and ensure proper controls are in place on expenditure.<br/>I will set out the items which make up this year's Supplementary Estimate, the first of which are the costs associated with increased service provision.  Several factors have contributed to the total expenditure overrun of &euro;510 million for service provision, primarily expenditure on acute hospital services, arising from factors such as the growth in emergency admissions, the treatment of more elderly and complex patients and an increase in bed days delivered. <br/>Hospitals are projected to be almost &euro;270 million in deficit by the end of the year.  This is the biggest single element of the &euro;510 million deficit.  Last year's hospital deficit was &euro;180 million and it was only possible to deal with &euro;100 million of this in setting the budgets for 2014, leaving an ongoing underlying incoming problem of approximately &euro;80 million in 2014.  Hospital costs have grown by approximately &euro;72 million in 2014; hospital workload has also grown, with the numbers of bed days and day cases up by 3%, emergency admissions up by 3% and very elderly patients, that is, those aged over 85 years, up by 4.5%.  These overruns relate in the main to pay and salaries of front-line and clinical staff, medicines, equipment and devices for hospitals. <br/>There is a projected deficit of some &euro;95 million in the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  This comprises a deficit of &euro;50 million on schemes administered centrally, including the general medical service payments scheme and the long-term illness scheme, and a deficit of &euro;45 million on locally administered schemes.  Local  schemes are demand driven and the growth year on year represents growth in key areas such as hepatitis C and HIV drugs administered in a hospital setting and aids and appliances to assist elderly and other individuals to stay at home longer or to enable their discharge from hospital.<br/>In finalising the Revised Estimates Volume and national service plan for 2014 a number of variables, including the unspecified pay savings and decision by the Government to amend the probity target for medical cards, resulted in the amount provided in the subhead for the PCRS being understated by approximately &euro;70 million.</p> <p>Therefore, while the overrun on PCRS is &euro;95 million, the adjustment required in subhead C1 is &euro;165 million, but this is purely a technical issue.  Pension costs, including lump sums, will have a deficit in the region of &euro;30 million.  The scale and number of retirements in any financial period is difficult to predict with certainty, and in line with some other Departments with large numbers of staff, additional funding is required to meet the pension entitlements of those retiring.  Expenditure on social care services arising from the demand for a range of community supports and services gives rise to a net requirement of &euro;40 million additional funding.  This includes, for example, home helps, home care packages, disability services and nursing homes.</p><p> Payments are made by the HSE to the State Claims Agency for clinical indemnity, public liability and other awards and settlements.  An additional requirement of &euro;54 million is estimated.  The estimated cost of the clinical indemnity scheme in 2014 was &euro;98 million.  That estimate was based on the reasonable assumption that the High Court, as had been its practice since 2010, would continue to rule settlements for catastrophic injuries on a periodic payment order basis, in anticipation of proposed legislation.  However, in the absence of this legislation, the High Court, in a number of catastrophic birth injury cases, did not make settlements on a periodic payment basis and converted previous settlements back to traditional lump sum settlements.  This has resulted in an additional &euro;52 million being required in 2014.  Legislation on the introduction of periodic payment orders is being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am informed this legislation will be progressed in early 2015. </p><p> In addition to this legislation, health service providers are working to minimise risk and to support an open, timely and consistent approach to communicating with service users and their families when things go wrong in health care.  This is called open disclosure.  The HSE has developed, in conjunction with the State Claims Agency, a national policy and national guidelines on open disclosure, with supporting documents that include a patient information leaflet, a staff support booklet and a staff briefing guide.  The HSE and the State Claims Agency launched these documents in November 2013.</p><p> The timing of income collection and working capital requirements associated with prior years results in a further &euro;108 million cash requirement in 2014.  During the course of 2014, the potential to achieve significantly accelerated payments from health insurers has been pursued, and this is now likely to take place in 2015.  In addition, while the UK receipts are short by &euro;9 million in 2014, an increase from this source is expected in 2015.  There are accumulated prior year deficits in the voluntary sector which, although they have no effect on the 2014 income and expenditure position, have an impact on overall cash requirements to the extent that they cannot be fully managed through working capital.</p><p> The Supplementary Estimate also seeks an additional &euro;5 million for the early access programme that has been put in place for patients with hepatitis C who require immediate access to new direct-acting antiviral drugs.  In layman&rsquo;s terms, these are oral medicines that eliminate hepatitis C in 90% of patients treated.  The early access programme will apply to a group of patients identified by medical specialists in hepatology.  Currently, it is expected that 108 patients will be approved for inclusion in the early access programme.  It being implemented now and the HSE is communicating directly with the relevant hospitals and clinicians about reimbursement arrangements.  Some &euro;30 million has been provided in 2015 for these new medicines, and the funding sought in the Supplementary Estimate will allow us to prioritise the most urgent cases this year.  In fact, the first patients were treated last week.  A number of powerful new direct-acting antiviral therapies are being licensed in Europe for people with hepatitis C.  As with other countries, Ireland must ensure that access to high-quality treatments such as these is managed in order to prioritise access for patients who can benefit most, while ensuring that the financing model is sustainable and affordable.  The aim is to provide access for as many patients as possible as soon as possible.</p><p> There has been a continuing upward trend in delayed discharges since the beginning of the year, with approximately 850 delayed discharges reported nationally - the equivalent of a large hospital.  There are people, mainly elderly, who have been medically discharged but remain in hospital while they wait placement in a nursing home, or appropriate supports to get home.  Clearly this is having a knock-on effect on both hospital emergency department overcrowding and levels of elective admissions, and, by extension, waiting lists.  In response to these concerns, the 2015 service plan includes an additional &euro;25 million to help address this.</p> <p>It includes &euro;10 million to support an additional 300 long-stay care places under the nursing home support-fair deal scheme, which will reduce waiting times under this scheme to 11 weeks.  Some &euro;8 million is being provided for 115 short-stay beds, including the opening in the Spring of Mount Carmel as a community hospital for Dublin.  An additional &euro;5 million is being provided to support an additional 400 home care packages and &euro;2 million is being provided for expansion of the community intervention teams to deal with 2,000 referrals each year.  This involves reducing the need to admit patients to hospital from nursing homes and enabling them to get home sooner by sending nurses to their homes to administer intravenous medicines and carry out check-ups, etc.  </p><p> Addressing delayed discharges is not a matter that can wait until the new year given, as I speak, the level of overcrowding in our emergency departments.  For this reason, I am seeking an additional &euro;3 million for the early commencement of this initiative from December 2014.  With the approval of the sub-committee and a little luck we will start to see pressures ease as early as next week.  </p><p> Given the extent of changes faced by our health services in 2014 the additional funding being requested through this Supplementary Estimate is necessary.  Our health service has been through a challenging year.  My intention in bringing this Supplementary Estimate is to eliminate the incoming deficit for the HSE as it faces into 2015.  This combined with the 2015 budget provision will provide us with a realistic basis on which to deliver existing levels of service next year and to introduce enhancements in some priority areas.  </p><p> I seek the sub-committee's approval for this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 39.</p></speech>

I have no issue in agreeing to the Supplementary Estimate but I do have some specific questions for the Minister.<br/>First, the Minister in his concluding remarks accepted that this Supplementary Estimate will enable the HSE to go forward into 2015 without the baggage of significant so-called overspend in 2014.  He also referred in his contribution to the passage earlier this year of legislation under the stewardship of his predecessor which provides that so-called overruns or overspends in 2015 by each of the component parts of the health service will be carried forward to 2016.  While this is laudable and acceptable in the context of what is proposed today, given the great difficulty of properly projecting footfall, throughput, usage, patient presentation, etc., how realistic is it to categorically state that there will be no Supplementary Estimate required in 2015 and that the overspends will become the first charge on the new provision for the subsequent year?<br/>I would like to address a number of other points made in the Minister's presentation.  In regard to the service arrangements and grant aid agreement for the coming year <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the HSE and section 38 and 39 funded agencies, perhaps the Minister will expand on the status of the service arrangements and grant aid agreement, including whether they have been finalised and are already in place.</p> <p>What is the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the sections 38 and 39 funded agencies?  It is an issue the sub-committee has not had a substantive opportunity to address in a timely way.  It was taken from us by another committee of this institution.  In the next paragraph a very strong assertion is made <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the very first point I raised where it states: &quot;I will be insisting that in return those who hold budget responsibility must plan and deliver services within the resources available.&quot;<br/>The hospital element is projected to be &euro;270 million of the total by the end of this month and is the largest single element of the projected deficit of &euro;510 million.  The percentage increases which have already been recorded in 2014 could not have been so accurately envisaged 12 months ago.  The numbers of bed days and day cases have increased by 3%, emergency admissions by 3% and elderly patients aged over 85 years by 4.5%.  What certainty can the delegation have that we will not see a repetition in the course of the year, given the current demographics, an increasingly ageing population, greater demands and the fact that people are living longer and presenting with a variety of challenges in terms of their health needs?  Will the delegation accept that significant overspends in 2015 and 2016 will not only have a crippling effect on the budgets of these hospital sites but will also have a serious impact on the quality of services and the general morale of those involved in management and front-line provision and that holding to this template will ultimately have a significant negative impact on the quality of the service being provided?  <br/>State Claims Agency payments have increased by &euro;54 million on what was projected.  I note the explanation for this.  Will the delegation advise us as to at what point is the preparation of the legislation on periodic payment orders?  It was indicated that it would be progressed in early 2015.  To what does this translate?  When does the delegation expect to see publication of the legislation?  Does it expect it to be enacted in 2015?  <br/>On the additional &euro;5 million for antiviral drugs for people with hepatitis C, it is very important that we provide for the advances made in medicine which can have a very positive impact on the lives of individual sufferers across a range of areas.  We should respond to, accept and warmly adopt these advances in the interests of our fellow citizens.  Will the delegation indicate where it stands on the drug Fampyra for sufferers of multiple sclerosis?  I make the case that after the trial involving some 1,500 MS sufferers, there is undoubtedly a sustained case to provide for access to this very important drug that clearly makes a difference for a significant number of them.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the drug is not effective for all who suffer the challenges imposed by multiple sclerosis.</p><p> If I could just conclude with this point, money follows the patient.  We have an increasing and aging population and I have never opposed a Supplementary Estimate for health services.  I believe that health services must be demand-led and we must be prepared and willing to respond.  In this spirit, I conclude by saying that the signalled intent of the legislation I opposed and referred to earlier will spell dark and difficult days for our health service after 2015 if it is not revisited in the intervening period.  I appeal to the Minister to use his position to re-evaluate this issue.  I do not believe in wastefulness, inefficiency and unconditional bail-outs but, when it comes to quality support and care for people, I believe we must be able to respond appropriately.  I will support the Minister's request for an additional &euro;680 million.</p></speech>

The figure of &euro;680 million is significant and there is an overrun of &euro;510 million in the HSE but we in this committee predicted as much last year.  To some extent it is a case of here we go again.  Many of us feel we were almost ridiculed when we raised issues that the Minister now highlights and it is no surprise to us that a Supplementary Estimate of this magnitude is before us today in December 2014.</p><p>  I hope the Minister understands that the huge cutbacks in the health service, of around &euro;3.5 billion and 12,000 members of staff in recent years, have put the system under huge pressure.  The Irish health service is close to crisis on a daily basis with significant difficulties across the board.  I have read the Minister's statement but my own experience tells me that much of this relates to the general hospital system, of which I know a little.  In layman's terms, the scenario painted by the Minister in his statement relates closely to the experience at South Tipperary General Hospital, my local hospital.  I managed that hospital for 21 years and it is a progressive institution, as it has always been, as there is good co-operation throughout the various categories of staff.  Staff members at consultant level are good and everyone puts their shoulders to the wheel but they are all under huge pressure.  The picture painted by the Minister is what happens on a daily basis at South Tipperary General Hospital because activity levels have been growing for some years.  </p> <p>The hospital is now to all intents and purposes a type of regional hospital with significant admissions from north Tipperary and parts of counties Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.  It is running at approximately 120% capacity on a daily basis.  That creates huge pressures, one of which is on the accident and emergency department.  In 2013, a total of 3,100 patients had to be placed on trolleys in the department, which was up from 750 in 2011.  Delayed discharges are also a problem.  The hospital put forward various plans to tackle this, including the provision of additional consultant staff in the accident and emergency department.  Thankfully, that has been approved and temporary appointments will be made shortly.  However, additional nursing and support staff and beds are also required.</p><p> The HSE, locally and regionally, made a recommendation to the Minister to open 12 step down beds in Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.  Nothing has happened in this regard over the past 12 months.  I welcome the initiative relating to additional community intervention teams because that was another proposal put forward by hospital management and I hope they will be put in place in south Tipperary.</p><p> We have been here previously and we predicted this would happen last year.  This is a significant Supplementary Estimate and I will support the Minister but next year's Estimate is unlikely to be much different from this year's.  Budgets for general hospitals have overrun by &euro;270 million this year.  Next year's allocation will not be adequate either and a further Supplementary Estimate will be required.</p><p> It is the first time I have met the Minister at the committee or in the House since his appointment.  I congratulate him and wish him well.  If he would like to see the picture he has painted in practice, I would invite him to South Tipperary General Hospital because it is a microcosm of what he has outlined-----</p></speech>

If it did, they would have been solved a long time ago.</p> <p>The real work is to be done here and in the Department.  I shall set aside as much time as I can to travel around the place.

The HSE will start with a clean slate in 2015.  There are some deficits in the voluntary hospitals that they carry forward from year to year but that is a somewhat different matter.</p><p>  It is acknowledged that the matter is not going to go away and has been worked into the base for next year.  The areas above the &euro;510 million figure relate to State claims, the timing of income coming in and so on and were not readily predictable.</p><p>  Any budget, particularly one this big, has upside and downside risks.  On the upside, we might do better in terms of income from health insurers.  We might do better in terms of drug savings.  The economic recovery may mean that fewer people are dependent on State schemes.  Also, with the number of people with private health insurance starting to increase again, we might see the demands increasing by less than they did in previous years.  </p><p>  On the other hand, there are downside risks.  Potentially, demand will continue to rise.  With an inward migration, a rising population and an aging population we may see demand rise again next year.  State claims are very unpredictable.  It comes down to when court cases are heard and what awards are made by the courts.  Therefore, it is hard to predict how much will arise in State claims.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made a point about State claims in terms of litigation, taking an inordinate amount of time to reach a settlement and leaving it until the steps of the courthouse.  Is there hope of changing the culture of this situation?</p></speech>

I expect it to go through the House next year.</p><p>  There is the bigger issue.  I think tort reform is required in this country.  In terms of payments for medical negligence, in many cases these are not cases of medical negligence at all and can be biological events in some cases.  Health care, by its very nature, is risky and there will always be a certain level of claims even against good physicians and good surgeons.  A lot needs to be done when it comes to tort reform.  Our legal costs and awards are very high.  I intend to engage directly with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the matter in 2015.  However, law reform is slow and I doubt it will produce savings in 2015.  </p><p>  Separately, the HSE is moving very firmly towards a change in culture - in hospitals and health care settings - to one of open disclosure.  The evidence is very strong that people are less likely to sue, and are less likely to be awarded big damages, if health care professionals are upfront and honest about what happens when things go wrong.  Unfortunately, that has not been the culture across our health service in recent years.  We have seen a number of very distressing examples where staff have not been willing to tell patients and their families the truth about what happened.  I think if they had done so not only would the outcomes have been better for the families and patients concerned, the cost to the taxpayer would have been lower.  That is a big change that can happen without legislative reform.</p><p>  On the issue of service level agreements for section 38 and section 39 organisations, they are nearing finalisation.  The target is to have them ready for the early new year.  Thereafter, the target is to have them signed in January or February with the vast bulk of them being signed before the end of quarter 1 of 2015.  That means the end of March 2015 is the target. </p><p>  In terms of financial control, there is a stronger incentive than ever for the HSE and hospitals to stay within budget.  In recent years savings had to be delivered in order to reduce the central Government deficit.  Now, more and more, savings above a certain level can go back into the health service and into services.  </p> <p>I hope that is an incentive to drive savings more in the future.</p><p> If the economy is growing by 3% or 4% a year, we should seek an increase of that amount in the health budget.  There is little point in having economic recovery if it does not mean more money in people's pockets and more money to provide better services.  The problem we have had so often in the health service is that increases in health spending do not result in better services.  We saw this particularly during the boom years when increases in spending went largely towards having more staff and increased pay for staff but not better services.  There were improvements in some specialties, but the intractables such as overcrowding in emergency units and waiting lists were the same or even worse at a time when the budget was much higher.  There is a major challenge to ensure additional spending benefits patients and service users.</p><p> There was a debate on fampridine, which is marketed as Fampyra, in the Seanad a week or two ago.  Decisions on what medicines are reimbursed are not made by me.  They are not political or ministerial decisions and there are no patient charts on my desk.  That is not how it works in my job.  A decision is made on objective grounds by the HSE's national drugs committee on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  Fampyra is not being reimbursed in many countries and it is not reimbursed by the NHS because the evidence produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, in the United Knigdom, Dutch researchers and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics shows that it is not particularly effective as a medicine.  It is costly and the evidence suggests it does not work for most patients.  In the case of those for whom it does work, it works less well than physical therapy and only marginally better, by a few seconds, than a placebo.  That is not a very good evidence base on which to reimburse any medicine.</p><p> Having said that, the door is never closed and no medicine is refused absolutely by the HSE which is always open to a manufacturer coming back with a more acceptable cost and new evidence showing that it is effective.  This happens from time to time.  Alternatively, the manufacturer can come back with risk sharing proposals such as allowing the medicine to be reimbursed in the case of those who do respond to it.  Sometimes, a medicine may not be generally effective, but a small cohort of patients may find it to be so.  Rather than reimbursing it for many, for whom it does not work, we can make risk sharing arrangements to allow the HSE to reimburse the medicine for the small group for whom it does work.  These options are open to the company concerned, but, more and more, the message that should come from this Parliament is that we need to put more pressure on the drug companies and the pharmaceutical industry to come up with fair prices.  It is often the case that Ireland is asked to pay more than other jurisdictions for the same medicine.  We would do better for patients and taxpayers if we were all united in putting pressure on the industry, not the HSE or the Government to overpay for certain medicines.</p></speech>

I have been addressing some of the fallout of what I regard as a system that is not really running as it should in terms of tight performance.  I have further evidence of wholly unacceptable and contradictory emissions coming from the PCRS in respect of a case I recently brought to the attention of senior management in the service.  The application was approved, affirmed and confirmed but then there was a problem with the issuance.  The case involved an elderly person in a confused state.  A letter issued a fortnight later advising that the previous decision to withdraw the card had been upheld upon review.  The letter was most upsetting for the individual concerned.  Yet the attached assessment of income on which the decision was based showed that the individual qualified for a full medical card and a GP visit card.  It was quite bizarre.  I have yet to present the matter to the personnel concerned but I will do so.  Anyway, these things are happening.  I am anything but satisfied that the system is on top of its game, as it must and should be.  I say as much because I believe it is appropriate to say so.  I will bring the particular case to which I referred to the attention of Mr. Burke.</p></speech>

My constituency office hears about similar issues from time to time.  Approximately 2 million people have either a medical card or a GP visit card.  Hundreds of thousands of applications are processed and reviews are carried out every year.  Even in the best system, if 2% or 3% of applications go wrong, this means 4,000 to 6,000 cases are going wrong.</p><p>  The ten actions announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I two weeks ago have the potential to improve the situation a good deal, as well as the implementation of the Deloitte/Prospectus report.  We can definitely improve the situation and reduce the number of errors and problems such as the problem Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has outlined.  However, it will always be the case that mistakes will be made where an organisation is dealing with so many applications.  Certainly, I encourage Deputies to bring these cases to the attention of the HSE and the PCRS in order that they can be rectified.</p></speech>

I have no wish to delay the meeting, but anyone who thinks that the PCRS system is now a good system or is giving a good return is simply not living in the real world.  Significant problems remain with the medical card system.  I do not intend to go through all of them today, but they include situations in which people have applied for discretionary cards on medical grounds.</p> <p>In many cases those people are waiting for three to five months for a decision from the medical side of the system.  That is absolutely unacceptable and I ask the Minister to address it.  In addition, there are people who were told earlier this year that they would have their discretionary medical card returned who still have not received those cards, and there is still no system whereby public representatives can speak to somebody with authority in the system.  That is a significant problem for anybody dealing with the system.  One is speaking to people who are simply agents and who know nothing about the system apart from what is on the screen in front of them.</p></speech>

It is very frustrating, annoying and upsetting, particularly for the families and patients who are dealing with the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  There is an ongoing difficulty there, despite the fact that there are many committed staff who are doing tremendous work.  One of the biggest problems is that there is inconsistency among whom one deals with on the telephone.  I realise the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announced a new streamlined process but that process is not helping the families concerned.  There is inordinate delay, which is unacceptable.  If cancer patients apply for a medical card, in some cases they must wait months to get it.  The committee might take that up further with the HSE, rather than just the Minister doing so.  This committee and public representatives working on behalf of constituents have found that there is inordinate delay in many cases.  Good work is being done and it would be unfair to paint all of the staff in the PCRS in a bad light, but I hope the process will be improved.  It has been frustrating for many of us, so one can imagine how it must feel for a patient or a person seeking a medical card.</p></speech>

The committee was of one voice on the last occasion it engaged with the PCRS team in Finglas.  That was the key appeal we made.  It is not a case of us always being against it.  We are here to try to be a practical bridge to a resolution or at least to get an answer, so we can explain to those who see us as a buffer in this situation.  We have a role to play.  It is a complementary role, not always adversarial.  The one thing we do not have is somebody to talk to.  It is absolutely bizarre.  It was accepted on the day, but it has never been implemented.</p></speech>

Has that been clarified?</p></speech>

The power to extend the medical card and to reinstate it in certain circumstances has been in place for some time, and it is used.  The fact that it has been used in hundreds of cases indicates that some GPs know it exists and have been using it.  It is also evident that some may not have known that it existed.  Perhaps they did not get the circular or they do not know exactly under what circumstances they can use it, but we are trying to agree a joint circular with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on that and to have it done sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

The chairman, Dr. Ray Walley, said at the time that the IMO had not received a communication.  I know of instances where GPs have made the various adjustments at their terminals in their practices, but Dr. Walley said categorically that they were unable to do it and that there was a miscommunication.  The committee wrote to the HSE seeking further clarification, but we did not receive a response.  The sooner we get clarification on this, the better.</p></speech>

In that case I thank the Minister and his officials, Mr. Breslin, Ms Prendergast and Mr. Mulvany for attending.  I thank also the members of the media for attending.

I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, Ms Elizabeth Canavan, Secretary General at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also in the Visitors Gallery, Mr. Paul Fay and Mr. Dermot Ryan.  If they wish to join us, they are more than welcome to come down.  This meeting has been convened for the purpose of considering the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I remind committee members that this is a Supplementary Estimate, so we are not dealing with the whole Estimate.</p> <p>I remind committee members that this is a Supplementary Estimate, so we are not dealing with the whole Estimate.  It is a specific Vote, Vote 40, which is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  We have apologies from Deputy Ciara Conway.</p><p> I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, and his officials to the meeting.  The D&aacute;il has ordered that the Supplementary Estimate under Vote 40 be referred to this committee.  We are only considering the Supplementary Estimate, and while members may discuss issues regarding individual subheads, they may not recommend an increase or decrease in the Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> I call upon the Minister to make his opening remarks and am conscious that we have a vote in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22014120900003#B00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the select sub-committee to outline particulars relating to the Supplementary Estimate for 2014 under Vote 40, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The committee will be aware that the Supplementary Estimate is for the sum of &euro;1,000.  It is purely of a technical nature, to allow for the creation of a new subhead in my Department's Vote for the commission of investigation into matters relating to mother and baby homes.  Costs associated with the commission constitute a new service, and the Supplementary Estimate will allow for expenditure to be incurred on the Vote from the beginning of January 2015.</p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to update the House and the committee on the current position regarding the commission of investigation.  The Government has undertaken to establish a statutory commission of investigation into matters relating to mother and baby homes in accordance with the motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 June 2014.  Considerable progress has been achieved since this date, including the publication of the interdepartmental group's report on the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will chair the commission and an inclusive consultation process with stakeholders.</p><p>  The establishment of this statutory investigation is an urgent and major undertaking.  The scale and sensitivity of the specific concerns relating to mother and baby homes, as evidenced in the interdepartmental report and submissions received, has necessitated a detailed examination of these complex matters.  Although the requirement to provide the commission with appropriate terms of reference may be generally accepted, the task of achieving the necessary precision in this regard should not be underestimated.  It is important that this inquiry be established in a manner that allows it to fulfil its remit in a timely fashion.  The committee will be aware that previous inquiries and commissions generated a great deal of expense and took much longer than anticipated to arrive at a conclusion than either those concerned or the Oireachtas would have wished.  In this regard, I am especially sensitive to the age profile of many of those involved with this process.  We need to learn from past experiences and ensure that we get this process right from the start.</p><p>  I would like to take a moment to reflect on the current position on establishing the inquiry.  The interdepartmental group on mother and baby homes met again recently to consider a number of specific issues which have emerged in recent engagements with advocacy groups and the political parties.  Indeed, I would like to thank some of the members who are present here - Deputies Sandra McLellan and Robert Troy, among others - for their engagement.  Following this meeting, I am confident that we are now approaching the conclusion of the current deliberative process.  While I am not in a position today to advise the committee on specific details, I can say that, following discussions with colleagues across the Government, we are now close to finalising the terms of reference.  As I advised the joint committee previously, some of the issues being raised with me directly and in public debate may extend beyond the central focus of mother and baby homes contained in the motion which was debated in the D&aacute;il.  I wish to make it clear that I intend to be as inclusive as possible, and the challenge is to determine a methodology for doing so in a timely and cost-effective way.  I am confident that we can establish an effective inquiry which has the support of those most centrally involved.  My priority remains the establishment of a commission that can deliver on public expectations in a realistic manner by providing a full account of what happened in these homes.  </p><p>  With regard to the timeline for completion of this work, assuming the current good progress continues, it is my intention to circulate a draft memorandum for the Government before Christmas.  This timescale is dependent on the finalisation of a number of key factors, including the conclusion of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on funding and final review by the Attorney General.  In parallel with this work, my Department is continuing to work very closely with Judge Murphy to advance the operational arrangements so that we can have an effective commission established and operational as quickly as possible following consideration of the Government's proposals by the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Under the provisions of section 5(2) of the Commission of Investigations Act 2004, a Minister seeking approval to establish a commission of investigation is required to prepare an estimate of the cost to be incurred by the commission.  This estimate is being prepared for consideration by Government in tandem with decisions necessary to finalise the terms of reference and formally establish the commission.  I have signalled to Government and the Oireachtas the requirement for significant additional resources to support this investigation.  Direct financial and staffing resources will be required within the commission.  My Department will also require additional staffing resources to meet the demands attaching to support and oversight of the commission.  In addition, the ongoing process of examining arrangements for access to adoption information will identify the cost implications of proposed operational reforms in this area.  Given the potential scale of this investigation, a number of other key Departments with relevant legislative and operational responsibilities have indicated that the increased administrative demands associated with co-operation with this commission may also require a dedicated resource in their respective Departments.  Any such requirements will be advanced separately by the relevant Ministers.</p><p>  As I mentioned at the outset, the establishment of the commission will constitute a new service in my Department's Vote.  A new subhead will therefore be required to meet associated costs.  Establishing the subhead now with a notional sum of &euro;1,000 will facilitate the early commencement of investigations in 2015, something I know we are all very keen to see achieved.  In conclusion, I seek the select sub-committee's approval of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 40.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate that we are talking in particular about the Supplementary Estimate regarding the establishment of the commission of investigation into the institutions that were commonly known as mother and baby homes.  However, if the Chairman will allow me - I think he did say that, while we may not call for an increase in anything, we may make reference to the actual Estimates for the Department - I would like to use this opportunity to ask about Estimates.

I am trying to be fair.  I am asking him to just take a deep breath.  He is not being fair in discussing the subhead.  I am not depriving him of any opportunity to raise issues regarding the matters he is discussing.  This is a Supplementary Estimate on Vote 40.  I can argue back and forth now, and if the Deputy wants to, that is fine.  To be fair to the members who are here and to the officials and the Minister, we are specifically dealing with the particular matter of subhead 40, the creation of a new subhead in the Estimates process.  If Deputy Troy wants to engage in that and have a row with me then that is his prerogative, but I would prefer if he did not do that.</p></speech>

I do not engage in theatrical-style stunts.</p> <p>The subhead is welcome because it enables the commencement of the commission of investigation into institutions commonly known as mother and baby homes.  I have spoken to survivors who spent time in these institutions and know that they do not like these facilities being termed "mother and baby homes" because there was nothing homely about their ambience and their experience of living in them - they were very far from being homely.  Collectively, as political representatives, we should take on board the fact that the survivors do not find the term "mother and baby homes" appropriate owing to what went on in them.  It is important that the investigation is moving forward.</p><p> I will respond to some of the points made by the Minister.  He talked about an inclusive consultation process with the stakeholders, a matter I raised with him when we met a number of weeks ago.  I have met a number of other groups, the members of which believe the consultation process has not been very inclusive.  The Minister has met them only once and they believe, although he has met them, he has not listened to them.  As we are facilitating the discussion of the Supplementary Estimate today, I ask the Minister to, please-----</p></speech>

It is also important that the stakeholders - the women who lived in thee institutions and the survivors - have their voices heard.  It is important that the inquiry be issue based.  We are not talking only about a set number of institutions commonly known as mother and baby homes.  The malnutrition, abuse, neglect, forced adoptions, illegal adoptions and high mortality rates also happened in many other institutions in which the State and religious entities were involved.  Therefore, we need to get the inquiry right.  The Minister came here to seek our support for this subhead and the Supplementary Estimates and he has it.  However, I ask him to, please, ensure he sets out terms of reference for an inclusive inquiry which will ensure he will have cross-party support.  He has mentioned that he hopes the draft terms of references will be published prior to Christmas.  Will there be an opportunity, either on the floor of the D&aacute;il or at committee level, to discuss them?  Will there be an opportunity for all political parties to feed into them?  Will there be an opportunity for interested groups - the stakeholders - to feed into them before the final terms of reference are published?</p></speech>

The only way we will do that is by having a good, long, hard look at what happened to so many people in the past which was so hurtful.  In response to Deputy Troy's points, this is a Supplementary Estimate and has nothing to do with budget 2015.  He argued that many people do not like the term "mother and baby home" but I have met a range of groups, none of which made that point to me.  I might also point out that Deputy Troy said that we are not listening but I met with all of the groups involved and made a point of doing so.  Almost all of them also met my predecessor.  I believe that we have listened.  It might be pre-judging the terms of reference to argue that people still have issues or feel that we have not heard what they have to say.  All submissions have been read but the Government has not made a final decision on the terms of reference yet.</p><p>  This is time-sensitive and we want to get this done in a timely fashion.  We certainly cannot afford to be repeating the investigations carried out by the child abuse commission.  On the question of timing, a draft order will be discussed in the Oireachtas after it has been approved by Government.  Other matters will be dealt with on foot of the decision of Cabinet, which I cannot pre-empt.  I thank everyone for their forbearance and co-operation.  We are all keen to deal with these matters as quickly as possible and to ensure that the commission can do its work in an unfettered fashion so that it can answer the questions people have asked.  We are very conscious of the age profile of many of those concerned.</p></speech>

This will bring my overall capital envelope and investment in land transport for this year to over &euro;1.14 billion, which is something I hope will be sustained in the future.  This additional funding will address three key priorities.  The first of these is to advance the stimulus projects announced by Government in May of this year, second, to repair the damage done to our roads and public transport infrastructure by the severe weather at the end of last year and earlier this year and, third, to support and improve our public transport sector, protect previous investments and ensure the sector is better placed to address the transport demands associated with an economy in recovery.<br/>The overall funding requirement is &euro;162 million.  The bulk of this &ndash; at &euro;110 million - will go towards the public transport investment programme.  The balance will go towards the roads programme - at &euro;47 million - and various smaller amounts towards the Smarter Travel, sports and tourism programmes.I am also including a technical<i>virement</i>of savings to facilitate two important initiatives in the sports and tourism areas.  On the first priority, members will be aware the Government made stimulus funding available through the sale of State assets for various projects and initiatives, many of which fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit.  The last stimulus package, announced in May, included provision for a number of initiatives within my Department&rsquo;s remit.  Today&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate covers the following elements of that May stimulus package: &euro;33 million towards the roads programme; &euro;5 million towards a public transport initiative; &euro;1.6 million towards the Greenways programme; &euro;500,000 towards the development of Lough Derg as a tourism initiative; and &euro;80,000 towards the development of a headquarters for the Special Olympics within the National Sports Campus complex.  The balance of the funding announced in May will be included in the Revised Estimate for 2015 and beyond as these projects are rolled out and as expenditure is incurred. <br/>These projects are in addition to our other stimulus projects announced last year which included the Wild Atlantic Way, the National Indoor Arena and a new round of sports capital funding, all of which are progressing well.  With this injection of capital funding, we are already seeing much-needed employment and economic activity at a local level with very important multiplier effects for the wider national economy.<br/>I have stated before that investment in our national, regional and local roads is one of my top priorities.  The efficient movement of goods and people around our country is vital to our economic future, as well as ensuring the connectivity of outlying communities to our major urban centres.  This funding will mean projects like the realignment of the N77 at Ballynaslee in Kilkenny, the widening of Hughes Bridge on the N4 in Sligo and pavement strengthening in Macroom, just to list a number, will come on-stream next year and communities up and down the country will feel the benefit. <br/>On the second priority, members will also recall that Government agreed a funding package in February last aimed at addressing some of the priority areas affected by severe weather which hit Ireland earlier this year.  This Supplementary Estimate includes spend of &euro;21 million for this purpose, including &euro;14.1 million to repair roads at national, regional and local level, and a further &euro;6.8 million for damage to public transport infrastructure, particularly the rail network.  Some further funding has been ring-fenced within my Vote next year as repairs are done and expenditure incurred.  <br/>The third element of this Supplementary Estimate is new and represents a significant milestone in the Government&rsquo;s capital investment programme in transport. This has been made possible given the improved economic and fiscal outlook.  Since taking up this portfolio, I have become acutely aware of the very challenging financial situation faced by CIE, in particular Irish Rail, and the dependence of the Group  on continued bank funding.  I remain strongly supportive of the efforts to secure the company&rsquo;s financial sustainability in order to ensure that rail services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively, with investment needs met over the long term.  The Government has provided substantial Exchequer investment in the rail network in recent years despite the significant financial challenges and is fully engaged with Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority (NTA) in examining the future funding requirements for the company to ensure a sustainable future.  I recognise that the Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport has called for a review of rail and I will be consulting with the NTA on how best to progress this proposal.<br/>Earlier this year, an independent group of experts brought together by my Department to examine transport investment in Ireland, produced an important report and a series of recommendations which provide a Strategic Framework for Land Transport Investment in Ireland.  A key finding in this report is that over the last number of years the level of investment in land transport as a percentage of national income or GDP is below the level necessary to support and improve, as necessary, the land transport system.</p> <p>This has meant that care and maintenance requirements of our transport infrastructure are not being met with very obvious implications for our roads and public transport asset base.  Members will be very aware of this.</p><p> With an improving economic outlook and a healthier fiscal position, we are now in a better place to begin to re-invest in our transport infrastructure in a way that was simply not possible since the Government took office.  With this Supplementary Estimate, the Government&rsquo;s investment levels in transport infrastructure will see a significant increase this year for the first time since 2008.  As a result of this Supplementary Estimate, overall capital investment in the land transport programme will exceed the &euro;1 billion mark.  This will begin a trend which I hope will be sustained over the course of the next capital framework which is to be announced by the Government shortly.  The injection of an additional &euro;110 million in our public transport programme will ensure critical projects are funded sufficiently, including Luas cross-city and that the PSO, public service obligation, bus fleet is refreshed and expanded to meet growing demands of an economy in recovery.</p><p> This injection will provide &euro;50 million for bus renewal and a further &euro;5 million for Luas cross-city so that public transport can meet growing demands of an economy in recovery.  In addition, &euro;45 million of that &euro;110 million earmarked for public transport will be targeted at Irish Rail&rsquo;s renewal investment.  This breaks down into &euro;27 million for railcar renewal and &euro;18 million for infrastructure maintenance, all of which will contribute to securing a viable path for the company.</p><p> The net result of this increase in investment will mean 90 modern new buses for Dublin Bus commuters, 57 new coaches for Bus &Eacute;ireann and enhanced service reliability and safety for passengers who use Irish Rail services.  This is extremely important not just for them but for the wider economy as an expanding public transport network is essential if we are to effectively harness the nascent growth now evident in our economy.  This extra investment in public transport coincides with the maintenance of current PSO funding for transport companies at the same level in 2015 as it was in 2014.  This is the first time there has been no reduction in this funding for several years.</p><p> Apart from the much-needed funding for transport, this Supplementary Estimate also includes additional allocations for the sports and tourism programmes.  I have already referred to some of this in context of stimulus funding.  In addition, I will allocate an extra &euro;1 million for equipment for sporting bodies this year.  For tourism, an additional &euro;850,000 for F&aacute;ilte Ireland will facilitate strategic IT investments primarily to promote the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin.</p><p> I have also included some technical virements in the Supplementary Estimate which will allow me to use savings from the Road Safety Authority which is moving to a self-financing position, and pay-related efficiencies in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s grant-in-aid subhead, to meet the costs of two important initiatives.  There will be an extra &euro;1 million in funding for the Irish Sports Council and a major tourism marketing blitz in key overseas markets over the winter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, will play a role in each of these.</p><p> I am pleased to recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the select sub-committee.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that Mr. David Franks, chief executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, recently indicated that over time &euro;100 million in investment will be required if the company&rsquo;s operation is to remain viable and kept up to date.  Does this &euro;45 million go some way towards that commitment, or had Mr. Franks already banked that when he made his statement on the company&rsquo;s viability?<br/>The Minister stated &euro;1 million will be given to sporting bodies for equipment this year.  I know the Irish Sailing Association was disappointed in its application for an earlier round in the sports capital programme.  Will it be considered for this extra &euro;1 million in funding?  Obviously, it is an expensive sport in which to participate.  I hope it will be considered in the context of this Supplementary Estimate.<br/>The roads programme needs much more money.  Successive Governments have had to reduce the care and maintenance of the road network.  Normally, it would be done on a seven-year cycle but it has now been pushed out which is effectively storing up real problems in the not-too-distant future.  I hope the Minister will win the argument in government to get more funding for the road network.  The longer one fails to get the funding needed to keep roads at their current standard, then problems are being stored up.  The National Roads Authority has been quite vociferous on this.<br/>The number of road fatalities and injuries increased last year.  I do not want to be partisan about this as it has always been tackled in a non-partisan way but there is a trend towards another increase which starts to show we are losing the battle in this.  It falls largely out of the Department&rsquo;s remit as much of the data points to the lack of funds available to the Garda to ensure proper enforcement.  The question of the courts dealing with the GoSafe vans and the report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>on penalty points are matters of grave concern.  If there is a requirement to bring forward primary legislation to make amends for legal loopholes, the Minister will have my full support.  Will he clarify what issues are involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014120900004#C00300"><p>There was an interesting article in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>by Larry Summers, a former United States Secretary of the Treasury, in which he spoke of the need for developed economies all over the world to invest in public transport and infrastructure projects.  I did not have an opportunity to include it in my text but he made the point similar to Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s, namely, that if one does not get to a point of maintaining existing infrastructure, then the cost to society and those who depend on that infrastructure really begins to build up.  We have a strong transport infrastructure in place which costs money to maintain.  If we do not maintain it, let alone look at new projects for the future, we will get to a point where the costs of maintenance will increase rapidly.</p> <p>That is why I was so committed to securing the budget and making progress in the Supplementary Estimate, which is a figure over &euro;160 million.  In response to the first question on where the &euro;45 million is going, it amounts to &euro;44.15 million.  Of that, &euro;15.9 million goes into the maintenance of the heavy rail network and &euro;27.6 million is going to the rail car fleet.  This will maintain rolling stock and carriages.</p><p> With regard to the point about Mr. Franks, I see the funding being a further significant step in looking to improve and strengthen the balance sheet of Irish Rail and the CIE group.  Further discussion and work is needed in the future.  This is a significant injection into the capital needs of the company to address the need for investment.  Where much of the investment will be spent on the busiest part of the rail network.  This will ensure it continues to be secure, safe and viable in the future.</p><p> With regard to the question about sailing, the Sports Council and the figure of &euro;1 million, I met recently some representatives of the organisation in my constituency office.  They articulated their concerns to me about the funding.  This may be the same as what the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

We do very well in supporting elite sports through maintenance of the participants but that sport, in particular, has a large capital requirement that other organisations do not.  I am anxious the Minister can look into some funding to assist.  There are only a couple of sporting organisations with the same capital requirement.  I do not expect an answer now but I am making the point that it may be useful to establish a fund that sits apart from the maintenance provided to athletes at a particular standard.  We must look at something on the capital side of things.</p></speech>

The programme we announced continues investment in a wide variety of roles across the country but I acknowledge that in the coming years the investment must be maintained and, in some areas, increased.  In the multi-annual capital plan that the Government is beginning work on, I hope to give an indication of our commitment to doing so.</p><p>  With regard to penalty points, which were the subject of understandable media focus today, I have been made aware of some issues with regard to the implementation of some penalty points.  My overall objective is to protect road safety and ensure all we say and do recognises the need to keep people safe.  I have requested advice from the Attorney General and I expect the formal advice tomorrow.  When I have it, I will arrange a briefing for Opposition spokespersons on this matter.  If and when I become clear, and receive formal advice from the Attorney General about what can be done, I will ensure the Opposition spokespersons are briefed.  I am happy to brief any member of the committee if I need to take action on this in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad next week.</p></speech>

Nearly every year, there is a supplement.  The &euro;162 million is being divided up, with public transport and road improvements receiving huge extra amounts of money.  Where do we get this money?  Is it purely from the lottery or the sale of assets?  Can the Minister explain how we have dug up this money?  With regard to road improvement and maintenance funds, will any of it go to local authorities?  We have many issues with local and regional roads and local roads have a huge number of potholes that have never been tackled.  Meath is one of the worst in the country.  Will any of this address that point or does it apply to the maintenance of main roads, the paths and road surfaces?  If any money is given to local authorities, we have issues with ramps that were destroyed over the past number of years.  In the past, Dublin City Council got a stimulus to deal with it.  Will any of this funding make its way to that end?</p><p>  Newlands Cross is an example of how a project has worked well.  We can now travel from one end of the country to another without stopping, which is fantastic.  I have heard massive reports about this project.  There must be a clap on the back for the people who pushed the project for so long.  With regard to the &euro;110 million public transport investment, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are getting a fair amount.  They are getting badly needed new buses.  Irish Rail needs a major stimulus in the replacement of stock.  I do not see a real improvement apart from minor improvements in Irish Rail.  Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on this point.</p><p>  Last year, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, received &euro;3.7 million and last year it received &euro;6.5 million.  The Minister referred to savings due to the RSA raising finance.  Can the Minister explain how the RSA managed to do that?</p><p>  There were reports of the Minister seeking funding from Europe for two areas, including for metro north.  In the past, the Minister indicated that metro north was dead and buried.  Has there been an attempt made to renew it?  It was mentioned that this might be something the Minister will look to Europe for.  Perhaps he can quash this idea if it is untrue.</p><p>  There is major debt in Irish Rail but we must invest more and see if we can improve the structure and the standard of trams.</p></speech>

Of the &euro;160 million, &euro;40 million is stimulus funding and the balance of the funding has been made available from savings in other Departments or in relation to how the economy has performed.  Specifically, the Deputy asked about where the money for roads will go.  Some &euro;20 million of the roads money will be for local and regional roads.  The money will be allocated to local authorities or, for the larger national roads, through the National Roads Authority, NRA.</p><p>  I appreciate Deputy Ellis making the point about Newlands Cross.</p> <p>The main contractor on Newlands Cross was an Irish company called BAM construction, which I understand is based in Cork, in Deputy McCarthy's county.  This project came in five months ahead of schedule and for its entire duration all of the laneways and roads through which traffic flowed were kept open.  There were six lanes of traffic open continuously while that work was taking place.  It is a real credit to how the project was managed and the company itself in the way that was discharged.</p><p> The Deputy correctly identified that the Road Safety Authority will be self funding.  The reason that is happening is the RSA will be retaining the revenue it raises through the operation of NCT centres and driver licences in the future.  </p><p> The Deputy's final question concerned Metro North and transport projects for the future.  I have put it out for public consultation and would be very happy to engage with the committee on this, as I think would be the other bodies involved in this.  As the Deputy will know, that part of our city currently has a very young population and it also has significant future development potential because of the amount of brown and greenfield sites that are out there.  It is really important that we plan for that and begin the work now.  One of the options is a proposal for a changed Metro North to reflect where the economy will be in a few years' time.  When I make a decision on the lead option next year, I will begin work to try and secure funding for that within Government, because until we know what the project is and how much it will cost I cannot secure funding for it, and in order to secure funding I will look at all of the different options that will be available.  I am very mindful of the fact that it is not funded now and there are many other competing demands for that money at the moment.</p></speech>

We have sent a list of options to the European Commission, but we have received no indication that funding is available for any of them at the moment and it is in the early part of the process.</p></speech>

There is an increase in people going back to work and using public transport.  Traffic congestion has come back again so it is important that we invest in transport infrastructure to allow people the option of leaving their cars at home and switching to public transport.  That needs to be continued.</p><p>  The other point I want to make was referred to by Deputy Ellis regarding the proposals announced yesterday.  I welcome them, in particular the proposal to have a rail connection from Clongriffin on the Dublin-Belfast line to Dublin Airport, which is realistic in terms of cost.  The land reservation is there in the Fingal County Council development plan and it would mean that Dublin Airport would have a connection to the mainline rail system, which every other capital city has.  That is something I would welcome.  I know it is going out to public consultation and there are other options as well, but that is certainly welcome.</p><p>  Concerns have been raised by other Deputies regarding the comments and warnings made by the Irish Rail chief executive, Mr. David Franks, on the future of the rail system and the need for additional funding if the service is to be maintained.  If there is a safety issue, services have to be curtailed and that is a concern.  There have been a lot of savings and cost reductions in Irish Rail.  I am thinking in particular of the Dublin DART system whereby manning levels have been reduced.  A lot of DART stations do not have staff present and ticketing is automated.  There is a particular difficulty for commuters who travel at night - if there is an unmanned station, very often there is a security risk and some people are quite concerned about travelling.  In my own constituency there is a DART station in Donaghmede, Howth Junction, which at times does have safety issues at night.  It is important that those issues be addressed.</p><p>  I see that there is extra investment for the Luas cross-city in the subhead.  Could I get some more details on that?  It is a major project in the city and is causing a lot of changes in our city's traffic as well as disruption to traffic, businesses and traders and so on.  I would like some more details on what the extra investment is doing. </p></speech>

I agree with him.  As he well knows, buses carry more people that any other form of public transport in Ireland and what we are doing here is modernising the fleet of our two main public bus companies.  I expect and believe this will lead to an improvement on the quality of service people see in the future.</p><p>  As regards the public consultation process on the railway line, this is the very reason I decided to put options out to the public at this stage.  If I look at how these decisions have been handled in the past, sometimes there is a big discussion, a lot of which can take place in private for understandable reasons, and a big decision is then made about a single project.  Lots of people then have questions regarding why something else was not considered, whether certain things were taken into account and so on.  By having a period of public consultation up to the middle of January I am hoping to give everybody an opportunity to put in their view.  At the end of the day we are going to have to make a decision about progressing a single project.  I hope the decision we make will be better informed by giving people the opportunity to send in their views.</p><p>  Deputy Ellis also touched on the matter of Irish Rail and Mr. Franks, and I apologise for not fully acknowledging his question.  The &euro;45 million investment is a really substantial development in funding work that needs to be done.  By making funding available from the Exchequer, we are making a very positive contribution to the balance sheet of Irish Rail and therefore to the CIE group.  There will be further work and further decisions on this in the future but I am very pleased to be bringing in this funding today to build on the fact we have maintained the PSO levels for next year for the first time in many years.  Now we are able to add to that with this injection of needed capital funding into the companies.</p><p>  The reason for the additional &euro;5 million funding for Luas cross-city is that, although the original budget figure was &euro;32 million, the utility works are ahead of schedule at the moment so more funding is needed this year for that work.  That brings the figure up to &euro;37 million for this year.  I take his point on the potential disruption across the city and acknowledge the huge support we have gotten from the business community in Dublin.</p> <p>I personally chair a Luas cross-city working group that meets regularly to consider this matter and I am pleased to see that as Operation Open City now is up and running to make the city easier to get around during the Christmas period, much of the hoarding and work that was taking place on Dawson Street, for example, has been removed to make it easier for people to get around.  However, I should add that even more work will begin in January.</p></speech>

I wish to make a couple of points that may or may not taper off into a question.  On the question of the roads allocation, I welcome that there has been an increase in the spend for the first time since the crash.  As for the way in which it is broken down, naturally there will be a concentration on national primary routes and similarly, there will be a concentration on regional roads thereafter.  For example, an area such as west Cork has a national primary route running through it and all available funding obviously will be expended on keeping it to a standard, keeping it salted in the wintertime and so on.  However, there is another structure of road not immediately visible to the eye as one traverses those routes, namely, the local tertiary roads.  There is a real issue with these roads and the bridges along them that have been damaged in storms or associated inclement weather conditions that always will have a severe adverse effect on such roads and elements such as bridges along them.  Invariably, there will be lobbying to bring such roads back to a level they were at before the storm, the severe frost or whatever and there is an issue in respect of expenditure with the local area engineer's office.  What happens is that when an Estimate is announced, it goes back to the local authorities and in their wisdom, with their engineers and special works overseers, they decide on where the money is spent.  However, there will be significant swathes of areas that will not see much of that, albeit not in geographic terms.  Outside of the normal expenditure and the special allocation, this area almost would require funding in its own right to restore it to the level at which it was before the inclement weather got at it.</p><p>  I ask that as the announcements filter out into the offices of area engineers, this point should be borne in mind.  The area engineers will be given a budget and naturally will concentrate that towards the regional routes and the national primary routes in most cases, almost without exception, much to the detriment of local tertiary roads.  A lot of damage is done to cars on those roads, which are used by milk lorries, agricultural vehicles and so on and are liable to extracurricular damage, as such.  I will ask the Minister a question on the allocation to which he may be able to respond this afternoon.  How much flexibility will be used by local authority members in how that allocation is spent?  Will that be maintained as an executive function or will it filter down through the executive or-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/996" speakername="Michael McCarthy" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014120900007#F00400"><p>Yes, things like that, as they manifest themselves at local level.  I wish to reiterate the whole point about local tertiary roads.  While it would take a normal budget allocation to maintain them to the level they should be at, it would take an additional amount of money to restore them to their level before the onset of the aforementioned inclement weather conditions.</p><p>  The other issue is in respect of tourism and marketing and every penny spent by the Department over the past seven or eight years has been money well spent.  There have been quarterly, biannual and annual figures and the tourism spend is increasing.  In itself, that has driven the coastal social economies nationwide and this has been significant in terms of services, tourism, marinas and so on.  It permeates into many areas and creates sustainable jobs in areas such as the area from which I come.  Moreover, the development of tourism initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way has been outstanding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, visited the Old Head of Kinsale recently, where he plastered part of the wall that forms part of the Old Head Signal Tower restoration programme.  It is money well spent to think that based on this initiative, there now is a product that will take someone to County Donegal and then bring him or her to the Old Head of Kinsale.  This is so much the case that people who have nothing at all to do with the Wild Atlantic Way by geographic definition now wish to link into it and I wish the Minister luck in trying to find a solution to their desires.</p><p>  My next point coincides with the trip by President Higgins to China, which is an absolutely huge market.  There is a centre for Chinese studies in University College Cork and there is a strong Chinese population there but developing the tourism links between Ireland and China will have a huge return.  This will be evident in respect of the figures and the Minister could use as an example the restoration of the American market, as well as of the domestic market between here and the United Kingdom.  It was a critical challenge to bring back the latter because they also suffered as a result of the collapse and the sort of short weekend trips which people from the United Kingdom would take to visit here almost stopped.  Developing and using the same strategies that were deployed to resurrect those two markets would stand to the Minister and his Department in the context of winning a crucial tourism market from China.  I refer to the additional expenditure of approximately &euro;800,000 in marketing campaigns to coincide with that trip, which is commanding huge coverage in China, not to mind the significant element of coverage here.  How much of that expenditure will be spent in 2014 and will any of it go into the start of 2015?  Allied to that, in respect of the State visits the President undoubtedly will make in 2015, will there be allocations of funding?  Will consideration be given for additional funding for those trips because the return would be absolutely huge and every penny spent in that regard would be spent well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-09a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52014120900007#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and I will come to each in turn.  His first question pertained to the allocation of capital funding for regional and local roads.  I entirely take his point that one must be aware of the more local roads or, shall I say, the non-national roads or tertiary roads in respect of where money is going and how it is spent.  This is something of which I have been aware since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I believe one of the country's leading capital needs concerns how to maintain what we have.  This is important in so many different areas, including road safety and the maintenance of basic connectivity and safe connectivity across the country.  As for how much of the funding I am announcing today and for which I am seeking the sub-committee's approval will go to regional and local roads, in total &euro;32.1 million will be going to that area, of which &euro;12 million pertains to restoration out of which the allocation for community improvement schemes amounts to &euro;6 million.  The allocation to deal with the aftermath and consequences of severe weather is &euro;14.1 million, which takes the figure up to &euro;32.1 million.  On how that money is spent and in respect of the Deputy's second question regarding the role of local Members and of local authority members, my Department plays a role in setting out what is the template for the scheme or in other words, what contribution one would ask people to make or not make.  As for where the money is spent within the county, however, I would expect local councillors to play a leading role in that regard.  Even though this is an area for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, I certainly would be interested in the operation of the scheme and in whether the Deputy has observations on it because I would expect local authority councillors either to be influencing substantially where the money will go or to be involved directly in the decision-making on it.</p><p>  In respect of the Deputy's points on tourism, I completely agree with his comments.  At present, there is an understandable amount of focus on the need for balanced regional economic development and one extraordinary thing about tourism is it is one of the main parts of the economy that offers the potential to engage in and influence every town and all counties nationwide.  This is why I am so pleased to see the progress of an initiative such as the Wild Atlantic Way in an environment in which politicians, in particular those of us who are in parties in government, always are being asked for more money to do particular things.  The beauty of the Wild Atlantic Way for me is that while it did need more money, what it really needed and what is happening is a new way of thinking about what we have and then advertising it better.  It has been an extraordinary success with many years to come ahead of it.</p><p>  On the Deputy's detailed question regarding where money would be going and how it would be used, the success of President Higgins in China already is apparent.  As to whether any of this money will be used in following up on that success, the answer to that question definitely is "Yes".   Out of the funding of &euro;800,000, some of it will be used on an inter-agency initiative, including, for example, Bord Bia, Science Foundation Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to put together a consumer video advertisement to coincide with the President's visit to China to make the most of that visit.</p> <p>On Deputy McCarthy's question about how much of this money will be spent this year, all of it will be.  It has been requested as a Supplementary Estimate for this year, so the &euro;800,000 will be spent this year.</p><p> On the follow-up of State visits, when we know all the plans for President Higgins for next year, we will ensure that there is a tourism dimension to that.  The head of Tourism Ireland is part of President Higgins's delegation to China.  Tourism is very important for a country of our size, which is so heavily integrated into the global economy and dependent on its ability to win consumers in overseas markets, and it is superb to see the work President Higgins is doing in this area.  He is just back from Africa, where he was doing very important work in one area and now he is following that up with different work abroad, in China, which is being supported by Government Ministers.</p></speech>

Coming in from Meath in the mornings, I notice it is taking longer and longer to get in and the traffic is extending back towards the edge of the city, so anything that can improve public transport for people, or mean that they do not have to take their cars to work, will benefit everybody.</p><p>  I am delighted that one of the main focuses for the Minister's Department is restoring our roads.  We can never have enough money for roads.  It is an issue that will always be at the forefront of many of our wish lists.  We have a serious number of local and regional roads in north Meath, so every little bit helps.  Last year our own county council would have made a special request to the Department for additional funding.  We would have made a special case.  Is this something the Minister's Department is looking at this year, or will it be split equally among the Departments based on the funding they are receiving at the moment?</p><p>  Does the additional &euro;1 million for equipment for sports groups and clubs extend to organisations that look after children with disabilities or special needs?  For example, there is an organisation in the town of Kells called Special Hands, which works with children with intellectual and physical disabilities.  At the moment they are seeking funding for equipment for the pool, to help children get in and out of the water.  Does the funding stretch to that or is the Department just looking at football clubs and so on?</p></speech>

On the issue of congestion, one of the major issues I have stressed in my work to date is the need to decrease congestion and increase growth.  This feeds into all the decisions I am presenting for the committee's approval today in relation to where I want to put the money I have and additional money.  The Deputy has raised the needs of her county with me on many occasions.  While I have received contact from the Deputy on many occasions on that particular part of her county and her own constituency, I have not yet received an additional formal request from the local authority in relation to needs for next year.  Our position in the overall process is that once we have, hopefully, received the committee's approval, we will continue to work to decide where funding will be allocated for next year.  I will be engaging with my officials on that matter in the coming week.  I know the Deputy feels strongly about this issue and that the needs of her county in this respect are great, so I am aware of the point she has made to me.</p><p>  On the allocation of funding for public transport, many of the needs her county will continue to have in the future will relate to a better bus service, the maintenance and improvement of the rail service, and maintenance of the road network.  With this Supplementary Estimate, we hope to make a big contribution to putting in place an approved balance sheet for a public transport companies to deal with that and meeting the commitments we have already made in relation to stimulus funding.  I hope that in the multi-annual capital plan the Government will publish early next year we will be able to give better guidance to some of the commuters the Deputy mentioned regarding how we will better plan for the future.  That is my objective and it is something on which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, wants to work with me.</p><p>  I cannot answer the Deputy's question regarding funding for special needs now, because the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will be involved in making decisions in this area, but I will pass on the point she has made to him.</p></speech>

I begin, as I have been asked to do, by introducing myself and setting out my professional background.  I am a management consultant by profession and an experienced company director.  I have worked in both the public and the private sectors in Ireland and internationally.  Having started my career in the public sector, I worked with the State training agency AnCO before taking a position with Synectics Inc., an international innovation consultancy based in Boston.  In this role, I worked with clients throughout the world and in Ireland developing long-term strategies, facilitating the invention of new products and services and transforming organisational cultures to be more creative and collaborative.</p><p>  Since 1992 I have been self-employed, running my own management consultancy company, Latitude.  Working in sectors ranging from IT to food, fast-moving consumer goods, financial services, Government and State organisations and the arts, I have continued to help clients change to a more creative and innovative culture and continued to facilitate strategic planning and the development of new products and services.  On foot of that experience, I found myself broadening what I do to include complex and varied assignments.  Examples include acting as the bridge between the Irish Episcopal Conference and survivors of abuse; serving as chair of the Grow Dublin task force, on which all of those with a stake in Dublin's success as a tourist destination collaborated in an unprecedented way to set the course for major tourism growth in the Dublin region; undertaking a review of Temple Bar Cultural Trust with recommendations as to its future for Dublin City Council, and facilitating the transition task force on the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  I have served on a number of boards of directors, including the board of the Project Arts Centre in the 1980s and Dublin Port Company, DPC, from 1997 to 2002.  Since 2009, I have served on the board of DPC as chair based on my appointment by the former Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey.  I represent DPC on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I also serve on the board of the National College of Art and Design.  I am very pleased that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has proposed my appointment as chairperson of DPC for a second term and that the joint committee is considering that appointment today.  It is a privilege and a significant responsibility to be the non-executive chairperson of this essential national infrastructural asset.</p><p>  Dublin Port plays a vital part in the nation's economic well-being and is a major resource for the city, region and country.  Dublin Port has in many senses shaped the development of Dublin as a maritime city and remains an important part of the fabric of the city today.  Dublin Port's contribution to the national economy is significant.  It is the largest commercial port in the State.  In 2013, with throughput of 28.8 million tonnes, it handled 43% of total port throughput in the Republic, 80% of roll-on/roll-off traffic and 71% of load-on/load-off traffic.  The company provides the infrastructure required by a range of private sector shipping lines, terminal operators and cargo handlers to meet market demand for efficient and cost-effective import and export of goods.  This is in the service of economic well-being, jobs and quality of life.</p><p>  The throughput of trade at the port is a bellwether for the broader economy.  The pattern is that for every 1% change in GDP, port volumes change by 1.4%.</p> <p>We have watched the economy improve since April 2013 and following 3% growth in throughput in 2013, this year sees further growth of 7% in throughput.  Therefore, 2014 will be close to our best year, 2007, when throughput was 30.9 million tonnes. </p><p> The port is located at the heart of the Dublin region and at the core of a national road and rail hub, pointing to its regional and national significance.  Some of the built infrastructure that Dublin Port is currently using was developed during the 19th century and is at the end of its operational life.  It needs to be renewed and in some cases replaced.   Dublin Port also has to take account of trends in mercantile and passenger transport, specifically developments in shipping which require increased channel depths and longer and deeper berths.  Against this background, Dublin Port Company currently has a major strategic infrastructure project before An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the redevelopment of Alexandra Basin, the ABR project.  We await the outcome of the ABR planning application and hope that we will soon be able to begin this &euro;200 million project that will generate 375 construction jobs and support 320 additional jobs per year after that.  </p><p> One of the key factors in getting to this stage is the constructive working relationships that we have with Dublin City Council, Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the National Roads Authority, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and other key statutory agencies.</p><p> When I was appointed chairperson of Dublin Port Company by the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, in 2009, I had a number of clear objectives I was keen for the company to achieve.  In particular, I believed that Dublin Port Company needed to develop a longer term vision of the operations of the port to guide its future plans.  I also felt that the port needed to build and retain strong relationships with all the key stakeholders relevant to the port&rsquo;s operations.   These two priorities came together in the development of Dublin Port&rsquo;s 30-year masterplan, which is grounded in extensive research, consultation and community engagement.   Being associated with the development a 30-year plan was most satisfying.  The masterplan has given the board a really good framework on which to base its decisions on the current operations and future direction of the port so that we can continue to meet our customers&rsquo; requirements and plan for the future needs of the economy in a timely fashion. </p><p> I was also keen that Dublin Port should re-establish its close relationship with Dublin city.  In years gone by, right up to the early 20th century, Dubliners were in no doubt that their city was a port city.  Passengers departed from ferries on the quays and goods were loaded from the river quays.  However, as part of a trend common to all river ports, port activity moved from the centre seaward and a run-down docklands acted as an unwelcome buffer between the port and the city.  This pushed the port itself out of people&rsquo;s consciousness. </p><p> Now that the docklands have been largely re-developed, Dublin Port Company is committed to achieving closer integration with the city and to allowing Dubliners to engage in a positive way with the life of the port.  We are working hard to put life back on the river.  The annual Riverfest at the June bank holiday weekend is one of a series of initiatives geared to this.  We have a very active corporate social responsibility, CSR, programme that focuses on education, sport and community events in the local dock communities, and as part of the major redevelopment works, we will open up greater access to the port to Dubliners.  The planned turning circle for ships, including the world&rsquo;s largest cruise ships, close to the East Link Bridge will make the spectacle of ship movements visible to all.</p><p> We have committed to making sure that the economic activity of the port makes the least demands possible on the natural environment.  Our first sustainability report, copies of which I have brought with me today, outlines a 95% reduction in water consumption in the 260 hectare site by the systematic elimination of leakages, an increase in the waste recycling rate from 40% in 2009 to 96% in 2013 and the ongoing carbon reduction programme supported by a new wind turbine.   In order to understand better the habitat of birds in the port area, we are co-operating with Birdwatch Ireland on the Dublin Bay birds project.  The project brings to life for us the fact that the port area belongs to birds and marine life as well as to humans.</p><p> DPC is a strong business.  I have provided a link to the latest annual report for members of the committee, which details the performance for the last financial year.  The company is in public ownership and facilitates the competing operations of private companies active in the port.  This has proven to be a very strong business model that works in the interests of the State and of port users.  On a turnover of &euro;68.4 million in 2013, we had profit after tax of &euro;26 million.  Consistent profit has enabled the company to pay a significant dividend to the shareholder, amounting to a total &euro;69.8 million over the past eight years. </p> <p>The company is debt free, putting it on a very sound footing as we embark on a significant period of capital expenditure, underpinned by the Alexandra Basin redevelopment, ABR, project.  In this regard, the company is in the midst of positive discussions with the European Investment Bank with a view to borrowing &euro;100 million of long-term project debt for the ABR project.  This is a prudent approach to debt financing, matching long-term assets with long-term financing.  Recently, the company received financial support from the EU under the TEN-T programme amounting to &euro;2.5 million in respect of studies to bring the ABR project through planning to the point where we can tender for the required construction works.  We will be following this up with a further application for grant funding in respect of the construction works for ABR under the newly-launched Connecting Europe facility.</p><p> The company's board is well constituted.  Early in my time as chair, I advocated to the then Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, a competency matrix to inform board appointments in order to ensure that the board would contain the blend of skills necessary to serve our needs.  This has served us well, as each appointment made by him and by the current Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has strengthened our collective capability across the areas of finance, marine operations, commercial law, planning and compliance.  The board's performance was independently evaluated at my suggestion during the year and was judged to be an effective board.  There is a high level of trust between the CEO and the other members of the board and between the board and the other members of the executive team.  The company is fortunate to have a very loyal and dedicated staff who serve Dublin Port Company and our customers very well.</p><p> I would be pleased and honoured to serve a further term as chairperson of Dublin Port Company.  I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have and to elaborate on any aspects of my submission.</p></speech>

I can see why Ms McCaffrey has been very busy and why she will be very busy, with all her plans and other roles.  She talked about a &euro;200 million investment to redevelop a large section of Dublin Port and she might elaborate on how that will be financed.  What are the other elements of Dublin Port's masterplan?  I see Ms McCaffrey has a vision to double the throughput from 29 million tonnes to 60 million tonnes by 2040.  What implications has this for Dublin as a city and for the rest of the ports throughout the country?  Is it a case of taking business from other ports or developing more business for Dublin itself?  There is the issue of the overdevelopment of the east coast, Dublin in particular.  How does that fit in to Ms McCaffrey's vision?  She might deal with those two questions.</p></speech>

The Harbours Act allows Dublin Port Company to borrow up to 50% of its fixed asset base, which suggests we could borrow &euro;150 million.  We are debt free going into this planning permission.  It is a tightly run company - it is profitable but it is very tightly run.  One of our values is frugality and, although we are profitable, we are very frugal and that does not allow us to loosen the reins.  We are now at an advanced stage in our talks with the European Investment Bank and the likelihood is that it will be willing to lend us long-term debt of &euro;100 million.  We will certainly be easily able to fund and manage that debt from the company's resources.  Is that satisfactory?</p></speech>

Obviously, Ms McCaffrey is saying there are no major issues.</p></speech>

We set out, first, to project forward and forecast what the demand would be.  We took a very conservative measure and we said we were going to plan for the next 30 years so, if growth were a conservative 2.5%, that would call for double the capacity.</p> <p>We are not saying that we want to make the port twice as big.  We are saying there will be a demand on the economy, and we are the people responsible to make sure it can be met.</p><p> The question of whether that overdevelops Dublin Port or ports on the east coast is understandable.  Port activity tends to gravitate towards huge centres of population, and that is the case in Ireland.  The biggest commercial port in the State gravitates to the Dublin region where 1.8 million people live and where the road and rail network is excellent.  We believe it is our responsibility to meet that demand, and the last thing we want is insufficient capacity and trucks having to travel by road to Belfast or wherever.</p><p> Another aspect of the master plan was that we made a commitment that we would intensively use the land we have got and not think beyond our current footprint until we were sure that we were intensively using that land.  We are working actively on that and reorganising the use of land to make the maximum use of it.</p><p> Is there more that needs to be said with regard to that?</p></speech>

In terms of Ms McCaffrey's plans, there is the view that Ireland will mean Dublin and the east coast and that it would impact on other parts of the country.</p></speech>

In terms of what she just said, I would have thought her fiduciary duty is to Dublin Port.  It is not macro-policy in terms of the Government's agenda with regard to other parts of the country.  That is an issue for Government rather than for Ms McCaffrey so I wish her well.</p><p>  Ms McCaffrey has done a very good job to date.  I am pleased that she is giving of her time for another term at Dublin Port.  The company will be well served by her doing that.</p><p>  I welcome her master plan for increased capacity.  I have some questions on that.  First, Ms McCaffrey spoke about the funding and the European Investment Bank providing up to &euro;100 million, and I think she said it was a &euro;200 million project.  How does she hope to make up the other &euro;100 million?  Does she intend taking in some private investment or will it be a public private partnership in terms of that development?</p><p>  Second, does Ms McCaffrey anticipate any strong opposition to the master plan?  Dublin Port has been bedevilled in the past with difficulties in advancing some of its developments, particularly the infill project that went on for quite some time.  If I am not mistaken, a Member of this House was elected as a result of his opposition to that project when he changed his name by deed poll.</p></speech>

Could we see an Independent in the next D&aacute;il with a similar agenda?</p><p>  Third, as well as dealing with transport matters this committee has a responsibility in the area of tourism, and Dublin Port has been successful in attracting cruise ships to Dublin Port.  It is obviously a lucrative business.  Ireland is not in the Caribbean but yet there is considerable attractiveness to this area.  Does Ms McCaffrey have any plans to further increase that activity and, if so, she might share it with us?</p></speech>

We will be able to fund it out of our current resources; it is a very strong business.  We will also look for grant aid from various sources within the European Union, in particular the Connecting Europe Facility.  We are not looking to a joint venture of any sort in funding that.</p><p>  In terms of objections to the master plan and future objections, the way in which the master plan was drawn up was very good in my view.</p> <p>It was highly consultative and the consultation was genuine.  Modifications were made on foot of all the feedback.  When Dublin City Council was reviewing this planning application, which is now before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the councillors unanimously supported it.  That is a measure of the extent to which it had been worked through and their interests and those of their constituents had been taken on board.  We are now at the point in the planning application for the Alexandra Basin, ABR, project where objections have come forward and have been heard by the planner.  We do not anticipate any other forum for objections to our going ahead and implementing it.</p><p> There will be later phases in the implementation of the master plan.  This is the first major project.  We anticipate approaching them with the same rigour in terms of talking to those who have a stake and taking their concerns on board.  Our obligation is talk to all of those who have a stake and meet their concerns to the best extent possible while fulfilling our remit.</p><p> It is true that the cruise business is lucrative, but it is not very lucrative for ports, because the vessel comes in and there are vessel dues but no goods dues.  However, we greatly welcome and foster the cruise business.  It is very good for the economy and for the hinterland of the greater Dublin region.  The new development will allow the largest cruise ships in the world to travel right up to the East-Link bridge.  It will be quite a spectacle.  We are planning a turning circle beside the East-Link so the cruise passengers will disembark in the city, which is a terrific prospect for them.  In addition, Dublin city dwellers will have the spectacle of the life of the port being visible and accessible again.</p></speech>

It is clear from her presentation that it is based on merit.  I wish her well and good luck in her next term.</p><p>  There is a great deal happening in Dublin Port and it is clear from the figures in the presentation and in the 2013 annual report that it is in a very healthy position.  What would Ms McCaffrey see as the port's competitors?  The report shows that the port has quite a healthy margin.  Sometimes a healthy margin can indicate the competitive nature of a port.  She would probably mention the ports in Cork, Galway and Foynes in this country, but does the board of the company give consideration to international competitors?  Also, how does she deal with or foster intra-port competition, in terms of keeping the charges for what is a very expensive business for the logistical operators as low as possible?</p><p>  Historically, industrial relations and relationships between the port company and the stakeholders have been a huge issue.  How would she describe the industrial relations environment within Dublin Port?  The committee is always conscious of that.  Any trouble or issues that might arise in Dublin Port could have a very serious effect on the Irish economy in terms of inhibiting the movement of goods.</p></speech>

I am a new Deputy in the House and not as experienced as the wily old people beside me.  Do staff from Dublin Port work together with the various people in all the ports around Ireland?  Do they meet up?  Do they have a common vision for the ports of the country?  Is Ms McCaffrey simply punching for her neck of the woods around Dublin, which seems to be getting much of the infrastructure and money?  I am afraid that at the expense of other parts of Ireland, for example, the ports in Cork, Foynes, Galway and Greenore, we are pushing a focus on to one section, perhaps at the cost of jobs, infrastructure or a more balanced Ireland.</p><p>  I am aware that there are designations around the area of Dublin Port.  I have followed several cases in Germany.  Ms McCaffrey referred to Dublin Port growing to twice its current size.  Does she envisage the designations blocking the progress that Dublin Port envisages if it is to grow twice as big?</p><p>  I have noticed another thing about Dublin Port.  It does not seem to be grabbing the nettle in the line of wanting live shipping of cattle.  Other places are doing it but there seems to be a reluctance in Dublin Port to facilitate this work.</p></speech>

I know at the moment in Galway Harbour this problem is causing tremendous difficulty.  Considerable taxpayers' money is being spent on ludicrous legislation that has come through from Europe and it is costing jobs.  Ms McCaffrey referred to Dublin Port growing to twice its current size.  I have studied the issue around Ireland and I have seen what has happened in Germany.  In Germany, if someone does something that could have an effect later on, progress has been stopped at certain ports.  Does Ms McCaffrey see this as a problem in future?</p></speech>

The principal reason related to disruption to bird habitats.  We have come to the conclusion that the two things do not have to be in opposition.  The bird habitat and the industrial use of the port need not necessarily be in opposition.  It is for this reason that we are working closely with BirdWatch Ireland.  We are getting to know indepth the migratory patterns of birds and the effects of human activity on the birds.  We are optimistic that these two things need not be in opposition.  Having said that, there is no choice but to abide by the European designations, but we do not see them as a barrier to doing what we need to do on behalf of the economy.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked me about ports collaborating.  Ports do collaborate.  There is an organisation called the Irish Ports Association under which we collaborate.  We do not have a masterplan for the ports of Ireland.  However, a recent and excellent new national ports policy has been published which gives coherence to the development of ports.  Of course, that is the level from which it should come; it should come from Government.  It gives coherence and identifies three tiers of port.  The policy places Dublin Port in the top tier, as it would.  That is where the coherence comes from.</p><p>  Do we compete?  Yes, we compete for business.</p> <p>The second thing is that market forces decide where they want to go.</p><p> Economies of scale are increasingly an issue in shipping so larger vessels are becoming the norm.  The main reason for ABR development is that we must have the depths and the berths to accommodate 21st-century vessels.  If we could not do so, Dublin Port would become obsolete.  That speaks to the problem of ports that cannot provide longer and deeper berths.  I can say more on this point if the members wish.</p></speech>

There seems to be a problem because Dublin does not do it.  Rosslare and Cork do it but there does not seem to be an appetite for live cattle being brought on boats.  I am not talking about roll-on roll-off lorries, I am talking about cattle being driven onto the vessels.</p></speech>

It is not business we actively go after because, if we did, we would be cannibalising the business of relatively smaller ports, which might not be welcome.  I can get more information for the Deputy on this point.  I am not up to speed on live animal exports.</p></speech>

It would be good if there was a facility for it.</p></speech>

He asked about the question of inter-port competition and whether ports outside the Republic are involved in that.  Belfast is a competitor port, one with which we have a very good competitive relationship.</p><p>  Intra-port competition is very active.  We have four large strong roll-on roll-off terminal operators, three load-on load-off operators and another operator is a hybrid between the two.  It is a company called CLdN, which operates to Zeebrugge and Rotterdam.  Competition is active in the port.  In its report, the Competition Authority acknowledged that intra-port competition was strong.  We have recently issued a new stevedoring licence, which was a recommendation of the Competition Authority and something we regarded as being in the interests of competition in the port.</p><p>  The industrial relations environment within Dublin Port Company is good.  The HR function is very skilled and the industrial relations competence is skilled.  There is no problem.  We do not have industrial relations problems of any significance and we are very good at scanning the environment to make sure that is so.  Some of the staff of the Dublin Port Company are generations working in the port.  They are very hard-working and loyal staff, which is significant in the culture of the company.</p></speech>

These are not the employees of Dublin Port Company but of the various operators in the port.  The growth in job numbers as a result of the new development will not be Dublin Port Company employees but operators in the port.</p> <p>Apparently, for every additional &euro;1 million of throughput a further 200 jobs are generated.</p></speech>

Is there a complementary environment for cruise ships?  If a large vessel is attracted to Dublin, there is no reason Cork Harbour cannot be in the mix.  Are efforts made to attract such business?</p></speech>

A viable cruise ship is one that sails to Galway, Cork, Waterford, Dublin and Belfast.  There is an organisation, Cruise Ireland, which enables us to market together.  The answer is yes, the business is complementary.</p></speech>

Have advances in technology, including automation and so on, had a huge influence on the port?  There are 137 port staff and 3,000 otherwise employed.  Have these numbers varied much in the past ten to 15 years?  Did the numbers employed drop, even though productivity had increased?</p></speech>

That number has been reduced systematically and intentionally in the intervening years, but the jobs did not disappear; they moved instead to the port estate.  We took the decision to concentrate on being an infrastructure rather than a services provider.  The services are still provided and the jobs are still there in their provision.</p></speech>
