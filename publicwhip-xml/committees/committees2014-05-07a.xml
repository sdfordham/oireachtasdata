I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements witnesses make will be published on our website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I ask everyone, including our guests, to make sure their mobile phones are turned off completely or are on airplane, safe or flight mode depending on the device.  It is important they are not left on silent as it interferes with the broadcasting equipment.<br />The first item on the agenda is a presentation by the WALK organisation.  The organisation addresses issues of access by young people with disabilities to education, training and activation.  I welcome Mr. Joe Mason, Ms Gr&aacute;inne Berrill and Mr. Des Henry.  I invite Mr. Mason to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Mason" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700003#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us here to discuss the issues of access and progression for young people with disabilities in regard to further education, training and employment. I am the CEO of WALK. WALK is an innovative, forward thinking organisation that is renowned for leading change within the community and voluntary sector and is highly recognised for its commitment to the provision of superior quality services.  I am joined by Mr. Des Henry, our walkways co-ordinator, and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Berrill, our Louth PEER co-ordinator.<br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  To begin, I would like to read an article by Noelin Fox, who is a PhD candidate at the Centre for Disability Law and Policy in NUI Galway.  Her article states:</font><blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F">This month, my daughter, like thousands of her peers across the country, is moving away from home for the first time.  She is 18 years old and is taking up her place in college, embarking on her journey to independence.  Over the coming months she will have to learn a whole array of new skills which she has no previous experience of.  She will have to manage her (limited) budget, feed herself ... learn to live with [other] people ... manage the academic work ... deal with the bank, figure out bus time-tables, forge new friendships ... she may well make mistakes.  She may submit work late ... spend too much money ... and get involved in unwise relationships ...  Hopefully she will learn from ... mistakes and manage better the next time.  Throughout this process she will have plenty of support [...]</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  How different all this would all be if she had a disability, especially if she had an intellectual disability.  Would she be leaving home at all at this stage of her life?  Probably not ...  On a practical level she may not be allowed to open a bank account or sign a lease ...  If she were deemed by a ... doctor to be unable to manage her money, [her disability allowance or any benefit would] ... be paid directly to us.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  And where would she go anyway?  There are so few mainstream third level education options open to people with intellectual [disabilities] [...]</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  Our systems and structures are designed to support my daughter&rsquo;s progress from home to college and on to employment.  The pathways are clear and open.  ...  For people with intellectual [disabilities] ... the opposite is the case.  Quite apart from the worries of parents about the ability of their ... sons or daughters [with disabilities] to manage [and maintain an independent life] ... the lack of clear pathways is an enormous [task] ...  For young adults with intellectual disabilities the most likely route after school is some form of training or day [activation programme] ... provided by a disability service provider and funded by the health services &ndash; not education.  Although F&Aacute;S or SOLAS funds some training programmes for people with disabilities, the vast bulk of day services and training for people with intellectual [disabilities] ... is funded from the health budget.  So, while our educational obligations to most young adults continues into their twenties, it seems to end at eighteen for those with intellectual [disabilities] ...  This means that if a young adult with [an] intellectual disability does not want to attend a specialist ... post-school education or training programme, they will in general have to forge a path largely unassisted by our state systems &ndash; which in the main only provides recognised pathways to specialist/segregated services for them.</font></blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F">  A number of years ago we asked the service users of WALK what they wanted out of life.  Having a job was at the top of dream list for most. Therefore, WALK needed to support them to make employment a real and tangible goal.  However, we were not set up to meet those needs at that time. Many of the people we were supporting had come from institutions, or had problems with challenging behaviour or very complex needs. Employment had never been an option for them up to this point. We set about finding ways to support them to achieve their employment goals and our research found that the generic and disability-focused employment supports that exist in Ireland were, first, unavailable to them and, second, did not meet needs of this group.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  We successfully obtained the Ireland Wales Programme funding which enabled us to advance and pilot a PEER methodology of providing supported progression routes for people with disabilities, which has proven to be very successful. Through the work of the INTERREG-funded project, it became largely clear that the majority of young people with disabilities are far removed from the employment market at a very early stage, whether they are transitioning out of mainstream schools, special education or rehabilitative training programmes.  It is also clear that we need to catch people at a young age and prevent their need for expensive interventions and intensive services later in life.  It is like the old Irish saying: &quot;T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre&quot; &ndash; &quot;A good start is half the work&quot;.  If we believe that to be true, then no start means no work.</font></p> <p> As noted in our submission document, it is difficult to obtain data on progression rates for young people with disabilities but what we do know is that despite the vast amount of legislation, policies and investment in place, people with disabilities have much lower rates of labour market participation than their non-disabled peers.  We also see evidence on the ground of the limited options and opportunities for young people leaving our education system.</p><p> In 2012 the Department of Social Protection secured funding from the European Social Fund for the disability activation project, DACT.  We successfully applied for funding under strand two of DACT, progression programmes for young people, to deliver the WALK PEER model to 16 to 24 year olds in County Louth.  This funding enables us to roll out the PEER methodology of developing routes to employment for young people with a broader spectrum of disability.  Designing our employment programmes has sharpened our focus on the gaps in provision of support for young people with disabilities.  Almost 20% of people with disabilities finish school with primary education or less and one third fail to complete their secondary education.  The majority of young people with intellectual disabilities progress to HSE-funded services.</p><p> This is what leads to low engagement with the labour market.  People with disabilities are half as likely to be in employment as their non-disabled peers.  Some 85% of people with an intellectual disability are unemployed.  If we do not give people a start early in life, then they will not get a start at all.  Rather than creating a climate of inclusiveness and expectation we have created one of segregation and low expectations.  We must make a variety of options available to young people with disabilities which will ensure that they have genuinely equal employment routes that facilitate them in becoming fully involved as contributing members of our society.  As evidenced by the case studies in our submission, individualised interventions, which have proven to be very successful, often are not complex or costly.  The long-term benefits and savings resulting from the provision of appropriate supports are significant.  There will, at the very least, be an identifiable return on the &euro;1.3 billion per year that we are currently investing in special educational needs supports.  We ask members to ensure that the need for suitable opportunities for these young people does not slip off the agenda.  As requested by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the National Disability Authority is developing a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  This is not solely an issue for the Department of Health, however, because these young people are not sick.  They require extra individualised supports to progress successfully from education to adulthood, with a view to having a full, meaningful and contributing life.</p><p> The DACT project concludes in early 2015.  Section 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2014, on Pathways to Work and the youth guarantee, commits to having a comprehensive strategy on employment for people with disabilities signed off by the end of 2014.  There is, therefore, a challenge for the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills to ensure that activation delivers tangible options for our young citizens from 2015 onwards.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700004#F00300"><p>We appreciate the opportunity to address the committee.  I will take a hop, skip and jump through the committee's agenda by raising issues of concern to us and which we consider are part of the committee's brief.  I will begin by dealing with the issue of income supports for family carers.  I acknowledge the significant achievements made in this regard in recent years.  I am sure people tend to come before this committee to give out about things but two particularly significant developments from our point of view are the reduction in the average processing time for carer's allowance to eight weeks - we would like it to be shorter but it is none the less a massive improvement - and the revised application, review and feedback process for the domiciliary care allowance.</p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to a conclusion in 2012 by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Education and Social Protection that carers are in a unique category.  In the context of the proposed single payment to people of working age, the only group of welfare recipients to be excluded from that payment were carers.  It is worth reflecting on this when designing future income support strategies.  The concept of a core social welfare payment has become significant in recent years in the context of the programme for Government, but there is studied ambiguity regarding whether the half-rate carer's allowance is designated a core social welfare payment.  We would like clarification that it is such a payment.</p><p>  From a carer's point of view, one of the most unfortunate things that happened in recent years was budget 2015 and the cut to the respite care grant.  We would like that to be restored.  Currently the grant is paid if the recipient is caring on a certain date in June.  A carer would receive nothing if he or she cared for the entire year and ceased caring because the care recipient died or went into long-term care on the day before the grant was due.  This seems an arbitrary way of providing financial support.  Even if the payment were made twice a year based on a half year's accrual, it might be an improvement.  During the question and answer session, I will address the question of a contributory State pension for long-term family carers, if members wish.</p><p>  As I noted earlier, we regard the review of the domiciliary care allowance as a positive initiative.  Many of the improvements made to the application process for that allowance could be extended to carer's allowance and carer's benefit.  The review group has also made proposals on the transition period when an individual reaches the end of his or her caring duties.  Due to circumstances outside the carer's control, such as due to the death of the person being cared for, he or she is no longer a carer.  A carer will get six weeks if the care recipient dies but if he or she is taken into hospital, the carer will in principle lose the carer's benefit on the following day.  That is a drastic adjustment and some sort of transition arrangement would be a good idea.</p><p>  We have no argument with the control and fraud initiative but we draw to the committee's attention the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion that error was a bigger cause than fraud when it came to issues of control in income supports.  The biggest issue is that we still do not have automatic notification from the Department of Social Protection to the Revenue Commissioners when somebody is awarded the carer's allowance.  The carer is made responsible for the fact that two agents of the State cannot communicate with each other.  That is relatively easy to fix and it deserves to be addressed.  I accept this is controversial but we support the proposal by the Minister for Social Protection to increase the upper age of entitlement to domiciliary care allowance to 18 years.  The proposal has implications for eligibility to disability allowance and benefit.</p><p>  I want to suggest a useful innovation for the longer term.  Currently medical assessors are employed in the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills, and in the health system, all of whom plead they do not have the resources to do the job as they would wish.  We cannot understand why consideration is not given to merging the three systems to provide a single medical assessment unit.  Three times as many resources would be available to carry out a single review of everybody instead of three reviews of some individuals and no review of others.</p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to a crossover between health and social protection.  We believe there is a widespread policy whereby the HSE withdraws supports from families, in some cases all supports and in others anything over five hours per week, where they are receiving the carer's allowance.  We believe that is frustrating the statutory basis for the carer's allowance as an income support, aside from being highly undesirable in terms of health and social policy.</p><p>  In regard to special education and family carers, cutbacks to supports for children with disabilities who attend mainstream schools are forcing parents to reappraise their circumstances.  Policy in this area aims to encourage people to live as normal an existence as possible.  If by taking the constructive and positive route one is effectively excluded from supports and services, why would one take that route?  While &euro;4 million in additional resources has been allocated this year to help people who are coming out of school to transition into an alternative environment in the HSE, parents often spend the summer, or indeed the following year, worrying about whether a place will be made available.  We suggest, as a simple solution that would not cost too much, guaranteeing a student the right to repeat in the education system if he or she does not get a place.  That is far from ideal but at least it offers a measure of security or safety blanket.  It is possibly an inexpensive but worthwhile innovation.</p> <p>We suggest there needs to be more focus in the education system on young family carers.</p><p> The last area is labour market training and activation.  We welcome the moves to reinvent or reshape community employment into a traineeship approach and to focus on health care as one part of the pilot phase.  We think that is very worthwhile.  We would like to lend our voice to the number of calls that long-term unemployment start at six months rather than 12 months.  I do not know if there are EU problems with that but certainly from a human point of view, 12 months is a long time to have to wait to access some of these things.  By the time it comes around, it may be too late for some.</p><p> We support the vision and aspirations behind Intreo, SOLAS and QQI, but we have encountered a number of practical difficulties in working through some of the schemes they offer.  The quality of referrals through Intreo has been extremely poor.  What is more, the new rules are obstructing some older ways of recruiting which had been effective.  I do not think that will be news to the Department but we had to put it on the record and say we hope there will be more on it.  I noticed Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked a question about the review of the last MOMENTUM programme and he was told there was a report in hand with SOLAS on the recruitment phase but it has not yet been published, so that needs to be kept under review.</p><p> There have been significant failures of co-ordination between the new agencies, in particular in the inaugural MOMENTUM programme.  We support the move to have the people delivering these services for a fee to be paid by results, but if the State system is not delivering on its part of the equation, what one is doing is shifting the risk to the private or the voluntary sector, although one is tipping the dice against the voluntary or private sector and when it does not work, one says that is tough and that it did not do its job.  This was a case where the State was clearly falling down on its end of the deal.</p><p> We are concerned about inconsistencies in entitlements for participants.  This is very demotivating if one is trying to get somebody to participate in a programme and he or she knows that if they do a different programme, he or she will get an extra benefit.  There is no reason for different standards.</p><p> We would like to flag a constant problem.  There is an inherent conflict of interest where State agencies provide some services directly while, at the same time, commission the same services from third parties.  It is generally not a good model from which to operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700005#G00200"><p>I thank both groups for coming in and making their presentations and apologise for delaying them at the start of the meeting.</p><p>  WALK's written submission mentioned the youth guarantee, but that was not touched on.  The youth guarantee is an area where we can address some of the issues raised in its submission because if one looks at the creation of it at a European level, it was designed to include all young people.  If one looks at it from its birth to where it is now in terms our national implementation plan, there have been significant changes to what was first conceived at  European level and what will be implemented at a national level.  At European level, it does not make any distinction between people with disabilities and people without disabilities.  At EU level, it specifically states that it is for all people and it does not state ages, capabilities or abilities, and yet the national implementation plan states that it will be targeted, in the main, at people between 18 and 24 years of age and people in receipt of jobseeker's payments.  That is a mistake which needs to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any views on that and on how the youth guarantee has the potential to help people with disabilities to access further education or even get into situations where they are able to access the labour market?  Do they have any particular ideas on that and on how the Government should implement it as opposed to what it proposes in the national implementation plan?</p><p>  I have a couple of points to make in regard to carers.  I agree completely with making the half-rate carer's allowance a core payment.  I presume one of the reasons the Carers Association is looking to make it a core payment is because of the Government commitment to protect core social welfare payments.  While that is in the programme for Government - I am not playing politics or anything - just stating that the half-rate carer's allowance will be a core payment will not protect it from potential cuts because we have seen how changes in calculation rates and criteria have already affected core social welfare payments.  Everyone in this room would support reversing the decision in regard to the respite care grant, regardless of his or her political background.  We will all put pressure on the Government to try to reverse that.</p><p>  At the end of his contribution, Mr. Dunne spoke about the inherent conflict of interest in State agencies providing services.  Will he elaborate on that and give us some examples of how that affects people?  I refer to the State contributory pension.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, our spokesperson on social protection, recently raised this in the D&aacute;il with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  We spoke about the possibility of introducing a home-makers credit scheme.  Does Mr. Dunne have any thoughts on that particular proposal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700005#G00300"><p>I welcome the representatives of WALK and the Carers Association.  I found both of their presentations very interesting, true and up to date.  I have a personal connection with WALK peer programme in that I shadowed one of the girls, Emer, who is here today.  It was an excellent day and an excellent eye opener to the work that is done to give young people with disabilities an equal opportunity.  WALK certainly does what it says on the tin and provides that opportunity.</p><p>  It was very enlightening to see young people with disabilities, some of whom I had taught in a mainstream school, come to the fore, achieve their full potential and be able to do things which perhaps people would not have expected them to do.  I say that as somebody who saw that happen and as a parent.  As was said, all these young people want is to have a job and to be able to say they are the same as everybody else.  It is fantastic that this is going on.  The example in Louth is fantastic and I would love to see it rolled out all over the country.  I hope that by raising it at this committee, it will enlighten other people and that we can work together to try to roll it out nationwide.</p><p>  I concur with Deputy O'Brien's comments on the youth guarantee.  It is one thing that has stuck out.  When one talks about the opportunities there, we need to look at the youth guarantee because there is a huge gap in terms of the provisions for people with disabilities in the youth guarantee currently.  There is a huge need to include and provide training and education opportunities for people with a disability.  What do the witnesses see as the gaps and the challenges?  How can we, as politicians, help WALK's work to improve it and to bring it to fruition?</p><p>  Funding was mentioned.  Rather than coming from the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills, it needs to be cross-departmental.  Everybody should be working together.  It is not just in this area but in every area of disability.  As somebody said, it comes under the remit of the Department of Health but these people are not sick; they need an education.  It is like sport and disability in that everything comes under this banner and yet it affects every Department.  That is something on which we need to work.</p> <p>On carers, I agree that the cut to the respite care grant was a very tough blow and is something that all parties would like to see reversed.</p><p> On school leavers, it is a terrible dilemma for people when they leave in June or July and do not know where they will be in August.  It is a good idea to let people know in advance but I understood that a directive was issued to the effect that all school leavers must be placed or must know before they leave exactly where they will be in September.  I was under the impression that this was the case and I ask the witnesses to clarify that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700006#H00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  What they do and who they are is at the core of what we are supposed to be as a society, in protecting our young, less well-off and less able.  I wish to ask a question about the WALK PEER programme, which is a brilliant idea on which I congratulate the witnesses.  The witnesses said that almost 20% of those with intellectual disabilities finish school with primary education or less.  That does not seem to be a very bad figure, or is it?  I would have thought that it might be even higher.</p><p>  The Carers Association annual report refers to the fact that the State is saving &euro;4.7 billion through carers, who provide 900,000 hours of care.  It also refers to 2,000 11 year old carers and 4,000 15 to 18 year old carers.  Are they paid?  How are they compensated?  What happens to their educational structure?  Are there any supports provided to them in this regard?</p><p>  I congratulate Mr. Dunne on an extremely brilliant executive summary.  I did a piece on carers on radio yesterday and I had read the annual report in advance of that.  I lived with two families for two days in different caring situations.  It really opened my eyes to the reality. The HSE really needs to walk the walk instead of talking the talk in that context.  Everything Mr. Dunne said is so relevant.  The witnesses have an awful lot to offer this committee and there is much we can do to help them in terms of the youth guarantee programme, educational gaps, grants and so forth.  I ask the witnesses to address the question of the 11 to 18 year old carers and the aforementioned 20% figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014050700006#H00300"><p>I also welcome the two groups to our meeting.  I have not dealt with WALK before but I have read its presentation which I found to be very impressive.  It would be great if its programmes could be rolled out nationwide in the future.  I have worked with Mr. Dunne from the Carers Association on various issues.  On the cut to the respite care grant, Mr. Dunne knows that I moved very quickly to try to counteract it by asking the Minister to ensure carers got a break through the use of some employment schemes.  I know Mr. Dunne has worked very closely with the Department on that.  I ask him to fill the committee in on the progress that was made in that regard.</p><p>  I have spoken to the Minister for Social Protection about the half-rate carer's allowance and she is adamant that it will remain in place.  Mr. Dunne also spoke about pension entitlements for carers, as did Deputy O'Brien.  Every person on carer's allowance gets a carer's credit which is valid for old age pension purposes.  It is as good as a paid contribution once a person has 520 contributions paid from work earlier in life and so forth.  I know of a number of people whose carer's benefit has expired and their income is over the threshold for carer's allowance.  I have applied for a homemaker's credit for those people and they have been awarded it.  Credits are available to people and it is important they are made aware of that.</p><p>  A suggestion was made that the respite care grant could be split in two, which seems like a good idea in the context of, for example, a caree who dies in May.  However, someone who only started caring at the end of May would get the payment immediately.  It is as broad as it is long in that sense but perhaps breaking it up into two payments would cancel out the anomaly that exists.  Reference was made to situations where a carer goes into hospital and loses his or her payment, but that is not quite the case.  The carer can hold on to the carer's allowance or benefit for 13 weeks.  The payment does not automatically cease as soon as the carer goes into hospital.</p><p>  The witnesses spoke about the importance of Departments speaking to each other but I know that is happening.  In the case of third level grants, for example, there is no longer any need for applicants to provide information to the Department of Education and Skills from the Department of Social Protection or from the Revenue Commissioners because their records are all interlinked through PPS numbers.   Reference was also made to a single medical assessment unit, and I wish that was the case.  If such a system operated in the context of medical card applications, it would solve many of the problems currently being experienced by those with discretionary cards.  Unfortunately, however, as we have been advised, medical cards are not awarded on the basis of medical conditions but on the basis of means.</p><p>  On several occasions I have called for a single means testing centre for applicants for all State payments, whether that be housing payments, third level grants, medical cards, social welfare payments and so forth.  If a person has been means-tested once, that information should be shared between Departments.  In that way, individuals would not have to be means-tested on multiple occasions.  When a person applies for a social welfare allowance, for example, he or she is means-tested.  While that person is awaiting approval, he or she can apply for a supplementary welfare payment but is means-tested again.  That is a complete waste of resources and involves a doubling or trebling of the work.  A single means test centre should be considered.</p><p>  I undertook the shadowing programme and had a gentleman in here who shadowed me for the day.  I can certainly say that he could teach me a thing or two, especially about politics.  He knew his politics inside out.</p><p>  I ask the witnesses to comment on some of the issues I have raised.  I could raise several more but I wish to be fair to my colleagues.</p></speech>

There is one question that I meant to ask earlier which is somewhat sensitive.  Those who are born intellectually disabled live in a different world and look at the world in a different way.  When does it become clear that an individual is not capable of getting a job?  Is that a family decision?  I know that many are capable but when does it become apparent that some are not able to operate in the world in which we operate?</p></speech>

We freely admit that there are any number of policies, any amount of legislation and a massive amount of funding in this area, but our questions centre on value for money.</p> <p>Members will see in our submission a diagram which shows the amount of money being spent per year in respect of a person in mainstream education and how when a person with a disability reaches 15 or 16 years of age he or she moves in another direction.  We would question who is making the decisions in this regard.  </p><p> Under the youth guarantee, which is an initiative from Europe, four countries will, because more than 30% of their populations over 25 years of age are unemployed will receive funding.  Ireland is included in this group and will receive &euro;6 million.  While the youth guarantee relates to all EU citizens, in terms of implementation in Ireland it now appears only people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance will benefit.  I cannot explain why or where that change occurred.  Europe has provided the money and requested that it be told only how it is proposed to spend it but the response from Ireland is to include particular people and exclude others who also need help.  I do not understand how or why that decision was made.  I cannot explain it.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, when the implementation plan around it was published we noted people with disabilities were not included.  I could not understand it.</p><p>  What we expected was funding that would allow us to do something different.  We expected some innovation or calls for tenders for something different that might help these groups of young people.  All of the people involved are young people.  The group we represent only want to be treated the same as everybody else.  That is all they want.  If they are treated the same as everybody else, in terms of being given a little extra support, they will progress.  They can and do want to work.  They are well able to work, pay their taxes and contribute.  However, for some reason our system has chosen to deny them that opportunity.  This is evident from what has been happening in terms of implementation of the youth guarantee and, unfortunately, the Pathways scheme, which is also disregarding people on disability allowance.  These two opportunities have been provided to help people who want to work but a decision has been made to help only the people who it is believed can work, leaving others aside.  We would have expected something innovative to happen.</p><p>  On Youthreach, while 50% of the people who go through it do not graduate from it, it is proposed to put more money into it in any event.  It does not make sense.  We do not know who made this decision but we believe it is a mistake.  </p></speech>

The cost to the Exchequer of excluding people because they are in receipt of a disability allowance, thus allowing them to remain in that position for the remainder of their lives, is enormous.

We believe that people with severe and profound disabilities have the same aspirations as everybody else.  However, they might express them in a different way.  For example, as well as being the chief executive of an organisation for people with disabilities, I am the sibling of a young man of 41 years of age who has a severe and profound intellectual disability.  He is my foster brother.  He was fostered by my parents in 1980, at which time he was ten years old and had previously resided at St. Ita's psychiatric hospital in Portrane.  He got a job through our programme 18 months ago, which means he was almost 40 years old when he got his first experience of employment.  Thankfully, my parents, although elderly, are still alive.  My brother tends to go to bed on a Friday and not want to get up until Monday because he is tired after his week of work and entertainment.  He works on a Tuesday morning and a Friday afternoon in Domino's, the pizza establishment.  They are the only two days of the week he is guaranteed to get out of bed.  On these days he gets up, puts on his uniform and heads off to work.  Work is an extremely important part of his life.  He is somebody who we would suggest, and the reports would indicate, is in the severe profound range of intellectual disability.  WALK would never make a distinction between people's different levels of ability.</p></speech>

The primary point made is that the primary curriculum is being delivered in the special schools, whether or not a person is capable of more.  On an individual school basis, people can achieve FETAC levels 1, 2 and 3.  Some people can achieve the junior certificate.  However, the point was made that there are people with intellectual disability who can achieve more than primary level education, which is true.  There are other people who cannot achieve more than primary level education but can be prepared for life.  Currently, the special education system is not necessarily preparing a person for life.  This means a young person of 16 years of age, who is effectively an adult, continues to do primary level mathematics which may be beyond him or her, which leads to their dropping out of school and so on.  People with disabilities who leave school early are not entitled to adult services.  There are very few transition options for young people who do not want to go into a day service setting, which is the main progression route for young people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disability.  While, as there should be, there are a suite of options available to every young person in this country, there is no suite of options available to the people about which we speaking today.  Whether or not a person takes up these options is another story.  Having a variety of options is important.</p></speech>

The system still uses the disregards, although the national pensions framework in 2010 recommended the introduction of credits.  One can have up to 20 years during which one has been out of the work force disregarded.  Our issue with it is that it excludes lifetime carers, that is, people who have spent more than those 20 years caring and, therefore, do not have the requisite 520 paid contributions they need, or people who, because of their caring responsibilities, cannot return to work before the age of 56 or whatever.  It is very specific to those lifetime carers who have dedicated a huge portion of their lives to caring.  The National Carers' Strategy is subtitled "Recognised, Supported, Empowered".  We need that recognition of the major contributions they have made in their lifetimes.</p></speech>

Therefore there is not much difference between benefit and assistance in terms of a pension.  Looking down the road at demographics and all the other challenges, I expect to see the difference between pension benefit and pension assistance begin to open up.  In that situation, wherein somebody has spent his or her life saving the State money, apart from anything else, it is difficult to see why the State would not make the gesture to give him or her the higher amount, partly as an acknowledgement and a validation.</p></speech>

The VECs offer training at costs we could not possibly match because they have built-in subsidies.  There are more egregious examples in the HSE, for example, when it sets a standard in a tender, such as the minimum educational qualification of staff working in a certain area of care.  A definite standard is defined and an organisation such as ours spends tens of thousands of euro training our staff up to that level.  Then the HSE discovers it cannot get its own staff up to that level and the standard suddenly disappears, leaving the standard lower than it was three years previously.</p><p>  Another example is where the HSE tenders out services.  Its staff deliver five hours of services in the middle of the day while any short periods or anti-social hours in the evenings and at weekends are given to the external bodies.  Apart from being a bit unfair to us, it is very unfair to those in receipt of the care because all the medical evidence suggests that continuity of care is better for the person.  In giving those examples I do not suggest any badness.  The issues are inherent to the system.  There should be some sort of control and balance.  Where somebody is delivering and purchasing services there is unlikely to be a totally level playing field.  The person would be superhuman if he or she achieved that.</p><p>  I thank the members for their comments on the need to restore the respite care grant.  I do not know the answer to Senator Mary Moran's question on school leavers.  We have not heard that.  We listen to carers.  I do not mean that in a smart way.  If there is a directive everybody must know about, all I can say for certain is that there are carers who do not know.  We will check up on it because if they are entitled to it-----</p></speech>

They are not and we do not suggest everybody should be paid.  Looking at it internationally, Ireland is particularly generous in its income supports to family carers.  The other side of the coin is that we have relatively few other supports to family carers.  The third factor is that it is extremely difficult to qualify for carer's allowance.  One must be able to show that one is working full-time, more than 40 hours.  While this is not the current guideline, because it is applied in practice, one must work full-time to get one's allowance.  The difference between carer's allowance and jobseeker's benefit is not enough to justify 40 hours a week of hard work.</p><p>  Young carers can be broken into three groups.  There are young carers for whom their situation is good, normal family living.  Every family has challenges and one expects and hopes that everybody would gather around.  There are young people who are under an unusual degree of stress in terms of what they are being called on to do in a family situation but it is manageable.  In a minority of cases the situation is tantamount to child abuse and we must examine that.  We need to view those three categories differently.  The normal family life situation is fine.  In the other situations we try to provide support, part of which is to ensure the systems in which they operate recognise their particular circumstances and challenges.</p><p>  The young people who have inappropriate levels of responsibility must be dealt with in a different way.  The system is under enormous pressure and if anybody picks up the pieces, the system tends to sit back, take a sigh of relief and say it is fine.  In some situations, even if the young carer and the person who is being cared for are both professing satisfaction with the situation, it is possible to examine it objectively and say it is not morally acceptable, probably is not sustainable, and needs intervention before it turns into a crisis.</p><p>  I completely acknowledge Senator Moloney's work on seeking respite breaks as a way of compensating for the cut in the respite care grant.  Although we are still muddling away at that and there has been no major breakthrough, we are engaged constructively in a process and we will see where it goes.  The Department floated the idea of the two halves around the time of the respite care grant cut, when trust among the organisations was so low that there was profound suspicion about any idea of change in the system.  We are considering it and are ready to say it possibly has merits.</p><p>  I thank the Senator for clarifying the issue of the 13 weeks in hospital.  If a person goes into long-term care, the carer's allowance stops immediately.  If a person goes into hospital for more than 13 weeks and has not been able to move to a step-down bed or some other facility, their carer faces losing the carer's allowance and the travel card.  I know carers who are travelling four hours per day to visit people in hospital.  From the carer's point of view, the person may yet come home.  These are very hard, exceptional cases.  I am not saying the Department should give everybody everything but that it should examine more carefully the transition from the carer phase in terms of income support.</p><p>  While it is great if communication is starting to happen between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, technically the carer is liable and that is a worry.  Having fought, in some cases for two years, to get a carer's allowance, a person receives a piece of paper which on the front says, "Congratulations, you have a carer's allowance," and in small print on the back says, "P.S. You are obliged to tell Revenue you are now in receipt of this allowance".  Nobody ever follows it.  While we promote it through the organisation, when somebody has fought for two years for the allowance, it is not top of his or her list to inform the Revenue Commissioners.  However in three years time, if Revenue has not collected money, technically that carer will be hit with a big bill.  This is avoidable and unreasonable and carers have enough to worry about without that.</p></speech>

That is true.  The idea of a medical assessment unit could have been a model in the context of the Government's focus on centralising services and achieving economies.  There was a recent High Court review of a decision to refuse a domiciliary care allowance under the old regime.  The Department is still reviewing it.  The core issue on which the judge criticised the Department was that a medical report from the GP had been disregarded without anybody having met the person about whom the report had been written.  The officials read the report saying what the person needed, decided they did not believe it and put it away.</p> <p>If one was to ask the chief medical officer in the Department of Social Protection how that happens, he would say, quite simply, that he just does not have the staff to do it.  That is a perfectly legitimate argument.  I cannot come in here and ask that another 50 medical examiners be appointed to the Department of Social Protection, but maybe there is another way of looking at it.</p></speech>

A point was made about the domiciliary care allowance that the age limit be raised from 16 to 18 years.  As that has not happened, it is still just a proposal.  I recall it did not happen because of political pressure.  Have the witnesses consulted their members on the issue?  Is it promoted to make it possible for the Minister to introduce that reform because that is a factor when it comes to budgets?  There was much pressure on Government Deputies and Senators in respect of the cut to the respite care grant.  The Minister had an enormous challenge to take &euro;1.5 billion out of the social protection budget and still keep the social protection system intact.  Compared with other countries that have experienced the same difficulties as Ireland, the Minister has done quite a good job in that area.</p></speech>

I have a number of carers who have a child with a disability.  One in particular has a child with leukaemia but the child is attending school.  The carer decided to go back to college to retrain while the child was at school, but because her hours exceed 15, she loses the carer's allowance.  As the child is in school and does not need to be cared for, she has time to retrain.  That is an issue that the witnesses and the committee could take up.  While their hours exceed 15, such people are retraining for future life when they will no longer be a carer.</p><p>  I supported raising the age for domiciliary care allowance from 16 to 18 years when it was mooted.  However, I recognise that as soon as we do that, there will be huge objections from the Opposition parties saying that we are attacking the vulnerable again.  The reason I supported the proposal is that I know many children who were in receipt of domiciliary care allowance but when they turned 16 found it very difficult to get the disability allowance.  When they were younger, they needed more care by a parent, but they became more independent as they approached the age of 16.  However, they lose the disability allowance and the carer, who cared for the child, loses the carer's allowance because the child is no longer in receipt of the required payment.  If the age limit for receipt of domiciliary care allowance was raised to 18 years, there would be continuity until they became young adults.  However, I think there would be huge opposition to that proposal.</p></speech>

We focus on the area of social protection when it comes to carers but there is also an educational focus, particularly when one is transitioning out of the carer phase.  For example, a carer who is caring for a person 24/7 for many years may find himself or herself at a loose end when the person passes away.  Is there anything the Department can do to help those people get back to education, further education, training or upskilling?  My experience from a family situation is that depression is a huge issue for people coming out of caring for a loved one who has passed away.  What is the witnesses' experience of people who suddenly find themselves no longer caring for somebody, how do they got back to normal living in terms of working and socialising and what supports are available to them?  It is always about the income.  After six weeks the income is gone.  The issue is much wider than that.</p></speech>

I have always been supportive of increasing the age limit because the disability allowance is essentially an adult payment.  When a child with a disability reaches the age of 16, one is essentially saying they should apply for an adult payment.  The Senator asked earlier at what point we are telling children or young people with a disability they are not suited to employment.  The disability allowance is a payment for people who cannot participate in employment because of their disability.  That is a critical transition point.  As I recall, budget 2012 proposed that the age be raised from 16 to 18 years, but it was done in tandem with a reduction in disability allowance to &euro;100.  My understanding is that parents were upset about the reduction in disability allowance and not necessarily the increase in the age limit.  I was involved in the national review committee for domiciliary care allowance where we discussed this issue.  Many of the parents groups went back and consulted parents.  Parents overwhelmingly supported an increase in the age limit.  I think it is wrong to give a 16 year old child an adult payment.</p></speech>

Therefore, we would then be battling with public opinion.  It is important that groups such as the witnesses would be very vocal.</p></speech>

At the time we were drowned out in the protests.  The committee knows the true story about Edmund Burke who gave a very inspirational speech to his electors in Bristol.  He said: "I owe a duty to you to do what I think is in your best long-term interests, not what you are telling me you want."  It is very inspiring until one realises he did not get elected until the next election.  I will forward the speech to the committee.</p><p>  On the issue of the respite care grant, having read Pat Leahy's book relatively recently, I sympathise with the Government in that it had backtracked the year before, and if it was to unravel again, I relate to all of that.  However, it was disproportionate but I would be happy to acknowledge that I think the Minister has done a remarkable job given the various pressures that were on her.  I have said it to her and I am happy to say it here today.  Frankly, that was a miscalculation late in the day.  It is interesting that each budget has used a slightly different process.  The process in that budget was that everybody was kept in the dark in certain areas until almost the last minute and there was not enough time to assess the final gradations of decisions that were being made and that such an allowance was being taken off the list.  They all got wiped out the following year so it did not really matter.</p><p>  On the question of a child attending school during the day and a person losing his or her carer's allowance, that issue is buried somewhere in the presentation.  That is an issue not only for education but for somebody going back to work.  The Department says, not unreasonably, that if one is working full-time in the home providing care, how can one do the rest?  For many carers, as a lifeline to sanity plus an assurance around their pension contributions, plus keeping in touch with a future where they might need to go back to work, the way they choose to spend the respite is in working.  Historically, 19.5 hours was the magic trigger around community employment and there was a feeling on the part of the Department that it did not want to go near that.  If the Department does not want to do it for everybody, it is obvious that where a carer is looking after a child who is in an institutional setting for a chunk of most days of the week, of course there is potential for that parent to go out and engage more fully, either in education or in the labour market, and we think that is worth looking at.</p> <p> I refer to the education focus of carers.  There is a limit to what one can do when one is caring but taking bereavements as a trigger, one of the first things one could say to a carer is: "It must be a great relief."  If a member goes to a funeral, I would not advise him or her to use that phrase because the carer has willingly built his or her life around a relationship caring for somebody.  There are bad days but it is not a great relief when that ends.</p><p> The carer gets six weeks grace.  The wife of one of our board members died recently.  He had go into a nice new shiny Intreo office rather than the old labour exchange, queue and, when he reached the top of the line, say that his wife had died and he was there to discuss his options.  It is a rough way to do it.  Carers have six weeks to make the adjustment and we have been asking for a while what it would cost to pay the carer's allowance rather than the jobseeker's allowance for six months rather than six weeks.  It would probably cost a few hundred euro per person, which is not a huge amount.  The humanity that would bring to the process is worth considering.</p><p> On personal assistants, one could argue that family carers are an alternative.  I am not being trite when I say that.  We do not have much of a view on such assistants.  We are certainly not against them but they are not a major feature of the caring relationship.  Our position is similar on disability access.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of evidence that there is no progression route into third level education, particularly for people with intellectual disabilities.  We are doing work on that at the moment with Tallaght IT in the context of a programme based in the college for people.  It is normally called a rehabilitative training programme but it is being reconfigured in order that a person who wishes to access education can do so in the mainstream environment.  DARE is very much a CAO-based route.  A young person who wants to access DARE has to have done the mainstream leaving certificate.  Someone who does the leaving certificate applied is not able to tap into it and that is a big gap as well.</p><p>  Senator Moran has been a fantastic supporter of our programme in many ways.  She asked what are the gaps and challenges we see.  They are so many and we do not have time to go into them now.  This links to the suite of options we referred to earlier.  The progression routes for most young people with disabilities are limited and that is the main challenge.  The person has to fit the service rather than the service fitting the person.  Much of that is funding directed.  New Directions, the Department of Health document, acknowledges that services are not in place to fit the person but to fulfil the needs of the service in respect of tapping into funding.  We would like to see tailored, individualised programmes or services which are accessible in a variety of ways by different people.</p><p>  Senator Moloney kindly proposed the nationwide roll-out of our PEER project, which we would love, but we would like Oireachtas Members to keep the fact that there is a gap in the youth guarantee on the agenda.  A comprehensive employment strategy will be published at the end of the year.  We do not know what it will contain but it will be a great document.  Much of the stuff will have been said previously.  We would like Oireachtas Members to drive the recognition that there is a gap affecting young people and to address how we bridge it.  One of our suggestions might be a working group of like-minded people who would like to drive something like this through.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss the topic of meeting the current housing demand with representatives from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Irish Council for Social Housing, Limerick City Council, the Peter McVerry Trust and Roscommon County Council.<br />I advise members that in order to complete the business in a timely and efficient manner questions should be brief.  Blocks of ten minutes each have been allowed for questions and replies to those questions.  Whoever is in possession in the tenth minute will asked to conclude.  Any extra information may be forwarded in writing to the member.  Those members not given ten minute slots will be allowed five minutes each.<br />I welcome Ms Kathleen Holohan, county manager and Mr. Tom McHugh, director of housing and community, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; Mr. Donal McManus, executive director and Ms Kathleen McKillion, head of development, Irish Council for Social Housing; Ms Kathleen Leddin, mayor Limerick and Ms Caroline Curley, director of services, Mr. Brian Geaney, senior executive officer, home and social development, on behalf of Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council; Mr. Pat Doyle, chief executive officer, Mr. Francis Doherty, communications and advocacy manager, Mr. Brian Friel, head of services, the Peter McVerry Trust; Mr. Martin Connaughton, mayor of Roscommon County Council and Mr. Tommy Ryan, assistant county manager of Roscommon County Council.  I also welcome Ms Christina Fannin and Ms Catherine Finlay on behalf of Roscommon County Council.  I propose taking opening statements in the order I have called, which is in alphabetical order.<br />I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />The opening statements and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website at the conclusion of the meeting. <br />The issue of housing is of particular interest to the members of the committee.  There have been fluctuations in the housing market for many years and the demand for housing seems to be growing again, in particular, in the Dublin region.  We need to develop a housing policy which while meeting a demand in a sustainable manner also reflects the issues.  We wish to avoid at all costs the creation of another property bubble.<br />This is the second of a number of meetings of the committee with various stakeholders on this important topic.  We have invited various voluntary housing organisations and local authorities to engage with us on the topic.  We intend to invite representatives from both the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and officials from the Department of Social Protection to assist us with our deliberations.<br />We hope to explore the relevant issue in order to have a comprehensive exchange of views with all the stakeholders in order to compile and publish a report.  This committee is an adjunct of the Oireachtas and is not an extension of the Government.  It is a cross-party committee comprised of Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  In line with previous reports we hope to achieve a fairly good sound solid report based on the exchanges with all the witnesses.<br />I will invite the delegation from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to make its opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen Holohan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700003#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to make a presentation.  The council's submission has been forwarded to the committee.  The main focus of this presentation will be on meeting the current housing demand but we can answer questions on the general scheme of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p><p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County is spatially by far the smallest county in the State with a population of almost 207,000, an increase of 7,000 in the 2011 census.  The age profile in the county differs from the national average in that there are fewer people aged under 14 years and more people aged over 65 years.</p> <p>In common with other counties, the rate of house completion in the county has reduced significantly, from 3,000 in 2007 to only 200 in 2012.  The most recent population targets suggest a requirement of 2,500 residential units per annum.  There are almost 640 ha. of zoned residential land in the county, of which almost half are currently unserviced.</p><p> With regard to social housing, the council manages a stock of more than 4,200 social housing units and 543 rental accommodation scheme, RAS, units, 396 of which are private rented tenancies and 147 are voluntary housing.  We also have 156 dwellings leased under the various social leasing models and 76 properties have been made available on the rent-to-buy scheme.</p><p> We currently have 4,319 applicants on the council social housing support list.  The housing needs assessment carried out in May 2013 showed the majority of those on the list - 83% - had a general housing need, with relatively small demand for disability, homeless, Traveller specific and age related categories of need.  Most of those on the list - 55% - are currently living in private rented accommodation and a further 20% are living with parents.</p><p> The council uses all the various schemes available to meet demand for social housing in the county.  For households not in priority position to receive an offer under the schemes, the alternative option has been to source private rented accommodation, with or without rent supplement.  However, in recent years, with the recession and accompanying reduction in numbers of dwellings being completed, demand for private rented accommodation, particularly in D&uacute;n-Laoghaire-Rathdown has far exceeded supply and the rents demanded have escalated.  This has had the knock-on effect of reducing the efficacy of rent supplement as a housing solution, as the rent supplement caps, which were revised in June 2013, are well below the average rent rates for family homes in the county. </p><p> The current housing demand has also been affected by an increasing number of households presenting as homeless.  This has occurred for a number of reasons, including banks foreclosing and forcing sales, home owners finding themselves in unsustainable mortgage arrears, householders being unable to afford rents and rent increases and a general decrease in supply and affordability of private rented accommodation.  The increase in current housing demand is caused largely by the lack of supply of dwellings.  Low supply is particularly acute in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, as is the increase in rent rates.  While the council is using all the social housing scheme options available to it, the problem will not be solved by the provision of an increase in social housing supply only.  An increase in the supply of dwellings is required through restarting construction activity. </p><p> The submission circulated by the City and County Managers' Association outlines a number of options for consideration in the context of developing a more strategic and integrated approach to meet housing need, which would include all stakeholders, including financial institutions.  Working in partnership with other public and private stakeholders, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will continue to play a key role in meeting housing needs at local level, whether through direct social housing provision or alternative social housing models.  </p><p> The role local authorities play in providing a broad range of housing supports to marginal communities is often unrecognised as they are often responsible for providing housing solutions where other options may have failed.  Therefore, in devising any new social housing policy, it is extremely important to ensure there is clarity on the future role of local authorities to achieve a positive policy outcome.  It is also necessary for policy-makers to clarify systems of prioritisation in the provision of social housing supports, specifically in terms of disability and congregated settings, medical needs, Traveller accommodation, homelessness, including the provision of supports to homeless families, residential care and the release of sexual offenders.</p><p> While the new housing assistance payment arrangements may have resourcing implications for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the council welcomes the provisions included in the general scheme of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, particularly the sections dealing with procedures for termination of tenancies.  We note, however, that the position regarding the protection of identities of persons giving information regarding anti-social behaviour will need detailed consideration and provisions. </p><p> D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has a strong record of working in partnership with a variety of agencies and stakeholders to deliver social housing.  It is through working together that we must address the issue of meeting current housing need. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McManus" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700004#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for extending an invitation to the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to address the joint committee.  Rather than reading through the submission we circulated, I propose to focus on three key issues, namely, the role the non-profit sector can play in addressing housing needs, the way in which the sector has responded to the financial environment since 2008 and proposals that would assist in enabling the sector to do more to meet current housing demand.<br />The Irish Council for Social Housing was established in 1982 and now counts more than 270 member housing associations.  The not-for-profit sector manages 27,000 homes occupied by families, people with disabilities, older people and former homeless households.  Approximately half the housing managed by the sector is occupied by families, with the remainder focused on groups with special needs. <br />Housing associations are based throughout the country and the sector includes large, small and medium sized associations.  The profile of the sector is shown in Appendix 1.  Since the 1980s, the number of homes managed by the sector has increased from approximately 2,000 to approximately 27,000.  This expansion occurred as a result of increased State investment, better co-ordination of policies and the use of the sector's own resources, including financial resources, land and property and a significant voluntary input.  Housing associations have been involved in promoting good housing management for 30 years.  We have a programme in place to promote outcomes in the areas of rent collection, repairs and maintenance, voids and landlord-tenant relations.  We hope this will form part of the new regulatory framework. <br />In terms of the response of the voluntary housing sector since 2008, the collective output of not-for-profit housing associations reached a peak in 2009 when 2,000 new homes were completed.  This included a number of mixed tenure schemes where housing associations were involved in the management of the social housing element of mixed Part V agreements, with local authorities and developers.  Since then the annual output of new social housing units by housing associations has declined to under 500.  Part of the shortfall has been filled by leasing initiatives and associated activities.  <br />Since the downturn, capital expenditure for the sector has reduced from more than &euro;400 million in 2008 to approximately &euro;40 million in 2014.  This reduction has resulted in a shift from bricks and mortar to revenue based schemes.  In that context, the new mixed funding environment allows interested housing associations to raise loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency or private institutions.  While the financing arrangements provided finance for acquisitions, it has become patently obvious that the number of properties which are fit for purpose for social housing and available on the private market is negligible.  This option is no longer available. <br />The range of schemes in which housing associations are involved and have been actively pursuing in recent years is illustrated in appendix 2.  It includes mortgage-to-rent schemes, regeneration, refurbishment and a limited number of stock transfers.  Most of these initiatives have relied on co-operation with third parties such as property developers.  Reliance on third parties makes predicting the supply of social housing extremely difficult.  <br />In some schemes, it has taken up to 40 weeks to secure approval for funding.  These delays in drawing down funding for schemes need to be addressed because, having invested considerable effort in the various schemes, housing associations find that the process of securing sanction takes too long in some cases. <br />The new regulatory framework will provide reassurance to financial institutions entering the housing sector.  A development capacity survey carried out by the ICSH in November 2013 found that members believed they had the capacity to develop more than 4,860 new homes in the next three years provided three conditions are met.  These are the introduction of a development programme with targets, a clear funding scheme with conditions and loan finance with reasonable terms.  <br />Proposals have been made for the not-for-profit sector to take an enhanced role by working with local authorities to meet housing need.  One of the current structural deficits is the absence in the Department of a dedicated delivery unit.  Such a unit was in place until 2009 and should be reinstated to allow for better co-ordination of funding and policy arrangements to increase supply.  A development programme for the not-for-profit housing sector linked to the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, would be a more proactive mechanism to ensure supply and incentivise associations that are seeking to develop new housing projects. <br /><b></b>Other measures that would assist in meeting housing demand include ensuring nominations for social housing vacancies are turned around quicker.  The nominations protocol for Dublin households should also be fully implemented.  These are two short-term measures that could be activated quickly. </p> <p>The ICSH recognises the benefits in principle of HAP.  We have previous experience of transferring 5,000 households from rent allowance to RAS, but there was no meaningful engagement with the sector.  Direct deduction at source would be useful for the housing association sector.</p><p> The ICSH believes the not-for-profit sector can play an increasing role in meeting housing need, notwithstanding those issues identified previously.  It is essential to have a continual supply of social housing with affordable rents, as dependence on the private sector will not suffice in future.  We see the increasing demand in the rental sector from other categories.  I thank members for their attention and we look forward to their comments and observations.</p></speech>

As they already have my written submission, I will keep my remarks brief.</p><p>  There is adequate land zoned to meet the housing requirements as set out in our core strategy in the county and city development plans.  It will also meet the requirements indicated in the Housing Agency's recently published document, Housing Supply Requirements in Ireland's Urban Settlements 2014-2018.  However, there is still a need for measures to encourage financial institutions to lend money to ensure more proactive private sector housing output.  Expansion of the "living in the city" tax scheme should also be considered to bring additional life to the city centre by bringing back into full use living space in our Georgian quarter.  It is also important that investment continues on public realm works to ensure an attractive city centre.</p><p>  Investment in flood defences is required in a number of areas within the city to ensure that existing built land is not flooded and also to ensure that land that can be used for future housing development is protected.  The current housing waiting list for Limerick city and county has 3,843 approved applicants.  Difficulties arise in sourcing RAS properties as landlords are withdrawing from the scheme.  The void elimination programme is assisting greatly in returning vacant social properties to productive use.  Limerick City and County Councils have received approval for refurbishments of 31 units in 2014.</p><p>  As of 31 January we have agreed 359 new build units with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is anticipated that work will commence on these projects over the next two years with all to be completed by 2017.  The council has also completed a thermal upgrade project to a selection of homes in all of the regeneration areas in 2013 and this project is being extended to include 300 homes in the current year. </p><p>  The council is working in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Irish Council of Social Housing with a view to the involvement of approved housing bodies playing an enhanced role in the proposed delivery of housing projects outlined in the Limerick regeneration framework implementation plan.  It is important that a workable financial model comes out of this process in order that AHBs can deliver certain aspects of the regeneration implementation plan.</p></speech>

They have our submission.  I wish to focus on four areas.  Throughout the last boom, record numbers of people presented as homeless.  So even in the boom we had people homeless at a time when we were building the greatest number of housing units we ever built.  We want to see more builds, but we want it to include the most vulnerable and the most excluded.</p><p>  The Minister of State recently announced a strategy to end long-term homelessness by 2016, which we welcome.  We believe it is achievable if the right measures are put in place.  That would impact on ensuring that the most vulnerable long-term homeless people get off the streets.  We also need a housing strategy involving new builds.  Numerous actions to create more social housing must include housing for the most vulnerable.  So it needs to be different.  Some 80% of homeless people are single individuals.  Young single males represent the highest percentage of homeless people in the country.  European evidence has shown that providing housing first addresses complex needs.  So we need a different type of housing build; we need single-person units to be in the mix also.</p><p>  A shocking number of families have become homeless lately.  As everybody is aware, the numbers have gone from 16 families in January 2013 to 48 families in January 2014.  Although we need units built for them, we do not need all the builds to be three-bedroom houses.  We need single-person units for single homeless people.</p><p>  The housing strategy needs to involve the social partners, the Irish Council for Social Housing and all the approved bodies.  I note that the Minister of State's high-level working group does not contain a representative from a voluntary housing association.  It is made up of representatives of statutory bodies only.  We believe that is a bit of a loss.  Most local authority directors of housing will say that they work in partnership with voluntary housing associations and yet the high-level working group for homelessness the Minister of State has appointed does not contain a representative from a voluntary housing association.  We need a new housing strategy and that needs to involve having all the players at the table.</p><p>  We welcome the Minister of State' recent announcement of capital funding for the CA scheme, which is targeted towards new builds.  The Peter McVerry Trust has some applications in on that.  We know it is oversubscribed, but acquisitions also need to form part of the equation.  New builds will take 18 months to two years to reach completion.  At the last count in November, there were 139 homeless people on the streets in Dublin.  The figures for the new homeless count are not yet published.  We expect it will have dropped slightly but expect it to still be higher than it was in spring 2013.  So we also need capital acquisitions.</p><p>  The last time there was a call for the CAS, it was oversubscribed.  If we get capital acquisitions, the trust along with other voluntary housing associations can turn those properties around in three to four months.  So that shows the difference between acquisitions at three to four months and two years for a new build.  It is also the only time to do it as the property prices are on the rise again.  Now would be an ideal time to bring in acquisitions.  If we wait any longer we will be paying more money for them.</p><p>  We need regulation of the housing market and particularly of the rental market.  In recent years as the boom was ending, the rental market was held out as a solution to end homelessness.  The rental market is swamped now, rents are rising rapidly and there is no regulation of the rental market.  The two lowest socioeconomic groupings make up the majority of homeless people.  They qualify for rent supplement, which was meant to be a temporary measure.</p><p>  Most landlords will now say that they will not accept social welfare rents.  We need regulation and that needs to be linked with the Equality Authority.  People are not allowed to discriminate against somebody on the basis of religion but it is possible to discriminate against somebody for being in one of the two lowest socioeconomic groupings in the country.  We need something in the rental market to stop this discrimination against the poorest people in the country.</p><p>  We need to do more to inform people of their rights and entitlements.  The Peter McVerry Trust works very closely with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Working together in partnership, all the providers and the local authorities in Dublin are doing a huge amount to prevent people from losing their housing.  Landlords are informing tenants they are increasing rents by &euro;200 with only one month's notice, knowing that if the tenants - young person, couple or family - leave that home there will be a queue of other people to fill it.  We need more prevention.</p><p>  The DRHE, Threshold and Focus Ireland are working developing an app and some information campaigns, informing people who feel they will not be able to come up with the rents what they can do.  They can apply and we can advocate for them to stay and argue with the landlord.  Landlords cannot simply increase rents by 25% overnight.  Evidence on the ground has shown that because people are coming from the two lowest socioeconomic groupings, they are not aware of their rights.  They may not be as educated as the landlord.  They are walking out and leaving the facility just before the next rent.  We feel we could keep them in the facility if they engage with us.</p><p>  We need to cut out all evictions.  We cannot be evicting the poorest of people into homelessness.  The local authorities have recently done considerable work with partners to reduce that.  Voluntary housing agencies, such as the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland and others can do a considerable amount to work with those families with such challenges to ensure they stay in their homes.</p><p>  Nobody wants anti-social behaviour next door to us, but it can be managed.  The Peter McVerry Trust has run a specialist programme for sex offenders for the past ten years.</p> <p>Nobody wants to live next door to a sex offender but we have managed to house sex offenders directly in the community over the past ten years.  That is one of the most problematic groups.  We have done that because they cannot go into emergency shelters or they would be targeted and picked on.  We have managed to work with communities to do that without any major difficulties.  If we can do it with such a difficult group, we can do it with anybody else.</p><p> My main recommendations are prevention, an increase in the capital assistance scheme, CAS, regulation of the rental market and a housing strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tommy Ryan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700006#E00200"><p>On behalf of Roscommon County Council I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to present the position of a rural local authority on the forthcoming housing Bill and the more general topic of meeting the current housing demand.  In our submission we examined the general scheme of the Bill and compared and contrasted the proposals therein with the current legislation and practice.  Particular attention was paid to the matters of termination of tenancy, tenant purchase and the proposed housing assistance payment.  We have also summarised the estimated demand for, and supply of, housing in County Roscommon with particular reference to the demand for social housing.</p><p>  Roscommon has a population of 64,000 and is the eleventh largest of the 32 counties of Ireland by area and the fifth least populous county.  It has the second lowest population density after Leitrim.  It is projected that the population of the county by 2020 will be 71,166, an increase of 6,202 persons.  The regional planning guideline states that there are on average 2.5 people in each house and therefore 2,480 houses will be needed between now and 2020.  The housing strategy estimates that 6% of land zoned for residential use needs to be used for social housing, with 370 social houses up to 2020.</p><p>  We have considered three significant operational changes in the Bill.  In respect of termination of tenancy, the council believes that engagement with the tenant at an early stage of rent arrears is critical and is the practice in Roscommon, which in most cases leads to good outcomes.  The county council welcomes the process of a tenancy warning with regard to non-payment of rent.  This legislation will provide the necessary support for this practice.</p><p>  Section 62 has never been used in Roscommon with regard to anti-social behaviour because the council implements the policies and procedures as set down in its anti-social behaviour strategy which provides for the resolution of problems, mediation, multi-agency co-operation and behavioural issues with minors.</p><p>  The council has carried out a detailed comparison of the proposal for incremental purchase with the previous tenant purchase schemes which is appended to our opening statement submission.  Tenant purchase has often had the effect of providing stability within a local authority estate by contributing to the mixed tenure nature of the development.  Disposal of local authority housing assets during a period of almost zero construction, however, will reduce the availability of the number of social housing units.</p><p>  The introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, as a social housing support to assist rent supplement recipients who have a long-term housing need is welcome.  Its introduction will consolidate all forms of social housing supports within the remit of local authorities.  It is a new departure for local authorities and will take some time to implement.  The transfer of the long-term rent supplement recipients into HAP will challenge human and financial resources available to local authorities.  In Roscommon there are approximately 800 persons receiving rent supplement, approximately 513 of whom are in receipt of long-term support.  This will significantly increase the council&rsquo;s responsibility from its existing 1,200 tenants and 420 rental accommodation scheme tenants.  The council has set out in its submission some observations to be considered for the implementation of the scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700006#E00300"><p>Housing waiting lists vary around the country.  The last time I saw the figures, approximately 50% of the waiting list was concentrated in three counties: Dublin, Cork and Kildare.  They are at the apex of the crisis of homelessness for families.</p><p>  The experience in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown closely matches that in my area.  Some local authorities are almost becoming homelessness agencies.  How does the council deal with families and what kind of resources does it dedicate to this?  Does it deal differently with families?  For example, are child welfare issues considered where children are involved?  There seem to be two major faults in the HAP scheme, one of which is a major resourcing issue at a time when there is an embargo.  What engagement has there been between the Department and the local authorities on that embargo in respect of workforce planning for HAP?  The Minister for Social Protection has told me that no one will be transferred from the rents unit in her Department.  One cannot magic up solutions when the ratio of staff to population differs so much throughout the country.</p><p>  In theory, HAP is a good idea and would address some of the poverty traps in the rent supplement scheme that arise if people take up work, which is possibly a disincentive.  The second fault line, however, is how local authorities, particularly Limerick, which is the lead authority in this area, deal with tenants who pay under the table.  We are all aware of these tenants.  I do not know anyone in my area who is not topping up.  Is it acknowledged?  When Focus Ireland came before the committee a couple of weeks ago it said, it had offered to give the names of people to show this was happening but the Department said it would withdraw rent supplement from those people, effectively making them homeless.  Focus Ireland would not do that to its own clients.  How do local authorities acknowledge something that is not acknowledged and deal with it in respect of HAP?  We need to write a report on this issue.</p><p>  I am surprised that the mix of private, direct local authority provision of social housing and the not-for-profit sector is not included in the high level committee.  It will be necessary because that is one of the areas from which funding can be drawn down.  We should include that in our report.  Dr. Michelle Norris told us there was an impediment to drawing down funding.  What is that impediment?  If 4,800 houses could be built in that sector over the next three years that would be a valuable contribution and it would be useful to us to know about the impediments.</p><p>  My questions are directed at the Irish Council for Social Housing, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Limerick County Council and the Peter McVerry Trust in respect of the increasing number of families presenting as homeless.</p></speech>

We feel that as a key player in the sector, in partnership with local authorities, that needs to be addressed.  We would like to be at the heart of that.  We met separately with representatives of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and just a week or so ago we met the four Dublin directors of housing on how to address the current homeless problem and the high media profile issue concerning families.  We need to be part of the formal structures.</p><p>  Mr. McManus in his introduction mentioned how there should be more effective use of the stock we have currently, and we are well aware of void properties in local authority stock, concerns about access to funding and resources to carry out remedial works to bring them back to use.  It is a significant issue.  The Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, through housing association performance management, collects data on how long it takes to let a property from when one tenant leaves to when another moves in.  We rely on the local authorities, which are the gatekeeper of all housing options, and the number one reason our member housing associations throughout the country tell us for the delay in properties being used, the number of which is rising yearly, is a delay in local authority nominations.  We need to improve the efficiency of the process on the ground to see immediate outcomes.</p><p>  There is an implementation plan from the housing oversight group relating to homelessness, which will be discussed this afternoon, and there are many recommendations and proposals in there.  Part of the process must consider housing associations working in partnership with the local authority to bring stock back into use.  The funding of all these strategies must be examined, as there is much conflicting need.  The growing waiting list is evidenced by all, but some people are only there to access rent supplement, which is a major issue in itself.  There is also the national disability strategy to consider, and everybody is trying to pull from the same limited housing supply.  We have exhausted reliance on the private sector and we must get back to building.  There must be a scheme to house special needs individuals and particularly the most vulnerable homeless people, including those with a disability and elderly people, but the budget for it has been slashed by over 60% in recent years.  The capital loan and subsidy scheme, which housed families, no longer exists.</p><p>  We have a big part to play and we are accessing private finance.  Members inquired about impediments.  The Housing Finance Agency has been lending to local authorities for a number of years and the ICSH has called for direct lending to housing associations.  The doors opened on that a few years ago, although it is a slow two-stage process.  Housing associations must be approved for certified borrowing status, and to date seven of the larger general needs housing associations have been granted such status.  The feedback we get from members who have applied and have not been successful - there are many, including some homeless organisations and other special needs providers - is that the approval for this status has not been granted.  We have spoken to representatives of the Housing Finance Agency with a view to almost having another tier of associations coming in with, for example, a lesser lending rate, because we need to get more associations involved.  We have heard that money is available, and initially it was only available for acquisitions but it is now available for new builds.  We welcome such movement but there is still a risk to the charitable non-profit housing associations in the initial construction phase.  It is an iterative process which takes time, although we welcome further engagement on that.</p></speech>

We do not simply put people on a list, and part of our function is to provide assistance and advice.  We do this in partnership with a number of agencies, especially Focus Ireland and Threshold.  One of our most important functions is trying to advise people about their housing position.  There is a robust and detailed assessment and placement service for families facing homelessness, and we also have a dedicated and specialised welfare section, which would have the welfare of applicants and their families to the fore.  It is very difficult for both staff and families but we try to do our best in offering advice and looking to place people in the best accommodation available.</p></speech>

With regard to rent caps, as we indicated in the submission, the basic problem now is that demand far outstrips supply.  Until there is an increase in supply, I am not sure what other solutions there will be.</p></speech>

A house is a person's castle but if one does not have a house, one has nothing.  The Government has recognised that and by inviting the groups' submissions today, the committee has done the same.  We must digest them further.  Housing is the most important item on the agenda, although jobs are also important.  If children are not in a house and they do not have a good start in life in a home, they are on a slippery slope to nowhere.  We must recognise that.</p><p>  A &euro;68 million fund was announced last month, but has that helped in any way?  Should it be utilised differently?  Everybody must prioritise in our current position.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about HAP.  I was a member of South Dublin County Council for 20 years so has HAP improved the process?  What other improvements could be brought about?  Mr. McManus mentioned the shift from bricks and mortar to revenue-based schemes, so can he elaborate on this to see how feasible it would be?  Landlords withdrawing from schemes is a major problem and rent rates are increasing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has spoken of how rent is linked to GDP in other countries, so the matter is being considered, although I do not know what will come from it.  It is an important concept.  If a scheme is capped, there may be an exodus and developers may decide not to build any more houses if there is no incentive or it cannot be rented at market value.  How could we balance the scales in favour of people who need a home?  The process has been linked to GDP in other countries but how can that be balanced from a bottom-up approach?  The witnesses have experience and could give this advice.</p><p>  Capital acquisition means turnaround of houses can occur in three to four months, which compares favourably with the building method.  People in one bedroom apartments which are not suitable want to move up the ladder.  This applies particularly to local authorities and shared ownership schemes, and for example, people may have bought a one bedroom apartment but they could have two children.  How could they be moved to a two bedroom property?  Could there be a negotiation or strategy involving local authorities and the parties involved?</p> <p>The person who has taken the loan with the authority is bearing the brunt.  Naturally, one cannot bankrupt a local authority by making it take some of the pain as well.  That is a question that is on my mind because everyone is taking some of the pain but I accept it might not be feasible.</p><p> The lack of involvement of members of non-governmental organisations dealing with the homeless community is one of the issues we will raise with the Minister.  I am sure it is not written in stone that there could not be one other member.  Perhaps there are reasons for that.  Such an input to the high level group would be important.</p><p> Early intervention is the best way.  I attended a presentation on early intervention in child care this morning.  Such intervention is important to prevent anti-social behaviour and to ensure a person does not become homeless.  Pat Doyle spoke about the issue.  Could the witnesses specify one thing that local authorities could do to facilitate early intervention and so stop the rot before it happens in terms of homelessness?  I refer to financial and social reasons.</p></speech>

It represents most of the voluntary housing associations and is very much linked with the homeless associations as well.  If the issue could be brought to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, we would be very happy for the council to take up the seat representing the voluntary sector.</p><p>  The question of the one intervention we could take to prevent children becoming homeless is a complex one.  Every time a decision is made in the Department of Education and Skills, it affects homelessness.  We always try to ram the point home.  Although it might not happen in the lifetime of the Government, if the Minister for Education and Skills were to increase class sizes or take other measure that would impact on the poorest children, it would affect homelessness.  What is synonymous with young people becoming homeless is that they are all early school leavers.  The first major departmental group with which they engage is the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  In the long term, we need to do more to preventing children from leaving school.  We have done a lot to improve literacy skills in recent years.  Previous Governments removed book grants and one does not see the impact of such measures until years later.  Education is a key area.</p><p>  Family support agencies in the health area are also important.  If we take &euro;50 million out of the mental health budget, that will affect homelessness in the future.  We always say that the housing and homeless strategy needs to be a Government strategy as well as a strategy of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In the same way as legislation is gender-proofed, we almost need to homeless-proof, as it were, budgets.</p><p>  I stated earlier that the number of families becoming homeless is increasing.  Since January 2013 there have been 16 new presentations of families a month.  The number jumped to 48 this month.  Repossessions of buy-to-lease properties are beginning to happen.  The banks are going after them.  When the banks take them back, they want vacant possession, which will bring families into what is currently a very overcrowded service.  I am in favour of resourcing families when they need to be housed but when they present in greater numbers, more single people who cannot get access to housing will end up on the street.  I have tried to answer the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tommy Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700008#G00700"><p>In regard to the cap on the rent supplement, the effect it has depends on supply and demand.  For parts of County Roscommon &ndash; the smaller rural villages - the cap is not a problem but in the areas located nearer to urban centres such as Roscommon town and Monksland, which is on the outskirts of Athlone, it is impossible to get accommodation for the level of rent provided for in the rent supplement.</p><p>  For example, we have to rent houses from the private sector under the rental accommodation scheme.  We cannot obtain houses for less than the cap set out in the rent supplement and we have to pay in excess of it when we go to the market or we will not get houses for our tenants.  There must be a revision of the cap on rent supplement under the housing assistance payment, HAP.</p><p>  In terms of acquisition versus new build, that depends again on where the houses are located and if they are in a suitable location.  In a county like Roscommon that has a large geographic spread &ndash; it is approximately 60 miles from north to south and 40 miles from east to west &ndash; sometimes where the houses are available for sale does not correspond to the location of our housing applicants.  Acquisition rather than new build might not solve the problem.  One needs both approaches.  If one is to have a capital programme for the provision of housing, one needs to develop a construction programme as well as an acquisition programme.  I accept it will take longer to get the construction programme up and running but if one plans it in time, it will be successful.</p><p>  Homelessness is not a major issue in Roscommon but we work very closely with the other agencies, in particular with community welfare officers.  We can sort matters out fairly quickly for anyone presenting as homeless in Roscommon in terms of providing private rented accommodation.  The main issue that arises is emergency accommodation for a few nights.  I do not know if that covers everything that was asked.</p></speech>

There will be bricks and mortar but it will be spread between some limited State money and some private finance.  With the new mixed funding arrangement, one could build three new houses compared with one house in the past for 100% finance.  That is the shift.  There is nothing inherently wrong with moving from 100% capital to revenue as long as it is balanced.  That goes back to what Deputy Murphy mentioned about drawing down the money.  The drawdown process is more complicated and the hurdles need to be overcome in that respect, but the shift from 100% funding to 60% or 70% is doable.  It has happened throughout the world and does mean one is providing three social houses with bricks and mortar for one through 100% funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700008#G01000"><p>I have other meetings to attend.  We know there is a massive housing crisis, and a homelessness crisis in particular.  Since 2008 we have had cuts of &euro;1 billion in the housing budget.  We should not mask the figures.  Even last year &euro;60 million was cut from the housing budget.  We keep hearing that more funding is being added but that is not the case.  We should put that in the context of the previous cuts.</p><p>  Reference was made to Part 5 and what we got in housing in terms of the 20% when schemes were built.  I would like to hear the opinion of witnesses in that regard.  The voids have built up as a result of the natural turnover in most local authorities.  One moved and one dealt with the voids, but because of the lack of funding, a huge build-up developed &ndash; more than 1,800 across the country - and we are now getting funding for 900.  We are only catching up on what should have been a natural progression.  That is why the lists have been getting bigger.</p><p>  Comments were made about the cap on rent supplement.  Unless we put rent control in place we will ask for more trouble because all we will see is an increase in rent.  We need a system of rent control whether it is tied to inflation or the cost of living.  There is no way around that.</p> <p> I know that many voluntary housing groups are represented here.  In the past, the local authorities were the main providers of housing.  I wonder what would happen if the local authorities were set up in the same way as the voluntary housing groups in terms of accessing funding.  Does anyone have an opinion on whether that could work?  The Minister has indicated that it could work.  When I spoke to officials in Dublin City Council, they said it could not work.  I would like to hear why it could not work.  Why should the local authorities not be able to access the open market to add to their housing stock?  Why should they not be able to borrow on that basis, through the Housing Finance Agency or otherwise?  I would like to know whether people think that can be done.</p><p> I agree with everyone that evictions should stop.  I believe we need to find a solution to this problem.  We are going to have more and more mortgages getting into deep trouble.  We are heading into a further crisis.  Approximately 180 people are being housed in hotels every day at a cost of much more than &euro;14,000 a day.  That money is being thrown away.  We are fighting every day to chase places in hotels.  If one or two families are put out, the local authorities cannot even house them.  It is an absolutely crazy situation.</p><p> A new tenant purchase scheme is about to start.  I believe the moneys in question should be ring-fenced for housing and not put to any other use.  I would like to hear people's opinions on that.  In the past, these moneys have been used for various things.  That is a scandal.  It should be ring-fenced.</p><p> I would like to speak about the issue of financial contributions.  In my own area of Finglas, more than 100 people who are on a list to go to senior citizens accommodation or otherwise are waiting for financial contributions.  There is a source of revenue that can be utilised if it can be brought on stream again.  There is a danger in this regard, however.  We have to make sure this does not add to the property bubble and cause prices to be put up.  That is why rent controls are so important.  We must put them in place in order that increases do not happen.</p><p> I want to ask about what happens to couples who own properties when they separate.  A different rule seems to apply in rural Ireland compared with Dublin City Council and the main local authorities.  Dublin City Council will accept that someone has a housing need if he or she can prove that he or she is separated and cannot afford a property. If such a person moves back to Dublin from another area, he or she can get a letter stating that he or she has a housing need.  If the property is sold, the funds accruing from that will go towards the local authority, if necessary.  Some local authorities do not seem to act in this manner.  I have received mixed reports from Cork and places like that.  I would like to hear about the experience in the local authorities that are represented at this meeting.  Is there a block of people who end up in these situations?</p><p> I have told the Minister that solutions are needed.  We have identified through parliamentary questions that &euro;1 billion is available to be used under the strategic investment fund, or the old pension fund.  We need to start building more social housing.  I know people have said it is not the be-all and end-all, but it sets the parameters for the control of housing.  There are many positives associated with the construction of social housing.  It can be used to take people off the rent supplement or rental accommodation schemes.  The savings that accrue from building social housing and putting people into it are important, as are the moneys gathered by the local authorities as a result.  There are many pluses in this regard.</p><p> I would like to say a few words about the issue of homelessness.  More than 5,000 people are on the homeless waiting list.  Many people are presenting as homeless.  It has been mentioned that 46 families presented themselves in a single month.  That is mad.  There is no way we will end the homeless strategy in such circumstances.  I would like to hear people explain how the present policies will solve the homeless situation.  I cannot see it.  When I spoke to a manager in Dublin City Council the other day, he told me that the council is being told to direct homeless cases as priorities.  It is all very well and good to direct most of the housing that is coming on stream to this sector, and I agree with such an approach, but we have to watch what we do thereafter.  People on the housing list or on rent supplement can have a housing need that is every bit as bad.  They could eventually end up on the homeless list.  It is going to be a vicious circle.  I think we need to be careful about how we do things.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about the Part V system.  I can only speak about the experience of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  There were difficulties associated with it in our county at the height of the boom when developers wanted to give us money and did not want to give us units.  By the time the collapse had come, they wanted to give us units but they did not want to give us money.  It had turned around.  We achieved nearly 600 units between social and affordable housing in that period.  It took an awful lot of complex work.  By the time the developer applied for planning permission, he might have been quite a long way down the road in terms of design, etc.  This meant we did not have as much control over the design of the units as we might have liked, or would have had we been building the units ourselves.  We got a developer to build a halting site for us.  Various things like that were useful.  The Part V system certainly had its place and had a role to play.  I would not like to see it disappear completely.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable for anybody - the housing applicants or the housing authorities - that a number of people are living in hotel accommodation.  We are working closely with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to try to alleviate that situation.  The Deputy mentioned the prioritisation of homeless cases by local authorities.  This is one way of alleviating the problem.  If we can try to get some more units made available to us through the voluntary housing bodies, that might get us over the current situation with regard to those in hotels.</p><p>  As we said in our submission, the basic problem at the moment is housing supply.  It has been made much worse by the current situation - the increased number of people on the waiting list and the increased number of people presenting themselves as homeless.  The prioritisation of homeless cases by the local authorities, together with the provision of additional units from voluntary housing bodies that we are hoping for, will at least get those families out of hotels and into more suitable accommodation.</p></speech>

Roscommon County Council does not issue letters saying that such people qualify for social housing.  However, we have an arrangement with the Department of Social Protection and the community welfare officers whereby they look favourably on any applications for rent supplement made by such people.  While we do not formally issue letters to such people telling them they qualify for social housing until the issue of the ownership of the family home has been resolved, there is still an arrangement in place with the community welfare officers to ensure they are not left in a position in which they are unable to provide accommodation for themselves.</p></speech>

Some local authorities are adopting a hardline attitude to the owners of properties and will not move until the issue of ownership is resolved.  Dublin City Council has been much more flexible in the sense that it accepts there is a housing need.  It will allow a person to access rent supplement without putting him or her on the housing list.  This does not seem to be working elsewhere.  It is a serious problem.  People cannot stay in their homes.  It depends on which county one is in.  One is better off in one county than in another.  That is the point I am making.</p></speech>

They do not get a letter putting them on the social housing list but they can certainly access rent supplement.

The Fr. Peter McVerry Trust stated that homelessness doubled in the boom time when there was much building.  Has it any means of accounting for how and why that happened?  The Irish Council for Social Housing stated the nominations protocol which was agreed between the four Dublin local authorities is not fully implemented.  Why is this the case and how can it be improved?  Could the council also give us more detail about the use of the leasing model for small housing associations?  What are the views of the delegations on rent controls?</p></speech>

There has been some uptake of social leasing by small associations but it has been difficult for them to raise finance.  We recommend they use social finance companies.  Leasing tends to be used by the more active associations.</p></speech>

It, however, does not seem to be implemented on the ground.  We ask our members about nominations they receive but they are unable to identify them or it has not been clear they have been prioritised.  There seems to have been some recent improvement in that.  We do need to address this current situation in homelessness but it needs to be balanced by ensuring mixed and sustainable communities.</p><p>  There has been some talk about rent controls.  There is an issue of rising rents, particularly in Dublin.  I have evidence of it personally with getting 28 days&rsquo; notice of a significant rent increase.  There is very little one can do about that when the market is moving that way. It certainly causes serious issues for those on rent supplement.  We all see the advertisements for letting which state applicants on rent supplement are not welcome.  There needs to be a review of the caps.</p><p>  The whole move to HAP, housing assistance payment, appears to be workable.  It makes sense to have a long-term housing support in the place of the local authority.  We have not, however, been included in the proposed direct deduction of source from welfare as the local authorities have.  We do need to have a role and know what impact it might have.  It appears to suggest it will increase housing provision and that there is money available.  We need to know about that.  We certainly feel the housing list may reduce if people accommodated through HAP are deemed to be adequately housed.</p></speech>

That is why we are calling for a national housing strategy.  During the boom, thousands bought a second home for buy-to-let.  We had shared ownership for certain groups but many homeless people did not have access to them because they did not have employment.  That was at time when we were talking about full employment.  Most homeless people, particularly young single males who left school at 14 and were in and out of the prison system, were not getting these jobs during the boom.  We had a housing boom with full employment and yet there were people from the low socio-economic groupings on the edge.  We are looking for a housing strategy that will not be all three-bedroomed houses but that the most vulnerable and marginalised will get access to housing.</p><p>  We are also calling for an oversight body on rents and rent legislation.  The private rented sector has always formed part of the market for housing homeless people.  We need regulation in the rental market and for rent caps to be linked to inflation.  We have had rent caps reduced in the past years.  They need to be increased now to go with market value.</p><p>  We do not want, as Deputy Ellis said, people heading into homelessness as a means of getting housing.  We do not want families going into hotels which might be ten miles from their child&rsquo;s school just to get access to housing.  I believe we can end long-term homelessness, namely those who are homeless for over six months, by 2016.  That is why we believe the acquisition of housing rather than its build over the next two years will help us hit that target.</p></speech>

The Limerick delegation stated there was adequate land zoned for the building of houses.  If we are to have a successful strategy, we need to have a mix of acquiring and building housing.  Voluntary housing associations will often acquire parochial, diocesan or trust lands.  Applications have gone in for the CAS, the capital assistance scheme, and decisions will be made on them soon.  There might, however be an issue about acquiring land.  Are the rural local authorities going that route?</p><p>  How many cases of youth homelessness, particularly in Dublin, are there?  Ghost estates are a big issue with rural local authorities.</p> <p>There are many houses but they are in the wrong areas.  I represent a rural part of Galway, which has houses but they are not in the right places, and this is also happening in Dublin with regard to families in hotels.  They are also in the wrong place and should not be there.  As Mr. Doyle mentioned, there is an issue of other Departments being involved with regard to education, employment and the health services.  In Galway city, the Simon Community and the HSE try to organise dental, podiatry and chiropody services for people who are homeless.  I fully support voluntary organisations being on a high-level group.  There are two high-level groups and there is much analysis but not enough action.  We would all agree on this.  Mr. Doyle also mentioned establishing a special Oireachtas task force to examine the issue of homelessness.  I suggest the committee could support this because it is a serious situation and the committee could feed into the policy, and the right policy would be deliverable.  We could tackle the homeless issue through such a task force.  I hope the committee will examine this.</p><p> Mr. Doyle also mentioned a dedicated unit in the Department and I fully support this.  Will there be dedicated units in local authorities as there is with regard to tenant purchases or housing grants for disabled persons?  Sometimes when one speaks to a local authority about mortgage-to-rent scheme cases, not much information is available and there is no dedicated unit for those who face eviction.  We do not want to see evictions continuing if we can come up with a solution which would be acceptable to local authorities and the banks with regard to the various forms one must complete before one is even considered for the mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p></speech>

We have no issue with voluntary housing associations playing a role.  In our submission we indicated that plenty of land is zoned to meet housing demand but the issue is getting the moneys freed up from the private sector to increase private output.  I can only speak about Limerick and much of the talk here seems to be about larger urban areas such as Dublin and about the homelessness issue.<br />Deputy Kitt asked about youth homelessness and thankfully it is not a huge issue for Limerick.  There is a regional homeless centre in Limerick and approximately 1,000 calls are received per week.  We have sufficient and adequate beds in the city and we work hand in hand with a number of voluntary agencies.  We do not have people on the streets.<br />Limerick is very fortunate with regard to ghost estates as it was unfortunate during the boom and they are not a large issue.  We are in the process of acquiring one of the ghost estates in the city which will be used for social housing.  It takes much paperwork with regard to receiverships or NAMA.<br />Having dedicated units in local authorities depends on the size of the local authority.  In some smaller local authorities all staff must be <i>au fait</i>with all areas.  Some schemes may not be promoted or do not work.  We have only had a handful of cases in Limerick for the rent-to-buy scheme, but people are well used to dealing with voluntary agencies and bodies and are familiar with the schemes they operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tommy Ryan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700011#K00400"><p>The ghost estates were planned during the boom when we had continuous growth.  There are some ghost estates in smaller towns and villages in Roscommon which were developed in accordance with population projections at the time.  Due to the downturn in the economy, there is not the same demand for houses in these locations.  The demand for social housing in smaller towns and villages has also fallen.  Many unfinished states are in smaller towns and villages where demand for social housing is not high.  The demand is in larger urban centres such as Roscommon town and Monksland, which is near Athlone.  This leads to a supply issue as these areas do not have enough housing.  There will be a need for some form of construction programme, such as direct provision by the local authority, long-term leasing from the private sector or approved housing bodies under the capital advance leasing facility, CALF.  Rents for private accommodation are increasing so the only solution in larger urban areas is to begin construction.</p><p>  Roscommon has a number of small local parish approved housing bodies and I am not sure whether CALF would be suitable for them because it is not fully funded.  These bodies are not in a position to avail of it and it will only be available to larger housing bodies.  This will leave a gap in smaller towns and villages such as we have in Roscommon and east Galway.  I do not know how this can be dealt with unless through direct provision by local authorities or a change to the scheme which would suit small housing bodies.  We have a demand for houses throughout a large geographical area but the unfinished estates will not resolve the problem.</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government acknowledges that CAS works by providing the association with a percentage of the market rent paid to the landlord who receives a deduction because the housing association is managing the property, or there is a loan through the Housing Finance Agency or the local bank.  The percentage is based on the market rent, so where market rent is low outside Dublin it does not stack up financially.  There is an absolute deficit in housing supply throughout the country and it is acknowledged it will work in urban towns.  This is why CAS is critical with regard to acquisition and new build.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Doyle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700011#K00600"><p>I echo what Ms McKillion stated.  It is also not suitable for specialist housing associations such as the Peter McVerry Trust which works with the more lower threshold groupings.  One cannot apply to build 20 units in one location for very difficult and challenging people.  One needs a pepperpot approach with scattered housing, for which acquisitions are perfect.</p><p>  To answer Deputy Kitt's question on youth homelessness, this will always be an issue so long as large amounts of alcohol are consumed in homes.  So long as alcohol is readily available from off-licences there will be family violence and break up and generally young people walk in response to this.  There is also the issue of parents prematurely dying because of alcohol and drug misuse and children walk away.</p><p>  In the past week we picked up two teenagers aged 19 and 17.  Their parents had died prematurely and the younger child was in the care of the older child, whom we still consider a child but whom the State considers an adult.  Their landlord increased the rent and they walked.  We were asked to pick them up between Gardiner Street and Dorset Street.  We did so and they have been housed.  We also picked up two brothers, aged 20 and 17, at a railway station on the south side.  We received a call from Irish Rail to state they were sleeping in the railway station.  They had never been in homeless services but their mother fled from domestic violence and while the mother and young daughters were taken into a refuge, the two boys were not.  It was considered to be a child protection issue to have them in a refuge with younger children.  They were left to sleep in the railway station and we picked them up.</p><p>  We will always have a problem with youth homelessness and the issue is how we respond to it and the services we put in place.  We could support the two boys in an apartment setting where we visit them.  They do not need to come into homeless services, or to be introduced to drugs and criminality in the city centre.  We could house them in an apartment and visit them daily if we had access to apartments.  The difference between now and two years ago is that back then we would have put them into private rented accommodation, paid a deposit upfront and then seen what we could get back from the Department of Social Protection later, but now we compete with 22 other people for the same private rented accommodation.  This is why we need a return to acquisitions.</p></speech>

I also welcome this discussion because there is no more urgent discussion to have and I hope it will lead to action and policy change.</p><p>  Do the delegations categorise the current situation as a crisis?  I want to know because one cannot begin to address the problem unless one alerts people to how serious it is.  Maybe the problem is more acute in my area than in other areas.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has alluded to the fact that the problem is very bad in Kildare and we have heard testimony from Limerick and so on.  I would describe the problem in D&uacute;n Laoghaire as an emergency because I have never seen anything like it.  The staff in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown council have been completely overwhelmed by what is going on.  My office has become an extension of the welfare, homeless and housing departments of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council with the arrival of a number of families in dire circumstances.  I have never seen a situation where the council literally says to people, "We do not know what to do.  We have nowhere to put you."  That is how bad it is.  If we are going to force the issue on to the Government's priority agenda then we need to name it as a crisis.  Do the delegations agree with me that this is a crisis?  </p><p>  The Peter McVerry Trust alluded to the fact this crisis did not start in the past two or three years and that a build-up to the problem was already apparent during the boom.  I wholeheartedly concur with its view.  Housing has always been the biggest issue for me and accounts for about 80% of what I deal with.  The problem has got severely worse but it has always been the biggest issue for me.</p><p>  In terms of a starting point for dealing with the matter, it is important that we recognise there has been a market failure in terms of the provision of affordable and social housing.  Do the delegations agree with me?</p><p>  I am worried by the fact that the Taoiseach still talks about the issue in terms of the need for 25,000 houses to be provided per year.  I am worried by the fact that he has not made a distinction between commercial and for-profit provided housing and affordable and social housing which, in my opinion, are two very distinct things.  Do the delegations agree with me?  I do not believe that the for-profit market can resolve the problem.  As the McVerry Trust has stated, the government did not resolve the matter during the boom and the problem has worsened since the bust.  The idea that the market can deal with the problem is, to my mind, fantasy in the extreme.  The distinction has not been spelled out in the responses received from the Government on the nature of the crisis.  I would like the delegations to comment on the matter.</p><p>  Can we start to name figures for what needs to be done?  We had a drama concerning numbers in the D&aacute;il when we discussed the matter.  When we said the budgets were being cut the Government replied this was not the case and that new money was now available for social housing and so on.  Then one looked at the figures and was left wondering.  The latest figure to emerge is 400 which means we will have 400 new houses.  How many social and affordable houses do the delegations think we need?  I do not mean the general provision of housing supply.  How many social and affordable houses do we need?  It is our opinion that we need 10,000 per year for five years minimum in order to deal with the crisis.   </p><p>  There are short-term and long-term characteristics to the crisis which were spelled out by the organisations.  What will we do in the short-term?  I direct my questions first to the McVerry Trust and then D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in particular.  What can we say to the families who live in diabolical and unacceptable conditions?  I am dealing with many of them and know that the council is very familiar with them also.  What can we do?  What has to be said and done to get people out of dire situations?  Nobody should have to drag their kids ten or 15 km across a city, as is currently happening.  Do we need a policy whereby a person, for example, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is not sent to another administrative district for emergency accommodation?  That should be the case and is self-evident.</p></speech>

I have a couple of more questions and the first one is on rent caps.  I am not in favour of pumping rent allowance into the pockets of private landlords but rents are spiralling.  Should we vary rent caps in the short term?</p><p>  Community welfare officers are restricted to a rent allowance cap.  Can the council confirm that the councils in RAS arrangements often pay way over the cap in order to keep landlords and stop them walking away from RAS arrangements?  If the council can breach the cap but individuals cannot get the community welfare officer to do so then that is double standards which is a crazy scenario.  I also want to know what the delegations think of long-term leasing arrangements.</p><p>  As the council people cannot comment on policy and so on I shall direct my last question at the McVerry Trust.  What does the trust think about the re-introduction of property-based tax reliefs to encourage speculation, as I would describe it, in the property sector through, for example, real estate investment trusts?  Does the trust consider, as I do, the initiative to be a worrying return to the practices around property that helped produce the crash in the first place?</p></speech>

We need a housing strategy in order to ensure, or try to ensure, that we do not return to the failures of the past.  The last boom did not work for homeless people as evidenced by the fact that the number of people homeless increased.  During the boom we all knew people who had a second home and it was so prevalent that people thought they were doing something wrong by not having one.  People felt inadequate if they could not claim to have a house in somewhere like Bulgaria and maybe one in Sligo as well.  We do not want a return to that situation and we do not want incentives created to encourage people to start speculating again in the property sector.  That is not what we are about and is why we want a housing strategy that includes all elements of social housing, particularly for families and people who are young or single.</p><p>  We also want social housing for people with complex mental health needs who are never going to marry or have  children but need to be housed in the community.  We want to do that work alongside our colleagues in the local authority.  We work closely with our local authority colleagues.  Although they are extremely busy and swamped, as we all are, they are not out of their depth.  However, they have been hampered by cuts in staff levels, embargoes and reduced budgets yet have the will and desire to bring about change.  Nobody wants to be saying to people, "I can't do anything for you".  The fact that people have said it shows how much the system has failed.  The staff of the McVerry Trust, along with our local authority colleagues, do their best to alleviate the situation.</p><p>  With regard to rents, the Minister announced about two years that she was reducing rents because they were falling and the market required it but now we need them to go back up again.  We need rents to be linked with inflation.  We need an index-linked rent system for the following reasons.  It would allow us to control the market; it would not allow it to go bust; and it would allow people in desperate need to break into the market.  It would also allow people who are in the market to stay put if they have not been given letters by landlords threatening that their non-payment of &euro;200 next month, for example, which would leave them out on the street and push them into the homeless market.</p><p>  Let us remember that it is the most chaotic and vulnerable people who get stuck in homeless services.  We want to get families in and out of the system as quickly as possible.  Nobody wants their kids going to school saying they are homeless and nobody wants their kids to travel 15 km either.  We have a local housing strategy in place that we try to follow but it have been very difficult.  We feel that the homeless response needs to be locally based which is what we have done.  The trust has been given a contract to open a new hostel in south Dublin, the first in the south Dublin area.  We pursued that strategy because we believe that homeless services should be based in the community.</p></speech>

The hostel has been over-prescribed.</p><p>  We also need accommodation in Kildare.  The only option for a person who lives in north Kildare but seeks a homeless service is to go to Dublin city or south Kildare because there is nothing available in north Kildare.  There is also Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge.</p> <p> These are huge population hubs without a single hostel among them - I live there.  As for how much housing is needed, the Deputy was probably talking about a national figure and at the moment, we are regional.  We are Dublin-based and are going into Wicklow and Kildare at the moment.  Moreover, we are hoping to do some business with our colleagues in Limerick but I probably am not allowed to say that in this room.  However, we have written to Limerick County Council and have offered our services.  In particular, we wish to go into communities such as Moyross and other estates like that, because that is what we grew out of, namely, Ballymun and other estates.  The Deputy should remember that the only regeneration project to be continued was the one in Limerick and so we would love to do some work there but that is end of the pitch.  As for how many units we need, I would say 2,000 to 3,000 units and not 10,000 units.  The Deputy may be aware of different figures nationally.  In Dublin however, were 2,000 units to be brought online annually and if we knew they were coming online for the next three or four years, we could do a huge amount to accommodate families and to bring down the numbers in hostels, thereby allowing the most vulnerable at least to get a hostel bed.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

Our submission to the joint committee has identified a number of possible solutions or assists towards solutions in providing a more strategic and integrated approach to the entire issue including all stakeholders, which includes the voluntary housing bodies, the local authorities and the financial institutions.  In respect of rents, rent caps, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and so on, Mr. Pat Doyle's reference to some level of indexation whereby rents would not be increased without regard to some measurement makes sense.  To what it is indexed would have to be teased out and that probably is a longer-term solution because I cannot envisage such a regulation being introduced in the short term.  There is a difficulty at present in respect of rent caps, competition between local authorities and people trying to obtain private rented accommodation but as I have said a few times in the past, the problem at present is the supply simply is not there.  If that supply is not there at a time when people are trying to obtain private rented accommodation and the local authority is trying to enter into leasing and RAS arrangements, then this competition arises.  The local authority is not subject to the rent caps on rent supplement.  Ours is based on market value or a discounted rate on the market value that exists at the moment.</p></speech>

We base our arrangements on a discounted current market value.  I understand those rent caps are being reviewed at present.  They were last reviewed in June of last year.  My understanding was they were not due to be reviewed for a period of 18 months but I understand that has been brought forward.  At present, however, the main difficulty is the lack of supply, which means the entire market has compressed and there is increased competition for those units.  At present, no units are available in our county that would be at or under the social welfare rent caps at present.  I think that is all.</p></speech>

However, I believe the point to which he was getting is that social housing is all about market failure.  It must be recognised that there is a failure in the market, regardless of whether one calls it a crisis or market failure.  I do not know whether the political system is strong enough yet to bring forward the concept of social housing equating to market failure but it must be articulated much more clearly within the political system because it is market failure.  Unless one is in Vienna, which has supply as a first choice, one must look at market failure linked to social housing.  That must be put on the now in the D&aacute;il in the future.  We encourage people to do that.</p></speech>

We talked about RAS and how what is being paid is over and above what people are getting in rent supplement.  However, Limerick City Council has told the joint committee that landlords are withdrawing from RAS, which also is my experience.  I believe this is happening where other options are available.  How can housing assistance payment, HAP, work if the payments to landlords are lower than the payments for RAS?  This is the point I am trying to ascertain because there is no suggestion that these rent caps will be increased significantly.  Indeed, when listening to what the Minister for Social protection has to say, while she has indicated she intends to examine the rent caps, she has not stated she will increase the amount in the overall budget for rent caps.  This is a significant issue with regard to making HAP work because the joint committee is going to write a report on HAP.</p><p>  The second issue pertains to resources and I asked a question in this regard earlier.  For example, Limerick is the lead authority on HAP, slightly more than 190,000 people live in Limerick and there are 1,075 staff members.  However, 210,000 people live in County Kildare and the local authority has 620 staff members.  Resources are not deployed equally around the country and the maintenance of RAS and of leasing is very labour intensive.  What is Limerick City Council doing in this regard in terms of HAP and the business plan?  This is being put out as being a transformative initiative and I agree that in principle, the idea of people not being caught in a poverty trap is transformative.  However, it is of no value if it does not work in reality.  The amount that is being allocated for renting these properties and the resources to actually run the scheme are the two critical points and unless they are got right, it will not work.</p><p>  In one further point, I am pleased this issue of homelessness is being perceived as being wider than simply a Dublin issue.  I acknowledge completely that it is a major issue in Dublin but it is an issue outside of that city as well.  When one talks about numbers, it tends to only be the Dublin numbers that are counted.  I personally am dealing with 14 homeless families this week in my office.  It is just crazy stuff.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Curley" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014050700013#M01000"><p>I will respond to the Deputy as best I can.  As she stated, Limerick is running the pilot on HAP and the reason to have a pilot scheme is to try to tweak or find out any issues that might arise.  All I can do is to confirm that HAP is there and the landlords are embracing it.  More than 40 landlords have agreed to sign up at this point.  They have tenants in receipt of rent supplement and what is in it for them is they are guaranteed their full payment.  Even at that, it is in arrears, but they seem to be happy to come on board with the full payment upfront and from the local authority, as opposed to relying on the tenant to pay them.  They are in there with that.  We have come across a number where the cap has become an issue.  We are running the HAP pilot on an administrative basis and the way we are dealing with those is simply by recording them, because part of this is the learning exercise, that is, to be able to go back and ask what policy is needed to deal with that.  To date, it only has been anecdotal evidence that there is an issue with the caps whereas we now are documenting it and it will allow for a better decision to be made.</p><p>  As for the staff, I did not grasp fully the Deputy's ratio.  All I can confirm is what we did in Limerick.  HAP is in competition with RAS because one is dealing with the same cohort of people, that is, people who have a long-term housing need who have been in receipt of rent supplement for more than 18 months.  In order to run the pilot in Limerick, we made the decision to take staff from our RAS unit.  That way, they could hit the ground running.  They already were familiar with a number of the clients, were familiar with the landlords and were able to deal with it.  It remains to be seen, as we go on and take on more, what the resources will be but again, this is what the pilot is there for, that is, to learn whether we can cope, to learn what are the issues and to decide on what the staffing levels should be to deal with it.</p></speech>

Most, if not all, members will already be aware of the work of Christian Aid Ireland.  For those who may not be, in brief, it is an Irish international development agency working in almost 50 countries globally, carrying out emergency humanitarian work as well as long-term development work that aims to address the root causes underpinning why people are and remain poor.<br />We first received Irish Aid funding in the 1970s.  More recently, it was one of the agencies to receive multi-annual funding from Irish Aid for 2012 to 2016 in support of our current programme, of which Angola and Sierra Leone are both a part.  The programme includes seven countries - Angola, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Israel and occupied Palestinian territory, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.  The coherence to our programme lies in their categorisation as conflict or post-conflict countries and provides, therefore, opportunities for useful inter-country information exchange.  For example, we are researching examples of partner organisations' strategies for resisting land grabs in their respective countries.  This follows on from a conference we jointly hosted with the University of Limerick last year on the same subject where partner organisations attending the conference gave accounts of their own experience of resisting land grabs.<br />Most importantly, we want to bring to the attention of the committee the worsening humanitarian situation in Angola, a subject that has received virtually no media coverage, yet is a dire situation that threatens to worsen.  My colleague Karol Balfe, who was in Angola in February this year, will present some key findings and recommendations from our partners working in Angola later.<br />I would also like to highlight a report that Christian Aid partners in Sierra Leone have recently published on the country's massive loss of revenue due to the granting of tax incentives to large multinationals.  Tax justice is a key corporate issue for Christian Aid and is an area in which we have developed a degree of expertise.  In 2010, Christian Aid was identified as one of the 21 most influential organisations in the world of tax by <i>International Tax Review</i>.  We are also members of several international bodies, including the OECD informal task force on tax and development.  We sit on the European Commission's recently established platform for tax good governance, which brings together governments.  Ireland is represented by Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners as well as private sector and civil society representatives.<br />We have written and spoken extensively about the tax evasion and avoidance, the tax practices of multinationals, the role of states - including Ireland - and international developments at OECD and EU level.  I say this not by way of blowing our own trumpet but to give the committee a sense of the experience and knowledge on international tax issues that Christian Aid brings to discussions.<br />The report today gives a flavour of what we are doing in Sierra Leone.  Clearly there are issues, however, that the report raises that feed into the ongoing discussions at an international level at the OECD and EU.  Perhaps the area of international tax justice and the changes taking place at OECD level are a subject that the committee would be interested in returning to at a later stage.<br />The UN estimates that least developed countries need to raise at least 20% of their GDP through taxes to meet the millennium development goals by 2015.  Sierra Leone, however, takes in only 10.9%.  Revenue lost to custom duty and goods and services tax exemptions alone in 2012 amounted to 8.3% of GDP, $224 million.  In 2011, the figure was even higher, 13.7 % of GDP.  It will be almost impossible for the Sierra Leonean Government to implement its poverty reduction strategy, Agenda for Prosperity, without a significant increase in revenue, yet it in 2011 it spent more on tax incentives than on development priorities.  In 2012 government tax expenditure amounted to more than eight times the health budget and seven times the education budget.<br />Proponents of tax incentives argue that they are necessary to attract foreign direct investment.  However, evidence from elsewhere suggests otherwise.  The Africa department of the International Monetary Fund states, &ldquo;Investment incentives, particularly tax incentives, are not an important factor in attracting foreign investment.&rdquo;  In fact, the countries most successful in attracting foreign investors have not offered large tax breaks.  More important factors have been good infrastructure, low administration and setup costs, political stability and predictable macroeconomic policy.  This view is backed up by government officials in Sierra Leone interviewed for the report, who believed the tax breaks to be excessive and would better be spent providing an enabling environment for foreign investment, such as good infrastructure.<br />The Sierra Leonean Government policy on tax incentives is criticised in three ways: too many incentives are granted to individual companies by a small number of ministers and officials, increasing the possibility of corrupt deals; there is a lack of parliamentary oversight; and no economic rationale is provided by government for offering tax incentives in Sierra Leone.  Assumptions are made about the effectiveness of tax incentives, but no convincing case has been made.<br />The report makes recommendations to the Sierra Leonean Government and Parliament.  They are mainly about increasing the transparency around the deals that are made.  They also include empowering and strengthening the oversight function of the parliament; carrying out a cost-benefit analysis on all tax incentives granted; reviewing all incentives with the purpose of reducing them; and working with governments of other ECOWAS, Economic Community of West African States, countries to ensure there is no regional race to the bottom in lowering tax rates and increasing tax incentives to multinational corporations.<br />There is one specific recommendation for the Irish Government that is not contained in the report but is being pursued bilaterally.  It encourages the Irish Government or Irish Aid, through its role as a development partner in Sierra Leone, to try to have included in the agreed framework between the Government of Sierra Leone and the development partners a specific indicator or requirement that the tax expenditure be published in the national budget.  Irish Aid could play a role in pushing for this.  This will clearly show how much the country is losing to tax incentives.</p> <p>A link to the report has been circulated.  The main bulk of the presentation is on the humanitarian situation in Angola, which Ms Balfe will discuss.</p></speech>

Christian Aid does not engage in direct advocacy towards the government of Angola.  We have a partnership model and work entirely through supporting the work of local partners.  We come here with our partners' concerns but, prior to speaking for them, it is important that I clarify for committee members the political and economic context in Angola.  It is not possible to understand the reason behind the current humanitarian crisis and the failure to deal with it adequately without first understanding the political and economic context.  I will draw on research from organisations such as Global Witness, Human Rights Watch, the US State Department and Transparency International to highlight some of the concerns about politics and the economy in Angola.</p><p>  Since the end of the long and brutal civil war in 2002, the Angolan economy has, on paper, been one of the most successful in the world.  This is largely down to its oil revenue, which peaked in 2008 and is expected to run until 2025.  It will give the Angolan government a vast source of revenue for urbanisation and infrastructure projects.  The World Bank has stated that economic growth in Angola is very dependent on oil but to date it has not created the necessary local employment.  Organisations such as Transparency International and Human Rights Watch have consistently highlighted the high levels of corruption that exist in Angola.  Along with this are allegations that billions of dollars are missing from state accounts.  This corruption is directly linked to the dependency on oil, the legacy of the political relations of the civil war and the high concentration of political power.  These reports show that in a country with an economic growth rate which is consistently among the top three countries globally, Angolans should no longer suffer from the food insecurity and vulnerability to shocks that we see today.</p><p>  Angola has persistent and widespread poverty, which we see through the social indicators of the UN Development Programme, UNDP, particularly with regard to alarming figures for life expectancy, poverty and child and maternal mortality and poor access to services.  Angola is one of the worst countries in the world with regard to many of these indicators.  It follows that Angola is a very unequal country.  Put very simply, the large wealth in the country does not benefit the majority of citizens in Angola.  This legacy of the war has a particular impact for people living in rural areas, particularly women.  The pace of mass migration to urban areas means that a large proportion, 30%, of households are headed by women, and these are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>  Food price increases are among the highest in Africa, and this disproportionately affects poor families.  Much of the country is heavily dependent on imported products.  In the first nine months of 2013, $3.6 billion was spent on imported food and drink.  This contrasts with the history of Angola with its abundance of natural resources and agricultural products.  There have been some signs of economic diversification and an increase in food production, but smallholder subsistence farmers experience high levels of absolute poverty.  A total of 85% of the labour force works in agriculture, but only 10.2% of the country's GDP comes from agricultural production.  A major factor in the persistence of poverty in Angola is the lack of basic infrastructure and services for poor people, particularly in health, education, water and sanitation.</p><p>  The UN special rapporteur on human rights has highlighted the fact that issues regarding land rights and security of tenure have a very serious impact on rural populations in Angola.  Despite the low population density and the vast areas of arable land, rural smallholders and pastoralists often have restricted access to the land they need to grow crops or to get water for their cattle.  This insecurity of tenure increases the risk for the rural population.  This is particularly an issue for women, as discriminatory inheritance laws and customs make them even more vulnerable.  A strong national drive to attract foreign investment in agricultural land is increasing the risks for smallholders and pastoralists.</p><p>  President dos Santos has ruled Angola for 35 years.  Two elections followed the end of the civil war, both of which resulted in majorities for the ruling MPLA.  A number of organisations have observed that this has resulted in a consolidation of power.  The impact of this on the country's economy and on ordinary Angolans is profound.  A thread of authoritarianism has prevailed since the colonial era.  This was exacerbated by the civil war and persists today.  It is widely recognised that government institutions are hierarchical, with few opportunities for citizens to engage and influence policy and practice at local, national or municipal level.</p><p>  Christian Aid has been working in Angola since the 1980s.  Initially we provided humanitarian assistance and dealt with food insecurity.  We support, entirely through local partnership, seven civil society and faith-based organisations working in Angola in humanitarian and development work.  Development funding to Angola has decreased seriously since the end of the civil war.  There is a prevailing view that Angola's wealth should be used for its own development.  Christian Aid believes that given the levels of poverty, inequality and marginalisation in Angola today, there is a vital role for organisations such as ours to support local partners in responding to humanitarian crises and to try to transform the power structures which keep people poor and marginalised.  Our Irish Aid funding allows us to work with civil society to try to create long-term peace and security, work on gender equality and the promotion of human rights, promote access to land and promote housing rights.  We also work on resource management and climate change adaptation.</p><p>  In the face of the initial failure of the Angolan government to acknowledge the scale of the humanitarian crisis, Christian Aid partners played a pivotal role in drawing awareness to the extent of the crisis and the urgent need for action.  Our allies and partners held a conference where members from the drought-affected communities met Angolan parliamentarians, UN relief organisations and other influential bodies which could respond to the drought.  This was seen as pivotal in creating change and building momentum.  There have been prolonged dry spells in southern Africa since 2011, which have led to the crisis in southern and central Angola.  This slow-onset emergency of drought, food insecurity and health problems needs to be addressed urgently before a greater disaster unfolds.  It has been exacerbated by a lack of rain for two consecutive years.  There has been some rain in 2014, which has brought some relief, but this relief is only short-term because the affected communities still have not received the food distribution or seeds which are so desperately needed.</p><p>  Climate change is having an impact on the drought in Angola.  Angola has not been as starkly affected as its neighbours Malawi and Zimbabwe, but between 1960 and 2006 there was a 1.5&deg;C increase in temperature and a 2 mm decrease in rainfall, all of which has an impact on drought-affected areas.  Approximately 1.8 million people in ten of the 18 provinces have been affected by the drought, largely because of the decrease in agricultural production.</p> <p>The total number of acutely malnourished children is estimated at 533,000.  The situation is even more critical in the southern region of the country, where about 57% of the total population of these provinces are affected by the drought.  The reduced rainfall in 2012 and 2013 decreased the availability of seeds for the year's crop and has contributed to a deterioration of livestock.  Poor sanitation and lack of access to drinking water are critical issues.  In November 2013 there was an outbreak of cholera in the region, with 2,000 cases of cholera resulting in 48 deaths in a two-week period.  There is also increased prevalence of malaria, measles, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections.  Basic food prices have increased in a country where food prices are already expensive for poor people.  Food is now scarce and consumption patterns are changing.  In those areas that are getting assistance, children are receiving two meals a day, but in other areas this is not the case.  Pregnant and lactating women have less access to food and this weakens maternal and child health in the affected population, even those who are being supported.</p><p> There is a serious reduction in the availability of drinking water.  The decrease means that people have between three and seven litres of water per day, far below the recommended 20 litres per person.  There is a lack of pasture for fodder and livestock, resulting in a reduction in cattle prices.  The social impact of that means that people are trying to move to urban areas or move between rural areas, increasing tension between cattle pasturing areas.  As I have mentioned, rural women are badly affected by this drought.</p><p> There has been some response to this crisis.  It was recognised that the Angolan government was slow to respond.  International relief agencies such as UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization began responding in 2012.  The government appealed for assistance in 2013 and Christian Aid is part of an appeal by ACT Alliance, a network that we are with, for emergency aid to tackle the food and water shortages that currently exist.</p><p> Let me now outline the recommendations that Christian Aid makes to the Government.  We recognise the responsibility of the Angolan government and encourage international actors to work with it.  We believe the Government can play a critical role. There is an immediate role in using our membership of the European Union, the UN and other bodies to push the Angolan government to seek more humanitarian assistance, to ensure it works with international relief organisations and to ensure that local civil society and communities that have been affected by the drought are involved in these relief operations.</p><p> There is another important opportunity for the Government.  Christian Aid has very much welcomed our membership of the Human Rights Council as an endorsement of our important work on human rights globally.  The Angolan government will be submitting its national report to the Human Rights Council through a mechanism known as the Universal Periodic Review.  It is an opportunity for the Government to highlight the devastating impacts of the drought and to urge the Angolan government to take action.</p><p> Ireland has always played a strong role and is committed to tackling gender inequality.  This is part of our work in One World One Future through Irish Aid, but we have also prioritised gender equality in other work.  We believe there is scope for the Government, through the UN, the EU and other mechanisms, to ask the Angolan government to ensure that gender analysis features in its work on rural community development, climate adaptation and agricultural reform.  As has been highlighted, the role of women is critical in building long-term and sustainable development in Angola.</p><p> We urge the Government, through its work on human rights and in particular its support for human rights defenders globally, to continue to support the vital and difficult work that human rights defenders in Angola do in securing land rights on forced evictions, but also access for smallholder farmers and pastoralists to agricultural land.</p><p> We urge the Government to continue to support civil society organisations working in Angola.  The severity of this humanitarian crisis highlights the need for urgent humanitarian action within Angola.  At the heart of the crisis is the need for Angola to ensure that all the citizens of the state play a part in the development of its natural resources so that they can become full and proper citizens of Angola.</p></speech>

The recommendations that have been made are very reasonable and I see no reason we could not ensure they are raised in the appropriate forums, particularly as we are a member of the Human Rights Council in the UN.  I am sure the committee will have no problem in endorsing the recommendations.</p><p>  I wish to apologise to the witnesses for the absence of Deputies Bernard Durkan and Dan Neville.  They are on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is meeting at 3 p.m.  Deputy Durkan is the Chairman and must go to that meeting.  I invite the Fianna F&aacute;il Opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs, trade and human rights to lead off.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Balfe sincerely for her clear contribution.  She paints a grim and clear picture of the difficulties facing Angola, particularly the needless suffering due to the state's failure to deal with inequality.  She mentioned in her contribution that a one-day conference had been organised at the end of 2012, with the participation of representatives from the Angolan Parliament, civil society, UN agencies and members of the drought-affected communities.  Under whose auspices was that forum convened?  Was the outcome beneficial?</p><p>  I concur with the Chairman that Ms Balfe's recommendations are very reasonable.  As a committee we should request the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his officials at both political and official level to highlight the particular problems of Angola at every appropriate forum and to seek some movement on the issues raised.</p><p>  Has the United Nations been a bystander during this time?  We are too well aware of the inability of the United Nations to make progress in ensuring that resolutions are passed.  We have seen this happen in Syria and other areas as well.  Is there anybody driving an international community initiative to try to deal with the very serious problems of poverty, drought and child and maternal mortality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014050700005#D00400"><p>I also wish to apologise in advance as I will have to leave a little early.  I am speaking in the House shortly.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their very graphic description of what is going on in Angola.  One could be talking about almost any country in central or southern Africa, as the same problems of rich countries and poor people arise.  People should be prospering in rich countries but they are starving in spite of all the natural resources that have been discovered that would make them rich relative to others.  </p><p>  Where there are land grabs, tax problems, war and corruption, together with climate change, one gets a crisis such as that which exists in Angola.  I would have no problem in going along with the recommendations that have been made and I would be pleased to make those representations.  One aspect that interested me was the need for governments to conduct gender analysis.  Christian Aid is concerned with poverty, and while all those problems result in poverty, one of the major causes of poverty is the unequal role and status of women in such societies, with early marriage, a lack of education, and too many children - all the things that make for poor families, societies and countries.</p> <p> I wish to raise with the delegation a matter that the committee has not had an opportunity to discuss.  I refer to the appalling situation in Nigeria where girls were taken whose only crime was to attend school.  Despite a lot of hot air nothing has happened.  Almost three weeks have elapsed and God knows where they are now.  Christian Aid has the experience of working in a lot of countries.  Can it tell us what we can do to highlight their plight?  What can we do to rescue them and prevent abductions happening again?  Apparently there has been another case of abduction in the past few days.  Where will it all end when a society allows abductions to happen?  Such behaviour has been virtually sanctioned by Governments through their inaction.</p></speech>

The country has arable land yet its people are starving and dying from illnesses that we take in our stride.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions and one of them is on land grabs.  A lot of the land deals have been done by local government or whoever and the farmers are the last to know about them.  What is Christian Aid's experience of the situation?  Have consultations taken place with the people beforehand?  </p><p>  Recently we met some people from Justice for Colombia and the Latin American Solidarity Group who spoke about land grabs in Colombia.  Some of the peasant farmers said that they can produce enough food for themselves and their villages but the land is grabbed so they must leave and go into urban areas to buy food.  Does the same cycle happen in Angola?  Where are there land grabs?  Is it for food, biofuels or wood and timber?   Is the trade agenda of Ireland, the EU and the western world too corporate-led instead of sustainable, inclusive growth and regulated investment?  What is Christian Aid's understanding of the European partnership agreements?  How much do people know about them?  </p><p>  The Sierra Leone report called for a review of all mining contracts and tax incentives.  Is that within Sierra Leone?  Has Christian Aid sought support on the issue from other governments?  </p><p>  Let me turn to budgets.  I do not know which way the balance is in favour of.  There been a lack of capacity building on the part of governments and parties and to negotiate fairly.  How is that balanced with corruption?  Is it overbalanced or imbalanced?  We want budgets to be fair and transparent and governments to be held accountable.  We know that there is a lack of parliamentary oversight which is something that some of us are aware of through our involvement through AWEPA.  Did the departure of the other NGOs from Angola ring alarm bells with Christian Aid?  NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, Oxfam and Christian Aid will remain. </p></speech>

I had to meet Turkish MPs who talked about a peace process and all sorts kinds of issues which is important work that the delegation will appreciate.</p><p>   I have a couple of questions on Christian Aid's report on Angola which is another damning report that gives Africa a bad name.  Mention was made of high level corruption.  The country has resources which exist on paper so one would imagine that it would be successful.  They have finite resources but it has not been invested properly and high level corruption has led to the disappearance of billions.  The report stated that 1.8 million people in ten of the 18 provinces are experiencing food insecurity.  We do know that there is a need to intervene in these crises because there has been a food crisis in east Africa in Sahel.  Christian Aid has called for Ireland to be more proactive about the issue on the Human Rights Council.  How can we be more proactive?  Can you outline some basic steps that the Government can take.  The EU is one of the largest donors to Angola.  Does Christian Aid see a role for Ireland in Angola?  How can Ireland use its influence in the region?  </p><p>  With regards to drought and famine, there is a lack of diversification.  Are there simple steps that the Angolan Government can take?  Mention was made of the World Bank's report that stated that Angola largely depends on oil production which creates little employment.  We know from other countries that have oil that roads must be built to the nearest port but that is all the development that takes place.  Some of the companies involved are EU-based.  Is there a need to name and shame them?  </p><p>  Tax equity and meetings were also mentioned.  Part of the difficulty for a lot of people is that if we want to use our spending power or whatever, for example by boycotting oil companies, we need to know what companies are active in these areas.  Would it be helpful to have an idea of the companies involved in the sector?  </p><p>  The situation is similar for land grabs.  We know that companies from Europe and wherever else are involved but I do not know which ones.  Is there a need for us to popularise them?  How can we highlight them?  Is identifying them part of Christian Aid's campaign to combat them?  </p><p>  Tax dodging in Sierra Leone was mentioned.  Should Ireland or the EU step up to the plate?  What is the best way forward to counteract the problem?  Ireland is a small country that is interested in trading with everyone but we must also act responsibly.  How will trade pan out in the future?  What does Christian Aid want the committee to do about the matter?  Does it have recommendations that we can give to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the role that Ireland can play, particularly in terms of human rights organisations, other organisations, the EU and so on?  What does Christian Aid want us to say to the organisations?  What recommendations does it want us to give to the Department and the Minister?  </p></speech>

I must apologise first because I have read both of the reports but cannot comment on them because of my voice.  Christian Aid projected the image of an uncaring regime imposed by the MPLA in Angola.  Can it explain the contradiction of a government recently allocating $32 billion for food security measures in the country?</p></speech>

I welcome the members of the delegation and thank them for their interesting submission.  I have looked at Africa for many years and corruption is endemic in most African countries.  Christian Aid has experience of working in Africa but I have my own analysis of how the colonisation of Africa has influenced everything that happens on the continent.  Colonisation reflects the lines that were drawn for countries rather than recognise the tribal aspects of Africa.  Some countries in Africa do better than others in dealing with corruption but it is still endemic.  Has an analysis been carried out on a long-term approach to dealing with the problem?</p><p>  We have heard about the level of corruption.</p> <p>I had known of the corruption in Angola but I did not think it was as serious as they outlined.</p><p> Christian Aid spoke about the humanitarian aspects of this.  Perhaps they would give us a graphic account of deaths from hunger, children in difficulties, abuse of women, abuse of children and exploitation of children who come into the cities.  I have seen this elsewhere in Africa where, because of starvation, people gravitate towards the cities.  I have seen it in Ethiopia, which is dealing with it much better.  They are dealing as best the can with it.  Is that happening and what services are the international community giving to those people, especially, the children, who gravitate towards the cities because of the starvation in rural areas?</p></speech>

The document that was sent yesterday is not the one that has been circulated today.  The Angolan Government has responded since 2013.  It is estimated that $150 million is needed to deal with the drought.  It is not yet clear exactly how much the Angolan Government has contributed.  It has asked for international assistance.  It is saying it is not capable of responding and it needs the assistance of United Nations agencies.  I am sorry to have to correct that first.</p></speech>

This is an issue that is of critical concern to the countries in which we work.  The pace of land acquisition that has happened since 2008, since the food crisis there, has taken the world by surprise and governments and civil society are just beginning to respond properly to that.  It is difficult to generalise but, from reports and documentation on this, it would be fair to say across the globe there is little consultation with indigenous communities who are on the land whose land is being taken.  There is a human rights principle around free prior and informed consent and in some countries that is being adhered to.  However, in some it has been adhered to in a tokenistic fashion.</p><p>  We are familiar with the situation in Colombia in regard to land grabs.  It is also a focus area for us.  This year we will be publishing research, doing an update looking at the global scale of land grabs, in particular, at how the Irish Government, the European Union or the world should respond to this issue.  There are reports showing that the pace of land grabs may have been exaggerated in the initial literature rush on this and in this research we want to look at what is the current pace of land acquisitions globally and, crucially, how civil society responds and how we support our partners who are often at the coalface of these issues.  We hope to be able to update the committee later in the year, but I would say to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that it would be a consistent experience that local communities' rights are not being respected.</p><p>  An important distinction in regard to land acquisition is that it happens in different ways in different countries.  If we look at how land has being acquired in Sierra Leone, it is different from how land has been acquired in Angola.  In Angola, there is some food production and biofuels but there is also large-scale agricultural plantations which are displacing poor people.  There are a variety of factors.  We stress that it is important to look at each context when looking at the issue of land.</p><p>  Specifically, in terms of the Human Rights Council, Ireland's role and the steps that it can take, we are encouraged by the Irish Government and the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who are working as part of the Human Rights Council and preparing Ireland's reports.  We have had previous experience with partners from Colombia where the Government met those partners and heard their concerns around gender inequality and protection of human rights defenders.  Ireland was supportive in putting forward recommendations from our partners.  We realise we are knocking on an open door.  However, it is important to highlight the role of the Human Rights Council.</p><p>  It would be safe to say that most states care about their international reputation and Angola is no exception.  It is a matter of using this opportunity at the committee to highlight what we as a State can do.  Angola will be going before the Human Rights Council in October this year.  The Irish Government will be preparing its report over the summer and all states that sit on the Human Rights Council have agreed that they will only make two recommendations to the state that is reporting.  We would urge that committee members would urge the Government to ensure that dealing with this drought and its impact on economic, social and cultural rights would be part of its presentation, particularly around the right to food.</p><p>  The conference in Angola was convened by a consortium of civil society organisations, Christian Aid partners and others.  The outcome of that conference was to highlight, with the Government, the need to take action on the drought.  It is an example of where a civil society organisation can play a vital role in ensuring state accountability.  It ties to Deputy Neville's question about the long-term aspect of some of these countries with which we work.  We, in Christian Aid, believe that development only works when power is used accountably and for the social good and that there is a critical role for organisations such as ourselves to support local organisations, not for us to go in there to do it but to support the partners from Angola, Colombia or Sierre Leone so that they themselves can transform the power relations.</p><p>  We would echo committee members' concerns around gender quality.  It is a core concern for Christian Aid as well.  It is one of the central objectives in our strategic plan and something that we contribute to.  We, as Christian Aid, currently chair the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence and we will play an active role in ensuring that gender equality is part of the development agenda.</p></speech>

Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan wanted to know whether the review of all contracts was an internal Sierre Leonean matter, and the answer is "Yes".  This report focuses exclusively on Sierre Leonean civil society, the role of the parliament and the role of the Government there.  That is not to say that we do not have a position that the review and greater transparency around the negotiations of all mining contracts and all multinational contracts between governments and companies should be more transparent and possibly reviewed as well, but it in this instance it is specifically in the Sierre Leonean context.</p><p>  On the question of tax dodging and Ireland's role, this is a specific area of our work around the issue of greater tax justice in tax incentives.  Our position on this is that the issue of tax incentives needs to be examined through cost-benefit analysis.  This report makes that point clearly, that it needs to be assessed through a cost-benefit analysis.  As for what Ireland can do on that, I made reference to it here.  As one of the key donors in Sierre Leone, Ireland is in a privileged position to be able to make recommendations or work together with the Sierre Leonean Government around its partnership agreement as to what the next four or five years will look like.  We have been recommending that Ireland use that position to advocate or negotiate the inclusion of an indicator or recommendation that would highlight the amount of money that is being spent on tax incentives by the Sierre Leonean Government every year which would provide for greater transparency and accountability of that Government to Sierre Leonean citizens.</p> <p>On the broader level internationally, for example, on the OECD level, we have been clear in our position.  It is that the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, which is the main international process examining the issue of taxing multinationals, has been more or less exclusive or has operated without the input of developing countries.  We perceive this to be one of its major flaws.  This process is being driven by the OECD that will create rules, regulations and systems to which developing countries will be obliged to adhere but yet they are not having any input into their development.  We have been very clear that the OECD process must take cognisance of and must take the input of developing countries to ensure the process and the systems on which they agree.  This is a short window because the OECD BEPS process will finish within a year or perhaps two years.  It is a very small window during which developing countries must get their position heard but at present, this is not happening to the degree we would like.  This is something on which we have made our position clear to all the departmental officials who represent Ireland in the various OECD processes.</p><p> I wish I had something more positive to say to Deputy Mitchell about the women who have been kidnapped.  Other than urging the Irish Government to use its influence at European level to put pressure on the Nigerian Government, we have not been able to articulate anything clearer than that.  The role we have taken on in the gender-based violence consortium probably will need to take a clear position on where we stand in this regard and this is something on which Christian Aid, as chair, must be more proactive.  The point to which Ms Karol Balfe has alluded in our recommendations to the Angolan Government about generating better desegregated data about women and men and how poverty has a different impact on them is very important.  It is not something that all development agencies have taken on and we badly need good, clear data that show and illustrate the particular role and degree of marginalisation that women are experiencing.  This is the bigger background context in which this is happening and where, at some level, it is considered almost acceptable or perhaps not as condemnable as other scandals of which we have heard.  I wish I had something more.</p></speech>

It refers to northern Nigeria around Maiduguri and Kano State.  I suggest the joint committee should consider carefully what Tony Blair has said about that particular region, which as the Chairman is aware, extends from Niger through the Central African Republic, northern Nigeria and the borders of Cameroon and Chad.  Right across this entire region there is revolution by various Muslim fundamentalist groups.  The joint committee must address it and the Chairman might help members by asking for Tony Blair's observations on the crisis for their next meeting.</p></speech>

At one level, there is strength in numbers and there always is something to be gained and benefitted from by having other NGOs there.  That said, we work through partners and consequently, we work with a very broad spectrum and rich group of civil society in Angola.  We do not experience a sense of isolation or of being alone in it.  I do not know the reasons many of the other NGOs pulled out of it but being in Angola is entirely consistent with our theory of change and where we believe we should be operating if we really are to effect change and to address issues of inequality and poverty.  Angola fits that particular profile as well.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will use our role in the United Nations, on its Human Rights Council and any other means possible to highlight this situation, particularly with regard to the present administration.  It undoubtedly is quite difficult and the president of the opposition group UNITA expressed his real frustration at being unable to present real change, as well as the frustrations in Parliament and with the media, which are all state-controlled.  It is extremely difficult and the fact that many NGOs have left Angola speaks for itself.  It is something we will raise and will continue to raise.

The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with a number of those who made a written submission on the heads of the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome from Facing Forward, Ms Nadette Foley, advocacy officer, and Mr. Niall Counihan, vice-chairperson; from the Law Society of Ireland, Ms Shalom Binchy, chairperson of the criminal law committee, and Mr. Shane McCarthy, a member of the criminal law committee; from the Restorative Practice Strategic Forum, Ms Catherine Ashe, steering committee member, and Ms Claire Casey, quality assurance sub-committee member; and from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Ms Caroline Counihan, legal director.  The format of the meeting is that witnesses will be asked to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes, after which we will have a question and answer session with members.</p><p>  I remind members, witnesses and observers in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  Unfortunately, switching to silent mode will not be sufficient as a level of interference will maintained that impacts negatively on the broadcasting of proceedings.  If a witness's telephone rings while he or she is making an interesting comment, it will not be picked up by the broadcast unit.  If, in the course of proceedings, interference takes place, I will ask everyone to switch off their telephones completely. </p><p>   I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members that under the salient rules of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Ms Foley to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nadette Foley" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700003#B00300"><p>This submission has been prepared on behalf of Facing Forward by Barbara Walshe, Niall Counihan and me.  Facing Forward was established in 2005 to support the introduction of restorative approaches based on best practice that have emerged in other countries.  We were very much welcome the heads of the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill for a number of reasons.  First, it is an important step in fulfilling the recommendation of the National Commission on Restorative Justice to place restorative approaches on a statutory footing.  Second, it takes into account the needs and interests of the victim and offender, places them on a statutory basis and requires the consent of the victim for the payment of reparation and-or a restorative intervention with the offender.</p><p>  Facing Forward&rsquo;s approach to restorative justice is based on three questions.  Retributive justice asks what law was broken, who broke it and how do we punish those who broke it.  Restorative justice asks what harm was done and to whom, what needs have arisen based on this harm and whose obligation is it to meet these needs.  Internationally, where restorative practices are embedded within criminal justice systems, they are only one part of a wider restorative approach in communities, schools and throughout society.  Facing Forward recognises the ripple effect of crime at all levels of the community and wants to encourage and support the adoption of a more restorative approach generally.</p><p>  The Restorative Justice Council in the United Kingdom has a best practice document that sets out a number of key principles.  These are that the primary participants in any restorative process are the individual who has been harmed and the person responsible for the harm.  In addition, there should be some level of agreement about the essential facts of the incident and an acceptance of responsibility by the person who caused the harm. </p><p>  I now propose to address the heads of the Bill.  Facing Forward welcomes the provision in head 8 for a "limited and specific restorative justice approach in relation to District Court criminal proceedings for minor offences".  </p><p>  On section (4) of head 9, the explanatory note reads "reparation means financial reparation, any other form of reparation, or both".  However, the examples provided in the head are purely financial.  Facing Forward urges that the possibility of encouraging victims and offenders to consider reparation in its widest sense be incorporated more fully in the final version of the Bill to respect the different interests and needs of individual victims in the spirit of the European Union victims' directive. </p><p>  The heads do not specify the precise mechanism by which the victim's consent is to be sought.  Facing Forward recognises that certain victims may have suffered considerable trauma and harm and have safety concerns.  For this reason, their overall needs beyond the consent issue must be taken into account and responded to appropriately.  To comply with the EU victims' directive, when a garda or other professional contacts a victim to ascertain whether or not he or she consents to a reparation order being made, the garda or professional may also need to assess the victim's additional needs and refer him or her to victim support agencies. </p><p>  Facing Forward ask that the process to be outlined in the Bill of seeking the victim's consent specify offering information to the victim on wider restorative possibilities, within the limits of the context of summary offences.  The restorative element could be strengthened by giving a victim time to consider not only if he or she wants reparation but also what reparation means to him or her.  For some victims, this may simply be the cost of damage done or medical expenses incurred as a result of the offence, while for others additional possibilities may arise.</p><p>  Wider communication with the victim could allow victims to explore their interest in communication of any sort, indirect or direct, with the offender.  Such communication would need to be carried out promptly as the purpose of this mechanism is to enable offenders to put the summary offence behind them.  Would it be appropriate for victims who consent to reparation to be given the option of attending the summary hearing in the District Court to hear the offender accepting responsibility for the offence and the harm caused and confirmation of the reparation arrangement? </p><p>  Head 10 refers to the "need to have due regard to the interests of any victim of the Offence".  This relates to the EU victims' directive which recognises the need for the victim to play "a key role in criminal proceedings".  Facing Forward would like the Bill to include reference to the needs of "victims with specific protection needs", as obligated by the directive.  This category includes all victims under 18 years, victims of sexual crime and victims of hate crime.  The directive also encourages states to introduce codes of conduct or guidelines for professionals who are in contact with victims. </p><p>  Facing Forward asks the joint committee to consider in detail a number of issues, namely, the "specific protection needs" of certain victims and how these will be met within the Bill, for example, considerations around language, age, gender, literacy, culture, ethnicity, mental health or sexual orientation and the specific training needs required to address these considerations; the issue of giving victims information on further restorative possibilities for communication between them and the offender, for example, a range of options which could include a facilitated meeting between the victim and the offender if it was requested; the possibility of informing victims of the option to be present at a District Court hearing where the offender accepts responsibility for the harm.  In addition, direct input by victims into the nature and extent of the reparation process and-or the potential to engage in a restorative session with the offender if required should be considered; and the need to conduct public awareness work to ensure widespread understanding of the benefits to victims, offenders and society of introducing restorative justice approaches in the criminal justice system.</p><p>  I thank members for the opportunity to present to the meeting.  We will be pleased to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy and I are members of the criminal law committee of the Law Society and Mr. McCarthy is a nominated member of its council.</p><p>  The criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill constitutes a radical overhaul of the manner in which the sentencing of offenders is dealt with before the courts, with particular reference to minor matters or matters where judges believe alternatives to convictions should be considered.  The most significant changes proposed under the new scheme are that the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 will be repealed and the court poor box will be replaced with a reparation fund.  The legislation will, to some extent, implement some recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report of 2005.  </p><p>  Mr. McCarthy will speak about restorative justice, with a focus on the community sanctions Bill, the need for adequate resourcing, the potential restriction of the range of options open to judges and future Garda vetting of community sanctions.</p></speech>

In this submission, we emphasised the importance of cross-agency and multidisciplinary co-operation, which are vital to ensure the successful roll-out of restorative justice.</p> <p>While the Law Society welcomes debate as to restorative justice initiatives, we caution against the introduction of a parallel justice system to the existing courts system.  Such initiatives might interfere with the rights of people who are suspected of criminal activity, albeit of a minor nature.  Any referral to a restorative justice scheme should begin and end in the appropriate court where the accused would have legal advice and representation.</p><p> In the context of the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill, many of our recommendations as regards restorative justice initiatives generally may be of interest to committee members.  We recommend that the restorative justice initiatives should be based on an analysis of the impact of any such changes to criminal procedure in Ireland and the avoidance of any potential weakening of the constitutional rights of the accused.  They should preserve the rights of accused people to be fully legally advised prior to participating in any such scheme.  They should be designed on the basis of evidence-based research and adequate resourcing.  They need to be supported by an adequate information programme established to ensure that there is adequate knowledge among all criminal justice personnel as to the appropriateness and suitability of restorative justice options in particular circumstances.</p><p> Research has shown that 75% of solicitors are unaware of the main principles of restorative justice.  The successful expansion of the restorative justice schemes in Nenagh followed an extensive awareness programme among the public, solicitors, garda&iacute; and other stakeholders.  This education scheme is fully supported by the Law Society of Ireland which provides training to lawyers and trainee lawyers as appropriate.</p><p> The availability of adequate resources will be vital.  Studies in Northern Ireland have indicated that each case referred to a restorative justice conference takes approximately 26 hours of staff time.  In cases where it is necessary to obtain the victim's consent, it is the society's view that the victim's opinion should always be considered but there should not be a veto in cases where the judge deems restorative justice an appropriate mechanism.  In many cases victims will not want to be involved despite the benefits of restorative justice schemes.  For example, 89% of victims who have got involved in the past have confirmed that the apologies they received were sincerely offered.  However, studies in England have shown that as few as 16% of victims want to participate in conferences there, with the comparative figures for Northern Ireland being 20% and Ireland approximately 45%.  Of those who refused to participate, more than half gave the reason that they simply did not wish to do so.  Similarly in the case of so-called victimless crimes where there is no victim to consent to the process, the society believes that restorative justice should not be automatically dismissed as an option for consideration.</p><p> The general scheme may put an end to the practice of courts seeking the assistance of the probation services for persons in circumstances where no formal conviction has been made.  In such circumstances the individual concerned may benefit from intervention by the probation services, for example, in respect of addiction issues or training and employment assistance.  There are instances where probation officers, after a period of informal supervision, may make recommendations that people should not be formally convicted.  We recommend that the general scheme should not limit or restrict the range of options available to the courts.  The Judiciary should be allowed to order the involvement of the probation services in any circumstances where it believes their involvement would be beneficial.</p><p> The treatment of discharge or binding-over orders made under the general scheme for the purposes of future Garda vetting is another consideration.  The general scheme provides no direction or clarity on the manner in which it is intended to record discharge and binding-over orders made for the purposes of Garda vetting.  Issues arise as to whether a notice of the making of either of these orders, which do not constitute a conviction, will be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for recording.</p><p> It is important to note that the Garda vetting unit does not currently operate pursuant to any specific statutory power.  While the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 may resolve some of the issues about which the society is concerned, this Act has not yet commenced.  Accordingly, the society is very concerned that the current non-statutory procedure may interfere with the privacy rights of individuals, in particular those pursuant to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The society believes that the general scheme must be considered in the context of the manner in which orders made under the general scheme, where there is no conviction, will be treated for the purposes of Garda vetting both under the current non-statutory procedure for Garda vetting and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Shalom Binchy" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700004#C00200"><p>We feel there is potential confusion with the use of the term "binding-over orders" in heads 8 and 10.  The courts currently have the power to bind people over to the peace even in circumstances where they are not charged with a criminal offence.  The use of the term "binding-over orders" may result in confusion between the two different types of orders which will be available.  The Law Reform Commission's 2005 report suggested the use of terms such as "full dismissal" or "conditional dismissal".  It is possible that the inherent jurisdiction of the courts to dismiss a case on its merits may be diluted should the approach proposed by the general scheme be adopted.  We recommend the use of the terms "full discharge order" and "conditional discharge order" instead of the term "discharge orders" and "binding-over orders" to avoid confusion.</p><p>  The maintenance of the privacy and confidentiality of recipients of probation services is addressed at head 38.  The general scheme proposes changes to how the Probation Service operates.  Under the general scheme of the Bill the Minister may direct a designated person to investigate a complaint regarding the treatment of a person being dealt with by that service.  There does not appear to be a requirement that such investigations be made pursuant to a complaint being made by the recipient of the service.</p><p>  Often persons who are under the care of the Probation Service disclose certain highly confidential and sensitive matters personal to them which may be of interest to other organs of the State.  The procedure whereby the Minister can direct investigation by a designated person could result in the State coming into possession of highly sensitive and confidential information.  We recommend that the procedure for the investigation of complaints be reviewed to consider the best approach to maintain confidentiality of recipients of probation services.</p><p>  The use of monies paid into the reparation fund, and the need to maintain the spirit of the poor box system and fund anti-recidivism efforts in communities are dealt with at head 30.  The general scheme proposes that monies currently paid towards general community needs and charitable purposes through the poor box system be redirected exclusively to victim support and the funding of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Payments for compensation, reparation and assistance for the victims of crime are provided for, and the fund may not be used for any other purpose.  Local charities and organisations benefit from the poor box and they are likely to be affected by the proposed redirection of funds.  This redirection will not assist anti-recidivism efforts in communities as locally based front-line organisations are unlikely to receive supports.</p><p>  In 2005, the Law Reform Commission endorsed the view that the fund "should be used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour since these would be of benefit to the offender and the victim in this specific case and to assist potential offenders and potential victims in society."  We recommend that the application of monies from the reparation fund be allocated to community anti-recidivism initiatives in line with Law Reform Commission proposals.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Ashe" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700004#C00400"><p>My colleague, Ms Claire Casey, and I represent the Restorative Practice Strategic Forum.  The forum promotes and supports the use of a wide range of restorative approaches spanning all sectors of the community.  It is grateful to the committee for the opportunity to comment on the heads of the Bill and it restricts its comments to specific aspects of heads 8 and 9, referring to victims&rsquo; interests and restorative justice.</p><p>  The forum makes comments in respect of five key aspects of the provisions in heads 8 and 9.  It welcomes the inclusion in the heads of the Bill of provisions relating to restorative justice.  It recognises that the stated intention is to provide for a limited and specific restorative justice approach in District Court criminal proceedings for minor offences.  It also recognises that the focus of the Bill is on community sanctions, not restorative justice.</p> <p>The forum would respectfully suggest that consideration be given to broadening the scope of the restorative justice provisions to include so-called &ldquo;victimless&rdquo; crimes or offences where a corporate victim is involved or cases where the victim does not wish to receive reparation or engage otherwise with the offender.  In such cases, reparation could be paid to the court reparation fund for possible dispensing to other victims or for the benefit of communities affected by crime.</p><p> Of critical importance in the view of the forum is that it is not necessary or desirable that a willing, remorseful and otherwise suitable offender should be denied an opportunity to benefit from a discharge or binding over order by making reparation.  We welcome the inclusion of non-financial forms of reparation in the definition of reparation and the possibility to adjourn proceedings to ensure sufficient time to make reparation.  We also welcome the possibility of offenders benefiting from discharge and binding-over orders, notwithstanding that they do not have the means to make reparation.  It is also our view that the payment of reparation should take place in a restorative context.  This would include other restorative actions by the offender, including potentially a restorative dialogue with the victim, and supports for offenders to avoid further offending.  We welcome the statutory underpinning of reparation, although we see court-based reparation as a very limited form of restorative justice and recognise that reparation is already a possibility, and a reality in the majority of cases, under other restorative justice options, such as community-offender reparation panels and victim-offender mediation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700005#D00200"><p>The Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, broadly welcomes the forthcoming criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014, as set out in the general scheme, because we welcome the inclusion of victims&rsquo; interests as an important part of the sentencing process, and as an important way of ensuring the best possible risk assessment and management of sex offenders.  In particular, we welcome the provisions which implement our own earlier recommendations about compensation and pre-sentence assessment reports.</p><p>  I will focus on certain heads of the Bill.  In head 44, compensation, we welcome very much the deletion of the words &ldquo;instead of&rdquo; from subsection (1) of the original Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, as we have already advocated for this, and it was recommended by the legal issues sub-committee, LISC, of the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women.  It will no longer be possible to make a compensation order instead of a sentence.  This is entirely appropriate.  We recommend further that if any judge is considering a compensation order, she or he should be obliged to consult the victim of the crime first.  Our experience is that some victims of sexual violence are not willing to accept any compensation from an offender, regardless of the circumstances.  If the judge found that the victim was indeed unwilling to accept such compensation, he or she should be able to order that the same amount be paid by the offender to the reparation fund.</p><p>   With regard to assistance for the victims of crime, we have nothing but praise for the existing Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime funding structure, which is simple and well-administered, and our members have benefited greatly from the funding for court and Garda accompaniment.  A request for help can only be funded by the commission if it relates in our case to accompaniment services applied for and approved in advance.  The structure is not very flexible.  We recommend that, however it is administered, the reparation fund structures should have the capacity to be flexible to victims&rsquo; needs as they arise, as far as possible.  The application process to the reparation fund should be well publicised by the State, simple and easy to understand, easy to administer and account for, and the portion allocated to victim assistance should increase the overall amount of funding available to victims of crime, not replace existing sources of funding.  With regard to victim compensation and reparation the existing Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal should have its rules replaced to include all those categories of victim who may now find themselves actually or potentially excluded from compensation. </p><p>  Under head 16, probation assessment reports, we recommend that with regard to the content of such reports, each one should include a detailed assessment of the risk of future re-offending and make proposals to address any such risk, where appropriate.  If anyone convicted of a sex offence does not co-operate with the preparation of a probation assessment report, that fact should be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge, who should have the power to impose sanctions if she or he is satisfied there is no reasonable excuse for the failure to co-operate.  As part-suspended sentences provide an important mechanism through which the court may impose conditions aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending after release and activate the full sentence if these conditions are breached, we submit that part-suspended sentences should be included explicitly in the wording of head 16(2)(c).  Where the sentencing judge considers it may be appropriate to impose a part-suspended sentence on a sex offender, we submit that she or he should have regard to some of the same matters which must be considered by a sentencing judge who has to decide whether to impose a post-release supervision order. </p><p>  With regard to head 17, other reports that may be requested, we recommend that in the case of sex offenders at least, any report prepared under this head should refer explicitly to the risk of re-offending and the report&rsquo;s author should make any recommendations which seem appropriate to address this risk.</p><p>  Under heads 20 and 21, access to reports and the right to tender evidence on reports respectively, we recommend that head 20 be reworded slightly so that victims are named as a class of people entitled to see copies of reports under that part, unless there are exceptional circumstances in a particular case which mean that the judge should not allow this.  Head 21 is broadly welcomed.</p><p>  With regard to head 8, discharge orders and binding over orders relating to summary offences, we recommend that the wording about the interests of any victim be changed from &ldquo;may have regard&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall have regard&rdquo;, so that any judge considering a discharge order or binding over order is obliged to consider the needs of any victim of the offence.</p><p>  In respect of head 9, restorative justice criteria for the purposes of head 8(3)(f) we recommend that the wording of head 8 on restorative justice criteria be changed from &ldquo;may have regard to&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo;, to put it beyond doubt that where they are applicable, the restorative justice criteria must be included in any consideration of a disposal without conviction.</p><p>  With regard to head 34, role of probation service in relation to court proceedings, we recommend that the proposal to allow Probation Service officers to prepare a victim impact statement be scrapped.  In making this submission, no criticism of the great and necessary work of Probation Service officers is intended.</p><p>  We thank all members of the committee most sincerely for this opportunity to make submissions on the forthcoming criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014, and for the invitation to attend this meeting today.  If any members of the committee would like further information on any point, they should not hesitate to contact us.</p></speech>

When dealing with the impacts of sexual violence, it takes time for a victim to build up a relationship where she can be full, frank, open and be herself in getting to the depths of the impact of the crime.  As far as sexual violence victims are concerned, that suggestion does not seem to be workable.</p></speech>

I thank the Law Society for the comprehensive submission.  Will the witnesses elaborate somewhat on the concerns regarding the proceeds of the court poor box?  What is proposed is certainly different and the issue is not left to the discretion of a judge.  The money would be targeted appropriately.</p></speech>

Currently, funds are usually sent to a charity at the nomination of the judge and administered in a very cost-effective way.  They also go to mainly local organisations, very often those which deal with sources of criminal activity.  For example, the money may go to local drug treatment organisations and bodies which may not receive much funding from other sources.  We are keen to keep that funding available for those types of organisations.  Although we welcome the idea that victims of crime could also receive some payments through the court poor box system, we would not like to see a system where local organisations - particularly those involved with measures to prevent offending - would not receive funds from the court box.  We are also concerned that this proposal could add another layer of bureaucracy and it could be much more costly than the existing system.</p></speech>

The complaint would be investigated as a necessary consequence and information given by a person who has dealt with a probation officer would be available to a third party.  One can imagine how the information could be extremely sensitive, and we foresee instances where somebody who gives information to a probation officer may disclose a very serious crime of a sensitive nature.  We are concerned that such issues may come to the domain of others who may not have constraints similar to the probation services or a solicitor on sharing information.  The committee should consider the matter and try to include measures to combat any disclosure of any information of sensitive or confidential nature.</p></speech>

I am open to correction on that.  We advocate a restorative method of dealing with the offender and victim in so far as the victim could attend court and have an input on the reparation involved in the judgment.  Where an offender agrees to take responsibility, rather than reparation or community work, he or she could agree to some sessions of victim-offender mediation with the victim.</p></speech>

My colleague referred to this, and if reparation is envisaged - possibly involving community service or another activity - a victim can relay his or her wish for the type of action involved.  The party may be involved in or support a project and wish the offender to contribute directly to it through time or money.  The opposite may be the case, and a victim may have safety concerns and not want to walk down a street where there is a possibility of the offender painting the wall of a local youth project, for example.  The victim may prefer the community service to be done in a different location.</p> <p>That is why we say there should be possibilities.  We do not want to impose restrictions.  The beauty of restorative work is that the creativity of both the offender and the victim can come into play and that they can come up with ideas none of us would even dream of.  They are the kind of things we have heard from other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In some cases the community garda can help but in others an inspector is required.  The safety of the person making the complaint is the key.  We operate strictly on the basis of restorative initiatives.  In the case of offenders engaged in intimidation, unless a lot of corrective work has been done with them, we would not consider them to be candidates for a restorative justice programme with such victims as described by the Deputy.  They could either be on the fringes of gangs or have gone down the road of purchasing certain illicit products and not been able to pay for them.  Serious intimidation could be involved.  I would not envisage a restorative process working in such a situation in the initial stages until such time as work has been done with the offender.</p></speech>

The evaluation involved self-reporting.  Confidence was built in relationships with the Garda through the process.  The aim is to broaden restorative justice provisions.  The forum sincerely welcomes the intention to put the restorative justice process on a statutory footing.  It is a step in the right direction in terms of adults having access to restorative justice processes in the criminal justice system.  It is a first step.  The recommendations tie in with everything that has been said by everyone present in making the processes more effective.</p><p>  An example of a corporate victim would be where there is a break-in at a post office at night and nobody is hurt but the post office has been damaged &ndash; in that case An Post has been damaged.  In such cases there is not strictly a victim for the Garda or the courts, but there is an impact on the community and a restorative justice option could be taken.  I return to points made about the supports people need in terms of training, information or skills around approaches to restorative justice and it being done on an inter-agency basis.</p></speech>

My colleagues would be very interested in some of the points made such as those Ms Casey outlined in the case of Tallaght.</p><p>  Mr. McCarthy referred in the presentation on behalf of the Law Society of Ireland to issues that might interfere with the rights of people suspected of criminal activity.  He also referred to a potential weakening of the constitutional rights of the accused.  Will he expand a little on his concerns about sections 8 and 9?</p></speech>

The point I have made is that all restorative justice procedures should be referred from a court to a restorative justice scheme and that in the court the accused should have the opportunity to discuss the issues involved with a solicitor and be able to take proper advice on the powers and remit of the restorative justice scheme to which he or she is potentially being referred.  Once he or she is aware of this, his or her involvement with the restorative justice scheme would be on the basis of informed consent.  That is vital from so many points of view, including the subsequent success of the restorative justice scheme.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I have one question for Facing Forward about its concluding observations.  Reference is made on page 3 to the specific protection needs of certain victims and the importance of the specific training required to meet these needs.  Will Ms Foley, please, expand a little more on this?  Is she also arguing that this is something that should be incorporated into the Bill?</p></speech>

In regard to these categories there is an obligation for new legislation to comply with the victims&rsquo; directive.  That part of it is specific.  On page 3 we have a wider formulation covering some of the categories in equality legislation.  Over and above the obligations of the victims&rsquo; directive, there are sub-categories of victims.  Victims are all individuals.  Given the specific sub-categories, it is important for the Garda, the Probation Service, court staff and those involved in reparation or community service processes to be fully informed and trained to deal with the specific sub-categories of victims.</p></speech>

I have a question for the representatives of the Restorative Practice Strategic Forum.  They have recommended that the payment of reparation should take place in a restorative context and should include other restorative actions by the offender.  Could they say a little more about that, perhaps on the basis of the experience they have gleaned from their work?  Is it possible that widening this practice in the way the forum has suggested could have some disadvantages?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Casey" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700008#G00500"><p>I can give some other examples of the things that have been talked about - the kinds of supports that have been put in place under the pilot projects and the alternatives to financial reparation.  People who do not have the money to make repayments can take on community service or do voluntary work instead.  The disadvantages of this approach are the same as the disadvantages of anything.  It involves making a commitment to having a longer-term relationship with an offender than one would have if one simply sent him or her to prison.  It is more labour-intensive in the community, as has been mentioned.  The cost-effectiveness of investing now might not be seen until 15 years down the road.  It is the same argument - prevention, in the form of early intervention, is better than cure.  The disadvantages relate to the challenges associated with taking an interagency approach to finding a new way to work with people.  It might take a little while for it to bed down.</p></speech>

I have 12 years experience of working with young offenders, some of whom had served sentences and some of whom were at high risk of going into prison.  I am aware that the range of other proactive restorative options will be explored further.  Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned this earlier.  It is important to note that restorative practices cannot exist in a vacuum in the criminal justice system.  Certain reintegrative processes outside the criminal justice system need to be acknowledged because they are of great value by virtue of their proactive nature and because of the manner in which they facilitate reintegration into society.</p></speech>

Is it offering an alternative in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700008#G00900"><p>The role of supporter in preparing victim impact statements or, depending on the level of need, drafting them substantially, often falls to rape crisis people who have been supporting the victim.  They are trained to do that with the support of the commission and of victims of crime.  We have made some supportive material available for workers and victims.  If a victim has a very good relationship with the investigating garda in his or her case, that garda might take on the role of preparing the victim statement, or at least providing a little assistance.  It depends.  As time goes by, I am noticing in my job that more and more victims seem to be undertaking to do it themselves substantially.  We tell them that they really need to crosscheck it to make sure it is all right to go forward.  As the members of the committee will be aware, there are certain matters that should not be raised in a victim impact statement for legal reasons, etc.  Our philosophy is that it should be left to the victim.  I am relaying to the committee the concerns of people in our network, who have said with the greatest of respect to the Probation Service that it is indelibly identified with the accused in the minds of victims.  The service often supervises accused persons and prepares reports on them.  It is identified by victims as a service for "them" rather than for "us".  It is a purely practical point.</p></speech>

I would like to mention another bee that I have in my bonnet.  We are dealing with the victims and the offenders today.  I regularly whinge in here that we do not focus sufficiently on prevention in the broader crime debate.  As the witnesses were speaking, I was reminded of the recent visit I made to a preschool in my constituency.  Many of the 260 kids in the preschool, all of them are under the age of four, come from dysfunctional and violent families.  Some of them come from families that have suffered as a result of gangland warfare.  The brilliant staff in the preschool are working really hard to try to save these children before they enter the justice system at the age of eight, nine, ten or 15.  I have a bee in my bonnet about the need to do more at the early stages before people get involved in criminal activity.</p></speech>

I would like to ask one or two questions now that everyone else seems to have concluded.  Mr. McCarthy or Ms Binchy mentioned that 75% of solicitors are not aware of restorative justice measures and processes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane McCarthy" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014050700008#G01200"><p>I referred to a small-scale survey of solicitors and other people working in the criminal justice area, as reported on in the <i>Irish Probation Journal</i>.  It has been noted that when visiting judges come to the Nenagh area, where a restorative justice scheme is under way, they are not as aware of the rules applicable to the scheme as the judges who handle it day in, day out.  Visiting judges are far less likely to refer a case to a restorative justice solution, as opposed to the standard solutions in the District Court.  There is a lack of knowledge of restorative justice schemes right across the board, for example among solicitors, judges and other people practising in the area.  One of the major things done as part of the roll-out of the extension of the scheme in Nenagh involved building awareness of the advantages of restorative justice schemes and creating an acceptance of such schemes among the community, which would not be aware of them.  It was considered that such knowledge-building was a vital step in increasing the acceptability of restorative justice as an alternative justice mechanism.</p></speech>

When Ms Casey spoke about training earlier, she cited an example of where training occurred in a community and the confidence of victims or possible victims improved dramatically as a result.  I think she said that the knowledge of people in general, rather than victims, improved.  Their propensity to report crime increased as a result.  Could she talk about the kind of training that is provided and how it works?  Who does it?  Where does it work?  What is involved in it?  What would Ms Casey like to see happening in order to expand or develop this further?</p></speech>

I work for an organisation in Tallaght called the Childhood Development Initiative, which is one of the prevention and early intervention programme projects funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Over approximately four days, we deliver training in two areas - an introduction to restorative practices and an upskilling in restorative practices - to give people the skills to use a restorative approach to build relationships and resolve conflict easily.  It is not restorative justice training.</p></speech>

We explain to people about restorative justice.</p> <p>The training is about conflict and it is not about tackling crime which is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because that is its job.  This aspect is covered in the training.  The training improves people's confidence about naming problems.  The programme was independently evaluated by NUIG over its first two years and it has been running for four years.  At that point 700 people had participated in the training programme and 35% of people surveyed reported themselves more confident and willing to report crime.  This was an unexpected outcome.  Tallaght is also a pilot project for restorative justice training for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Waterford and Tallaght were the two pilot projects and the reports on those projects will be published next year in 2015.  It will be very interesting to see how they have fared.  The aim was to forge better relationships between residents and garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

It expanded geographically to include parts of County Offaly and other adjacent counties.  The only way that this expansion was acceptable was by creating awareness of the benefits of the scheme and how it operated.  That was done through the probation service meeting with garda&iacute;, public representatives, members of the community and setting up local panels of people who were trained in the appropriate principles.</p></speech>

The first petition for consideration was P00010/13, from Mr. Patrick Smyth, calling for the introduction of legislation to allow for the creation of an offence of reckless lending.  The petitioner is of the view that the banks should be held somewhat responsible for the financial difficulties in which a large section of the public finds itself regarding their mortgages and bank debts, and, consequently, carry some of the burden.  The decision of the committee is to forward to the petitioner a copy of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan's response and inform him that as his petition seeks the introduction of legislation, the matter is more germane to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The committee has also decided to write to the clerk of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform with a request that the committee consider the matter of reckless lending as a matter that would benefit from further investigation by the committee as part of its work programme or consideration in the context of the consideration of other financial services legislation and amendment to address the concerns about reckless lending raised by the petitioner.  We will copy this letter to the petitioner and close the petition.</p><p>  The second petition is P00023/13, from Ms Annmarie Crowley, requesting that Cork County Council take charge of the maintenance of the estates, roads and parks in the surrounding area of Weston Park, Carrigaline, County Cork.  Since the submission of the petition, the estate in question has come under the management of Cork County Council, therefore this issue has been resolved.  We have agreed to close this petition.</p><p>  The third petition for consideration is P00007/14, from Ms Lara Henry on green leylandii or leyland cypress trees.  The committee has previously deliberated on similar petitions, namely P00050/12, P00070/12 and P00071/12, and has made strong recommendations to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government calling on him to introduce legislation on tree height.  Our decision is to bring this petition to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing and planning showing that petitions continue to be received on this subject, which remains a problem for many people.  We will forward a copy of all correspondence received to date from the Minister to the petitioner informing her that the committee has made very strong recommendations on introducing legislation to tackle the height of trees.  We have also decided to refer the matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht with a request that the committee consider the issue of tree height as a matter that would benefit from further investigation by the joint committee as part of its work programme or consideration in the context of the consideration of legislation and amendment to address the concerns of the petitioner.  We will copy this letter to the petitioner and close the petition.</p><p>  When we refer petitions to the relevant sectoral committees our committee ensures that we still manage the petition, examine what was done about it and then communicate with the petitioner.  Our role is not to pass over but actively to oversee petitions when they move on.</p></speech>

This matter can escalate into unnecessary civil, legal action.  It would be much more desirable to have guidelines that were clear to all parties.  We will actively monitor that as it progresses.  Thank you, Deputy.</p><p>  Our last petition is P00009/14, from Mr. Aaron Davey, calling for the legalisation of cannabis use in Ireland.  The committee has previously deliberated on similar petitions, P00029/13 and P00001/14, on the legalisation of cannabis.  We have agreed that legalisation is not within the remit of this joint committee.  The petitioner has requested that legislation to legalise cannabis be enacted.  We will write to the petitioner and advise him that as his petition seeks the introduction of legislation, the matter is not within the remit of this committee and is more germane to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  As with previous petitions, we are referring it on.  Again, we will write to the Clerks of the relevant joint committees advising each that this is the third such request for the legalisation of cannabis.  Although we are closing the petition, we will monitor the issue.  We have a responsibility not just to pass petitions on but to ensure there is a substantive "Yay" or "Nay" from the relevant committees.</p></speech>

We had some issues to clarify in our private meeting, which went over time.  The purpose of this meeting is to engage with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the procurement process for the awarding of contracts under the school transport scheme.  In the interest of transparency, I wish to put on record that I have previously tabled parliamentary questions relating to Bus &Eacute;ireann, including matters relating to procurement.  These questions are a matter of public record.</p> <p>On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Martin Nolan, chief executive officer of Bus &Eacute;ireann, who is accompanied by his colleagues, Ms Andrea Keane, chief financial officer and company secretary; Mr. Gerry Gannon, manager of schools transport; Mr. Joe Kenny, manager of human resources and regional manager for the east; Mr. Colm Costello, group chief solicitor; and Ms Margaret Hubbard, procurement and materials manager.  At this point the committee will not discuss any allegations made against Bus &Eacute;ireann related to the school transport scheme or any investigations undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann into allegations made.  The substance of the allegations falls outside the committee's remit and relates to matters more appropriately dealt with by the courts.  There is litigation in train on the matters relating to those allegations and the committee is mindful of allowing that litigation to take its course without any interference.<br />I draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />Before allowing Mr. Nolan to begin, I reiterate that we are not here to discuss any allegations made against Bus &Eacute;ireann relating to the school transport scheme or the detail of any investigations undertaken.  I ask Mr. Nolan to limit his presentation to ten minutes as members have received the full document already.  Perhaps we could gain more from the meeting with the questions from members.  We will not blow the whistle after exactly ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Nolan" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014050700004#J00200"><p>I will speak to some parts of the document.  The Chairman has already introduced the people accompanying me, and I have brought various levels of expertise to answer any questions.  We have expertise on school transport, financial and legal issues, as well as procurement.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to address it, and we have been invited here to discuss the procurement process for the awarding of contracts under the school transport scheme.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is a large, complex organisation with up to 10,000 people working, or in reserve, to deliver our services to rural and provincial Ireland on a daily basis.  We are a competitive public transport company based in communities throughout the land.  Our ethos is to think national but act local, where the greatest knowledge of local transport requirements and resources reside.  We are a safe, effective and efficient provider which has delivered large savings during recent economic conditions.</p><p>  The school transport scheme delivery is complex but its purpose is simple in terms of its support for access to education policy.  It is to get 114,000 rural children to or from school safely twice daily.  There are 40 million journeys on the scheme annually, and it is a public private partnership, where 90% of the services are delivered privately under our direction and to our standards.  We are one of the largest supporters of rural Ireland, with nearly &euro;110 million in 2013 alone being paid to 1,400 contractors directly employing 5,500 people.  This money gives them the basic income to run their businesses but also ensures that 3,500 vehicles are available in rural Ireland to provide other emergency, sports and social transport services that might not otherwise be there if we ran the school transport scheme in a different fashion.  We also provide direct employment in rural Ireland.  The school transport scheme does not make a profit for Bus &Eacute;ireann, and all moneys received under the scheme are spent on the scheme.</p><p>  I will give a brief update on the general company before discussing how school transport works and procurement.  Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann provides nationwide bus and coach services across three core products.  There is the public service contract, including city, commuter and rural services, to the National Transport Authority, NTA.  A second product is the school transport scheme, operated on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, and the third product is our commercial Expressway services.  The operations and delivery of the three products are fundamentally linked, and we try to run as many products or services out of rural depots to ensure the efficiency of all products and provide a good service to communities.  We are no different in that regard from An Post in that for us to maintain rural depots and services, we need to put as many products as possible through those depots to spread the costs.  Expressway services have had a difficult time in the recession through lower patronage and additional competition but I am pleased to say these services have achieved a break-even position.</p><p>  It must be remembered that the main remit for Expressway services in a public service organisation is to help defray the cost of the public services to the State.  The overhead absorbed by the commercial product is &euro;5 million to &euro;7 million per annum and also these services cover towns and villages that are not commercially viable.  If those services had to be replaced, it would cost a further &euro;6 million to &euro;7 million.  Our subvention is currently &euro;32 million per annum but if the commercial services disappear, another &euro;11 million to &euro;14 million per annum would need to be found to maintain services.  We also could make the same services more profitable by coming out of more towns and villages but that is not part of the company's ethos.  We understand the necessity to maintain as many commercial services as we can for rural Ireland but it has to be recognised that we are putting ourselves at a commercial disadvantage in doing so.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is the largest customer of the bus and coach industry and related suppliers in Ireland.  Our employment and contracts are a huge boost to rural Ireland, especially during difficult economic times.  In its dealings, Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to the highest standards of propriety, quality, honesty, openness and accountability with all of its customers, staff and business partners.</p><p>  We have had a difficult time over the past seven years, like most of the rest of the country.  Nevertheless, we have delivered 30% savings on subvention for public services since 2009 and Bus &Eacute;ireann has implemented two staff cost reduction programmes in that timeframe.  There has been a 12% reduction in internal staff numbers, with twice the number of back office staff leaving as those from the front office.  Overall operating costs have reduced by 15% in that time but we have also managed to maintain very high customer satisfaction levels.  In that time we have re-engineered our network and the ground work is there for the next few years in the current network.  We should recognise the part played by the NTA in the process, and we have also implemented new technology, new systems and new additions to the fleet.  All of these improvements have helped governance, operational efficiency and safety and quality assurance in the company.</p><p>  I will explain the context of our relationship with the Department of Education and Skills.  Bus &Eacute;ireann manages the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, subject to the policy requirements and criteria of the scheme as set out.  In order for the scheme to operate effectively, it is necessary for the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann to ensure that they co-operate closely in respect of a broad range of functions and policy matters.  Overall responsibility for the provision of school transport lies with the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department oversees its general administration.</p><p>  The operation of a safe school transport service, provided in an efficient and effective manner, is the highest priority for Bus &Eacute;ireann in its management of the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates three separate schemes on behalf of the Department, each with their own distinct criteria, under the umbrella of the national school transport scheme.  These are the primary school transport scheme, the post-primary school transport scheme, and the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  One third of the cost of the scheme is on special needs.</p><p>  As part of this responsibility, Bus &Eacute;ireann ensures that schemes are applied nationally in an impartial, uniform and equitable fashion on behalf of the Department.  The scheme is a policy instrument designed to facilitate the achievement of the objectives of educational policy.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very conscious of its responsibility to ensure that the nation&rsquo;s children are conveyed to and from school by the safest and most reliable means of transport possible in the most efficient and effective manner.  A wide range of measures and controls are in place to enhance the safety of our school transport services.</p> <p>These include operational performance checks as well as checks on driver licences, insurance, PSV licences, the vehicles used, the nominated drivers that contractors must tell us about and the background Garda vetting check under which almost 12,000 individuals have been processed at this stage.<br />The school transport scheme is a very significant operation serving over 114,000 children, approximately 10,000 of whom have special educational needs.  We serve almost 3,000 schools with 4,000 vehicles operating over 6,000 routes.  Over 40 million individual journeys are undertaken in the scheme every year.  The number of vehicles involved is more than the combined fleets of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The management of the school bus network is co-ordinated and integrated where possible with the provision of local transport services.  For example, over 3,000 schoolchildren use Bus &Eacute;ireann's other services and use the rail and bus services of Dublin Bus.<br />In the annual statement of accounts in 2008, the cost of the scheme was &euro;162 million.  Over &euro;30 million has been saved by Bus &Eacute;ireann, working in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, from this figure and largely reinvested in 750 new services and 2,000 service improvements.  Over &euro;20 million of this amount was saved due to re-organisations of the network of contractor and Bus &Eacute;ireann services undertaken on an ongoing basis by our local school transport offices, as well as through renegotiation of contract rates and retendering of existing contracted work.  Since 2008, and in view of the serious financial challenges facing the country, Bus &Eacute;ireann has also provided a rebate to the Department, the cumulative value of which amounts to some &euro;10.5 million.  These positive results echo the findings of the value for money review of the school transport scheme which endorsed Bus &Eacute;ireann's role stating, &quot;There is not an alternative national organisation with a regional dimension currently operating in Ireland which is an alternative to Bus &Eacute;ireann for operating the school transport system&quot;, and, &quot;No existing organisation is operating in Ireland with the range of expertise in place other than Bus &Eacute;ireann.&quot;  <br />Our services are organised across five regions through 11 local offices.  Each region is under the authority of a regional manager who is responsible for all services in that region, including the procurement of contractors subject to procurement policy and the renegotiation of contract rates.  We use of a mix of our own vehicle resources and those of contractors to deliver school transport services.  As noted in previous reports, this maximises economy and efficiency while at the same time retaining the ability to maintain full service coverage in the event of a threat to service for whatever reason.  Almost 90% of the vehicles used to provide school transport services are provided by private contractors.  Since the late 1990s the number of vehicles in the scheme has more than doubled from some 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to over 3,400 now.<br />In the Celtic tiger years the number of new services required each year surpassed the level of interest received from the market.  The way the system worked then was that we placed advertisements in local and national newspapers and when contractors applied they were put onto a panel.  The local offices then drew up lists of suitable operators from the panel and invited them to quote for work when it became available.  In our experience there tended to be little or no interest in school transport contract work when the economy was strong because other more lucrative opportunities were available.  In 1999, for example, only 42 applications were received nationally from private operators and of these, 26 failed to meet the necessary standards in terms of documentation.  All of the remaining 16 were recruited but a further 69 were needed to meet demand and these had to be found through canvassing of existing contractors.<br />Between 2001 and 2008 the shortage of suitable potential contractors was so acute and the additional cost that was invariably involved in recruiting new operators to replace those withdrawing from the scheme meant that, by agreement with the Department, existing contracts could only be opened to tender in very limited circumstances.  There was more than sufficient new work being introduced each year to satisfy what demand there was from the market, with an average of 200 to 300 new vehicles needed annually.  Quotations were always sought for new work from a minimum of three suitable operators, where possible.<br />In 2008 and by agreement with the Department, 150 existing services were retendered, but only 36 large buses were offered by the market in response.  As the economy declined, interest grew again and in 2010 a more structured approach to the procurement of contractors was introduced with the introduction of an award criteria and a scoring matrix.  In 2011 a revised tendering process was introduced, further enhancing the existing process.  This is a competitive procurement process conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under EU Directive 2004/17/EC.  This is the process now in place.<br />The revised tendering process is managed by each of the 11 local school transport offices and overseen by the procurement and materials department of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The local school transport offices receive and evaluate all tender responses and the procurement and materials department liaises with and advises the local school transport offices on any queries that may arise during the process.<br />We advertise on<i>etenders.gov.ie </i>and in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>each year.  A pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, document is attached to the notice and can be downloaded or obtained from the local school transport office.  These PQQs are submitted to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Our written submission goes into great detail on the procurement process, including outlining what happens to both successful and unsuccessful tenderers and the negotiating procedure we go through so I will not go into that now.   <br />Under the revised process, 100% of existing contracted work is subject to tender at least once in five years on the basis of an average 20% per year.  Successful operators under this process are awarded a five-year contract.  The panels of pre-qualified applicants established in each local regional office are also utilised when new work arises and is being introduced for the first time.  In this case a minimum of three quotes are sought.  The tendering process allows Bus &Eacute;ireann to achieve the procurement objectives in terms of value for money, access to the contracts for all interested parties, transparency on how the contracts are awarded and equality of treatment.  It is also in line with Government policy where expenditure of public funds is concerned.<br />The procurement process is large in a European context.  If the call for tender for the east of the country went out in one go, for example, 150,000 documents would have to be sent out.  That is why we do 20% per annum.  It is a very significant undertaking which is executed impartially and fairly across the country.  Since 2011 the annual re-organisation of services undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport offices has generated some &euro;15.8 million in savings, with &euro;4.63 million of this figure coming from the retendering of existing services under this procurement process.<br />As already mentioned, Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to the highest standards of propriety, quality, honesty, openness and accountability in its dealings with all of its customers, staff and business partners.  We have a strong system of internal controls in the company, through both the board audit committee and the CIE audit committee but both our internal and external auditors constantly review systems for weaknesses and recommend improvements.  We have a good faith reporting system rather than a whistle-blowing system which deals with the responsibilities of employees and management for the detection and reporting of any alleged impropriety or fraud.<br />The CIE group's code of business ethics for employees is very important and has been circulated to all employees in the company.  This code establishes the principles of honesty, integrity and legality, among other principles, with which Bus &Eacute;ireann employees are expected to conduct their business.  Bus &Eacute;ireann takes allegations of misconduct by Bus &Eacute;ireann employees with respect to the operation of the school transport service very seriously and has carried out a<i></i>thorough and comprehensive investigation, in line with company control procedures and governance.  As a complaint was made against specific named Bus &Eacute;ireann employees and not against Bus &Eacute;ireann itself, it was appropriate for the company to investigate the complaint in the first instance as an employer.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister of State with responsibility for commuter and public transport, and the Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills requested a full report from Bus &Eacute;ireann into the entire matter.  This report was completed and signed off by the Bus &Eacute;ireann audit review group, ARG, and our chairman.  The ARG is also attended by the CIE group head of internal audit and the CIE group chief operating officer.  This has now been completed and circulated not just to the three Ministers but to this committee and the Committee of Public Accounts.<br />With reference to the original allegation the investigation team reached the conclusion that there was no basis for the allegations ---</p></speech>

Its success in keeping these products bundled is fundamental to maintaining services in rural areas.  The basic<i></i>income of the scheme for small contractors has a much wider bearing on keeping the rural social fabric going.  We are a well governed company and group with the appropriate checks and balances.  We have recently agreed that the Comptroller and Auditor General can have access to our financial records for schools.  To our knowledge this is the first time a semi State company has done this.  The company also comes under the Freedom of Information legislation.  We are a company that thinks national but acts local for the good of the community.  The vast majority of Bus &Eacute;ireann staff live in the communities in which they work and understand their duty of care and responsibility to deliver people from A to B in a safe, effective and efficient manner. <br />The school transport scheme does not make a profit for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  All moneys received under the scheme are spent on the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has significant skill and expertise in all aspects of operating a safe and efficient school transport scheme and these skills are utilised by the Department of Education and Skills in order to operate the scheme.  School transport is a very different operation from the PSO services.  Its remit is much more than just transport, it was established with the objective of facilitating equality of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to children who might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly.  The school transport scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann and is designed to assist in implementing educational policy as determined by the Department of Education and Skills.<br />I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee and I welcome questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014050700006#L00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Nolan and his senior staff from Bus &Eacute;ireann and thank him for providing his opening statement in advance.</p><p>  I am disappointed that as a member of this committee I am not in a position to have had sight of the documents that have been sent to the secretariat by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the whistleblowers.  The committee has taken a decision on legal advise, from which I dissented, not to circulate the documents.  It is my belief that this is a fundamental flaw in our system.  It impacts negatively on me as a public representative that I am expected to deal with matters that come before me but by the wish of the committee may not look into issues of such a serious nature that have been making headlines in the media, for example, issues on the way taxpayer's money is spent, matters that go to the core of the administration of the State.  Notwithstanding the situation that has developed in other institutions of State in the past number of years, some people choose not to learn from these lessons.  I am disappointed about that.  I will remain within the legal guidelines that have been outlined in spite of my objection to it.</p><p>  My questions relate only to overall policy matters as I am constrained from dealing with the pertinent issues that Mr. Nolan seems to want to discuss.</p><p>  In his statement Mr. Nolan states: "The school transport scheme does not make a profit for Bus &Eacute;ireann".  The recently published report conducted by FGS for the Department of Education and Skills looks at the totality of the school transport scheme and in Appendix 4 it discusses Bus &Eacute;ireann's indirect cost workings.  It states that the charges are comprised of direct costs, 13% add-on for other cost recovery, and reasonable profit, depreciation and interest.  It goes on to state that the 13% add-on to the direct cost charged to the Department of Education and Skills in the statement of account is intended to provide for direct cost not included in the school account, indirect cost incurred by Bus &Eacute;ireann, shared indirect costs which provide services for both road passenger and school operations and reasonable profit.  The reasonable profit element is to compensate Bus &Eacute;ireann for other items such as reputational risk, exposure to risk, capital investment risk and so on.</p><p>The FGS is a reputable accounting and auditing company and it believes that the Department of Education and Skills is paying Bus &Eacute;ireann a figure that encompasses a figure for profit.  As the Department of Education and Skills published this FGS report, it must be the Department's view also.  I am not going to make allegations about how Bus &Eacute;ireann prepares its accounts, but can Mr. Nolan try to help me in bridging what the FGS report states and what Mr. Nolan said in his opening statement that the school transport scheme does not make a profit for Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  Mr Nolan explained the difficulties in procurements during the better economic times and that in 2011 the company changed procedures to reflect the 2004 EU directive.  Will he give us the detail in percentage terms from 2011 to 2013, inclusive, of the routes awarded in accordance with the 2004 directive?</p><p>  I wish to deal with the policy matters rather than the specifics of the investigation.  Mr. Nolan states that the investigation team reached the conclusion that there was no basis for the allegations, no basis for disciplining any employee and no basis to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Further on he states that whereas we cannot categorically deny or conclude that it never happened, there is no evidence to suggest that any gift has been accepted by any individual that breaches the company code of ethics.  He further states that information that has come into the public domain in recent times does not add anything to that.  Specific allegations have been made in a Sunday newspaper-----</p></speech>

I want to put on record that the Committee on Transport and Communications got legal advice and it is the decision of the committee that we would not allow anything to prejudice the cases that are ongoing in the courts so as to allow justice to be done in the place that justice can be done.</p></speech>

At no time during the private discussion did I seek to follow a course of action that would have in any way have had an impact on a court case.  I think that when documents are circulated by a semi-State agency to members, there is an absolute entitlement for members of the committee to have sight of those documents.</p></speech>

At this stage, we have provided all possible information on these documents.  We have provided a full and detailed report to the three Ministers and the two committees.  I can say, without going into the individual allegations, that they go into the procurement process, the company's ethics policy and its good faith reporting policy in great detail.  Most of the documents involved in the report are in the public domain anyway.  They are brought together in the report in a fashion that makes it quite clear where our conclusions come from.  I do not think I can say much more to the Deputy on that.</p><p>  The CIE group has a strong ethics policy which is set out on its website.  Employees are not entitled to accept gifts or hospitality worth more than &euro;70, which is a minute value.  One has to get permission from one's boss, etc.  From a procurement point of view, over 80% of school transport contracts have gone out in the public domain at this stage and have been re-tendered.  The last 20% of contracts, including all the special needs services, are out at the moment.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for asking a question about the FGS report.  The funds within the school transport scheme are hermetically sealed within that scheme.  Any reserves that exist are spent on school transport.  As this is a complex area, I will ask the chief financial officer, Ms Andrea Keane, to bring the committee through it in a little more detail.</p></speech>

I will set out the ways in which all the money received in respect of the scheme is spent on the scheme.  It is spent on the direct provision of services; on the indirect overheads of Bus &Eacute;ireann in running the scheme; on capital reinvestment within the scheme; on one-off costs which would include, for example, voluntary severance payments to deliver further efficiencies for the scheme; and on the risk reserve.  The risk reserve, which is held in the company's account and ring-fenced for schools, deals with unforeseen charges which can and do arise from time to time.  It might be helpful for the Deputy to note, following his comments about the FGS report specifically, that the report states that profit can have a wide range of meanings and notes that what is commonly referred to as profit within the report exists to compensate Bus &Eacute;ireann for the additional expense and risk incurred in the management of the scheme.</p></speech>

The fluctuations are linked to the capital investment programme within the scheme.  We have two significant capital reinvestments for school transport at the moment.  A significant IT system that costs approximately &euro;2 million is being funded through this facility.  We are also looking at purchasing school buses for the provision of direct school services.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills feel it is prudent to have a level of risk reserve for charges that can come up.  If there is a pressing need for capital investment, it might be considered that the risk reserve should be reduced to &euro;4 million, for example, and an additional &euro;2 million should be spent.  We have agreed in our discussions with the Department of Education and Skills that there is a level below which it would not be prudent to allow the risk reserve to drop.  Charges associated with the scheme, outside of capital investment, have arisen from time to time and have been applied from the risk reserve.</p></speech>

I would like to set out my position on the issue about which Deputy Dooley has expressed concern.  I understand his worries and frustrations as a Deputy and as a parliamentarian.  I would like to reiterate what the Chairman has said.  The committee has received strong legal advice to the effect that the documents presented to the committee should not be circulated.  If we were to do so, we could prejudice matters that are before the courts at present.  I do not think anything is preventing the Deputy from receiving the papers in question from Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is a semi-State company, if he so wishes.  He can do what he feels fit with them at that stage.  That point needs to be made clear.</p><p>  Mr. Nolan mentioned two policy documents - the good faith reporting statement, which is a CIE policy document, and the code of business ethics for employees.  Could he tell me, without disclosing any specific details, how often these policies are reviewed and adopted by Bus &Eacute;ireann management?  Are employees fully aware of their obligations under these policies?  If so, how are they made aware of them?  Do they sign something to indicate that they understand and accept their obligations?  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann ever had any reason to discipline employees under the terms of these policy documents?  Perhaps those questions can be answered without disclosing any specific details.</p><p>  I note that the model used to deliver school transport relies largely on outsourcing.  Approximately 90% of vehicles used under the school transport scheme are provided and operated by contractors.  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann run a risk management and analysis system to ensure compliance not only from a health and safety and vehicle fitness perspective, but also from a public procurement and financial probity perspective?  Who is the person within the organisation who is responsible for ensuring full compliance?  How often is that system audited and reported on to the executive?</p></speech>

He asked about the systems that have led to 90% of services being tendered to private operators.  From a health and safety perspective, we employ the UK Freight Transport Association to come across here every year.  We give the association a list of all vehicles, including Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles.  It chooses 7% of them at random to have their maintenance checked.  If it is not happy with the maintenance, it checks the maintenance facilities of the relevant operator.  We act on the reports that the association gives us.  It depends on the standard of maintenance of the vehicles.  We have been doing this check in between the annual DOE tests for the last seven or eight years.</p><p>  From a public procurement and probity perspective, the CIE group's internal audit division conducts audits of all of Bus &Eacute;ireann's systems under the guidance of the CIE board's audit committee.  This division has complete autonomy to go anywhere in Bus &Eacute;ireann group when it is auditing these systems.  Our auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, come in on top of them to check the work of the internal audit people.  PricewaterhouseCoopers would say that our systems have a strong level of internal control.  The date on the latest good faith policy is 2013.</p> <p>The code of ethics has been changed four times in recent years to include some new items.  Last year the gift value was &euro;120 which has been reduced to &euro;70.  On the issue of discipline, I will pass on to our HR manager, Mr. Joe Kenny, to get the exact figure on it.  </p></speech>

As Deputy Coffey has said, in reference to a previous speaker, nobody in this committee has a monopoly in terms of concern or in terms of allegations made or which are in the public arena.  To suggest otherwise is disingenuous to the committee and to the member who made it.  Discussions that are held in private should be private but, obviously, they are not.  At no stage in private discussions did any one person monopolise their concerns in respect of allegations.  I want that put on the record.  I was not present at any meeting where only one person expressed concerns but I was present at a meeting where the majority expressed a view that the legal opinion given to the committee was the appropriate course of action.</p><p>  In page 5 of his presentation, Mr. Nolan said that the cost of the Bus &Eacute;ireann administered element of the school transport scheme to the Department of Education and Skills in 2008 was &euro;162 million.  He also said that more than &euro;30 million has been saved by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, one of the contributors said the scheme did not make a profit.  Given that Bus &Eacute;ireann saved &euro;30 million in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and made 2,000 service improvements, what was Bus &Eacute;ireann doing prior to that time if it could not make those savings?  We had to wait for the collapse of the economy before those savings were made.  What was going on in the company up to then, given that it was operating the service at a cost of &euro;30 million in excess of that at which it could operate post the collapse of the economy?</p><p>  Further on in his presentation, Mr. Nolan said that in 1999 Bus &Eacute;ireann experienced difficulty in attracting applications from private operators and "these had to be found through canvassing of existing contractors."   What exactly does he mean by that?  What processes were engaged in for canvassing of contractors?  Did it take the form of telephoning people or going out and meeting people and, if so, were terms and conditions offered that may have been more amenable than those offered up to then?  Were the terms and conditions offered better than those already in place and were enhancements given?    </p></speech>

Between 2008 and 2012 the cost of the school transport scheme to the Department of Education and Skills was reduced by &euro;12.5 million off the bottom line from &euro;162.2 million to &euro;149.47 million which in itself is not insignificant.  There were more than &euro;30 million worth of savings in the same period.  Those savings were achieved through the re-organisation of the network, the retendering of existing services and the renegotiation of rates.  Another way in which the saving was achieved was that Bus &Eacute;ireann provided a rebate to the Department of Education and Skills of &euro;10.5 million.  I can provide details of the &euro;30 million.</p><p>  The reason the &euro;30 million does not reduce off the bottom line by itself is because of the additionality that is introduced to the school transport system every year in terms of sanctions for new services and improvements to services which amount to more than &euro;6 million per year.  In that five-year period, 2008 to 2012, it was more than &euro;25 million worth of additionality.  In simple terms, the re-organisation of services saves the money that paid for the additional sanctions but because the savings exceeded the cost of the sanctions, the actual cost of the school transport scheme was reduced, hence the bottom line reduction of &euro;12.5 million.</p></speech>

Why did the economy have to collapse before the Department of Education and Skills insisted that savings were made?  Why were these efficiencies not insisted on all the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-07a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Gannon" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014050700008#N01600"><p>The school transport scheme is evolving.  During Celtic tiger years, there was a tremendous expansion of the scheme.  For example, in the two years pre-2008, 2006 and 2007, the three for two seating ratio was abolished.  In addition, seat belts were required on school transport scheme services.  Therefore, there was considerable investment in the scheme.  Effectively, an extra seat was required for every third child carried at that time so that each would have an adult seat.  Expenditure was incurred to do that.  In 2005 to 2007, the number of new services we introduced on the special needs side of the operation had multiplied tenfold compared to ten years previously.  Between 1995 and 1998, an average of 30 new services were introduced every year.  Between 2005 and 2008, an average of 300 services were introduced every year, the vast majority being for special needs.  While the scheme was expanding at that massive rate the scope to make the savings, which we have made subsequently, was not available then.</p></speech>

The saving is that the bottom line cost of the school transport scheme was reduced.  In effect, the saving has paid for the sanctions.

The Department sanctions it and we run it.  In addition, in budget 2010 the Government decided that there would be a number of policy changes, some of which we introduced ourselves, and there was a target in those changes - different charges for schoolchildren and closed school rules.  The target for savings on those areas alone was approximately &euro;17 million and we have delivered them as part of the &euro;30 million as well.</p></speech>

That is fewer than four per local office.  Nationally we have 11 local offices so that is an entirely inadequate figure in order to keep services running.  One must remember as well that of the 42 applications more than half of the vehicles that were put forward were not suitable in terms of documentation so we could not use them.  Only 16 of the vehicles could be used and all 16 were used.</p><p>  To meet the demand in 1999 we needed 69 more vehicles and they had to be found through referrals and canvassing.  That means referrals through people working in the industry approaching operators directly and asking them whether they had additional vehicles which they could put forward for school transport purposes.  That does not mean they would be accepted at a lower standard than usual.  We cannot, for example, rule out 26 vehicles in terms of suitability and then replace them with 26 vehicles of a lower standard.  That simply is not the case.  We had to go to the industry to find the additional vehicles that met our standards.</p></speech>

The total number of contractors&rsquo; fleet that we had at the start of 2009 was 3,381 vehicles.  The additional services sanctioned by the Department of Education and Skills up to September 2009 amounted to 89 vehicles.  That is a potential new vehicle requirement of 3,470 vehicles for the start of the school year.  One must bear in mind the re-organisation of services and the efficiencies.  This is where we talk about network planning expertise being essential.  It has been identified in a number of previous independent examinations, including the value for money report, how essential it is.  The value of it is that the 3,470 potential new vehicle requirement was reduced because we were able to take 148 vehicles out of the service through using our transport planning expertise.  In autumn when the school year started we needed 3,322 contractors&rsquo; vehicles.  In other words, despite 89 new services being needed we achieved it by reducing the total number of vehicles by 59.</p></speech>

All anyone ever wants in a process is to be treated fairly and to believe that the playing pitch is as level for them as it is for their next-door neighbour.  Nobody likes dealing with a system where they believe there is a bias - real or perceived.</p> <p>Under Bus &Eacute;ireann's tendering process, does it have an appeals mechanism?  If not, do the witnesses perceive merit in having an appeals mechanism?  In addition, when a contract is awarded under the company's tendering process, does it have any obligation to follow up with the person who has been awarded that contract to ensure he or she is fully in compliance with employment law?  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have an anti-corruption policy?  If so, what is the architecture of that policy and who are the main personnel who would deal with it?</p><p> What are Bus &Eacute;ireann's investment plans for school transport for the future?  In common with other members present, I represent a rural constituency and every June and July, we must deal with severe problems arising for people who find themselves without a school transport ticket and who are trying to get to areas to which they traditionally have gone.  While I do not have it to hand at present, I refer to the 3 km rule or whatever it is and members have not been able to deal with that in any satisfactory way.  We meet people with medical cards who cry to me that they cannot afford to pay for the tickets.  While Mr. Nolan stated the company had &euro;30 million in savings, can any of it be used to come up with a satisfactory solution to these pockets of which there are not many?  Some other Deputies also have experienced this issue, which I have encountered in a number of areas.  If a novel way could be found to try to solve that issue, I would be grateful.  However, the witnesses should deal with the other questions.</p></speech>

As for the legal advice, I wish to associate myself with the comments by Deputies Coffey and O'Donovan.  As Deputy Ann Phelan has touched on some of the questions I had wished to ask, I will turn briefly to the tendering process.  Companies that have been going through this process for years and which have had contracts for years may suddenly find themselves failing or losing out.  On companies that may be coming in with considerably lower bids in respect of prices and so on, I believe I have raised the question previously both as to whether there is an appeals process and as to whether there is a mechanism by which complaints can be made.  If so, is this on the record and is there transparency?  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have a figure as to how many people in the past actually have made complaints, whether they were successful and so on?  On the 3 km rule, is there any discretion in this regard?  I have encountered cases in which two siblings might be on the bus but the third sibling has not been allowed to go on the bus.  As the witnesses can understand, for a parent it obviously is not logical, does not work and can be highly distressing and upsetting, especially for the third child who is told he or she cannot take this school transport.</p><p>  I am curious about the age of the buses.  I left school in 2004 and can remember friends who used to arrive on a bus that was manufactured in 1979.  It was colder inside the bus then it was outside.  Is there a cut-off age and is there a standard for the buses in this regard?  Following on from that, I refer to the bus crash in Kentstown, which is in my constituency.  An inquiry was conducted by Bus &Eacute;ireann into what happened and how the company conducts school transport.  As far as I am aware, the findings have not been published.  If this is the case, does the company intend to publish the findings or where can they be found?</p></speech>

On the overall tendering process, all unsuccessful tenderers are given a detailed breakdown of how and why they did not achieve the tender.  This is done under the different criteria in respect of where the successful tenderer was and where they were.  As for the appeals process, the regional schools transport manager will hear appeals and they obviously have natural appeals as well.  As it is a contracted issue, they may appeal back to the legal end of the house on that.</p><p>  The age of vehicles is 20 years and we do not go beyond that.  The key point about such vehicles is of course that they are well maintained.  However, because of public perception and so on, we like to reduce the age.  We have just gone out for the first time in a few years to buy a number of vehicles.  We also have new public service vehicles on the way and the older ones will be cascaded into schools.  Such vehicles will be approximately eight or nine years old.</p></speech>

One of the questions from Deputy McEntee was about discretion.  I am taking the questions as I have written them and mean no disrespect.  The rules on discretion changed as a result of a budget announcement in 2011.  While I can appreciate it is difficult for families to understand it, one reason that one child in a family may not be eligible while the other two could still be eligible is because there is a new set of rules and the new criteria apply to the younger child.  The children who already are in the system, if they were eligible, will remain eligible until they leave school.  The difference regarding eligibility where the medical card is concerned - this relates to Deputy Ann Phelan's question - is that only eligible children are entitled to the medical card waiver under the school transport scheme.  We do not have any discretion on that.  We do not have discretion with regard to the manner in which we apply the criteria of the school transport scheme.  One of our key responsibilities is to apply it impartially in a uniform fashion on a national basis.  Consequently, I am sorry but the answer to that question is "No".  I believe I have answered the questions.</p></speech>

We have a code of business ethics for employees and since 2013, we also have a good faith reporting policy.  Both policies are published on our website.  In respect of compliance with regard to good faith reporting, the chief executive is required to make an annual report to the board on any issues that have arisen under the good faith reporting requirements and with regard to our code of business ethics.  It is reviewed within the company by senior management, including human resources, and is subject to audit by the internal audit department.

At the outset, I welcome the improvements in safety that have occurred in recent years.  I certainly remember being on a 54 seater school bus in the mid-1990s on which there were 90 children on one occasion.  It was more like the Tokyo underground than a rural school bus but, thankfully, we have come a long way since then.  I wish to ask a couple of questions about the nitty-gritty of the tendering process.  How are tenders actually received and opened?  What does Bus &Eacute;ireann do to ensure that any sensitive information is protected, is not leaked and that no one who should not know about it does not know about it?  What oversight exists in respect of the tendering process?</p><p>  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann accept tenders from operators that clearly are operating below cost?  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have concerns in cases where operators are tendering well below cost?</p> <p>Is Bus &Eacute;ireann aware of the difficulties that causes for the general provision of services?</p></speech>

However, I want to acknowledge the support and advice given to us by Ms Egan from the Department.<br />On the question of tendering, are unsuccessful tenders advised and does the issue of collusive tendering ever arise in the school transport scheme?  Are there private contractors?  How often would they change or does Bus &Eacute;ireann tend to use the same private contractors for the job <i>ad libitum</i>?  There were other questions but they have already been asked.<br />It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the good school transport system that is in existence in north County Louth where I come from.  Also, having used the Expressway service from Dundalk to Dublin via the airport three weeks ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann ought to be complimented on that wonderful service, which departs at 6 o'clock in the morning and arrives at the airport at a quarter past seven.  For those from the north end of the country, it is an excellent service to go somewhere and be collected promptly and left back to Dundalk.  I acknowledge the service, with which I was impressed.</p></speech>

They led to some stoppages but we sorted them out.</p><p>  Mr. Gannon will go into the matter of contractors below-cost selling.  We have minimum criteria that they have to meet.  They have to have a vehicle of a certain age and certain standard, all the various tax clearance certificates, etc.  Once one meets all of those standards, it is down to an award metrics which Mr. Gannon will explain.</p></speech>

On the evaluation on the opening of the tenders, the suite of tender documents refers to the confidentiality of evaluation.  After the official opening of tenders, no information relating to the examination, clarification, evaluation and comparison of tenders and recommendations concerning the award of a contract shall be disclosed to tenders or other persons not officially concerned with such process.</p><p>  On canvassing, interference and collusive tendering, the documents state that any attempt by a tenderer to influence the process of tender evaluation and contract award through canvassing or other means shall result in that tender being rejected.  Tenders are advised that the use of improper influence will also result in the tender being automatically disqualified.  Examples of such improper influence would be collusion, price fixing, bid rotation or market division.</p><p>  As to whether unsuccessful tenderers as advised, the answer to that question is, "Yes".  Also, at pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, stage, if the applicant is not suitable, he or she is advised at that stage.  He or she does not even make the panel of suitable operators from which the operators are asked to tender.  If they fail at tender, they are written to and given the reasons.</p></speech>

The controlled opening procedure at PQQ stage is mirrored at tender stage and I will not repeat it.  What happens is the PQQ or the tenders are received and they are held securely until after the closing date by which I mean they are locked away.</p></speech>
