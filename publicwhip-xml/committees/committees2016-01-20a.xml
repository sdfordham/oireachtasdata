I welcome our guests.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, all of those present are asked to ensure that their mobile phones are turned off completely or placed in safe or flight mode for the duration of the meeting.</p><p>Today, we are looking at the issue of the quality of teaching in higher level education.  Ireland's higher education system has played a major role in the development of Irish society and the economy and will continue to do so as we seek to build an innovative, knowledge-based economy which provides sustainable employment opportunities and good standards of living for our citizens as well as a broad education.  We are aware of the pressure that has been on third level institutions in recent years to accommodate an increasing number of students at a time of scarce resources.  In view of these considerations, the issue of quality of teaching in third level institutions is very important and always has been.  To brief us on this matter, I am pleased to welcome Dr. Jen Harvey, head of learning at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Professor Mary Gallagher, school of languages and literature, UCD, and Dr. Greg Foley, school of biotechnology, Dublin City University.  This meeting has been sought by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for a long time.  In fact, since the committee was established, she has been highlighting the issue and asking us to have a meeting on it.  We are glad to finally get around to her request.  To get our discussion under way, I invite Dr. Harvey to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jen Harvey" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012000004#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I was given the brief to talk about quality of teaching in higher education and I have interpreted it in that way.  The issue has become one of increasing importance as the landscape of higher education has changed.  We face international competition and there is greater diversity in the student population.  Things have changed substantially in the last ten or 15 years in Ireland.  There is emergent technology of which we can avail.  I want to talk us through a context for consideration of quality of higher education before focusing on key elements related to teaching quality which is about the importance of student learning and engagement and academic development.  I have also included  for the committee's consideration a number of references which draw on some of the extensive discussions around the Green Paper and quality of teaching in the UK.</p>  <p>  In terms of considering teaching as responding to the national agenda, from the Hunt report there has been a variety of strategies until recently.  There has been the strategy of the national plan for equality of access which looks to higher education institutions to encourage participation and which seeks to give increasing accountability to higher education institutions on meeting specific targets.  Of particular importance is the issue around excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience within third level, which is key.  Certainly, Ireland has always been a leader in this area.  This is also in terms of making us globally competitive and internationally orientated.</p> <p> Quality teaching is a concept which is difficult to define.  It is very complex.  There are many factors which impact on quality of teaching.  It cannot really be looked at in isolation.  One cannot separate it from discussions on quality cultures and learning support within institutions.  The concept of teaching quality takes different forms depending on whether one is a full-time student or whether one is studying online, etc.  It is also very much stakeholder relative in terms of employers, students, academics.  Other stakeholder groups would have different interpretations as to what quality is.  In looking at quality, one tends to think of the inspirational, passionate teacher.  If we are considering what makes a teacher extraordinary, it is very much about the teaching experience.  He or she knows how to teach, what to teach and how to improve.  It is about bringing students along.  He or she needs to have passion and inspiration, which is what sets him or her above ordinary teachers.  He or she also needs the toolkit.  That is one of the strengths DIT brings to the table in that all of our new academics undertake our postgraduate diploma and we have an extensive CPD support programme for teachers and academics who are at different stages of their career development.</p> <p> I refer in particular to the importance of student retention and success.  There has been a focus nationally around and about the whole issue of transition to third level and the effort to retain students.  The key element within this has to be about student engagement.  I welcome the consultation document which has been commissioned about how we might do this more effectively.  The reality is that a lot of institutions have not taken the opportunity to do this as well as they might.  That is more than just about getting students to be active learners.  It is also about involving them in decisions as producers of the curriculum and negotiating and learning pathways which are appropriate to them.  That also links into the quality of teaching issue.  I have included some slides around the student engagement at Trinity College Dublin because I thought it was useful.</p> <p> As good teachers, we need to determine what students do and direct them to purposeful activities.  We need to put in place effective educational practices to do that.  That is about resourcing, supporting and providing timely strategies and policies to ensure quality.  We have recently undertaken to develop a student engagement strategy.  I have included some examples in the slides which I circulated previously.  I will pull out some which are particularly important.  There is this idea of a sense of belonging and teachers ensuring that students coming into third level feel as if they should be there, building confidence and engaging them as part of a community.  That is community with their peers within the institution and in terms of their professional direction into the future, which is key to retention.  There is the idea of learning as a shared responsibility.  Alongside that is providing a supportive learning environment where they get support from their peers and also provide feedback.  It is the institution's responsibility to act on that feedback and to build alongside of this research capability.</p> <p> We are putting in place the best practice.  Within DIT, we have been looking to provide enriching educational experiences which aim to build our learners as lifelong, autonomous learners but also to provide them with skills so that whether they decide to move internationally or become actively engaged within their local communities, they have the confidence to do so and the appropriate skills and abilities to articulate it.  Within the learning teaching and technology centre, LTTC, at DIT, we have provided a great deal of support for academics so that they might encourage the development of this high-quality learning experience.  Part of that is through the postgraduate diploma, but it is also through continuous professional development with small, timely, continuous professional development, CPD, events on diverse topics, including higher educational policy.  Recently, we had a CPD event for academic leaders in learning, teaching and assessment to give managers with responsibility for resource allocation the appropriate skills to better support this.  Key within that is the focus on assessment and feedback.</p> <p>One thing I would like to see developed and encouraged is a change to some of the assessment and feedback practices.  We have elicited a number of initiatives and research founded through teaching fellowships, etc. to recognise good practice and to feed this back into models which are scalable.</p> <p> Alongside that, it is about eliciting curriculum change and working with programme leaders and programme teams in order that there is a discussion about the holistic experience of students, from the pre-entry first alert on the website, where they think they will do a particular course provided there is the support, before they come in, during the first year, through their programme and into the future.  In looking to the merger as the Technological University for Dublin, TU4D, into the future, it is giving us an opportunity to work and to hear the students voice.  When looking at our model for learning for our students, we can put in place a quality curriculum that would support this.  That is very much about preparing our students and empowering them.  It is about giving the opportunity to discover and to develop through flexible learning and also tailored support.  Support is key and it needs to be timely, giving them the opportunity to practise in a safe environment with their peers and with colleagues and to be able to apply the theory in a timely manner.</p> <p> I hope we manage to consolidate the theory and the experience into a package that provides the students with the skills to develop the graduate attributes and to leave as reflective practitioners into the future.</p></speech>

I am really happy to appear before the committee to speak about what I love, which is my work in higher education.  It will not be just about my work, obviously.  I need to state that I am not representing the views of UCD or speaking for UCD in any way.  As the committee is aware, higher education is a very diverse sector and almost anything I say will be true of some of it but it will not be true of all of it.  I just want to make that disclaimer.  I know I am protected by a certain amount of privilege but I would probably need to be on some kind of witness protection programme to say some things that are probably true of the whole lot.  Everybody is doing their best and there are still huge problems.  I hope what I am going to say makes sense.  I have tried to compress it into the seven minutes but I think that is sometimes at the cost of coherence.<br/><br/>The first subtitle I have is the idea of a national debate.  I really think we need a national debate on higher education.  It should focus on what Ireland wants from higher education.  We have to make a distinction between higher education and further education.  If one says &quot;higher&quot;, one means superior, a higher order.  It is a different thing.  It is to educate at a higher level.  What do we mean by &quot;higher&quot;?  I think we might mean critical and creative thinking or, at least, a critical and creative engagement with detail and with depth in a given area.  Of course, one needs a certain amount of knowledge and information to be able to engage in that way, but I think that is what we should be looking for from higher education in this country.<br/><br/>I took about two years out of my day job to write a book about what I think Ireland should be looking for from higher education.  It took me about two years to write it and it was published in 2012.  I called it <i>Academic Armageddon: An Irish Requiem for High Education</i>.  I did not realise I needed to be in a witness protection programme before I would do something like that.  It was to call attention to one major point - how making a business out of education, any education, including higher education, is really at the heart of our problem in this country, not just ours but in other countries too.</p> <p>I think this is an organic problem which is starting to affect second level too.  One sees it in all the language schools that we are forced to close in Ireland but one also sees the problems and tensions that exist between the private secondary schools and the public secondary schools, the fee-paying and the non-fee-paying schools, the grind schools and the institutes.  Of course, education is an organic system.  That is why I am appearing before the committee.  The reason I called the book <i>Academic Armageddon</i>was because what is happening in the western world, especially in the English-speaking or global world system, is that academic standards and academic integrity are being destroyed.  What I mean by that is that in some cases a kind of a funny version of what is academic is being made into the be-all and end-all of everybody's life.  It seems it has to be everybody's life.  We have only one precious finite life, as Senator O'Donnell said.  We all have finite lives.  All our youth are being told academic success is the be-all and end-all.  I really think that is what is destroying academic standards.  It is curious.  They are victims of their own sort of success.  When that book came out, it came out to silence; no public refutation but no public response.  I think that if even 10% of the analysis of that book was well-founded, it would have merited a national debate.  I really do think that.<br/><br/>What do I think we should do in Ireland?  We should stop allowing higher education institutions to be run as competitive businesses.  Of course, they are not all run as competitive businesses but some are and there is a trend.  We should stop pretending that it is possible to take the studying out of studenting, that one can be a student without studying.  That is not possible.  We should stop pretending that students are clients.  We should stop letting them think that is what their contract is with the higher education institution and also stop pretending that 85% of Ireland's youth are academically inclined and should be going to university because these are all, in my view, damaging lives.  I was going to point to Germany but we all know about how it avoids this damage and how, as a result, apprenticeships rather than degrees are so highly valued and why France is trying to imitate Germany.  France points to Germany.  In Germany why are such able people going into apprenticeships and France is trying to go that way?  Either Irish school leavers are up to 50% more academically inclined and talented than their European peers or else they are being misdirected into further academic endeavour when they would be probably better suited to following a less pseudo-academic training, whatever that might be.  I definitely think that England, the US and Australia, not Scotland, are the wrong models for us to look towards as a university because that is where the most intractable problems are coming from, the atrocious idea of exorbitant tuition fees, whoever pays them, included.<br/><br/>If, as I believe, the Anglo, aka global, brand is toxic, it is linked to the spread of a zombie culture in higher education wherever it is applied.  We should be looking to more free, responsible, sane, healthy, independent northern European models instead.  I do not know why we have chosen to copy the worst of the Anglo global world.  All Anglo businesses, Anglo universities, are in common market competition with each other and they all see branding as the answer.  We have it on the radio before the six o'clock news where they are fighting for customers.<br/><br/>Distinguishing the university from its so-called competitors is of the essence.</p> <p>They are synonymous always with extortionary prices.  That is what distinguishes those awful little shoes one can get in Dunnes Stores for a fiver.  My children wear the Converse brand.  They are just a brand but they ruin one's feet the same way as the little flat runners from Dunnes Stores.  Be aware of branding.  </p> <p> If one is a business, one does not necessarily have time to focus on the education part but in so far as the corporate university focuses on education, it is bent on increasing student throughput and retention.  What that means in practice is not awarding fail grades.  There is also a focus on staff performance but I cannot go there because I do not have time.  This is becoming a terrible problem.  The real causes of poor retention figures are not just the plunging staff-student ratios - in other words, a funding issue - or an exodus of experienced staff into early retirement, etc., and recessionary cuts, but also the shameful codding of school leavers into university.  What we see happening at the educational chalk face is an almost irresistible dumbing down of academic subjects.  One might say, "So what?"  In my subject there is an awful lot of "what" about that.  I teach French and either a student can read French and understand what he or she is reading or her or she cannot.  Either he or she can write French that someone else is going to understand or he or she cannot.  Either he or she can speak and understand what somebody else is saying or he or she cannot.  When one is awarding a D minus grade, one is saying a person can do none of those things but one is getting the student over the hump and one is not getting grief from the system that is bearing down on one to push the student through.  Failure is just not acceptable.  It is very difficult to do it.</p></speech>

We do that too.  We get the students through but we also shut down hard subjects.  The school of languages has been shut down totally in Coleraine in the University of Ulster.  There are no language courses any more because they are too hard and too many people fail.  One can see where that is going.</p>  <p>  The next problem is compliant academics.  People try to stop academics from doing what I am doing now, and I am really enjoying it because I do not get the chance to do this very much.</p>  <p>  How does one balance education and research?  These are the problems.  We have to keep doing research but how do we balance the two?  How do we balance educating students and at the same time doing our research?</p>  <p>  My last point is about the teaching and learning industry.  I apologise to Dr. Jen Harvey for using the word "industry" because it sounds a bit derogatory and I do not mean it in that way.  How is the teaching and learning industry going to address those problems?  Every institution has teaching and learning units embedded all over.  They are focusing on "how", but who is focusing on the "what" and who is focusing on the "why"?  I will end there because I have gone on for long enough.</p></speech>

I teach in DCU.  I will come back to that word in a minute or two.  I do research and I am also the associate dean so I have a triple mandate.  That is a key point.  It is not that I am particularly interesting because that is typical of academics within the sector in that they do a lot of things.  This takes me to my main point which is that the word "teaching" in a university context is problematic.  We are not teachers in the sense of second level teachers.  Third level is fundamentally different from second level or at least it should be unless we want to radically change our vision of third level.  I agree very much with Professor Mary Gallagher that we do not have a proper vision as to what third level should be.</p> <p>I said that also in my submission's conclusion.  All sorts of stakeholders have differing views.  Employers see it as training while many people, in particular students and their parents, see it as an extended form of second level.  The Government, in particular the current Government in recent years, has seen it as an engine of economic growth as if that can be separated from its educational brief.</p> <p> The multifaceted nature of third level education is absolutely key.  Although this might get me into a little bit of trouble, I must say that initiatives such as the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning in higher education are fundamentally flawed in that they do not take account of the triple mandate, at least, that an ordinary academic has.  Most academics will do some research, some teaching and some administration and they will parcel out those roles slightly differently.  Unless we take into account that the culture in third level education is fundamentally different from second level, we will go down blind alleys and eventually we will just try to reproduce what is done in second level at third level.  That would be a real shame.  That is my basic premise.</p> <p> I do not know what it is that we do.  We do not just lecture.  I do laboratory modules, tutorials and a lot of active learning in the classroom so I am not just a lecturer, but I do not think of myself as a teacher.  If one looks at the key difference between third level and second level education, it is the role played by independent learning.  A typical module in the STEM disciplines will have four hours of independent learning for every hour of contact.  That is radically different from second level so when one hears various stakeholders, politicians included, making statements about the lack of contact time, they are misunderstanding third level education.  An educator in the third level sector guides somebody, charts a course through a subject for him or her and perhaps explains things and is there to support the student.  He or she inspires and motivates students but he or she is not a teacher.  We really have to get that into our heads.</p> <p> I agree with Professor Mary Gallagher that there is a teaching and learning industry out there.  I heard somebody refer to it as the "T and L-aliban", a sort of take on the Taliban.  There is a culture of fear that if one does not adopt what are student-centred methods, one will get very poor reviews from students.  </p> <p> SIPTU did a recent survey in DCU where some staff actually felt bullied by students because the demands were so great.  I frequently answer e-mails at night from students.  In my kitchen this morning, while eating my Shreddies, I was answering e-mails from students on my telephone because they have an examination tomorrow.  It has become very student-centred.  The table in page two of my submission shows the enormous administrative load that lecturers are under between student surveys of teaching and student reps.  Next week, I will be inundated with students coming to my office to look at exam scripts to get feedback and for me to justify my marks.  We have annual programme reviews, periodic programme reviews, quality reviews, professional reviews and we have tracking systems for students.  Anyone who says that teaching and learning is not taken seriously at third level is seriously wrong.  In fact, I think that so far we have created a dependency culture and that is not good.</p> <p> I will depart from what I was going to say and refer to the drop out rates because it came up last week.  It relates to some of the things Professor Mary Gallagher said.  The HEA produces reports on drop out, although I should not say "drop out".  They are non-progression rates because the students come back into the system.  The only single metric one can use to predict drop out is what is called prior academic achievement.  The courses that have high drop out are low point courses.  We are taking people into demanding courses who are just not academically up to it.  They have got such low points that they are probably getting their seventh, eighth or ninth choice, so they have picked the wrong course because they are academically on the weaker end of the spectrum. </p> <p> One of the issues that has come up through the forum is whether university lecturers should have a formal qualification in teaching.  My own opinion is "No".  It would nice to know a little more cognitive science, for example, but it is something that is a "nice to do" rather than a "need to do".</p> <p>It does not take into account the fact that if the culture of a university values research, having an educational qualification or continuing professional development will degenerate into box ticking.  Somebody will do a postgraduate diploma and use whatever means they can to get promoted.  Usually, the quickest way to do this is to excel at research.</p> <p> The fundamental barrier to improving teaching is the fact it is very difficult to measure the quality of teaching.  Good teaching is defined as that activity which improves student learning.  However, there are many ways to do this.  The two best lecturers I ever had in my career were Frank MacLoughlin at UCD, who has retired, and someone at Cornell University.  One used an overhead projector and the other used a blackboard and chalk.  They were inspirational and fantastic teachers.  My fear is that the teaching and learning industry will generate into ideology, as it has with Ofsted in the UK, and that if one is not teaching in a certain student-centred way, it will be perceived as not being dedicated to teaching.  I have a real fear of this.  I know many very good lecturers who do not do anything particularly innovative and are not visible as excellent teachers.  They may be excellent researchers but they teach very well in the background and are not making a song and dance about it.</p> <p> Cuts to higher education funding have been ongoing.  I am an engineer.  I tend to be a bit of a nerd with data and I go back and look at things.  The cuts in higher education preceded the global financial crisis.  They date back to 2006 at least.  There has been a mindset among policymakers that, for whatever reason, higher education, university education and third level education should not be funded to the same extent as primary and second level education.  This is a mindset issue.  It is particularly visible in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, disciplines.  I find it quite difficult to understand how this disconnect occurs.  Last October or November, the Government launched its capital investment plan, Building on Recovery, to run to 2020.  In this it pledged to spend &euro;27 billion, including an increase in funding for research, innovation and job creation from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;5 billion by 2020.  Included in this is an expectation to increase PhD numbers by 30% and postdoctoral researcher numbers by 30%.  At the same time, it committed &euro;110 million to higher education.  These figures make no sense because the pipeline for research and innovation and for those PhD students is their undergraduate education, particularly their experience in undergraduate laboratories.</p> <p> There is a crisis in terms of the funding of laboratories in every institution.  This will probably get me into trouble because I am saying something that does not reflect well on us.  However, I say it because it is typical of the sector.  I brought a panel of biopharma people around our laboratories as part of a quality review.  They were very complimentary and stated that we do great work.  When I brought them to one particular laboratory, there was an audible gasp when they saw how out of date the equipment was.  Much can be done with very little in education and we can still teach the basics but laboratories throughout the country use equipment connected to computers which look like they were built by Alan Sugar in the 1980s.  There is a real crisis.  I find extraordinary the disconnect between the rhetoric of the knowledge economy and willingness to fund the grassroots.  I do not quite understand why it is the case.  It is like in sport where people suddenly decide to put millions into elite athletes, as was done in England for cycling.  Doing so wins gold medals but meanwhile the grassroots die.  This is a real danger here.  The CAO preferences for science and applied science have been dropping since 2013.</p> <p>I have a feeling we have been operating in a science bubble and that, as the economy picks up, we will see a lack of interest in science.  People think this will go on for ever and we will have all of these PhD graduates.  However, what if we do not provide an undergraduate experience of having well-equipped laboratories?  I am not stating that everything has to be off the shelf or the latest model but it must be better than 1990s equipment.  Unless we commit to this, no number of foreign students - or any other methods universities are trying at present - will solve the capital investment problem.  We are addressing it in DCU.  I will not say how we are getting the money but people probably know.  We are actually doing it because it has come to a stage where we must.  We can longer teach laboratory courses, which are a big part of STEM education, unless there is serious investment.  The greatest crisis affecting the higher education system is that we are not putting in capital investment.  It must be a rolling plan.  There must be a commitment every year in every budget that X million will be spent on higher education.</p> <p> I truly believe third level education is about a partnership between the lecturer or educator and the students.  I love my job.  I love working with students.  It keeps me young.  I gave a tutorial yesterday and it was just good fun.  There are times when it is really good fun and I really like students.  There is a problem in that the nature of modern culture is such that students find it very difficult to put in the graft required.  I feel quite aggrieved if I am criticised or assessed on the basis of a vision of third level education which presumes I should behave like a secondary school teacher.  Students must play their part.  If we look at the Irish survey of student engagement, the results of which are on page 6 of my submission, approximately 45% of students do fewer than five hours of independent study per week.  This is bad in the STEM subjects but it is even worse in the humanities where students need to do a lot of reading.  One could not read a single book in a week with that level of study.  We have a cultural problem as well as a funding problem and various other issues.</p> <p> To go back to what Professor Gallagher stated, we need a conversation on what third level is supposed to be.  In saying this, I fear we would end up with a talking shop whereby everybody would just give their tuppence worth and matters would go nowhere.  Everybody is probably aware of the Growing Up in Ireland survey, which is fantastic and which has informed child development.  We need something like this for education.  We could do it very quickly because those involved in the Growing Up in Ireland survey have done it.  From 2017, we could track 10,000 students.  It can be done.  We have a very good track record in Ireland for doing this.  They could be followed over the next ten or 20 years.  Let us begin to use evidence to inform our education policy because it is dominated by anecdote, hearsay and the experiences of people who went to college 30 years ago.  We spend so much that we need this database.  This is my big suggestion.</p></speech>

I have been a member of the committee for three or four years and this has been one of the most provocative half hours I have experienced in a long time.  I do not know where to start.  This matter is close to my heart because I have spent a great deal of my life as a teacher at third level.  I was considered a pariah at one point.  I recall a director of education in the university informing me "This is a research institution" and then walking off.  I did not know where I was on the campus at the time.  I am more interested in hearing what my colleagues have to say because I do not want to bring my own ideologies or prejudices to bear on this matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on something Dr. Foley stated.  There is a rewarding of failure.  This is evident at second level where if somebody fails higher level mathematics, this is equivalent to obtaining a pass at lower level.</p> <p>In all my time at university we did not fail students.  We tried every way possible to pass them.  We did not want to fail them, and if they failed, we did not like it and we pulled them up from a mark of 32 to 36 to 38 to try to pass them.  Only if they did nothing were they in the realms of failure.  That is a massive change.  Therefore, when we talk about quality of teaching we are also talking about quality of learning.  It is not just quality of teaching.</p> <p> With regard to tracking students, is Dr. Foley aware of any surveys that have been done on this?  We track them monetarily because we constantly look for money from them as alumni.</p></speech>

There is huge input from students nowadays.  However, regarding the idea of tracking them through their careers, people get wiser as they get older and they look back on their education with slightly different eyes and maybe appreciate it more.  We certainly find that when most of our graduates come back to us they are very complimentary.  Sometimes, in the thick of things - when a student has not done well in an exam, for example - it is not necessarily the best time to ask him or her.  There is a lot of literature on this.  If one considers how valuable student surveys of teaching are, for example, they are very often popularity contests and are not really objective assessments of quality of learning.  In fact, a very recent study produced in Italy showed that ratings in student surveys were inversely proportional to the amount the students learned.  What I have found over the years is that students love a teacher who makes life easy for them.  If a teacher is very organised, provides students with absolutely everything they need and minimises the need to go to the library and do extra work, they will think the teacher is great.  That is why I like the idea of tracking students over a decade or more.</p></speech>

What would they do differently on the transition from second to third level?  Do they think that it should be a prerequisite for anybody teaching in third level to have a teaching certificate showing that they are highly qualified?</p></speech>

I believe that all teachers at third level should have a teaching qualification of some kind, although it is important what that qualification is.  It is not a tick-box exercise that involves sitting down and learning about cognitive science or some other subject.  In our institution, we made the policy decision to invest in our staff and it is very resource-intensive to provide the support for postgraduate diplomas for all new staff, unless they are completing a PhD.  I must admit that there were various reservations initially as to whether this was a good policy, and how motivated people would be within that.  On day one, we had a couple of people sitting there, arms folded, with an attitude of "I have to be here."  However, these academics recognised that one of the most important aspects of the programme is not just the tool set or the menu of options that is being provided to them through this experience, but the safe space, the time in which they can amend their practices and look at what they are doing as teachers.  They can come and talk about issues they are facing in a structured way.  They can look at others by going to visit them in a very supportive way, in the style of tutor observation.  For example, a scientist can go and see what somebody else is doing in photography by arrangement, and is in turn asked for feedback on how the students are doing this or that.  One learns an enormous amount by looking and seeing what other people are doing.  Most people will only teach the way they were taught or based on whatever their experience was.  By providing the academics with a range of different opportunities, although they might like some better than others, we are giving them the option of making selections afterwards.</p>  <p>  It is very much a practice-based programme.  I am not saying it is absolutely the best, as I may be a bit biased.  It is portfolio-based in terms of its assessment: there is a range of evidence that those taking part present as part of a portfolio submission, and we support them through this.  It deals with a lot of the challenges with regard to the transition to third level and reflecting on assessment and feedback.  On the point mentioned by Dr. Foley, one of the major challenges in starting out as an academic is that one is pulled in all directions.  The new academic is supposed to be researching, doing administration and trying to get his or her head around it all, and usually, as the new person, has the worst teaching possible.  There are maybe 19 contact hours with students, which the academic must design and develop.  A programme that provides support over the academic's first or second year is invaluable because it gives him or her the time, the opportunity and the safe space to say "I am having a problem with this," "I am not sure how to do that," or "Has anybody else faced this challenge?".  To compare it to a traditional second level education certificate is perhaps not the best way of doing it, because we are not all the same.</p></speech>

Academics who have gone through our programme have said it is transformational in that it encourages them to be reflective practitioners, to look at where the issues are and also to have a menu of options to think about how they might do things differently.  Particularly with the use of new technologies and various other things, where else would academics have the opportunity to try these things out and to work together and support each other?</p> <p>In the past I might not have believed that everybody should undertake a postgraduate qualification.  Now I think it is a really good idea if it is the right qualification and it is done in the right way where it is structured and supported.  I would be very concerned if a policy was brought in where such education just became a person sitting in a lecture theatre ticking a box kind of exercise to gain a certificate.</p></speech>

I do not like the idea of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.  That might develop but it would depend.  It cannot be a bad thing that people would be required, if they do not do so spontaneously, to understand what they are supposed to be doing and what this is all about.  Many people think that teaching is a doddle and that anyone can teach.  They think that if one knows a subject that one can teach it but there is much more to teaching.  It is a bit like nursing.  Most vocations or professions are about experience with reflection so to be encouraged to reflect would be more important to me.  I would be worried about the qualification becoming a box ticking exercise.  We are absolutely plagued with it and such an approach has subsumed our culture to a certain point.  I promised myself that I would not say the following but I am going to do so.  About three years ago I applied to be promoted from an associate professor to a full professor.  Earlier Dr. Foley said, in a rather throwaway remark, that research is what secures promotion and he is right.</p></speech>

All that counted was research.  For various reasons, UCD did not want to promote me in that promotion round.  Basically, UCD decided to say that I was unsuccessful because my teaching was very mediocre.  I do not know many things but I do know that I am a pretty good teacher.  I know this because my students have told me that I have helped them which is good enough for me.  I have proof that I can help students to love a subject and want to study it.  I model things for them and they learn.  I must say I found it very difficult to be told that I had not done enough CPD courses.</p></speech>

One of the key things I would do if I was proposing that everybody should have a postgraduate in education or whatever, is that I would look elsewhere, see what the evidence is and assess whether it makes people better teachers.  Logically, one would think that it would but does it really?  This goes back to my point that education should be evidence-based as much as possible if one is going to impose a certain workload.  Let us remember that when a new academic is appointed, and this is particularly the case in STEM disciplines, he or she must work night and day to set up labs and recruit postgraduates to carry out research in order to get papers out as quickly as possible.  That is an extra load on a new academic.  A lot of teaching is discipline specific.  How I go about teaching engineering is very different from how someone else would go about teaching his or her subject.</p></speech>

The word &quot;education&quot; is derived from the Latin term <i>educo</i>, which means to lead out, which is the task for anyone who is a teacher or lecturer.  One is an educator and as such one must be able to communicate.  Looking back through the mists of time I recall some of my lecturers.  One was John Killeen and another was Michael Jordan, who was an amazing man and Neil Jordan's father.  Both men were great communicators who inspired their students and gave everyone the added value to move on.  Unfortunately, not everybody has such attributes.  One can improve oneself through communication and education courses.  One can learn to stand before a large number of people and improve on one's delivery.  However, education costs an awful lot of money nowadays and parents invest so much in their children.  Research is hugely important and one of my daughters is in research at Maynooth University.  If one pays a lot of money, and even if one is not paying but the State is, one is entitled to a proper standard of education.  I do not know whether we should call students clients or customers but I know that when one buys a product one is a customer, in my opinion.</p></speech>

We are overloaded with quality mechanisms.  There is a huge amount of goodwill there.  This is in total contrast to the position in the 1980s, when I was a student.  We had buckets of lecturers who were so bad they were good.  We knew that they were hopeless and that we had to teach ourselves.  That worked at that time.  Nowadays, the mechanisms are huge.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jen Harvey" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2016012000016#S01800"><p>I would like to refer to what Professor Gallagher said about the actual purpose of higher education.  This links in with the debate we have been having about the quality of teaching.  We have moved on from the imparting of information.  I think the role of educators in higher education is now much more than that.  Our role is to equip our students to be lifelong learners when the information they are getting now is well and truly redundant.  At a time when students can avail of extracurricular activities and many opportunities to engage with external communities, etc., the provision of an enriched educational experience must involve more than sitting or standing in a classroom.</p> <p>As an institution, we have been involved in considering what teaching quality is in terms of granting awards to academic staff.  I have been involved in various processes through the years and there is a challenge in defining quality of teaching.  We have gone through models whereby students make nominations or academics submit portfolios.  I have never been particularly comfortable with any of these measures.  Last year we introduced a new model whereby students made 1,100 nominations for academic staff members.  It was one of the most positive things I have ever seen because we heard about the inspirational teacher who really captured the essence of a problem and inspired students.  For example, there was somebody who, in a moment of despair, did not know where to turn, and an academic had spent lots of time working with the student.  Another academic had really built up a student's confidence.  There were many such amazing examples.  Linking into what Dr. Foley said, now an academic needs to be so many things to so many people and therefore needs to be able to support and inspire in everything he or she does.</p> <p> I return to the argument that we need to be able to provide people with the toolkit with which they can do this.  We now have to cater for students who use new technologies.  The skills of being able to mediate and moderate online are very different to those of being able to inspire and engage students in a classroom or those of providing supports and one-to-one tutorials.  That is an amazing skill set.  Sorry, I am babbling but it is definitely something to support because most of the academics with whom I work and the ones who select to engage after the diploma want to try all these different things.  Once they have the core skills, they want to review their assessment and feedback strategies, they want to know whether there is a continuing professional development course through which they can do this, they want to move online and they will ask whether there is an online course through which they can learn from a student's perspective.  We should not generalise too much about everything.  If we can provide academics with all these resources, that is key.  It is not just always about general resourcing, it also involves where that resourcing goes and, linking into what Professor Gallagher said, getting parity of esteem between teaching and research - and nothing else.  We must recognise the importance of that and the skill set that we give to our students or encourage them to develop while they are with us.  It is much more than lots of information.</p></speech>

It has been an extremely interesting and timely debate and I thank Senator O'Donnell for requesting it.  I hope the committee will forgive me if I wander a little as I try to make the points that I want to make.</p>  <p>  Every year when I see graduation photographs in the newspaper, I wonder how many plasterers, motor mechanics and electricians have been lost to academia.  Our value system in this country seems to have gone wrong somewhere.  We pride ourselves on having the best education system in the world but we are driving square pegs into round holes at an unmerciful rate and that really bothers me.  Regarding teaching and learning - we are talking here about third-level teaching and learning in particular - Dr. Foley's point was, for me, instructive.  He sees himself as a mentor, not a teacher.  I believe that to be his proper position.  The expectations in transitioning from second level to third level education are wrong.  We have grown in expectation that we will be taken by the hand through the entire education system by a kindly teacher who will always put us on the right track.  We have gone out of our way to build systems to support that type of thinking.  </p>  <p>  Dr. Harvey mentioned Blackboard, Moodle and other such things.  In 1996, I went to Holland for the first time to look at electronic learning systems and I introduced them into further education in the same year.</p> <p>There was an expectation with the Moodle platform that an educator could put everything on it, sit back and interact every now and then.  There was a very interesting conversation - I think it was in DIT - where a lecturer from one of the institutes of technology pointed out that he had gone to all the trouble of putting videos and exercises online, but when he carried out a piece of research he found that he had the same number of failures as before.  He called in those who had failed and asked them what went wrong.  One of them said he hadn't got up on Monday morning because "I don't get up for lectures on Monday, and it would all be online anyway."  The lecturer asked why he had not availed of the online resource in that case, but the student told him he had never got around to it.  Going back to the point Dr. Foley made, there is an expectation that students will be managed through the system.</p> <p> There are a few key areas for me which I am interested in today.  Where is the HEA?  Why does it not have a representative here?  I would love to hear its view on teaching and learning in third level education.  I would like to see something in the area of mentor training rather than teaching.  I do not believe that teaching, if we look upon it as second level teaching, fits the model for third level.  I am deeply concerned by the casualisation of teaching and lecturing in third level institutions.  It is happening right across our education system and I believe it is to the detriment of the system.  The loyalty that would have existed to the institution is no longer there.  If anything, we see ourselves as being in conflict with the institution rather than being a loyal member of it.  There is also the issue of the disappearance, or the dumbing down, of the hard subjects.  As I throw these points out, I welcome Dr. Foley's comments on them.</p> <p> I have spoken on a number of occasions about the need for language education.  We visited Helsinki recently with Senator Healy Eames.  A 12 year old child walking through a school stopped and asked me how Ireland was coping with the crisis.  When I asked him which crisis, he said, "The economic crisis."  He spoke in perfect English.  We had a brief conversation about it and I told him his English was excellent.  I asked him if he also spoke Swedish and Finnish.  "Oh, I do," he said, "and German and Russian, but my German is a little poor."  I remember having a debate in which I wanted to bring one language into further education, and they said, "No, we do not do languages here."  And here we are, sitting in the European Union, with no languages.</p> <p> I can see the Chairman looking at me so I will get through this as quickly as I can.  We now have private providers delivering teaching and learning programmes for further education and secondary education.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we are churning out thousands of teachers for whom we have no jobs.  The third level system was already in place, and I would be interested in Dr. Foley's comments on that.</p> <p> Dr. Foley's table is instructive on the amount of diverse activities that one must carry out as an educator today.  We seem to be driven by outputs.  Everything is about outputs today.  It is about the number of students who started, what modules they took, and the number who passed.  As Dr. Foley said, not only does one have to correct the scripts; one also has a plethora of students outside the door waiting for an explanation as to why they did badly, or well, as the case may be.  Then the returns must be sent to some department head, who in turn will collate those and send them up the line.  Ultimately, they will finish up with some politician saying that 24% of students did a, b, and c.  It is a nonsense, to my mind.  I believe - I would be interested in Dr. Foley's comments on this - that if we were to talk about teaching and learning, we could leave that nonsense aside.  We have actually started to concentrate on feeding the machine, and the machine is the university system that needs money.  We have taken the money from the universities but we still expect the same outputs.  Maybe we should shrink the student population and start moving into research.  Maybe there should be a greater emphasis on research.  I will finish on that, and I apologise if I have dragged the discussion all over the third level education system.</p></speech>

I wish to emphasise that this discussion relates to third level education, or higher education.  This includes the institutes of technology, but the other third level institutes are also relevant.  As I was saying to Senator O'Donnell before the meeting, my father was a lecturer at DIT in Kevin Street, and one of the things he did was to run a course for other lecturers about teaching at third level.  That was back in the 1970s.  There was some kind of structure back then, but obviously not as advanced as it is now.</p></speech>

I suggest it would have been far more advanced in the Chairman's father's time.  It went the other way towards research.</p></speech>

I agree that there is a need to develop the apprenticeship system, but I do not agree with the idea that some people are not suitable for university or for third level and should instead be in apprenticeships.  People do not get the points for certain courses for various reasons.  Perhaps they were disadvantaged from the outset, right back to when they were three years of age.  Everybody should have an opportunity to go to university or third level college at some stage of their lives, whenever it suits them or they want to do it.  If they want to look at a bit of medicine at one stage of their lives and a bit of history or social science at another stage, my feeling is that they should be able to do so.</p></speech>

We should have the view that higher education is open to people at any stage of their lives.  We should not say of any individual that higher education will never be for him or her.  I suggest we should model the funding of our system around that.  I went through third level.  I do not know what higher education is like now because I am not in it.  I do not have a clue.  I know what I experienced at the time and it was mixed.  I found it very hard to make the transition from second level to third level, but I muddled through all the same.  We hear people saying now that this is happening to them as well.  Obviously, some people have the same experience as me.  Teachers at second level are looking at moving away from the traditional imparting of knowledge.  I hope this whole idea will help third level education.  It is not just at higher education that this is needed.  It is needed at all levels.  It is clear that there will be junior certificate reform, regardless of the shape that reform takes.  The NCCA engaged in consultation on how to introduce reforms as part of the attempt to have a curriculum based around the idea of critical thinking.  When third level institutions are examining how to improve the content and quality of teaching at third level, do they engage with their students?  Dr. Foley mentioned a survey.  If this matter were being examined now, what could be done to improve it?  Is there consultation?  The NCCA definitely engaged in consultation on the reform of the junior certificate curriculum.  Is there any corresponding consultation in the case of these reforms?  That is just the question I have.</p></speech>

I had to speak on flooding in the Seanad.  Those present will be aware that half the country is under water.  I welcome the witnesses.  I used to be a lecturer at Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.  I congratulate Senator O'Donnell, who is a former lecturer of mine, for putting this issue on the agenda.  I am sorry that I missed the witnesses' expos&eacute;s on this issue.  I have a huge interest in the quality of teaching in higher level education.  If the witnesses have already answered my questions, I will be happy to read those answers in the Official Report.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the relationship that needs to exist between students and lecturers.  There are high numbers of students in lecture halls.  I heard Professor Gallagher say that no relating goes on in lecturing.  I would not completely agree with that.  Some people are amazing raconteurs and storytellers with an ability to communicate.  They are inspirational in their own right.  I am talking about undergraduates, in particular.  I have a son in first year.  I know all his peers.  I know the attrition rates are very high and it is a deep concern.  I also know about the mental health issues among our young people.  In particular, I know about the number of accidental deaths and suicides in that age group.  I spent a good number of days over Christmas looking for a body in Oranmore.</p> <p>We found him after 20 days.  In the previous eight months, there was another case.  Where I live in Oranmore, eight bodies are found every year.  That is terrible.</p> <p> In the exchange between Senator Craughwell and Dr. Foley, I heard the word "mentor".  Would a lecturer meet each of his or her students once in a semester or in a year?  Have they proposals on building a relationship?  One never knows who reaches a young person, be it for teaching and learning, or to see how they are managing away from home.  What scaffolds are in place to build more interaction with students outside the engagement with the student who has failed?  Have the colleges put proactive measures in place to build a relationship with students?  I presume the witnesses are not merely talking about their own practices but what happens in higher education generally.</p> <p> Would a lecturer have a goal to meet student each once in a semester?  I know it is not all about face time because many young people like online time. Will the witnesses address the question from both face to face time, which I think is very important, and online time?  </p> <p> We need to save students from dropping out.  I believe intervention at the correct time will save them but it is a matter of reaching them.  I have a significant issue with the fact that colleges will not give information to parents once the student is over 18 years.  Who is paying the fees?  Parents pay the fees.  Young people are only feeling their own wings; they are wild.  I understand the importance of respecting that they are 18 years or older, but not all students have that level of maturity.  The level of attrition of students during their first year of college is 29% in the ITs and the average in universities is 11%, a figure which is probably outdated now.  That is too high a loss to the system.  Not only have parents lost a significant amount of money, the State too is at a considerable loss but above all it is a major personal loss to the student.  From personal experience across the board and my time in the field of education I can speak about their disappointment.  </p> <p> What impact has the contribution of Professor Sarah Moore to the awards made on teaching and learning in third level?  She is somebody who could contribute to our proceedings today.  I note that representatives from the HEA are not present.</p></speech>

I do not think the argument should be third level or apprenticeships because apprenticeships are dependent on the economy at the time.  One cannot suddenly decide to train 1,000 plasterers if there are no jobs.  I think the major problem in the third level sector is that it is becoming too homogenous.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the first preferences for levels 6 and 7.  Back in 2006 there were 40,000 first preferences for levels 6 and 7 courses and 50,000 for level 8.</p> <p>The number of students who list a course at levels 6 and 7 as their first preference has dropped to 35,000, where the first preference choice for level 8 course has risen to 65,000.  What is happening is that students want a level 8 course or nothing.  It is no surprise that the dropout rates are highest at levels 6 and 7, even if those students have the same points as those at level 8.  We are now at the point where level 6 and 7 qualifications are viewed as inferior as students want level 8 qualifications or nothing.  I think the homogenisation of the third level sector will be aggravated when we have technological universities.  We will have a third level education system that has 13 or 14 universities and nothing else.  There will be no diversity in the system.  I think all universities should have the power and should be willing to give students an exit route at level 7.  There are many students in the system who are dragging through fourth year.  We are seeing a new phenomenon of students failing in fourth year when they should go at level 7.  Now level 7 is viewed as a substandard qualification.  In ten years time everybody will try to get a place for a level 8 course in universities and no other type of college.  Within that we could have a great deal of diversity that would suit people who might want to go to level 6 or level 7.  Many of the level 8 graduates are doing level 6 and 7 jobs.</p></speech>

I think that is of major importance.  I have developed a project which has been piloted in a number of schools but which will be dropped if it does not get a sponsor.

There needs to be much stronger discussion or liaison between further education, FE, and higher education.  I do not think there is enough consideration of those pathways.  We should be talking about how we can work better together.  There is a drift upwards, because of student demand, to more level 8 courses.  That is happening in many institutions and I think it is wrong.  There should be much more discussion about the pathways because the system is very disjointed.  We are not having the correct conversations.  There is a value system for higher education that is not right.</p></speech>

However, it operates completely from the bottom up in the sense that the teachers come to me free and the schools then fund the accommodation, which is just &euro;25 per week.  It is a very good initiative.  I started it because the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said that Chinese would be an optional subject on the junior certificate curriculum, although there is no sign of that now because there are such problems with the curriculum.  We started preparing for this initiative four years ago, so it has been running for four years and it is going really well in Galway.

To return to Senator Craughwell's original point, we must get past the idea that third level education is about sitting in lecture halls.  Studying a STEM subject exposes the student to a huge diversity of learning.  He or she spends a lot of time in laboratories and undertakes research projects and group projects.  I tend to teach small classes so I characterise much of my teaching as teaching by walking around.  I do a lot of hands-on problem solving in the laboratories while I teach laboratory modules.  I am glad the Senator raised the issue of big classes, because recently there has been a big push led by Professor Philip Nolan and the task group on reform of university selection and entry, TGRUSE, which is considering the whole area of transition.  One of the current fads is the idea that all students should go into a general entry course and then make their decisions on the subjects in which they will specialise.  That means that people are stuck into these large, impersonal classes while they are making that difficult transition from second level education.  More often than not, resources will be such that they will have to be assigned to different disciplines on the basis of academic performance in first year.</p></speech>

I went to Trinity College, for example, and at that time arts was split into different courses such as English and history.  Since I left, new courses such as politics and French have been introduced.  The effect of that was to make those courses exclusive, with higher points requirements, because there were only 12 places in a course such as law and German.  My understanding was that the intention of generic-entry courses such as arts was to prevent certain courses from becoming high-end or elitist, and that after doing a general course, people could then specialise if they so wished.</p></speech>

I have studied all the data on this and done large graphs of points requirements versus student intake and so on.  University College Dublin, UCD, admits 400 students to its generic-entry science course, which has a requirement of 510 points.  UCD has the largest intake of engineering students in the country for its engineering course, which has a requirement of 510 points.  The most significant determiner of the amount of points required for admission to a course is the prestige of the institution, in my view.  It is nothing to do with the course.  Many of the degree programmes with very small intakes have very low points requirements, and the reason there is a low intake is that nobody wants to do the courses.  Therefore, we should get rid of them because they are wasteful.  The idea that there is an inverse relationship between intake and points is not true.  Trinity College could admit a thousand students into, say, Business, Economic and Social Studies, and the points requirement would still be high.  It is the prestige of the institution, and it is no coincidence that-----</p></speech>

My fear is that in doing so, we will expose them to a dog-eat-dog culture in first year.  For example, in Dublin City University we have eight science programmes.

If we consider retention rates, that is another argument for having broad-based first year programmes.  One finding of a search undertaken by the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning shows that the turnaround time for a decision on the places offered to students is very short.  One of the issues it found was poor choices in students' selection of programmes.  One day you get your leaving certificate results, and only a few weeks later you are in a course that you do not know much about.  If it is not the course for you, you are quite likely to drop out.  There is an argument, therefore, for broad-based courses.  Having said that, however, if a course is too broad-based, maths and the various other subjects tend to be brought in, and if they are taught in a way that is particularly dissociated from engineering or science, students will disengage and be more likely to drop out.</p>  <p>  In response to Senator Healy Eames's question about how often academics meet first year students, it does vary, but there is a crucial point by which, if a new student has not met with somebody internally, the chances are they will not feel a sense of belonging, or will not feel part of the community.  In the larger classes, a lot of initiatives recently have been encouraging a peer mentoring system, under which continuing students or graduates come in to associate with smaller groups of students in a structured way; they get credits of some kind for this.  That programme is helping to increase the sense of belonging.  Part of the first year experience and the transition from second to third level is very traumatic, and the national forum has done a lot of work on that transition because its theme last year was advancement.  There is a lot of commissioned work that is really valuable.  It is important to see what does not work, what interventions are most important and when they are needed.  When the commitment is made to take students in, they need to be supported through that journey.  It is not enough to take them in on whatever points they get; they need to be supported.  If there are students at risk, they need to be provided with associated support and at least consulted.</p>  <p>  There is an issue with regard to students' ability to change course.  A person who wishes to change must withdraw and reapply.  If students make the wrong choice, the current system is not the best way of supporting them because they cannot go off and do another course if they decide that medicine, for example, would be better.  There are a lot of difficulties in the system.  I could talk a lot about transitions but I am aware that the time is going on.</p></speech>

There is horrendous clumping and over-assessment in programmes which encourages things such as plagiarism and surface approaches to learning.  That is why we are harping on about the importance of providing academic staff with strategies - so that they can review and reflect and make a choice about the best way to assess something.  One size does not fit all.  DIT certainly has a diversity of learners, and to assess them only in one or two methods - I am not saying that happens at DIT - does not capture the strength of the different kinds of learning and the different academic qualities that students are bringing.  There is such a diversity of programmes within the institute.  We need to be reflecting and doing something different.  It is fundamental within the first year.  Students need to know very early on how they are doing relative to others, whether they are progressing, whether they have the right skills and so on.  That needs to be a conversation that happens with the academic member of staff within the first five or six weeks.  There is something to discuss about assessment.  It is hardly any surprise that students withdraw when one leaves any discussion on assessment until the final exams at the end of the year.</p></speech>

Parents who have children of college-going age are very conscious of mental health issues, as they are aware of their child as a whole person.</p>  <p>  This is a good question, but let me be specific in the way I answer it.  I teach a skill subject, and the language I teach is French.  As well as being a lecturer, I am also a tutor and I take small groups and seminars.  These students have to be taught a laboratory subject in small groups.  One is interacting with small groups of students.  Everybody knows that is where the pressure is at third level.  If I were president, I would put more emphasis on small group teaching, more emphasis on the students handing in work.  Certainly, at third year, I would be correcting a piece of written work from my students every week - that is, ten or 11 pieces of written work.  They get feedback on their written work.  They do oral work, so they are talking about themselves.  There is a high level of contact.   I was at an exam board meeting this morning before I came to this committee meeting.  One of my students, who is borderline, sent me nine worrybug e-mails about what she needs to be doing.  There can be significant contact, but the really interesting part of my answer to Senator O'Donnell's question, which I think will surprise members, is that one of the major problems with students who I can see are in difficulty is that they do not come to the small-group teaching sessions.</p></speech>

I have 15 suggestions but I will speak about two.  First, and this may be boring, we need a rolling capital investment plan for the STEM disciplines.  If we do not have that, all the talk about a knowledge economy is nonsense.  Second, this will sound funny coming from an engineer working in a so-called STEM area, I have spoken to career guidance teachers about this and I am aware that secondary school leavers feel badgered into doing STEM courses.  It is coding, coding and more coding.  Having done coding, these disciplines are real minority tastes and do not appeal to everybody.  If one considers what the best-performing students in our universities are studying, it is often the humanities at which they excel.  I worry that, as a country, we are becoming obsessed with STEM.  It is such a broad term and people are studying biology, physics, coding and they are all different.  What I would love the Minister to do is to set up a working group in which he talks to recently qualified graduates who have made the transition from B.Sc or PhD into the workplace.  Nobody over 35 years should be invited.  If one talks to recently qualified PhD students in the STEM area, they will give one a very different perspective from the spin about the knowledge economy.  That is trickling down to school leavers.  I have one career guidance teacher from Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona in Glasnevin who tells me that her students feel they have to do maths because of STEM.  They feel the economy will fall apart if they do not study STEM subjects.  I would like to get a really good sense of what the economy needs.  Do we all have to be fantastic at maths?  I am not too sure we really do.  Engineers use maths.</p></speech>

One example is the digital road for Ireland, which is necessary, and the group is undertaking a review of various projects about technical infrastructures and support for digital literacy.  I think that is encouraging.  In the context of much of the work that has been under way on transition pieces - work that has been researched in many institutions across Ireland - really useful data are available on the website.</p>  <p>  Parity of esteem between teaching and research is something with which we are all wrestling.  I am always arguing the case - the perspective of comparing it to the Taliban is interesting - that there is teaching versus research.  Perhaps that is an IOTI piece.</p> <p>The teaching here achieved a learning impact award.  I am not a great person in terms of awards.

Teaching quality is complex.  Much of Gibbs's work in response to the Green Paper in the UK has looked at what the measures might be.  The conclusion he draws is that it is about learning gains as this is the only real measurable piece.  The quality of most institutions is determined by the actual funding, the research that comes and the quality of the students which is the prestige of an institution, so one cannot fail.  One has to look to measure one's success as a teacher as how one has moved somebody on, so one measures the learning gains.  How does one do that?  That is up for debate.  I do not think they have got it right in the UK as yet, but at least they are discussing it and that is the reason really that this has been put on the agenda now.  Nationally, we need to have more discussion.</p></speech>

Senator Healy Eames was not present for this part of the discussion.  One of the things I have been trying to focus on is the difference between how one raises the quality of learning, as well as the what and the why of learning.</p>  <p>  I really think the mental health of the student is an issue.  We have not really focused on it but Dr. Foley touched on it when he referred to the unrelenting emphasis on STEM and being good at maths.  Are we aware that the humanities are really under threat in Ireland at second level?  When I was studying French at school I read a book of short stories.  I was able to do that and we did it at school.  That has all gone.  In the languages, pupils do not read books with the exception of Irish and what they are now reading in Irish is getting contracted.  That is terrible.  That is an issue that I will try to address before I hang up my clogs.  That is one of the major problems students of French have in university.  The students loved French at school but they have no realisation that one must be able to read French literature, and they have only read it in translation.  It comes down to the what and the why.</p></speech>

There should be much more flexibility in the system.  One should be able to move all over the system at different periods of one's life.  If we had that flexibility there would be less focus on availing of the once-off opportunity to get an education, and being finished if one does not go on at that stage.</p></speech>

Prior to Christmas, the committee heard the views of Professor Faull on the current state of play.  We are keen to hear the Minister of State's views on the situation.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that this subject is of particular interest to the joint committee and that it prepared and published a report in May or June of last year on the impact of a Brexit on Ireland.  We are interested in hearing how the Minister of State sees the negotiations developing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000002#A00700"><p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with the committee today.  Although the details are yet to be confirmed, we know that there is a significant event before us this spring.  I thank the joint committee for its engagement with me since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs in 2014.  When first elected, I had the privilege of being Vice Chairman of this committee.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, this committee fulfils an invaluable role in the scrutiny of EU affairs and I thank members for their balanced and even-handed approach in that regard.  Every member of the committee and, in particular, the Chairman, deserves credit for that.</p>  <p>  Before I address the EU-UK issue in detail, I am conscious that I have not been before the committee since November and so I would like to take this opportunity to touch upon the December General Affairs Council, the broader items on the agenda of the December European Council and the more recent January General Affairs Council.  </p>  <p>  There were five main items on the agenda of the December General Affairs Council, which I attended, including preparations for the European Council; political agreement on the inter-institutional agreement on better regulation; approval of the 18 month work programme of the Council; European Semester 2016 and the Commission presentation of its annual growth survey; and enlargement.  The inter-institutional agreement on better regulation was negotiated on behalf of the Council by the Luxembourg Presidency, which did an excellent job in shepherding through an accord with both the Commission and the European Parliament.  Although it was not perfect, Ireland was happy to support the final text.  The Council work programme, essentially the trio Presidency programme, was an uncontentious item.  The Commission&rsquo;s presentation of the annual growth survey was criticised for coming two weeks later than planned but, nevertheless, found broad agreement.  The Commission&rsquo;s publication of its package of enlargement reports was also delayed but in this regard the majority of member states were also able to signal overall support for it, albeit with significant commentary by many of our partners.  </p>  <p>  On the December European Council, the Taoiseach attended this meeting and, as the committee will be aware, he made a statement in that regard to the D&aacute;il yesterday.  To recap briefly, at that meeting EU Heads of State and Government, in addition to migration and the EU-UK question, also reviewed Europe&rsquo;s actions in the fight against terrorism, building on the decisions taken at its February meeting and in light of the barbaric attacks in Paris and elsewhere.  A number of other items were also discussed, including the situations in Syria, Ukraine and, briefly, Libya.  Certain economic and financial issues, taking stock of discussions on the Five Presidents&rsquo; report on Economic and Monetary Union and developments in the Internal Market were also discussed.  Following the successful COP 21 in Paris, energy union and a forward-looking climate policy were also discussed.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, represented Ireland at the January General Affairs Council, which took place in Brussels on Monday afternoon.  </p> <p>The meeting was exceptionally short, following on from a Foreign Affairs Council that took place before it.  There were two substantive items on the agenda: the work programme of the Netherlands Presidency and preparation of the next scheduled European Council, which will take place on 18 and 19 February.  The General Affairs Council also briefly discussed the language regime relating to EU recruitment following a recent court case.  The February European Council will focus on the EU-UK issue, which dovetails nicely with the topic for discussion this afternoon.  It will, of course, also deal with migration and the euro area recommendations agreed by ECOFIN on 15 January.</p> <p> The January General Affairs Council heard from the Netherlands as it began its 12th Presidency of the Council, and as the first member of the current Trio along with Slovakia and Malta.  This is a standard presentation of priorities at the first GAC of a Presidency term.  We, like others, anticipate that the Netherlands will run a very efficient Presidency given its extensive experience.  We are generally happy with the proposed overall programme.  The Dutch Presidency&rsquo;s three key principles are: a Union focused on essentials; innovative growth and jobs; and connecting with citizens.  However, a number of immediate priorities are dominating the European Union agenda, including migration, security, the UK-EU question, EMU, and climate change policy.</p> <p> The Dutch Minister for Foreign and European Affairs wrote to his ministerial colleagues earlier this month setting out the following priorities for the work of the GAC over the coming months: a review of the multi-annual financial framework; work on the rule of law, to include a Presidency seminar on fundamental values, migration and integration to be held in Strasbourg on 2 February; implementation of the inter-institutional agreement on better regulation; consideration of the better regulation package and the Commission&rsquo;s REFIT programme; consideration of transparency in the way the Union operates; discussions on better governance in the context of the European Semester and country-specific recommendations; and follow-up to the European Council.</p> <p> Given the gravity of the migration situation and notwithstanding the desire to discuss the EU-UK issue, it would be remiss not to say a few words on the migration and refugee crisis.  We are all aware this is a complex and emotive issue.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we continue to emphasise the importance of addressing the root causes as well as the humanitarian dimension of this crisis.  This has been our consistent approach both in Europe and in terms of our own national response.</p> <p> Migration remains the highest priority issue on the European Union agenda, although we have struggled as a Union to tackle successfully the challenges posed by the crisis.  There have been important agreements at EU level over recent months on various elements of a multifaceted, comprehensive response to the crisis.  These include agreements on so-called hotspots, registration, control of external borders, relocation and returns, as well as very important agreements on how we can improve our co-operation with Turkey.</p> <p> However, delivering on many of these commitments has been far too slow.  As our Heads of State and Government stated at the European Council last month, implementation of agreed measures must be speeded up.  In our own case, for example, and despite our opt-out under Protocol 21, members will be aware of the Government offer to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers into Ireland through a combination of resettlement and relocation programmes.  The resettlement aspect of this is advancing albeit slowly, with 176 people having already arrived in the State so far and with more expected over the coming months.  However, on relocation and in spite of our best efforts to implement our agreed approach and our early engagement with the relevant authorities, progress has been very slow.  This is due mainly to administrative difficulties with the establishment of the hotspots and setting up the relocation programmes in Italy and Greece.</p> <p> Ireland has deployed two experts to the Greek island of Lesbos to support the European Asylum Support Office and we have also nominated liaison officers to both Italy and Greece to support the work of the hotspots.  We await an update this week on progress regarding the first grouping of asylum applications under this framework.</p> <p> Delivering on relocation and on other measures, some of which were agreed in very difficult political circumstances, is important for the Union's credibility, and it is in all our interests to maintain that focus in 2016.  In February, the European Council will return to the migration issue with an assessment of how progress is advancing on implementation.  Between now and then, it is incumbent on all involved to fulfil their obligations.</p> <p> I now come to the main agenda item for us this afternoon, the issue of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union.  It is, of course, of very important strategic interest to Ireland.  As committee members know, it will remain a priority throughout the negotiation process and into the subsequent referendum.  Our two countries are bound by uniquely close economic, social and political ties.  Furthermore, from an EU perspective, we share many common positions and issues of common concern with the UK.  These are close ties and there is a very strong belief that the European Union as a whole benefits and will continue to benefit from UK membership.</p> <p> From a political perspective, we have been involved in frequent discussions on this issue, including at the highest level in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s exchanges with the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron.  Ministers have also discussed it regularly with their UK counterparts - the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, with the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Philip Hammond, and I with the Minister of State at the British Foreign Office, Mr. David Lidington.  This committee has, of course, engaged in some excellent work, including travelling to the United Kingdom.  The Department of the Taoiseach has been engaging closely with other Departments as well as with our permanent representation in Brussels, our embassy in London, and our embassies across the European Union, to ensure a comprehensive, whole-of-Government response to the key questions. </p> <p> Where are we in terms of the negotiations?  Following initial discussions at the June and October European Councils, the end of last year saw a significant increase in activity on all fronts.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, issued a letter to President Tusk on 10 November which kicked off discussions in earnest by outlining the British concerns in broad terms under four headings or baskets, as they are referred to.  This was followed by a series of consultations between senior officials from all EU member states, including Ireland, and the EU institutions, on foot of which President Tusk sent a letter to EU Heads of State and Government on 7 December, presenting an initial reaction to the British reform agenda and confirming that there would be a two-stage approach at EU level: a political discussion of the issue at the December European Council and, one hopes, a final decision at the February European Council on 18 and 19 February.</p> <p> The December European Council provided the first opportunity for a collective discussion of the issue among all 28 EU Heads of State and Government and the Presidents of the European Union institutions.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, outlined the four broad areas where he is seeking change and also spoke about the complex domestic politics which surround the issue in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>As the committee members will have learned from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement to the House yesterday, the subsequent exchanges were, overall, positive and constructive.  The Taoiseach intervened to present the Irish perspective in strong and forthright terms.  In doing so, he addressed the importance of the issue to Ireland but also emphasised the significance of the UK's membership to the EU as a whole.  He struck a positive and supportive note, underlining the need for partners to work together to find a solution that is mutually acceptable and that will enable the Prime Minister, David Cameron, to recommend and campaign for a vote to remain in the European Union.  In addressing the House of Commons after the European Council, Prime Minister Cameron singled out the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address as having been particularly helpful.</p> <p> In terms of the substantive issues, the committee will be familiar with Ireland&rsquo;s positioning across the four headings.  Under the competitiveness heading, we share the UK&rsquo;s enthusiasm for sustained effort to do more.  These issues are the drivers of long-term prosperity for all EU citizens, and we support measures that would give further impetus to growth, competitiveness and employment, including through strengthening the Single Market, building a real digital Single Market and expanding the EU&rsquo;s network of relationships and trade agreements across the globe.</p> <p> On economic governance, we believe the principles set out by the UK provide a good basis for discussion.  The euro area must have the capacity to do what is necessary to ensure financial stability and economic growth.  It must, however, also act in full respect of the Single Market and of the integrity of the EU as a whole, without prejudice to the interests of all member states.  We appreciate the concerns of the UK and other non-euro member states in this area and we are committed to examining carefully and constructively the detail of what is proposed.  We must keep in mind the importance of our financial sector and the need to ensure it is not disadvantaged in any way.  This view is shared by many member states regarding their own sectors.</p> <p> Issues under the sovereignty heading relate to strengthening the role of national parliaments in the EU as well as addressing the concept of ever closer Union as it applies to the UK.  Ireland has a constructive approach to practical proposals and we firmly believe that workable solutions can be found.  Although the details remain to be clarified, and we must always apply the caveat that the devil is in the detail, it is felt that broad lines are emerging in these areas that will address the key issues.</p> <p> The fourth heading, welfare and immigration, is more difficult.  An element of consensus is emerging.  For example, agreement is moving well on finding solutions to addressing fraud and abuse, and there is good progress on changing the way child benefit is paid abroad.  The idea of limiting access to in-work benefits is tricky, and there was widespread opposition to the proposition as it was originally put forward.  Nonetheless, work is progressing on it and I am hopeful that, with willingness and determination, a workable solution can be found in this area.</p> <p> It was the overriding sense of a willingness and determination to chart a way forward that struck me most from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s report of the December European Council yesterday.  While it is a challenging and sensitive issue, it is very encouraging that the exchanges at the December European Council were substantively rich and constructive in tone, which led to a very positive atmosphere.</p> <p> EU leaders have agreed to work very closely in the very short period ahead with a view to reaching agreement on a package of measures at the February European Council, a few weeks from now.  President Tusk is expected to present a paper in very early February, perhaps on 5 February.  This will contain - finally, some might say - concrete proposals under the four headings and will be the subject of two meetings in early February at senior official level before the matter comes to the European Council via the General Affairs Council on 16 February.</p> <p> While the legal form and implications of the final package remain to be teased out, it is to be welcomed that the UK is not pressing for early treaty change.  The overriding sense is that, for the large majority of issues, broad lines of agreement are already emerging.  Even on the more difficult issues, we can be optimistic that a solution will be found which addresses the legitimate concerns of all partners, and which will meet Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s political objectives.</p> <p> From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, we move into the next and critical phase, with a significant amount of work already completed at both political and official levels.  This leaves us well-placed to continue our positive and constructive engagement with the negotiations at EU level in the weeks ahead.  We know Ireland's strategic priorities, we understand the British requests and our own views on them, and we have a sound understanding of the perspectives of the other 26 member states.</p> <p> As things stand, we have good grounds to hope an agreement can be reached in February which is acceptable to Ireland and other partners, and which will allow Prime Minister Cameron to recommend, and campaign vigorously for, a vote to remain in the European Union.  It has been a three-step process.  First, there was the decision to hold a referendum in Britain, now the negotiation period is, it is hoped, reaching a conclusion, and the third phase will be the referendum campaign in the UK.  A referendum may take place in June.</p> <p> I look forward to any questions the committee members may have.  Although the exact detail of the text that is coming on 5 February has not emerged yet, I hope to be as helpful as possible to the committee.  I thank the members for their engagement over the past year and a half and wish them all the best of luck over the next two months.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000004#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials and thank him for the comprehensive outline of the state of play.  Migration is a relatively significant issue for me.  Across Europe, there has been a lack of movement on achieving a resolution, notwithstanding that there probably can be no immediate resolution.  There is inertia.  While it is identified as the highest priority, it almost reminds me of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  While I do not want to be political, although everything is his highest priority, so-called, nothing necessarily happens.  Although European leaders are generally saying migration is the highest priority, the Heads of State bemoan the fact that nothing has happened at the Council meeting, that the appropriate action has not been taken, or that there has not been enough action.  It is unacceptable.  My point is not directed at the Minister of State.  It is a collective issue for all the member states.</p>  <p>  To some extent, there has been an easing off in the passage of migrants due to the change in season and the weather, although there has not been as much of a decrease as originally expected as winter began.  Ireland could do much more.  While I was critical of the 4,000 we settled on, it would have made a difference had we moved more quickly to welcome 4,000 here.</p> <p>We could have accommodated them and we are in a position to accommodate them but we have been far too slow to address those issues of red tape.  There is an opportunity for us to step away from the pack a little bit.  We can explain away the lack of action as the inability to reach agreement among member states because some members do not share the same views.  The challenge is for us to recognise our own history, culture and views and to do much more on an individual basis rather than staying part of the herd and accepting the roadblocks and issues that prevent the process from proceeding at greater speed.  Has any consideration been given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or European affairs at the Department of Taoiseach to reach ahead of the actions of other members states and do more on a bilateral basis?</p> <p> On the British situation, we look forward to the text of such an agreement.  We hope it will be enough for David Cameron to resolve, to some extent, the mess he has created for himself.  That would be a political charge.  I do not want to do that because we are all on the same side but it is an issue that needs to be comprehensively addressed.  It is to be hoped there will be enough in it to allow him to convince the people of Britain to remain in the European Union.</p> <p> The Minister of State mentioned that child benefit was a tricky issue.  Could he give us more information on what he thinks is being proposed or the direction in which that is being taken?  Notwithstanding our desire to keep Britain as part of the Union, which is a major focus - a high priority, as the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, might say - we cannot at the same time diminish in any way the principles upon which Europe is founded, particularly the in-work benefits which accrue to the individual regardless of the residence of their family.  These benefits accrue in the country in which people pay their insurance and while that is unpalatable for some in this country, it is an issue politically.  We have to stand up to people who make these kinds of statements, even thought it might not be electorally advantageous.  It goes to the core of addressing an issue that exists in every society and which is linked to racism.  It is often presented as or hidden behind an assertion that there is not enough money to pay those people.  There is a view that we are assisting people through the social welfare code to a far greater extent than we are.  Such charges usually come from people who, in my view, have racist tendencies.  Anything in the text of this that will give succour to those people should be resisted, and I am sure it will be.  We have to be very careful about the language we use while supporting David Cameron.  We cannot give succour to those who would seek to be divisive and racist in their outlook.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000005#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his team.  There have been a number of referendum campaigns in this country and very often it is a case of perception versus reality - perception of what a vote is about versus the reality of what it is about.  We saw this with the referenda on the Lisbon and Nice treaties.  The emigration and financial crises have tested the resolve of many of the firmest EU supporters over recent years.  It is especially difficult for a country such as the UK where there are splits on a likely referendum campaign between and within leading parties.  It seems to have come faster than any of us would have anticipated and there is talk of a referendum in June.  It may not happen then but it will certainly be in the very near future.</p><p>On the Minister of State's and Taoiseach's discussions on the UK's demands, what areas does the Minister of State feel Ireland has been particularly helpful on?  On the migration situation, there is a perception that people are coming to the EU for welfare.  The view that people are getting benefits that others are being denied is especially prevalent in the UK.  Deputy Dooley touched on it and it comes up the odd time in canvassing.  How is that being fed by the migration<font color="#FF0000"> </font>crisis that exists at the moment?  Ultimately, if a referendum takes place in the UK or anywhere in the EU, that view will certainly be at its core.  Is there growing support because of the migration crisis across the EU that something has to be done about the unnatural draw of the welfare system, as has been stated by a Minister in the UK?  Is there increasing support in other countries, such as Germany or France?  We know the situation that has pertained in Germany over recent  weeks and how this issue has been heightened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000005#D00300"><p>I do not know whether I am being artificially lulled into a sense of optimism.  My memory of the British Prime Minister's attempts to renegotiate treaties was of a very virulent, hard-hitting and destructive campaign as a reaction to the growth of UKIP in the early days.  Today we are hearing more about Mr. Cameron's position that he vigorously campaigned to remain in Europe.  The Minister of State has spoken of the plausibility of the other 27 members accepting that we can negotiate with the UK and that by 18 or 19 February, all will be rosy in the garden.  That strikes me as somewhat contradictory.  I do not know whether the Prime Minister of Great Britain acted improperly under duress from the growth of the extreme right wing in England and whether this is gamesmanship by him and a belief that he will succeed if he shouts and roars enough.  He has promised the British people revolutionary reform and reform of treaties.  He has said openly and publicly that he will not argue in favour of Europe unless he succeeds in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister of State the hardcore questions.  What will Mr. Cameron sell to the British people if the other 27 nations are happy to concede?  I have always conceded one of the points the Minister of State mentioned, namely, fraud and abuse of the welfare system.  What country would not argue for the elimination of fraud and abuse of welfare systems?  It is natural and we do not support fraud in the welfare system in this country.  That is easily conceded but is not the key point Mr. Cameron was making.  In so far as I can understand his position, it was that the power and sovereignty of national parliaments was being lost.  The British argued they were losing their sovereign status, being engulfed by the other 27 nations and being neutered in the process.  Will the Minister of State enlighten me as to how it all seems to be so much on an even keel at the moment?</p>  <p>  The key question is what plan B is for the Republic or for Europe if the electorate in the UK rejects these revolutionary changes that Mr. Cameron is seeking to achieve by negotiations and banging the table with his European partners.  Ireland played its own role in the negotiations.  Did we make any positive contribution to the debate on the arguments with Mr. Cameron to facilitate his position?  I cannot quite figure out how we are so lovey-dovey on the one hand without making a contribution to his political demands.</p></speech>

I apologise for repeating myself, but he stated at this meeting that it was one of the highest priorities on the agenda.  Yesterday, we discussed the relocation of 160,000 people.  To date, only 322 have been relocated across Europe.  Hardly a weekend goes by in which 322 people do not arrive in Italy, Greece or so on.  The Minister of State mentioned that there were inefficiencies in the system, but that is not the case.  It is broken.  It is not working.  I accept his assertion that we must address this issue again, but whoever takes over the leadership might have a different view of the matter and it will be pushed to the side.</p>  <p>  The front-line states of Greece and Italy are dealing with this day to day, but there is a lack of solidarity with them.  Ireland has agreed to take 4,000 people, which is a substantial number, but there is a blockage in the system.  For the life of me, I do not know what is causing it.  When people were debating the numbers involved, several of us gathered together on a cross-party basis because we did not want it to be used to promote the racism card or negativity.  We tried to be positive.  The various groups that were supportive of it have decided to gather again.  Something is wrong.  Clearly, we are out of the loop as politicians, but many of the groups that support relocation are also out of it.  I do not get a sense of what is going wrong across Europe.  I am not criticising the Minister of State, but I do not understand this problem.</p>  <p>  The proposed Brexit seems to be based on fear.  Fraud and abuse have been referenced, but are there statistics to support claims of a widespread abuse of the system?  If it is happening across Europe, no one will oppose a change, but I do not believe that it is happening to the extent the British public has been led to believe is the case by tabloids and so on.  Stirring up this trouble is easy.  What are the red line issues for Ireland in this regard?  One contentious demand is that workers from other EU countries be required to wait four years after moving to Britain before they can claim benefits.  What is Ireland's position on this demand?  It is a reasonable question.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State view Brexit as a divisive issue in respect of the North?  Yesterday, I referred to the strength of the majority English vote.  People in Scotland and Wales are clearly opposed to a Brexit and a poll was conducted in the North.  The majority in England will determine the outcome.  The figure that I cited yesterday was high at 53% in support of a withdrawal.  I am worried.  There will be an impact on the island of Ireland.  The British Government will not replace the moneys being invested in many communities in the North.</p>  <p>  According to media reports, Poland is willing to trade its welfare rights for UK support for NATO bases.  Poland joined the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia as the Visegrad Group to oppose discriminatory welfare restrictions.  It is changing its tune.  Will this have an impact on the negotiations?</p>  <p>  I have asked many questions, so I might wait for the answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000006#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his interesting and broad-ranging presentation.  He mentioned that security and the situations in Syria, Ukraine and Libya had been discussed, but what discussions have there been on internal security?  For example, what is the position on the suspension of the Schengen Agreement and what measures are being taken to improve European security?</p>  <p>  In December, an agreement was reached with Turkey on stemming the tide of migrants into Europe.  A significant amount of money was to be made available to Turkey for that purpose.  Although it is not relevant, a backstop was placed on Turkey's ultimate membership of the EU.  How is the agreement working in practice?  Will the recent bombings in Istanbul impact on the co-operation between Turkey and Europe in terms of broader security and migration?</p>  <p>  Would the early holding of a referendum in the UK - it has been mooted for as early as June - be a positive or a negative?  It could be positive in light of the visible uncertainty that is being created by Britain's position, as evidenced by a decrease in the value of sterling, which has impacted on Ireland.  Given the polls, would it be better to have the referendum sooner rather than later or would a longer run-up to the referendum be more in our interests?  I take Deputy Crowe's point about fear being a part of the issue.  I am concerned that much of the narrative in the UK describes people as wanting to go and feeling that they would be better off because of sovereignty and "Rule, Britannia" without showing many of the downsides that would result from an exit.  From what I have seen in the British media, even the narrative that existed early in the debate about an exit possibly damaging business, foreign direct investment and so forth has changed.  It is not as much of an issue in the debate anymore.  This is worrying from Ireland's point of view.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State commented that treaty change seemed to be off the agenda.  That contradicts some of this committee's engagement with the various British representatives who have appeared before us.  It was made clear that treaty change would not be off the agenda and would be a necessary part of any successful deal to prevent a Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016012000006#E00400"><p>That was an extensive set of questions.  I will start with one asked by Deputy Dooley, which was picked up by others, in particular Deputy Crowe.  Deputy Dooley stated that the approach to migration was not working.  I agree with his sentiments, as we do not believe it is working.  This country showed good, strong ambition that reflected the views of the Irish people.  We are a welcoming nation and, notwithstanding our opt-out, we were willing to take 4,000 people.  A low number of migrants have come to our shores.  Regarding relocation in particular, this approach is not working for a variety of reasons.  We have sent our officials to the hotspots in Italy and Greece.  The December Council was politically aware that the agreements, which were very difficult to achieve, exceptionally divisive and involved a qualified majority vote, had not delivered for people the opportunity we know they want, namely, to live in the EU and escape from the barbarity of regimes in certain parts of the world.</p> <p>To that end, it will be on the agenda for the February Council to consider why procedures and processes have not worked, particularly with respect to relocation.  As to whether we can act - Deputy Dooley asked, quite understandably, if we should act unilaterally - we cannot at this time.  We are working as a small peripheral member state.  This is a major crisis for the European Union and, given the quantum of people involved, progress must be made collectively.  I understand the frustration; we experience it too.  It is something that must be acted on quickly.  There is a small period of grace given that it is winter, but we can expect that, unless action is taken, there will be an increase in the numbers as soon as the weather improves.</p> <p> All of the members had questions in respect of the UK.  While we support the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union, we do not support it any cost.  We do not support it if it diminishes two core principles - first, that there is full and free movement of European citizens, including ourselves, around the Continent and, second, that in any member state all people regardless of what European Union country they come from are treated equally.  That applies to work benefits, social protection benefits, employment and everything else.  These are core principles.</p> <p> It is fair to raise the debate in the UK.  Deputy Crowe asked if perception was a problem.  First, the United Kingdom has benefited significantly from the free movement of people.  It has one of the lowest levels of unemployment and has a strong and dynamic workforce.  In terms of so-called foreigners, be they from inside the European Union or outside it, the United Kingdom is about average with regard to the number of people who are not British living within its borders.  For example, there are more eastern European people living in the Republic of Ireland, as a proportion of our population, than is the case in the United Kingdom.  To be blunt, there is a strong benefit in having a country that will attract young, well educated Europeans because there is a cost in educating them.  It has been a strong benefit to the UK such people in its workforce.  We believe that the principles of free movement of people and goods and services have worked for the European Union and we do not believe there is a need for change in these areas.  I tend to agree sometimes that the fears of fraud and abuses can be overstated.  However, that is not to say there cannot equally be ways of addressing them as well.</p> <p> We have made a significant contribution to the debate in Ireland, particularly by pointing out that many of the suggestions from the UK, especially in the first three baskets, are things we should have been doing to a greater extent in any event.  I refer here to making the Union more competitive, improving governance in some sectors, developing trade agreements and so forth.  There are many elements in the original set of proposals from the United Kingdom which benefit our citizens as well as the UK.  The Taoiseach, in particular, was to the forefront on that.</p> <p> Regarding the question about Northern Ireland, my view is that the journey we have travelled on this island has been remarkable.  Regardless of any vote in any referendum, the people of these islands have made remarkable progress.  Equally, we must acknowledge the reports.  The ESRI points out that the country that would be most disadvantaged economically by excluding the UK will be ours, while there are other reports which indicate that within the United Kingdom the area that will be most disadvantaged will be Northern Ireland.  If one combines the interests of the North and the South, we collectively have a significant interest in the development of this discussion.  There is the possibility that the land border between the United Kingdom and Europe would be the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  That clearly would create difficulties.  A total of &euro;2.3 billion has flowed in the past five years from the European Union to Northern Ireland from both the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund.  It is correct to point out that these would be difficult to replace.  Yesterday, the D&aacute;il discussed the issue of whether the referendum is undemocratic in light of the nature of the four countries within the United Kingdom.  However, that is a matter for the UK.  At this stage, it would be speculative to consider what would occur if certain countries within the UK voted one way and others voted differently.  While all of this is speculative, a British exit would potentially cause some difficulties.</p> <p> Senator Hayden is correct.  The Schengen Agreement is under significant threat.  It is currently suspended.  We are all aware of the challenges now faced by the legislators.  Ireland is not part of the Schengen Agreement but the free movement of people is threatened when some countries have borders between each other as they have now.  Aside from the British question, that is yet another reason that this migration crisis must be addressed.  To be clear on treaty change, I fully accept there is a nuance here.  The British and David Cameron want legal certainty to the outcome of these talks.  We have no issue with that.  However, we do not believe at this point - we are not alone in this view - that there is a requirement to open the Pandora's box of widespread treaty change.  Perhaps, as happened with ourselves and the Danes, legally binding protocols which would satisfy UK demands could be agreed and these would then come into effect at the next point of treaty.  We hope and believe that this could satisfy the UK's concerns.</p> <p> I do not have anything to say about the rumours from Poland.  I have only seen the reports but not anything else, so I cannot comment on that only to say that it seems quite a stretch.  The rumours in question were stringently denied by authorities in Poland subsequently.  I do not wish to toss out the phrase, "Do not believe everything you read", but in this instance there might be some merit in that.</p> <p> I note there was also a question about a plan B.</p></speech>

On plan B, I do not wish to reiterate what I have said many times and what many others have said.  However, we are very much focused on plan A, namely, the current negotiations.  Then all of us in all our member parties and, indeed, in the diplomatic world, the business world and so forth will see how best to engage in the debate in the UK.</p> <p>A disproportionately large number of people who live in Great Britain, as opposed to Northern Ireland, have either an Irish parent or grandparent.  Moreover, there is a significant level of Irish commercial membership of boards in the United Kingdom.  Consequently, we will have some role to play in the referendum in the United Kingdom.  However, members should recall how other countries becoming involved in our referendums - on either side of the argument - went down.  This is a matter for the United Kingdom.  I refer to the reason a plan B would be so hard were there to be a vote to leave. There would then begin a lengthy process of deliberation as to the terms under which the United Kingdom might stay.  It would be very much in the interests of Ireland to be engaged in that process, as we certainly would not wish to be disadvantaged in any way but, then again, neither would other member states.  Work is ongoing in the Department of the Taoiseach to consider various potential outcomes.  At this point, however, the focus must be to ensure that two objectives are met from the current process.  The first of these involves reaching an agreement the United Kingdom is satisfied fulfils its desires and ambitions.  From Ireland's perspective, the second objective, which is shared by the other 26 member states, is that such an agreement would not in any way disadvantage our citizens or undermine any of the core principles that have allowed the European Union to travel so far in recent decades.</p></speech>

As members will recall, in December, representatives from almost 200 nations approved the landmark Paris agreement at COP21.  Prior to COP21, we met representatives of Stop Climate Chaos and at the meeting, it was requested that we would invite the representatives back following the conference.  Today is the first opportunity we have had to reflect on the outcomes of the decisions made at COP21.  We are interested to hear the witnesses' interpretation of the deal, their views on the implementation of the agreement and how they may impact on various sectors both here and abroad.  The format of today's meeting is that we will have an opening statement, which will be accompanied by an audiovisual presentation.  We will then take questions from members.  </p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are completely switched off for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee room.

However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call on Mr. Mac Evilly to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Sweeney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000003#B00400"><p>Good morning Deputies and Senators.  I will kick off with a brief introduction to issues where I think there is a very strong linkage between the Paris agreement and issues which are relevant to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I suppose this is our target audience when dealing with these matters.  People in the developing countries have a particularly difficult way of life at the moment.  Last September, I travelled to Zambia as part of a group from Maynooth.  Maynooth University runs a masters programme with some African universities.  We were graduating 26 students from Maynooth University, who were all based in Zambia and Malawi.  As part of that, I visited some of the people concerned.  We were dealing with people at the grassroots level in terms of poverty.  They are some of the poorest people in the world.  I went there to hear their particular issues which I think are quite relevant.  A slide shows their community hall and church where we listened to what they had to say, both the older and younger people.  The men and the women had very different issues.  When one is dealing with issues of environment and climate, it is important to hear some of the older voices in the community because they will have long memories about extreme events and whether things have changed substantially.</p>  <p>  Another slide shows an old man in whom I was especially interested.  He told me the hardship he had now begun to experience was because of a fundamental change in the reliability of the rainfall.  He said that their seeds withered because the rains had not arrived on time and that their crops were dying in the field because the rains were retreating earlier than had been his experience over many years.  Therefore, acute hardships were being felt.  Although he did not directly say this to me, the unwritten question was, why is this happening?  Who is responsible for these changes?  The scientific answer to that would be that it is largely us, in the developed world, who are responsible for what he is experiencing.  </p>  <p>  I will show the committee two slides that epitomise the problems that are now developing in many part of Africa as a result of climate change.  The first slide shows the famous Victoria Falls where the mighty Zambezi tumbles over the escarpment and flows down into Lake Kariba, which is the largest man-made lake in the world.  It generates 90% or more of the electricity supply for the country of Zambia and a substantial supply for other countries as well.  Members will be able to see quite clearly the problem beginning to emerge.  The lack of reliable rainfall and an absence of rainfall mean the rains no longer feed the falls and, in turn, the falls no longer feed the hydropower station on which so much of that country depends.  As a consequence, there are all kinds of knock-on effects for the economies and societies in that poorest part of the world.</p>  <p>  People can live without heat in tropical Africa but one still needs to cook food and if there is no electricity, then one has to use charcoal.  Deforestation is taking place as a consequence and is now emerging as a major problem.  One can see that urban dwellers are starting to move large amounts of wood into the cities.  Even the poor people who walk on average 11 km a day to collect firewood in that part of the world now find it increasingly difficult to source wood.  In the cities, there are 12 hour power cuts, resulting in disinvestment which, in turn, is producing high unemployment and thus hardship in the cities concerned.  The impacts of climate change, although we think of them as something alien to us, are really profound in many parts of the developing world.  Irish Aid is active in these countries in terms of trying to foster sustainable development.</p>  <p>  We know from the climate science conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that we are on an upward trajectory.  In each of the past three decades, the earth has been warmer than in any of the preceding decades since 1850, when reliable records began.  We know that for the past 30 years, we have been privileged to live in the warmest 30-year period of the past millennium and a half on this planet.  Things have changed, and they are changing quite radically.  </p>  <p>  It is not simply the developing world that is affected by this situation.  There are strong connections back to us here in Ireland.  We know that the flooding that we have experienced here in the past few weeks has had a component in it which has intensified its magnitude.</p> <p>That has rendered that kind of an event likely to occur more frequently as a result of climate change.  It is a connection that is universal for all of Ireland.</p> <p> We will see changes in our agricultural viability and the kinds of pests and diseases that we must cope with in agriculture.  We will also see changes in the infrastructural protection that we need in our towns and cities.  As with all environmental hazards, we will see them affecting those who are least able to bear them.  It is one of the features of environmental hazards of all kinds that they tend to affect the poorer people in society and those who do not have the wherewithal to escape and protect themselves.  For example, our small farmers will be particularly at risk.  We know the changes will entail considerable costs for them.  We have seen a hint of that in the fodder crises from a few years ago and we will see that kind of event more commonly in future.</p> <p> We know last year was the warmest year globally on record, and before that it was 2014.  That was partly contributed to by a major El Ni&ntilde;o event but it was also partly brought about by the ongoing loading of the atmosphere by greenhouse gases.  We know from our own hard experience in Ireland the impact of extremely wet months such as last December, the wettest December since we started reliable measurements in the 1940s or so.  It has been an exceptional past few months in Ireland.</p> <p> Anywhere in Ireland today is a half degree Celsius warmer than it was 30 years ago.  Ireland is warming at the same rate as the rest of the world, on average, and as a mid-latitude country that is unsurprising.  Every month of the year is roughly a half degree Celsius warmer than it was 30 years ago.  Climate change is affecting us and it is under way in Ireland.  Our models suggest we will undergo another warming of a half degree Celsius in the next 20 to 25 years.  The trend is quite clear and what is happening in the rest of the world is having an impact on us in Ireland in terms of temperature.  The models suggest there will be a further and perhaps more severe impact on Ireland in terms of rainfall.  The red areas in the map distributed to members indicate areas where in winter we expect substantial increases in rainfall with all the consequent impacts for flooding.  We expect drier summers with all the consequent impacts on water supplies for towns, cities and agriculture.</p> <p> It is quite clear from the fifth assessment report, which the Irish Government has signed up to - as it has with all the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, reports since 1990 - that there is a very strong link between the cumulative amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere and the climate change it induces.  In particular, the Paris agreement, which we are discussing today, has as a focus the need to avoid taking the temperature change to levels at which we enter the unknown in climate science, specifically what is unknown about what will happen in Greenland, Antarctica and the gulf stream.</p> <p> There is an issue I will address before we move on.  There is a strong relationship that came from the last IPCC report and although it was alluded to in Paris, it did not form the centrepiece of the negotiations.  One suspects that was for political reasons.  There is a straight line between how much we have historically put into the atmosphere and how much warming we have experienced.  One can see that over the past century or so, we have put in approximately 500,000 million tonnes of carbon and the relationship with temperature is very straightforward, with under a degree Celsius of warming.  We can base future carbon emission predictions on that.  Taking it forward, if we want to avoid warming of 2&deg; Celsius, we have a certain carbon budget and once we exceed it, we will irrevocably enter dangerous climate change territory.  That entry will occur when we exceed an emission of approximately just under 800 billion tonnes of carbon.</p> <p> That is what we have to work with globally and once we go beyond that as a planet, we will have warming of 2&deg; Celsius come what may.  Currently we have emitted 545,000 million tonnes of that 790,000 million tonnes of carbon.  What we have left to divvy up among the global community is 245 billion tonnes.  That may not sound like much carbon but we are currently putting into the atmosphere approximately 11 billion tonnes every year, meaning we have 24, 25 or 30 years at the most to get that carbon emission sorted out.  That is why the IPCC is quite adamant in its conclusion that there are only two decades left before the window closes and we can avoid a dangerous climate change scenario.  That will of course impact not just the developing world but also Ireland.  That is why it is important that we enter the territory of decarbonisation as soon as we can, not just for the sake of the developing world.  I have indicated that it is already experiencing acute stress from climate change but we must also think of our own citizens, who will also in the medium and long term have to face the consequences of quite serious change in climate.</p></speech>

I went through some of the main concepts before Christmas and I will do so briefly again.  This process began with the Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and what we have seen in subsequent agreements is a focus on mitigation, such as reducing emissions; adaptation, such as making sure we become more resilient to the impacts, as Professor Sweeney indicated; and an increasing focus on climate finance, or how we can ensure that developing countries in particular can develop their economies in a low carbon fashion and become more resilient.</p>  <p>  Why was the Paris event so momentous or different?  Over the past five to ten years or so, there was extreme difficulty between countries in coming to a top-down agreement with a common medium-term emissions reduction commitment that would apply to everyone.  Paris was different and the basis of the agreement was that each country would make its own pledge.  It provides a framework for how these pledges will evolve.  These are national plans and in the Irish case, it will be done on an EU-level basis.  The EU has a 2030 commitment and we will come back to that.  The agreement must be implemented post-2020.  The treaty is not a sudden adequate solution but it provides a clear, binding common roadmap that we cannot ignore at an EU or national level.</p>  <p>  What are the key aspects of the agreement?  I mentioned some of these key elements before.  There is a clear long-term objective to where we are heading and a process for updating and increasing our commitments to reduce emissions.  We are not reducing those emissions for the sake of it but to protect human rights with the impacts that climate change will have in that respect.  As has been mentioned, there is also the issue of finance to assist developing countries in increasing their resilience so they can develop in a more sustainable fashion.  I will address these points in turn.</p>  <p>  Members can see in the document bullet points that paraphrase commitments in the agreement.  In terms of the long-term objective, it is clear that all states have a responsibility to act but this must be done on the basis of equity.  Those who are most responsible must take the lead.  That is the framework or guiding principle for the entire agreement and this objective.</p> <p>What is also very different about the Paris agreement, and members may have seen this in the news, is that there is now a clear reference to 1.5&deg; Celsius.  Smaller countries and low-lying states were very insistent that there should be a reference to countries pursuing efforts to limit this global warming increase to 1.5&deg;.  This is one of the key benchmarks against which our national pledges, which I mentioned previously, will be judged.  There is also a long-term commitment regarding what we are all working towards.  The language here is quite cumbersome, but basically our emissions must peak as soon as possible and we must achieve some sort of a balance, that is, the emissions we are producing will have to be balanced out in the second half of the century through, for example, forestry, bio-energy or carbon capture and storage.  The use of land to take in emissions in carbon capture and storage poses particular risks and we will come back to that later.</p> <p> Why do we focus so much on this reference to 1.5&deg; and why was it so important?  As Professor Sweeney has pointed out, we are currently on track for a 1&deg; increase, which is already causing significant difficulties.  Having 1.5&deg; in the agreement is important, because it is a type of shorthand for a global situation where the impacts of climate change can be managed.  However, as a result of the pledges I began with, we are currently on track for a 3&deg; increase, in other words, the very worst impacts of climate change.  To prevent that, we need to look closely at the processes for increasing ambition in the agreement.</p> <p> This ratcheting up of commitments applies directly to this EU pledge for 2030 and to our own national policy-making.  What I have laid out here are some of the key aspects of the increasing ambition process that is set out in the agreement.  Many NGOs would say this could be an awful lot stronger, but it is clear that countries will have to revise their commitments every five years.  All countries are going to come together in 2023 to examine what progress has been made.  There is also going to be a meeting in 2018 and in 2016 on our mitigation efforts.</p> <p> I said previously that the purpose of the agreement is not simply economic.  This is a key point.  The agreement addresses human rights directly in the preamble.  We would have preferred stronger language but there is some very good, clear language in the agreement.  It is positive that the right to health, rights of migrants, development, and gender equality must be taken into account when countries take action.  Equally, the agreement does not address economic protection of individual industries.  For example, when we look at food security, the focus is not simply on producing more food.  Experience has shown over the past 30 years or more that poverty is not addressed simply by producing more food.  It is a result of inequality.  It is an issue of access to food.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, and others have been very positive that food security is also referred to in the agreement, that the focus is on ending hunger and the vulnerabilities of food production to the impacts of climate change, as Professor Sweeney has mentioned, and also that when we are maintaining our food production, this must be in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.</p> <p> There are a range of provisions on climate finance in the agreement.  We would have preferred these to be stronger.  What is important is that the agreement makes clear that our investments and financial flows have to work in favour of climate action and not against it.  This will have implications for financial flows in countries.  Developed countries must continue to take the lead.  There is a pre-existing commitment that countries will work up to providing &euro;100 billion per annum by 2020.  This is interpreted as a floor that countries will come back to after 2020.  The important point here is that these climate finance commitments are also going to increase after 2020.  There are some gaps.  We would have preferred a clearer reference to new, innovative sources.  In other words, the onus should not simply be on the Exchequer to provide public funds.  Other means should also be used, such as a carbon tax.  For us, there is insufficient focus on adaptation and increasing resilience, but this can be addressed at EU and national level, which we will come back to.</p> <p> I will finish by linking up how this affects EU policy and bringing in this ratcheting process and the EU pledge I mentioned before.  It is fundamental that this reference to pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5&deg;, reaching a peak as soon as possible and achieving some sort of balance, changes the framework or the ambition at EU level.  The EU's pledge is on the basis of reducing emissions by at least 40% by 2030.  That is the overall EU commitment.  The Paris agreement means that this "at least" aspect of the commitment must be operationalised, that is, we must have efforts that go above and beyond the 40%.  In terms of how we will reduce emissions, what we need to see at EU level is a commitment to revise existing and proposed legislation in light of Paris and to enhance our 2020 reduction efforts.  Members might not know that the EU is, overall, already on track to meet its 2020 commitments and, in light of that and the Paris agreement, the EU needs to go beyond that.  There needs to be a focus on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and addressing land emissions effectively.  That means that if we take in carbon through forestry, for example, that should not mean we do less in energy or in transport.  Making a link to climate finance, subsidies that go to support fossil fuels need to phased out.  There needs to be a focus on grants for adaptation and increasing resilience and these moneys need to be new and additional.  I will leave it at that for Dr. Augustenborg to go through some of the recommendations at an Irish level.</p></speech>

I am just going to finish with a few slides on what Ireland's response is and needs to be as a result of the Paris agreement.  To set this in an international context, this week the World Economic Forum wrote a report on global risks.  It gathered more than 700 experts and identified failure to adapt and mitigate for climate change as one of the top three greatest potential threats to society.  Some more specific impacts that are related to climate change, such as impacts on water resources, migration and severe weather, were also identified as significant threats to society at the moment.</p>  <p>  Ireland's response to the EU regarding doing its fair share in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions reduction to date has generally been to argue that we are a special case.  One could say that every country has its special cases.  For example, Poland produces lots of coal and could also argue for a special case.  If we do that, none of us will achieve the targets set out in the Paris agreement.  We argue that Ireland should now be saying what we can do and what we are doing to meet that agreement, particularly since we are now accepting money from the EU to address flooding, which is related to climate change.  In a national context, we did achieve our Kyoto Agreement targets, primarily due to the recession, but we have not had a climate strategy since 2012.</p> <p>It is now well overdue.  We are at the bottom of the pack in our response to meeting our 2020 commitments.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has said that without serious policy implementation we will continue to struggle to meet our emission targets.  There are fines for non-compliance, so in addition to not doing our fair share, we face severe penalties for not doing it.<br/><br/>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 was passed in December and this set us on a trajectory to begin finally to make some action plans.  One of the powerful tools within the Act is the formation of a national advisory committee which was modelled on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  This committee could allow us to ensure any climate action plans we propose do in fact meet the Paris agreement.  The advisory committee was formed officially yesterday.  Our concern is that periodic reviews from that advisory council are only set to take place every 18 months.  We are expecting a national climate plan early in 2016 and we believe the advisory committee needs to advise the Government before a draft climate plan is put forward.  We urge the joint committee members to consider requesting a periodic review from the advisory committee now that it is officially formed.  Otherwise that advisory committee is essentially producing submissions after a draft is released and does not have as much power as it should exercise.<br/><br/>All Government policy, such as policy on transport and agriculture, and county development plans now needs to be reviewed in light of the fact that we are a party to the very ambitious goals of the Paris agreement.  We also need to ensure our mitigation plans, once the climate adaptation plan is officially approved, are not left on the long finger.  We need to begin immediately to meet this ambitious goal.<br/><br/>The energy sector is probably the most ambitious sector from which we could get the fastest wins in terms of reducing emissions.  A White Paper was published in December which sets out a good vision for decarbonising our energy sector, ideally by 2050.  The action that would yield the fastest results is to look at retrofitting our homes and our building stock to make them more energy efficient.  There is nothing to stop us saying that our energy standards will rise from the average of D1 to B1 by 2030.  Community ownership and co-ownership is key to the success of any strategies to reducing emissions and energy consumption.  We need a community energy strategy to bring on board community ownership.  We also desperately need a price for solar energy.  At present there is no pathway for communities, schools, farmers to sell solar energy to the national electricity grid.  Without that we cannot use alternative renewable energy such as solar energy in decarbonising the national grid.  We need to phase out fossil fuel use immediately.  This includes stopping the burning of coal at Moneypoint, and ceasing the subsidy on peat burning stations.  We have to stop the exploration for oil.  We also have to ban fracking.  To comply with the Paris agreement we simply cannot do these things any more.<br/><br/>This joint committee has a mandate to look at policy coherence and how our national policies match up with our goals in terms of overseas development.  I know Irish Aid is supposed to provide a report which this committee is supposed to review.  Climate change is one of the issues on which we need to ensure what we do nationally is coherent with what we do internationally.  One example of a risk to that is in the bioenergy sector.  We simply do not have enough land to produce the amount of biomass to meet bioenergy targets and therefore there is a risk that we will import biomass such as palm oil from other countries to meet the obligation.  Importing that kind of biomass has significant ecological impacts, such as deforestation, on other countries and it also threatens food security for those countries by taking land that is available for agriculture from those countries.  This committee needs to consider how our policies around climate action match up with our Irish Aid objectives.<br/><br/>Mr. Mac Evilly addressed the climate finance issue from a global perspective, but members may be aware that Ireland has only contributed &euro;2 million this year to the green climate fund as part of the Paris agreement.  When one views that contribution in terms of a <i>per capita</i>figure, it is equivalent to about 57 cent <i>per capita</i>from Ireland compared with the average of &euro;12<i>per capita</i>.  What we are offering is internationally embarrassing.  We need to offer a figure in the range of &euro;20 million to match the contribution of a country of our size, when one considers that Ireland produces some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions <i>per capita</i>in Europe and the world.  We desperately need to increase our contribution to the green climate fund.  We were told that a policy document on this would be brought to Cabinet in December and those of us who were in Paris and met the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, were also told that, as soon as he returned from Paris, he would be making an announcement on increasing our contribution to the green climate fund.  Neither of those things has happened.  This contribution is well overdue and we are at risk of international embarrassment if we do not address it soon.</p></speech>

At our meeting before Christmas members had the opportunity to state their opinions, so in the interest of getting the most out of this meeting, I ask members to confine their contributions to questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000006#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The key issue is fossil fuel, a topic on which the leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan, and others have spoken, and the fact that 80% of the oil that we know exists in the world today must remain in the ground.  What I have not seen from all the commitments that have been made is the commitment from the oil industry to allow that.  Ultimately profit is king.  Governments can make pledges but companies can continue to extract oil from the ground.  At present oil is cheap and there is no reason that companies will not continue to do that.  In essence no target will be met.  If we continue to burn fossil fuel, and there is no reason that it will not continue, then we will not meet the target in any shape or form.  Did the oil industry make any commitment to the Paris agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.259" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000006#E00400"><p>On a related question, the price of oil is falling rapidly.  Inevitably this means that there will be less research into alternatives and alternative energy sources become relatively much more expensive.  Much of this has happened since the Paris meeting.  All the indications are that oil will get cheaper.  What effect will this have on all the figures and the target?  Does it make what has been agreed almost irrelevant at this stage or is this a temporary phenomenon?  The indications are that it is not a temporary blip but a long-term phenomenon that oil prices will be low indefinitely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000006#E00500"><p>Were the witnesses surprised by the agreement that came out of the Paris meeting?  There had been suggestions that no leadership would be shown.  Do they think that the chairing of the meetings by the French was helpful?</p>  <p>  We have seen some of the disastrous consequences of climate change, such as the flooding in Ireland, but that pales in comparison with what is happening in less developed countries.  During our visit to Tanzania we visited a project in which Irish Aid was involved in training local people to train other local people to use less water and other resources when growing rice.</p> <p>The impressive point was that the rice output in some of those areas doubled.  Would the witnesses see that type of leadership - namely, getting local people to teach local people - as a role for Irish Aid in the future?</p> <p> It is widely accepted that the State will not reach the EU&rsquo;s 20-20-20 targets of a 20% reduction in emissions from the non-emissions-trading sectors.  What does the State need to do on this?  I am critical of this whole idea of developed states using the allowances of the least developed countries, LDCs, and trading emissions.  It is not doing anything for the planet and we are just codding ourselves.  Where do the witnesses see leadership coming from in the future after the Paris conference?  Would they be concerned about some of the outbursts from some of the US presidential candidates on global warming?  Several elections ago in this country, all political parties promised to be carbon-neutral, but we do not talk about that any more.  Is there a need for more awareness about this among the general public?</p> <p> Community energy projects are part of the answer, but people have to buy into them.  We have not been good at this.  What is the next step and what do we need to be doing over the next five and ten years on this?  Everyone is in favour of wind energy but no one wants a wind farm beside them.  Should we be locating these out at sea rather than beside people&rsquo;s homes?</p> <p> Fracking was also referred to.  One of the reasons oil prices are cheap is that it is an attempt to stop the development of this energy source.  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is coming down the tracks, along with the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, process which will allow companies to take on countries.  Is this a concern, particularly with fracking?  For example, Lone Pine Resources is aiming to sue the Canadian Government for $250 million in response to a moratorium placed on fracking in Quebec.</p> <p> Everyone is in favour of reforestation, but some of the regulations from the EU make it difficult for Coillte engage in it.  Is there a need for changes to the regulations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000007#F00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their contributions, which were detailed and in many ways scary.  Are we going to meet these heavy demands?  For example, will we be able to phase out fracking and oil and gas exploration?  One hears people arguing that we need to bring in as much oil as we can.  The Government is attacked for not issuing enough exploration licences.</p>  <p>  It is ironic that when Dublin City Council argued that it required additional water sources from the Shannon to secure the water supply to the city of Dublin, people campaigned against the proposal.  The reason I am highlighting that is that the delegates highlighted the fact that our summers are getting hotter and, therefore, continuity of water supply is vital.  Is there any argument against surplus waters being diverted from the Shannon to catchment areas, such as artificial lakes on the bogs of Offaly?</p>  <p>  Ireland is sensitive about agricultural production as it is a large sector in the economy.  We hear about the damaging environmental role that beef production plays in emissions.  Is there an argument that we can offset this?  There are balances between food and water security - the basics of life - and emissions.  Could intensive reforestation compensate for the negative aspects of cattle ranching?</p>  <p>  Obviously, human rights must be respected.  The development of gender equality, women&rsquo;s empowerment and intergenerational equality are important human rights issues.  How does the debate about climate change potentially impact gender equality, for example?</p></speech>

If we do not get that right, we will see increasing poverty and hunger.  What would the delegates identify as the most significant decision that came out of the Paris conference?  What was the most disappointing decision?  What decision, if it had been included, would have made the most difference?</p>  <p>  There was much disappointment that the recent climate Bill did not go far enough.  What do we need to do to bring it a stage further?</p>  <p>  At the centre of everything is policy coherence.  We are not paying enough attention to that because we are giving with one hand and taking with the other.  I attended a recent event at Trinity College Dublin looking at the aftermath of the Paris conference.  There is a need for rolling out that kind of meeting across Ireland.  We think climate change belongs to somebody else and that it does not affect us.  We do not see the implications of decisions we are making here on other places.  Are the various groups planning to come together to have that sort of awareness campaign throughout the country?</p>  <p>  What will be the effects of the outcome of the Paris conference on animal and plant life?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Sweeney" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2016012000007#F00400"><p>It is difficult to know where to start.  There have been so many questions that it would occupy a full college course on the topic.  I will do my best, however.</p>  <p>  The build-up to the Paris conference was the key to its success.  I attended the abortive 2009 Copenhagen conference but came away from it disillusioned, realising that it set us all back by seven years.  To get back on track for where we hoped to be after Copenhagen, there was a sense in the world community that it could not happen again that way in Paris in 2015.  Several matters conspired in getting the choreography right before Paris actually happened.  The first was the effort by the US President, Barack Obama, to forge an agreement with China.  That agreement was forged in the later stages of his presidency but it was one that took much of the sting out of any agreement that might be reached for the rest of the world.</p> <p>The second factor was the efforts of the Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, who has worked tirelessly over the past few years to bring world leaders together in the build up to Paris to ensure that an agreement was reached.  There were several summit meetings at the United Nations and he travelled throughout the world to meet on a one-to-one basis with many leaders to get them on side before Paris.<br/><br/>The third factor was the efforts of the French diplomatic system.  We were blessed here in Ireland by having a very active French ambassador who was himself a negotiator at Kyoto in his earlier days and who also worked actively behind the scenes within the Irish system here.  As part of a large scale effort in the global sense, the French diplomatic system worked very hard.  President Hollande visited most of the key people at least once over the course of the previous year.<br/><br/>The fourth factor, which was quite influential behind the scenes, was the Papal Encyclical, <i>Luadato si'</i>.  Here was something which was written in plain English, which was not overburdened by theology but which could actually bring the message home to people in a very effective way.  It has had a profound background effect on many of the political figures around the world since its publication in June.<br/><br/>All of this set the scene for a conference which one sensed would be different right away when one arrived in Paris.  The mood was different from all the other COPs I have attended.  There was a feeling that an agreement would emerge and so it did.  After the third day of the second week, the optimism dissipated briefly when things went down on paper and negotiators did not see their pet projects appearing, but the process was resurrected and quite a considerable framework agreement was achieved.  That is the important point today.  It is a framework agreement which puts the ball back in countries' courts.  It is up to countries now to live up to the obligations they made.<br/><br/>I can address a couple of the other points briefly.  The point Deputy Eric Bryne raised about the River Shannon was a very valid one.  It brings home to us the consequences at a local level of what is happening at a global level.  To provide a snippet of scientific research published by the UK Met Office in December, it estimated that the probability of a ten-day extreme rainfall event such as the UK had experienced had increased seven-fold as a result of the loading of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.  The research was based on a very comprehensive modelling effort.  It brings home to us the fact that we face a greatly increased hazard.  There are adaptation responses we can make to that.  The Deputy is right that we can with judicious planting reduce flood hazard in some places.  With judicious planting of forest, we can gain some sequestration of carbon which will help us with our obligations in the future.  We have to be very careful where we plant new forests, however.  If we plant them in carbon rich soils and remove the carbon from that soil as a consequence, we are actually undoing some of the benefits we would otherwise achieve.  It has to be done with a very careful policy in mind.<br/><br/>In terms of farming, the farmers of Ireland are among those I admire most in the country.  They are excellent farmers and stewards of the landscape.  We have to face the idea of rewarding them by putting some of the single farm payment towards farmers who are willing to let lands close to the Shannon flood in the winter time to allow that reservoir of water to be stored for a while rather than to run down the river to flood high amenity urban land elsewhere.  We need thinking out of the box on how we manage the area around the Shannon.  It has been a bugbear as we know for almost a century at this stage, but there are options available.<br/><br/>In terms of what we should be doing and what we would we do not like about the Paris agreement, the most significant decision was the ratcheting effect.  That is the effect whereby every five years a country must come back with increased efforts.  That may not sound all that bad now but if it is implemented and one multiplies it by ten, 15 or 20 years, it will mean getting to grips with the problem.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing for me was the absence of shipping and aviation from the agreement.  Those very powerful interest groups managed to get themselves excluded.  If one adds up the emissions from shipping and aviation globally, they account today for the combined emissions of the UK and Germany.  It is a very substantial loss.  We hope that the aspirations and commitments they made to tighten up their emissions and avoid burning high sulphur and heavy fuel oil where it is unnecessary will begin to produce results in that area.<br/><br/>Oil prices are a problem as Deputy Olivia Mitchell was saying.  It is a two-edged problem.  As oil prices fall, fertilizer costs for the developing world will also fall so that some farmers in developing countries will benefit considerably from their ability to farm more efficiently.  For some of the large developing countries like India and Brazil, it may be more of a problem and it may well be that they would prefer higher oil prices.  We have to think about how we are going to spend the taxation from energy in that situation of falling oil prices.  Should we ring-fence more of it towards encouraging renewable energy for example?<br/><br/>I was asked what I would change in the climate legislation.  The awareness issue raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is very important.  The budget for climate awareness in the last five years has been very small indeed and not much has been spent to enhance climate awareness in Ireland apart from initiatives like the encouragement of the green schools system.  I would like to see more of that.  Responsibility and policy coherence are critical here.  I would have hoped that responsibility for the climate change Bill would have been taken by the Department of the Taoiseach rather than left to individual silos to fight their corners individually.  That has been a bugbear which has affected progress on mitigation over the last few years.<br/><br/>I was asked about animals and plants.  We tend to forget about biodiversity.  The person who asked the question was right.  The Papal encyclical was actually very strong on the point that we share the planet with other organisms and have no right to render them extinct to suit our own needs.  It is a very valid ethical point which we have to take cognisance of.<br/><br/>I have talked enough and should pass on to someone else at this point.</p></speech>

I will just go through a few questions.  Senator Daly made the point that oil needed to stay in the ground.  Obviously, it does.  We need to see more from the companies involved, but ultimately the obligations that are there are on states.  As such, the question is how we move beyond that.  States need to examine their own investments in fossil fuel companies.  This issue of subsidies for fossil fuels also needs to be addressed and we need more incentives for renewable energies.  Similarly, fossil fuel companies will have less opportunity to operate where choices for renewable energy are made.  It links back in with some of the recommendations Cara made.</p>  <p>  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is another big concern for Tr&oacute;caire.  There is a concern that fracking of gas in the United States in combination with the TTIP agreement could lead to an increase in gas exports to the EU and, similarly, to an increase in fossil fuel use.  The two other main concerns in regard to the TTIP, without getting too technical, involve first, a dispute mechanism to arbitrate decisions under the TTIP which explicitly excludes states and national judicial systems.  There is an element of disenfranchisement there in that states would not have a role in arbitrating on those agreements.  Similarly, the TTIP will also impact on the ability of countries to incentivise their own indigenous industries.  That is of particular concern in regard to renewables.</p> <p>I was also asked about the potential for forestry to be used to offset some of our emissions.  I know there are already plans to significantly increase forestry in Ireland.  It is important to clarify that although such an approach would be worthwhile, it would not be a silver bullet.  It would not entirely offset the increases that are going on at the moment.  Reductions in emissions across all sectors, including energy, transport, agriculture and housing, would still be required.  Reductions would need to take place even with an increase in forestry.  Such an increase would be worthwhile nonetheless.</p> <p> Deputy Eric Byrne asked about the impact on human rights and on food security.  Obviously, in the national context we are concerned about Irish exports.  We would make the point that Irish meat and dairy products are not providing food security in the developing world because they are aimed at middle-class customers.  Regarding the human rights impacts of climate change, I will explain in a little detail why we would see the effects of climate as only being human in nature.  Some 2.8 million people in Malawi are currently in need of food.  One of the main effects of climate change in the developing world is a reduction in crop yields.  This is where the whole food security issue comes into play.  We need to consider how we can support small-scale farmers to produce food in a more resilient fashion.  I noted quite a long list of human rights protections in the agreement.  I will explain why they are important by taking the issue of gender as an example.  It is widely shown that women are more likely to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change.  It affects their efforts to grow and produce food, for example.  Intergenerational equity is also an issue.  The point is well made in the encyclical that future generations will bear the brunt of this to a greater extent than current generations.</p> <p> I will conclude by responding to a couple of other points.  I would say the commitment to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5&deg; is the most significant thing in the agreement.  It means that the analysis being done by the advisory committee, and the policies coming out of the mitigation plan in the Bill, must be directed towards meeting the goal set out in the Paris agreement.  We could point out a variety of shortcomings within the agreement, but we would say it provides a start.  I fully support Deputy O'Sullivan's point about the need for some sort of climate gathering to be broadened out throughout the country.  The only way to get more buy-in is to ensure communities become more engaged.  We would make the same point with regard to the election.  While it can be difficult for citizens and candidates to raise the issue of climate change, they can express support for sustainable policies and policies that have co-benefits, such as the retrofitting of houses, which was mentioned by Dr. Augustenborg.</p></speech>

A question was asked about leadership at the Paris conference.  The most surprising thing for me was the leadership shown by China in securing the agreement.  Many people have credited China with making it happen at the 11th hour.  When I have given public talks since I came back from Paris, I have said that we are in a unique situation as a transition generation.  Just as we have witnessed the transition from paper to the Internet, we are now witnessing part of the transition from the fossil fuel-driven society that started with the industrial revolution to a society that relies completely on renewable energy.  This provides an opportunity for leadership to be shown by everyone, including governmental and community interests.  I see leadership happening at a number of levels.  I see it as a big election issue, as suggested by Deputy Crowe.  I know that Eamon Ryan has proposed a potential debate on this specific issue.  This would allow people to show leadership on it.</p>  <p>  The targets that will have to be met seem highly ambitious and in some ways impossible.  We are making a lot of strides in energy, as I explained previously.  Community ownership is part of that.  We know that bioenergy is best used when combined heat and power plants are locally owned.  People in places like Cloughjordan have demonstrated this by buying wood chip from local farmers, thereby keeping the money in the local economy, keeping the system closed and ensuring there is no dependence on foreign imports.  There are opportunities we can build on.  We can grow and expand out.  There are opportunities for creative financing through credit unions.  Communities could come together to invest in solar panels, etc.</p>  <p>  I did not talk about transport because the transport sector has really not addressed greenhouse gas emission reductions.  It has focused instead on reducing congestion.  The development of the Grand Canal cycle path, which was led by the National Transport Authority, is an example of best practice.  It shows where we should be going with cycling in this country.  We need to get people out of their cars and onto safe cycle paths.  We can also look at places like Sweden, which is replacing its entire bus fleet with vehicles powered by biofuels from ethanol.  We could look at replacing our own bus fleet.  I am aware that Dr. Jerry Murphy of University College Cork has done a great deal of research into how Ireland could replace its bus fleet with buses powered by livestock waste from slaughterhouses, etc.  We have opportunities to look at examples of such changes.</p>  <p>  It is much harder to reduce emissions from agriculture.  The recent flooding showed that being narrowly focused on one sector of industry, such as beef or dairy, is putting farmers at risk with respect to future climate.  It is going to get harder for them to do those kinds of things.  We need to look at diversifying to protect us from those risks.  I will give some examples.  Opportunities exist in the agri-forestry sector, which allows farmers to plant trees while continuing to farm in other ways between those trees.  We should encourage farmers to start contributing to the renewable energy market through solar and biomass schemes.  This would give farmers an opportunity to diversify their income sources.  A fantastic study, Green Plan Ireland, which has been published by Professor David Connolly in Denmark, shows that we could completely decarbonise our society by 2050 and create 100,000 new jobs in this country as a result.  There are a number of co-benefits to making that transition too.</p>  <p>  I will put my scientist's hat on for a minute while I reply to Deputy O'Sullivan's comments regarding the impacts on animal and plant life.</p></speech>

I was delayed due to weather conditions.  I wish to respond to what was said about the need for farmers to diversify.  Our grass-based system makes dairy and beef our primary outputs.  It is not that easy to diversify while still making an income.  I think it is often lost in the debate that we have very sustainable food production systems.  If food production in Ireland or in Europe was to be significantly reduced, food would be brought in from less sustainable systems elsewhere.  This would add to the whole emissions problem.  I think our approach to livestock, dairy and beef gives us particular advantages in this area.  I understand why farmers are reluctant to diversify away from that approach.</p></speech>

It is also true that our farmers engage in efficient and good stewardship of the land.  We need to consider whether the business model being employed is the most sustainable one for the future.  We are putting all our eggs in the basket of powdered milk for China at present.  That might not be too wise from an ethical perspective or in terms of our future economic potential.</p> <p>As Dr. Augustenborg was saying, we must examine opportunities for diversification and moving up the value chain in agriculture rather than simply moving up the volume chain.  We must recognise that all sectors of society will have to bear their share of the cost of tackling climate change.  Some sectors bear more than others at present but all sectors will ultimately have to bear their share.  With agriculture currently accounting for approximately one third of our non-ETS emissions, it will be recognised that further intensification and expansion of the herd can only be achieved at the cost of applying the polluter-pays principle in some shape or form.</p></speech>

I reiterate our commitment to serving rural Ireland and connecting the people in these communities with the wider network.  As the biggest provider of rural transport in the country, almost 10,000 people help to deliver our services every day.  We are proud to be associated with the provision of jobs in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  As is any service industry, we are very reliant on our employees, whose dedication and commitment is among the highest In Ireland.  More than 80% of our staff are customer facing, and last year we were very proud to be recognised by the Reputation Institute as having the 42nd best reputation in the country.  We had the second biggest increase in placing among the top 100 companies in Ireland.  This is entirely down to the attitude, commitment and competence of our people, who went to extraordinary lengths again during recent weather events to keep the travelling public connected in most of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Bus &Eacute;ireann had almost 80,000 passenger trips, including those by school-going children.  This demonstrates the critical role our organisation plays as part of the social and economic fabric of Ireland.  In 2015, we successfully completed the first year of a new five year direct award contract with the NTA, and began a number of projects under that contract which will bring enhanced customer service standards and technology improvements to the business.  We secured funding for 116 new vehicles, which we launched last week.  These will bring higher capacity and comfort to our customers.  Our network improvements and marketing helped to deliver 700,000 extra passenger journeys, and we increased our focus on the customer, setting up a new customer care facility, beginning work on Colbert station in Limerick and reinforcing our commitment to safety above all, through a new school transport campaign aimed at raising seat belt awareness among young children.</p> <p>All of these initiatives underpin our ambition to be recognised as progressive and deliver on our mission, which is to succeed by providing an excellent service to the public.</p> <p> Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway network is a separate commercial service that receives no State funding.  Our fleet livery is familiar, as one sees the big red coaches traversing the country.  The Expressway network comprises 23 inter-regional routes which operate throughout the country, linking cities and population hubs, and must generate its own funds for necessary investment in fleet, customer service, technology improvements and marketing.</p> <p> The environment in which we operate these Expressway services has become increasingly competitive, comprising a significant number of other coach companies.  In addition, customers from bigger population centres demand faster journey times with fewer stops, more use of the motorway network and more direct connections to larger population centres.  We have seen new licences granted for routes, and this issue is a matter of utmost concern for our board and management.  The NTA now performs a difficult role with regard to licence issuing and connectivity of the network.  We assist it when necessary, when routes are being designed or realigned, but ultimate responsibility for ensuring connectivity among all of the public transport alternatives now rests with the NTA, and not with Bus &Eacute;ireann, since our legal roles changed in 2009.</p> <p> As Bus &Eacute;ireann operates more than 300 city and stage carriage routes under public contract with the NTA, we connect thousands of locations and customers on a daily basis, ensuring city and rural stage carriage services are dovetailed with Expressway and other public transport services where it is possible to do so, providing a vast integrated bus and coach network throughout Ireland.</p> <p> Having addressed the committee last March, we worked closely with the NTA and a solution was provided for the towns affected by our commercial decision to withdraw from Expressway route 5, from Waterford to Dublin through Wicklow, and to curtail our Expressway route 7, originally from Dublin to Cork through Clonmel.  The network solution involved a redesign of our public service routes 132 in Wicklow and 245 between Cork and Mitchelstown, both of which are operated under subsidy as part of our public service contract.  These routes, together with some integrated connections provided by Local Link, which is the rural transport scheme contracted by the NTA and provided under subsidy, perform a role to ensure the people in these communities remain connected.  In this example, the transition from the non-commercial segments of Expressway to public service obligation, PSO, services, has been successful and the subsidisation required is now more prudently aligned with the customer demand in these smaller towns and villages, and not left to our Expressway business to shoulder.</p> <p> Expressway cannot afford to endlessly provide service on routes which will never deliver a financial contribution and this is a fundamental tenet of being commercial on our inter-regional and intercity services.  As part of this decision-making ethos in recent years, difficult decisions were necessary and our Expressway services were withdrawn from approximately 20% of secondary locations where customer demand did not exist or did not cover the costs of providing the Expressway service.  That said, through working with the NTA we assure the committee there has been no widespread loss of services to rural locations as a result of the decisions we have made.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland, and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network.</p> <p> We previously advised the committee that Bus &Eacute;ireann has been in survival mode in recent years.  The company worked its way out of the recession and remains committed to work with its stakeholders to deliver the best possible transport system, in an efficient and effective manner given the funds available.  The pace of economic recovery requires increased public transport levels, and this will require support to foster social and economic inclusion.  With regard to PSO services provided under contract to the NTA, we are pleased there is recognition emerging that the PSO subvention to operate the levels of PSO service requires more funding.  In 2015, we made substantial progress on developing our services in conjunction with the NTA, and we have seen substantial growth in passenger numbers in the markets we provide.  We recently received an additional allocation for 2015, which covered the cost of the services.  We have been advised that the level of funding in 2016 will match our costs and we await final confirmation on the capital side.  We will submit our own application for the 10% of our services being tendered as part of the PSO market opening later this year.</p> <p> I shared our concerns regarding the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages during our visits to this forum in 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2015.  I also advised that changes to a number of our commercial Expressway intercity routes were required to ensure their survival.  Nothing has changed in this regard, and, in fact, competition on Expressway routes has increased.</p> <p>With competition increasing, we must continue to ensure the Expressway service is as cost efficient as possible.  The reversal of the 18-month cost-saving agreement with our staff came to an end in 2014 and, taken together with the work stoppage in May of last year, this affected the bottom line and had a very serious impact on our profitability last year.  Expressway broke even in 2014.  Despite savings achieved through various changes, we will be in loss in 2015, which adds financial pressure to our concern.</p> <p> The board and the management team are committed to examining ways in which to reduce costs to deliver the profitability necessary to secure a viable future for Expressway.  This business requires investment in customer service, fleet, marketing and innovation, and we must create an efficient and cost-effective business model to achieve this.  The matter was discussed at the recent Bus &Eacute;ireann board meeting and the management team has been tasked with bringing a comprehensive strategic plan for Expressway to the board as quickly as possible and to keep the board appraised of progress.  As a company, if we do not make changes and consequently lose the flexibility to respond to the licensing environment which continues to unfold, Expressway will go out of business and jobs will be lost.</p> <p> I reiterate that Bus &Eacute;ireann is very much committed as a company to rural Ireland and stands ready to provide the most relevant services for ongoing connectivity across our network given the financial resources available.  Expressway is part of the wider national integrated network but it still operates in a small economy with a high rural constituency.  Our focus as a management team is on preserving and growing Expressway which delivers a significant social dividend to the State through the provision of services not otherwise provided to many regional locations.  We will continue to work in a collaborative and inclusive way with our employees to ensure Expressway is put on a sustainable footing but we must also act to protect the future interests of all stakeholders in this business in a market which has become increasingly competitive.</p></speech>

I understand the joint committee wishes to focus on two areas in particular, first, the interurban and Expressway commercial bus services and, second, the co-ordination of rural transport services with the Expressway network.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions, I am joined by Tim Gaston who manages public transport services in the authority.<br/><br/>Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I wish to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority.  The remit of the National Transport Authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  These include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.<br/><br/>The authority is responsible for securing the provision of public bus services through two specified mechanisms: public service contracts where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis and the licensing of public bus services which are operated on a commercial basis.  In licensing commercial bus services, it is important to note that the relevant legislation requires the authority to seek to achieve, in the public interest, regulated competition in the provision of such services.<br/><br/>On the specific areas of focus raised by the committee, bus services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann under its Expressway brand are commercial services and are licensed by the authority in exactly the same manner as all other commercial bus services.  Licences set out the nature of the service and conditions under which licensed public bus passenger services must operate, such as the point of origin and destination as well as timetable and stopping place details<b>.</b>The majority of interurban services, including those between the regional cities and Dublin city and Dublin Airport, are provided on a commercial basis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and a number of private operators provide these services which are licensed by the authority.<br/><br/>In exercising its functions, the authority seeks to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus or transport mode, or both, is required.  This includes the operation of rural transport services, operated as Local Link, which can facilitate connecting to mainline interurban services, irrespective of the provider of those services, and including, but not limited to, Expressway.  The objective of the rural transport programme is to provide a good quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  In 2015, funding of &euro;10.7 million was provided through the authority for the programme.</p> <p> The rural transport programme came under the aegis of the authority in April 2012.  The programme was initially managed by Pobal on behalf of the authority but since January 2014 is now directly managed by the authority.  A restructuring strategy was launched in July 2013.  Since assuming responsibility, we have focused on restructuring the programme to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness.  The restructuring programme included the establishment of 17 transport co-ordination units which replaced the 35 rural transport groups previously managing the programme.  Local passenger services are managed by the relevant transport co-ordination unit in each area on the authority's behalf.  This restructuring has positioned the programme to better integrate with other public transport services, and provides a solid base to expand or adapt services to meet current and future identified needs.</p> <p> Now that the organisational restructuring has been completed, we are focused on optimising the services provided within the funding envelope available.  A review of services is currently in progress to ensure that they are meeting user requirements and our objectives.  </p> <p> Transport co-ordination units work closely with the local authorities on the assessment of local transport needs, including those people who are socially excluded.  With the benefit of this local collaboration, we expect to make considerable progress in 2016 on refining and expanding, where appropriate, the operation of local transport services, in addition to ensuring the optimal level of integration with the other public transport services.</p> <p> That concludes my introductory presentation.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan indicated that the service made a loss in 2015.  I understand the accounts for 2015 have not been fully prepared but will he indicate the scale of the projected losses and the impact this will have in 2016?  Does Mr. Nolan think that Bus &Eacute;ireann will be able to bring its cost structure in line with its revenues for 2016 or is the company projecting a loss by the Expressway service for the year?  In his presentation, Mr Nolan states that the company operates in an increasingly competitive environment with ever-expanding activity on some of the routes.  I would have hoped that the increase in passenger activity would have helped to address some of the increased competition but clearly that is not the case.  Will he elaborate on the nature of the competitive environment in which the service operates?  Has saturation point been reached on some routes?  Is the competition that is required under legislation reaching a point where it is making it difficult for all concerned to survive on certain routes?  Obviously, there are wider implications in a competitive environment because it could ultimately lead to a deterioration in services.  We know what happens when the point of saturation is reached, namely, it effectively becomes a race to the bottom and the service is diminished.  The customer is the obvious loser in the long term.  My concern, based on what Mr. Nolan said, is that we may be at the start of the road to that ultimate outcome.  I would like Mr. Nolan to address this matter.</p>  <p>  I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.  I have had the opportunity to discuss with the NTA on a number of occasions the very good work it does in attempting to put in place a national plan for the delivery of public transport services, both in terms of the licensing remit and managing the public service obligation element.  What criteria are in place to ensure that the issuance of licences will not result in an over-saturation of a particular market to the point where it will not be financially viable for operators to survive?</p> <p>Often, one can let the market decide and try to pick up the pieces thereafter.  This is a regulated environment, after all.  The witnesses do not need me to tell them about the requirement to try to ensure there is a viable market, as opposed to a predatory approach that would ultimately lead to a race to the bottom.  What kinds of checks and balances are in place?  What type of testing is done?  What advice do the witnesses have for the Legislature?  What should operators like Mr. Nolan do to ensure this eventuality does not arise?</p></speech>

As we have been here many times, there is no point in going back over our history.  We have made our points about what way the market will develop.  The legislation and the market are in place and licences are being issued.  We are now reacting to those licences and anticipating licences that will be issued in the future.  We are drawing up our plan.  We intend to get back on path in 2016 or early 2017.  We will discuss that with our stakeholders and staff in the first instance.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has been competing in this market since the 1970s and 1980s.  It has always been competitive to a degree and that is increasing.  We will get back there.  We have many advantages.  We have added some new vehicles to our fleet, we have invested in new technology and passenger numbers are growing on many of our routes.  New competition is posing challenges on other routes where licences have been issued.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that 50% of Bus &Eacute;ireann's revenue stream comes from the school transport services, 25% of it comes from the PSO-operated routes on behalf of the NTA and 25% of it comes from the Expressway service.  All of those figures are approximate.  It is clear that a commercial operation which is not in a profitable position needs to be addressed quickly.  That is why we have asked the executive to come up with a very comprehensive strategic plan, which we will discuss in a collaborative fashion with our stakeholders, particularly our employees and their representatives, to ensure we have a route to continued profitability and sustainability for the Expressway network into the future.  This is an important element of the matter.  We have invested heavily in new coaches.  We do not use second-hand coaches on our network.  We have invested heavily to ensure our branding is clear and easily distinguished to attract as many consumers to our product as possible.  With regard to competition, I accept that we are in a very competitive environment.  We provide just 18% of the services on the Dublin-Limerick route, for example.  That gives the Deputy an indication of the level of competition we face.  We are facing that competition in a very positive fashion.  We believe there is a strong future for Expressway.</p></speech>

The backbone of its network across the State allows people to connect at various locations.  Much of the competition is coming from point-to-point services.  There is no doubt that competition is good.  It has certainly improved the service provided by the company.  If competition continues - I will not say "unabated" - to a point at which Bus &Eacute;ireann's main services are no longer competitive or are no longer able to be provided, consumers will lose their ability to interconnect with Bus &Eacute;ireann's other services.  Obviously, this is something that concerns me.</p></speech>

We honour those passes and we provide services in the connecting towns and so on.  That is a kind of a hidden piece.  We have to be conscious that it does not come as direct revenue into our stream.  In light of our background as a complete network provider across rural areas in the previous situation - that function is now with the NTA - we are conscious of and understand the market very clearly.  I refer particularly to the connectivity piece.</p> <p>That is why our brand strapline is "making good connections".  We understand that.  We wish to provide that level of service and interconnectivity.  Clearly, we have to do it against the competitive background in which we find ourselves.</p></speech>

It is a requirement in the legislation that we should have a regulated competitive environment here.  We are very careful with every single licence application we get.  I remind the committee that applications come into us from third parties.  We consider each one carefully to identify its overall impact.  We consider whether it will be beneficial for all transport users along the relevant corridor.  We consider whether it will affect the public service obligation, PSO, service, if that is a factor.  Many balancing items have to be taken into account.  Nobody can say they get it right all the time, but we believe that, on the whole, we have struck a balance that reflects where the legislation is meant to bring us.  Perhaps my colleague, Mr. Gaston, would like to expand on that.</p></speech>

We recognise that not everyone gets it right all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Gaston" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012000008#N00600"><p>Every application we receive for a new licence or a licence amendment is treated in the same way.  Rather than failing to renew licences, we apply the same set of tests and criteria, as mentioned in a question that was asked earlier.  We ascertain the level of demand or potential demand on the relevant corridor for an increase in public transport activity on the back of the relevant licence.  We apply those tests to all licences that are issued to Bus &Eacute;ireann, commercial operators and other operators.  That is what the legislation requires us to do.  We have to take account of the demand or the potential demand for services.  We refuse licences from time to time.  We occasionally have discussions with the operators involved to discuss whether their licences might complement services that are operating in certain corridors if they applied to different times of the day or the week.  We would argue that we have the numbers to illustrate that we have been able to increase the total public transport market by means of controlled and regulated competition.  There are many examples of corridors where we have chosen not to continue to grant licences or amendments because we believe they are adequately provided for.  We have taken both actions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1180" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012000008#N00700"><p>I thank Mr. Nolan and Mr. Creegan for their presentations.  I would like to begin by asking about the issue of school runs.  How often are the routes reviewed?  I recently met the family of a five year old boy in respect of whom an application was made in advance of his starting school.  They were told he would be on the bus route and they made the relevant payment, but when they went to the private provider, they were told he would have to be picked up a kilometre up the road.  Obviously, a five year old boy is not going to walk that far.  His mother feels that if she has to put him into the car, she might as well drive him to school.  When we did a bit of investigating, we found that a private coach operator had been hired by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Obviously, this operator must take the route it has been told to take.  The members of the boy's family did their own investigation and provided a new route, which is safe, is a kilometre shorter and goes past their door.  They asked for this to be looked at, but their request was not even addressed.  I wonder how often the routes are reviewed.  If a solution is found, as it was in this instance, can it be looked at or are these matters set in stone?</p>  <p>  Obviously, as Deputy Dooley has said, the witnesses have a very difficult job.  People are happy with express routes because they want to get to or from work, but such routes often leave out people in smaller towns who want to get connected.  Mr. Nolan gave an example of a case in which a solution was found by looking at other routes and rearranging them.  Is that being done for all the routes that have been changed?  For example, the 115 route between Dublin and Mullingar used to cover the area between Dunboyne and Summerhill in County Meath, but four locations - Moynalvey, Culmullen, Kilcloon and Baytown - are now excluded and the people in those places feel they are being left out.  Do the witnesses review cases like that?  Do they look to see what other services might be provided for the people of such areas?</p>  <p>  How are the prices for the various routes decided?  I would have regularly travelled from Navan to Dublin when I was younger and when I was in college.  I know that a one-way ticket from Navan to Dublin now costs more than &euro;11, whereas one could travel a lot further down the country for a lot less.</p> <p>Is it decided on the basis of proximity or the number of people who use the route?  How is it arrived at?</p> <p> If a new bus stop is being sought on a route, what are the requirements?  We have a number of requests in Navan where a service is required.  How can people apply for that and how is it decided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-20a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Nolan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2016012000009#O00200"><p>On the Navan route, we do that under contract to the NTA so both of us will come in on that.</p>  <p>  We review school routes constantly.  We carry out a major review every summer when sixth years go out and first years come in.  On the question of a five-year old child having to walk 1 km, I would probably be concerned about that myself.  In general, we try to pick up primary school children as close to their homes as possible.  We also have pick-up points for post-primary students.  If the Deputy gives me the details, I will examine the specific case.</p>  <p>  There have been changes on the 115 route in conjunction with the NTA.  We review all of these routes constantly where there are changes on them.  There are regular meetings at which we go through the routes.  We have gone through that specific route with the NTA.  The NTA also comes to us with its changes and Mr. Tim Gaston will come in on that.  Prices are all agreed with the NTA.  In general, it depends on the number of people on the route and the distance they are from the location.  On the Navan route, there is a great deal of peak time travel.  It is more expensive to put peak time travel in when there is a lack of business during the day.  On Expressway or intercity routes, there is business all day.  On the Navan route, however, the peaks decide the level of service put in place.</p></speech>

The town is quite close to Dublin but the prices are a lot higher than would be the case if one was travelling to Galway or Sligo.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to network reviews.  We have a group within the NTA whose sole purpose is to review the networks continually.  We are taking on board comments being made in respect of the entire range of issues.  As well as detailed discussion with Bus &Eacute;ireann and looking at the bus loadings, we also take account of what other local provision there is in the area.  With the NTA also having responsibility for rural transport, we are working increasingly to dovetail the services.  As such, where a PSO operates or changes are introduced prior to that, we will discuss it with local transport co-ordination unit management to see and ensure that communities continue to be served.  As such, networks are being reviewed on a regular basis and the two teams - our own and Bus &Eacute;ireann's - meet on a very regular basis to see where we can bring about improvements.  Improvements are not really driven by the bottom line either.  They are actually about providing a better service through the day, through the week, through the time of day and in terms of the geography.  Of course, we have to take account of changes in geography and the community.  It is very much an ongoing process.  If there are specific queries members want us to address, they should let us know and we will come back to them on those.</p>  <p>  Fares for public service obligation services are determined by the authority.  Again, we engage in detailed discussions with operators and model - in advance of a determination - the fare increases to see if they are appropriate and what will be the fare adjustment.  We are in the middle of an exercise involving a number of areas of the country to see if we can move towards a more equitable fares basis nationally.  It is a difficult challenge to meet, of course, and it is something that it will take a number of years to put in place.  If one looks at our fares determination issued last year, one will see that in some areas there were very small increases as we are setting about rebalancing fares.  It is something we look at very closely with the operators.  While we look at the loadings, fares in Ireland are based, by and large, on distance.  Within the eastern region, there is a zoning arrangement with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Since we have rolled out the Leap card in the eastern region, significant discounts have been available to those who choose to use them to travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann and other services.</p></speech>

As such, &euro;11 is the upper end of the scale.  Anyone who uses the bus regularly can do so much more cheaply on a monthly or yearly product basis or by using a Leap card.</p></speech>

It is heartening to see that the number of passengers has increased by 700,000.  Do we have a target for how much we want to increase those numbers?  It was stated that there was a loss in 2015 but the numbers are increasing.  Where will the 116 new vehicles be concentrated?  While they are all wheelchair accessible, how does it leave the fleet in terms of wheelchair accessibility?  I am not sure if we are up to 100% and I would like the witnesses to give us an idea of where we are in relation to that very important issue.</p>  <p>  The last time the witnesses were in, we talked about routes 5 and 7 and the serious effects on the local communities.  There were direct connections through private transport.  The witnesses are saying now that the agreement that has been reached there has helped.  Can it be explained because I was not following it too well and would just like to get my head around how much of an impact it has had?  We had a lot of complaints from people in the communities along the routes.</p>  <p>  Tendering for some of the routes was mentioned.  I remember that when we argued about this before, the Government was talking about putting 10% out to tender.  However 100% of Bus &Eacute;ireann routes in Waterford was mentioned.  If we are going to tender those and will give up 100%, what are we aiming to do in Waterford?  I would like to know what we are trying to do.  Is it the intention to privatise that whole section or is Bus &Eacute;ireann going to tender for the service also?  I would like that to be explained to me because I find it a bit contradictory.</p>  <p>  Have there been huge savings in fuel costs?  I would have thought that there would have been massive savings with the way fuel prices have gone which would have helped in terms of targets.  The Minister tells us that the PSO is remaining the same.  When I was reading some of this earlier, I noted that there were to be changes in the PSO for Kerry and Mayo.  Those are planned to be implemented in the near future.  How will that impact on those areas?  Will the changes affect services and will there be cutbacks in some of the routes?  Will the routes be more direct?</p>  <p>  Can the witnesses explain how the community has an input in all of this?  Do people go out to talk to the community?  What way is it done?  I know there were meetings on routes 5 and 7.  When it is intended to do something new and areas are being considered, is there direct contact with the community?</p></speech>

Passenger numbers on the PSO side have been very good in the last number of years, but it has been patchy in some areas.  There is more growth in Dublin and Cork than in rural Ireland.  The provincial cities grew by 4% last year and Cork alone is up by 8% or 9% in the last couple of months.  We anticipate similar growth this year.  The vehicles that are coming in will be deployed across the whole network, but there are specific places that require additional capacity.  We are putting additional double-deck vehicles into Cork and taking out single-deck vehicles.  There will be additional capacity around the greater Dublin area given what has happened in terms of congestion.  We need to put a bit of capacity in there in conjunction with the NTA.</p>  <p>  We are 100% wheelchair accessible at this stage and well ahead of most of Europe on that, which is very pleasing.</p> <p>There are no losses on the public service obligation services, but Bus &Eacute;ireann has made losses on the commercial services.  There is a distinction between commercial and PSO services.  The intercity service is commercial and must always come back to profit.  We will bring it back to profit.  I ask Mr. Tim Gaston to speak on routes 5 and 7.</p></speech>

We buy both the dollar and fuel forward.  At present we have bought it at about &euro;1.20.  We bought at that price when the price at the pumps was &euro;1.50 so it was a very good deal but the cost of fuel has now gone down to &euro;1.10 or even a little lower.  We have bought all our fuel for the next 18 months.  We are looking 18 months out in the market.  In general, the market does not give those type of prices 12 to 18 months in advance.  There will be some reduction in the cost of fuel, but the price is very low price compared to the price at the pumps.  There will be some reduction in the price of fuel as time goes on.</p></speech>

It is correct that there were a number of public consultation meetings and representations were made to us, to Bus &Eacute;ireann and to others at the time.  We organised a number of discussions and then reviewed the entire network requirements in those immediate areas.  We came in with a package of services that would deliver to the communities that were being impacted on by the withdrawals.  There were three main ways by which we delivered.  We modified some of the PSO services in those areas to bring in additional communities.  Through discussions with the transport co-ordination units, we also put additional funding, something of the order of &euro;300,000, into the rural network to support additional services in that area.  We also took out a couple of small services that were not being met by either of those two options.  We went to the market and providers came in and those services are now up and running, all being provided by local businesses.  Through a network of mechanisms and packages of solutions we had, we were able to configure things to provide services to those communities.  The level of commentary back to the National Roads Authority has fallen very significantly.  We would consider that to be a successful delivery.</p>  <p>  On the question of tendering of routes, a decision was made to tender 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann services to the open market.  The process of tendering really required us to put together packages of services that could be delivered by another provider coming in, so the decision was made to take 10% and split it into two specific packages on the Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  One of those packages is a number of the services in the Waterford area.  When a new provider is coming in, it makes sense that it should have a locality in which to have a base.  We have chosen two for the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus market opening exercise, the Waterford area and the Kildare corridor.  About 7% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be the Kildare corridor services and about 3% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann activity would be in Waterford.  Those packages were put out to the market last year and that procurement is still continuing.</p>  <p>  Deputy asked specifically about PSO funding.  Mr. Martin Nolan has touched on this in his response.  In fact, the Department and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have granted the NTA additional PSO funding for 2016.  We are in the process of again working with Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and the transport co-ordination units to see where we can expand and bring in additional services.  The Kerry area was reviewed last year and an additional network of services was provided in Kerry to bring about improvements.  We are looking at present at a number of other geographical areas across the country, which we will bring in as quickly as can be done sensibly within the PSO and the rural transport network, using the transport co-ordination units.  </p>  <p>  On the question of community input, that comes in a number of ways.  Representations come to the National Roads Authority and we regularly meet community groups, local representatives and so on.  One of the strengths of the rural programme continues to be the extent to which local people are involved in the transport co-ordination units, TCUs.  Each TCU has its own board, comprising people who give of their time voluntarily to contribute to the discussions as to how best those local needs are meet.  We then contribute to the funding of their services and we give guidelines and get involved in network planning where it is appropriate to dovetail with other services.</p> <p>The vast majority of the decisions that are important to the local community are made by the management of the transport co-ordination units, TCUs, guided by their local board.  We welcome the very heavy local involvement and it is a significant benefit to have that local knowledge inputting into local decisions where local services are being provided.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with intercity services provided by both Bus &Eacute;ireann and other service providers and to focus on long journey times from Dublin to Limerick, Cork and beyond.  Is there a requirement that toilet facilities be provided on board these coaches, be they in public or private ownership?  If there is a non-stop service from Limerick to Dublin, which probably takes about three hours, is there a requirement to have a toilet on board as part of the licensing of the service?  What inspection takes places to ensure that provision is adhered to?</p>  <p>  Will the Bus &Eacute;ireann representative indicate the level of profitability of the school bus service?  I am aware that this issue was discussed by the committee on a previous occasion.  What percentage of the profit, if any, from the school transport service is used for other services in Bus &Eacute;ireann?</p>  <p>  Over the Christmas period I as well as a number of people noticed a brand, Transport for Ireland, advertising on mainstream broadcast media.  Will the witnesses indicate why this brand is being used?  Transport for Ireland comprises four different companies.  It seems to me to be a complicated branding initiative.  What is it trying to achieve?  What is being achieved?  How much is the advertising campaign costing?  Who is paying for that campaign?</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of intercity route corridors, specifically private operators who are going through provincial towns that are not bypassed.  I have raised the issue in the context of the extension of licences that are granted for services from Limerick to Dublin and down into Kerry through Tralee and Killarney, passing through the towns of Adare, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale, with Rathkeale and Castleisland being bypassed.  What progress is being made in extending these services into these provincial towns and when can we expect to see a service change?</p></speech>

The legislation setting up the NTA required it to develop a uniform brand for public transport in an effort to integrate public transport.  That is what we are doing in Transport for Ireland.  Transport for Ireland is meant to be the customer-facing brand that unifies across all the transport modes.  The Transport for Ireland website is the place where one gets all the details of a journey planner, fares, services and so on.</p> <p>The purpose of doing some advertising on it is to start to get out that message that public transport is being integrated under the umbrella of Transport for Ireland and that will grow in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Those who are not familiar with the airport when they land in Dublin encounter Aircoach, the green bus, Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and if they look at their smartphones, they will come across Transport for Ireland.  They will say to themselves, "This is a bizarre set up".  When one lands in Boston or a European city, one encounters a single transport entity when one arrives.</p></speech>

We have a challenge to develop what we started much further over the years ahead but we are dealing with the legacy of bodies that were set up decades ago and, therefore, it will take some time to change.

If the Luas, DART, commuter rail, mainline rail, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are to be integrated, surely something as basic as painting them all the same colour would be a start.  However, Irish Rail has rebranded over the past three years at a cost and Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently rebranded at a cost.  The Leap card was introduced with another new name foisted on us at a cost.  Every time there is a will to inject cash into one of the public transport services, a rebranding happens and that is not in keeping with what the NTA is trying to achieve, which is a single brand entity for transport Ireland.  On top of that, there are the DART, CIE International Tours, etc.</p></speech>

It does not go directly.  Road conditions are a factor.  It is easy to use a toilet on a motorway but when roads are bumpy and so on, there are safety concerns regarding the speeds at which the buses travel.  There are opportunities for passengers to go to the toilet, where appropriate, on or off the buses.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann buys diesel in advance at &euro;1.20 per litre.  The price of diesel is now down to 99.8 cent a litre in places.  When it falls lower than that, will the company buy enough in bulk in order that it might save a great deal of money down the road?  The price of oil is expected to fall to somewhere between $22 and $24 dollars.  When the opportunity arises, will the company make sure it buys enough diesel in advance?  A group appeared before the committee recently to discuss natural gas and Ireland's move to a low-carbon economy.  They said buses would move to natural gas.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann buying buses with that facility?  It costs &euro;18,000 to install the relevant technology.</p>  <p>  On school transport, why was the old school rule abolished?  It is causing many problems around the country.  Another problem that crops up here and there, which I am sure every Deputy has encountered, is children attending schools that are further away from them than others.  I am familiar with cases of bullying and other problems which meant the children had to move to other schools and they had to pay for their bus tickets.  Is any change proposed in this regard?</p>  <p>  The NTA is just waggling along with the Local Link service in County Leitrim and parts of County Roscommon and nothing is being done.  We have been told schemes would be announced but nothing has happened.  When will the service be provided?  Who is making up the rules preventing buses from pulling up in different places?  The approval of the local authority is needed.  Who introduced that rule, which is causing problems?</p>  <p>  I return to matters involving Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There are new rules for orange, yellow and red weather alerts.</p> <p>I understand that during the flooding, if there were three to four inches of water on the road, there was an instruction not drive.  I must compliment Mr. Nolan on how Bus &Eacute;ireann staff dealt with a problem in Roscommon as the bus went round about to help children.  Why is it the case that in adverse weather conditions of frost, rain or storm, the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus is stopped but the private operator will pick up the children?  Different rules seem to apply.</p> <p> I wish to put a question on tendering to both the witnesses from Bus &Eacute;ireann and the National Roads Authority.  Do the witnesses think the new procurement procedures fly in the face of common sense in that the detail of the description of how one cleans the bus and so on means that one is awarded more marks and therefore secures the tender, making an ass of the procurement system?</p></speech>

We have heard before about the problems caused by the rules for designating a stop.  The responsibility for designating stopping places at the roadside rests with the local authority.  We understand they have taken a conservative view in many places and are not allowing buses to stop at historic stopping points.  We have decided to produce some guidance and send it to the local authorities and this might allow them to take some comfort from that guidance and go a little further than an individual on his own might be prepared to go.</p></speech>

The issue I raised was in Galway city.  I have been talking to some of the private bus operators in recent days and they are still meeting brick walls with regard to the renewal of licences and effectively having to provide a more limited service for the public.  I am glad to see there is some movement on it.</p></speech>

On the issue of green buses and natural gas buses, that is something we have been looking at but they are more expensive.

Whether that is this year or next year, we do not know but we will be able to react whenever that happens.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked if we are flying in the face of common sense on the tendering of bus routes.</p> <p>The short answer is no.  At this stage all we have done is pre-qualification of tenders.  We have adopted the approach that is adopted around Europe.  The next stage is where the tenders go out and the financial considerations will be a major component of that choice.</p></speech>

The way procurement procedures are being processed for the bus routes especially flies in the face of common sense.  Common sense has gone out the window. </p></speech>

In response to the question of fuel, we buy 12 months hence.  The price of the market is now 99 cent but the price forward is much higher than that at present.  We look at that all the time.  If we get a reduction in our costs, we feed that into the system.  With a price of 99 cent or &euro;1, people are more inclined to use their cars.  If the cost has reduced from &euro;1.50 to &euro;1, the revenue potential is a little bit lower, so it is back to giving the bus an advantage over the car, so that we can all move forward.</p></speech>

The new vehicles we have are as good as the hybrids with little or no emissions.  There are no double deck gas buses.  One would normally use gas buses, but we can put more people on to double deck buses which are not run on gas.</p>  <p>  The bus is considered a short-term asset, it is not like buying a loco engine that will last 25 years.  It is shorter than that as within seven years the major life is gone.  The time is not right to bring something in but it is moving in that direction.</p>  <p>  The school rules came from a Government review body.  l can assure members there were as many complaints about the catchment boundary system as there are about the new system.  </p>  <p>  There is an appeals mechanism for bullying.

Our drivers are trained to that standard as well.  When there is a major red event, we do not travel, but when it goes down to yellow or even further, the driver has to drive according to conditions and if he feels it is unsafe, he does not operate.  As members know in rural Ireland, in some places one cannot prejudge it as on one side of a hill there is black ice and the other side of the hill is different.  I do not have any evidence of that.</p>  <p>  The result of the tendering process last year was that 3% of the people who tendered did not get their contracts renewed, but half of them got different contracts so at the end of the day 1.5% of the people did not remain in the scheme.  As the Deputy said, there were some problems around the washing of the vehicles, so we have reviewed that in the new tender documentation.  We listen to what is going on.</p></speech>

If a person was doing a bus run for thirty years and never had a problem, never had an accident and the tender price was okay, and as the person did not write an essay, the person lost out because they did not write down all the different things.  It would have been a good idea to give people guidelines on how to fill out the forms.  There are problems in many areas over that process.</p></speech>

Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have smaller buses than the 45 seaters?  There is a service that goes from Cavan through Leitrim down to Sligo on a Saturday morning.  I see it nearly every Saturday morning around 10 a.m. and there would not be any more than 15 or 20 people on this big 45 seater bus.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann looked at similar routes across the country and considered introducing smaller buses?</p>  <p>  My next question relates to the NTA and perhaps it might be better if I was to talk to the witnesses privately about Westlink Coaches, which is currently in a tangle over licensing of a route.  To put it simply, they are allowed to carry university students from Leitrim through Roscommon to Galway university, where they drop them near the campus.  However, they are not allowed to pick up the same passengers on a Sunday evening going through Castlerea, Ballygar, Williamstown and Dunmore.  There is another operator on that route.  They have lodged an appeal because it seems their last appeal was turned down on the basis that there were insufficient numbers.  They have now provided further numbers coming from NUIG, GMIT and they are also being told by NTA that there is a Bus &Eacute;ireann service operating on the same route.</p> <p>That Bus &Eacute;ireann route goes all over the country, going into Ballyhaunis and into Mayo, yet as we know the students want to get home.  I wish to raise this issue and I am just flagging it as I would like to talk privately to somebody about it afterwards.  This operator is providing more than 20 jobs in Drumshanbo, a small town of 800 people.  It would be devastating if he were to lose out.  It does not make sense to me that he is allowed to bring passengers from Drumshanbo through Roscommon and Galway into NUIG and yet not allowed to bring passengers whom he picks up in Castlerea because a licence was given to another operator.  This issue needs to be examined.  I was with the Minister when he was in Leitrim recently.  He promised the people from Westlink he would contact the witnesses about this.  I would like to have this issue addressed sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

In regard to the unit cost of running a vehicle per kilometre, the cost of the vehicle would be a very small part of it as the labour element of the cost would be much greater.  A bus could be on a different route on a Friday or on a Sunday evening.</p></speech>
