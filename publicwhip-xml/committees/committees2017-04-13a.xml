    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.5" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Mr. Seamus McCarthy (An tArd Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00200"><p>As we have a quorum, the committee is now in public session.  We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Malachy Quinn, senior auditor.  We have received no apologies at this stage.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meetings on 6 April.  Are the minutes of last week's meeting agreed?  Agreed.  With regard to matters arising from the minutes, if members want to raise items under correspondence that they feel might be relevant to last week's meeting, we can do that.  We will come to correspondence in a moment.  We will move on to the next item on the agenda, item No. 3.  </p> <p>  We will deal with some of last week's meeting first.  We have some correspondence arising from last week's meetings but we will deal with it under matters arising.  We are all fully aware we had a meeting with a number of institutions from the third level sector and we are waiting for information back from most of them at this stage.  From UCC we are waiting on a number of things including its policy on intellectual property rights, the management of conflicts of interest, a note on the IMI transfer, retired staff on contract and financial assistance to students.  From the University of Limerick, we are waiting on items such as a note paid to the Revenue on sabbatical figures, details on non-Irish students, a note on the Mazars review and a note on the number of complaints leading to internal and external reports or settlement.  That follows on from the issue of whistleblowers.  We have received a response to our correspondence from Dundalk IT which is in our correspondence list this morning.  From Waterford Institute of Technology we are waiting for further information on the campus company FeedHenry.  We are awaiting details on staffing such as gender breakdown and details of full-time and part-time staff, further information on the library subscription service as well as implications of the delay to the Grangegorman development.  From NUIG among the things we are waiting for is information on procurement, gender and staffing, casualisation of staff contracts, and university shares as they relate to intellectual property.  We are also waiting for information from the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills on these matters.  </p> <p>  There are a lot of issues arising from our meetings in the last couple of weeks with the third level institutions.  We will give a little bit of time for the information to come back which hopefully will be over the next week.  When we are here again, we will have hopefully received responses to all the matters that we have raised with them at their meeting.  We will need to consider what action to take at that point.  Does anybody have any comment? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00300"><p>Deputy Cullinane and I have submitted to the Chairman a fairly comprehensive list of questions and issues that we believe need to be answered by the HEA but also by the Department of Education and Skills.  The questions are on issues regarding whistleblowers.  Last week, we raised this with Dr. Love from the HEA, which he said was open to providing us with a fairly detailed oversight of the processes, procedures and instances around whistleblowers and other issues.  I do not propose to go through every item but we ask that this is followed up on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00400"><p>That only arrived late last night so it has not been circulated to members.  I saw it just a minute ago.  I do not think other members have the document yet because it arrived late yesterday evening.  It will be circulated today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00500"><p>I appreciate that other members will want to have a look at it.  It is comprehensive but straightforward.  There is nothing hugely surprising in it but we have gone to the trouble of itemising it for the purpose of being specific rather than making a general request of the parties that they have the specifics we are looking for.  I wanted to bring that to the Chairman's attention.</p> <p>  I have two other issues.  May I raise them now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00600"><p>On that issue, I propose that when members receive this by the middle of next week, any member who wants to add anything to it should contact the clerk and, if not, we will send it on next week.  We will give people a day or two to look at it but we will send it on next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00700"><p>The second thing relates to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  One of the issues we raised last week is the area of intellectual property and its commercialisation and the processes, procedures, oversight, conflicts of interest, the money in terms of revenues generated and who got what proportionately.  We proposed a special investigation and it is still my view that we need it.  We need to get under the bonnet of this.  One of the difficulties we have is that the Comptroller has the discretion and authority to audit the institutions but there is the issue of all of these spin-out companies.  We need to know what happens thereafter because the innovation in the first instance is incubated and financed by lots of public money.  As it is such an important sector in terms of job creation, it is really important that we get on top of that.  We had made a proposal.  Mr. McCarthy was not here last week but we made a proposal on a special report or some similar mechanism to explore that area.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say on that.</p> <p>  I have a third issue but I am happy to come back in on it.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00800"><p>This issue was mentioned at the last meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is familiar with the issue.  I think there is agreement on the committee.  A remark was made by Waterford IT on the return on investment for the State.  What will have to be established by somebody is what was the investment by the State.  It is a meaningless comment to make to us.  It is gratuitous to tell us about the return on investment when nobody has an idea what the actual investment was by way of the incubation unit, staff resources, facilities and equipment provided by the taxpayer in Waterford, direct grants from the HEA, grants, which we are aware of, probably from Enterprise Ireland, possibly training grants from European taxpayers and possibly a whole lot more.  We are in a position where we have no concept of what the State investment was for the relative shareholding it got at the end of the day.  We ultimately have to get to the bottom to know the State's investment.  The suggestion is that it is a broad issue in all of the colleges but the FeedHenry company is the one that has come to light.  We cannot direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a report but we can ask him to consider it.  He might consider it or give us his observations on it.  At this stage, we cannot pin him down for a definite answer.  One way or the other, the Committee of Public Accounts will not move away from this topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B00900"><p>On FeedHenry specifically, the financial statements we are currently auditing of Waterford IT are the 2014-2015 year of account.  The FeedHenry disposal was in that period.  Therefore, we are examining the transaction as it relates to the financial statements currently.  The issues the Chairman has raised are perfectly valid.  I will have to consider whether it would be appropriate to do a special report.  It would have to be a value-for-money report on the disposal of FeedHenry.  For me, the issues that would arise if I decide to do that would be exactly what the Chairman has said, to look at it over time and to ask where it came from, how did it get to be intellectual property and how were the shares attributed and on what basis; that is the decision-making process around that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B01000"><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General will need to treble his staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#B01100"><p>He will need more staff.</p></speech>

The issues that are raised are probably bigger than would be central to the audit of the financial statements.  In order to finish the audit of the financial statements in a timely way, I may have to consider parking it or moving it over and commencing a value-for-money report.  I would have to alert the college to that if I was moving in that direction.  In terms of a special report, it is worth noting that spin-out companies and the interests of colleges across the sector are listed in their annual financial statements anyway.</p><p>If one looks at the financial statements, one will see a list of all the spin-outs.  That information is included.  Perhaps the committee might consider communicating with the HEA if it is not satisfied with the sufficiency of the information-----</p></speech>

If the committee was of the view that additional information should be given or disclosures made - for example, when a spin-out actually happens - it could ask the HEA to ask the colleges to include additional information.</p></speech>

Otherwise we would not be having this discussion.  Does Mr. McCarthy wish at the next meeting to give the committee his view on the audit and whether it is appropriate or whether we should go through the HEA to find out the information?</p></speech>

We are already discussing it internally and I have asked for additional information on FeedHenry.  I will be making a decision in the next couple of weeks.  I am certainly aware of the committee's concerns expressed last week about accelerating the completion of financial statements.</p></speech>

I do not have another vehicle.  It is different with the appropriation accounts because we have the report on the accounts of public services which is provided for in law.  If an issue comes up, for example, on the Vote for education or health, I have a vehicle to report on it.  I do not have an analogous vehicle to report a concern, let us say, about a probity matter or an individual set of financial statements.</p></speech>

That is something at which we need to look.  Mr. McCarthy is only in a position to highlight issues to us about line Departments.  Where he believes there is a need to provide additional information, he has such a mechanism for line Departments, but he does not have one for the other 300 organisations, the accounts of which he audits.  On the face of it, there is a gap.</p></speech>

Although the Chairman might think there was not enough information included and I bow to his experience, there was not only information but also a list of all the companies, with figures of 8%, 10% or 15%.  Our difficulty is whether it is value for money.  How is it arrived at?  There is no such information.  It is a different level of debate and I do not know at what venue we need to look in that regard.  Certainly, NUIG came forward with its entire list and one could not fault it.  It stated what the percentage was and gave us all the information.  I say that to be positive about NUIG.  To return to what is outstanding, it is to come back with a breakdown in terms of gender and so on.</p></speech>

There seems to be a variety of approaches to the issue taken by some of the colleges.  The amount of their own material to which they have access also varies.  It seems that some of them do better than others.  There may well be a higher cost being paid.  It might be a better approach to do it in a more collaborative way.  Is this something that can be addressed in the overall context or is it separate?</p></speech>

I have a couple of observations in that respect.  Among the universities there is a system for accessing journals; I think it is called IReL.  It is being managed by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth on behalf of all of the universities.  It provides the network for it.  It is funded by the HEA to collaboratively provide access for all of the universities.  I do not think the institutes of technology have access to it, but whether there is scope to extend it is something that could be addressed with the HEA.  It is just a suggestion.</p></speech>

The research is not paid for by the journal to which it is submitted.  The researchers have to sign a copyright agreement with it.  It is then peer-reviewed, again at no cost to the journal, and the researchers producing the work have to sign a copyright agreement.  They must even carry indemnity against litigation.  At the same time, they receive 50 copies free for themselves.  After that, in a lot of cases, they actually have to pay to access their own work.  It strikes me that something is being paid for from the public purse, in terms of education and the generation of knowledge, which is then sold back.  I know that there is international collaboration, but it seems that it is one-way traffic only and that there is no return to the colleges which I think there should be.</p></speech>

If it cannot, we will ask it to give us the names and we will write to each of them because the Dublin case seemed to be a complete outlier as to the level of loss incurred compared to the others.  I know that the DIT is the biggest, but we want to get the full picture of the cost to the institute of technology sector as a result of the contract.  We only know about the DIT.</p></speech>

A narrative has been spun by some since and questions have been asked about the commercialising of intellectual property.  It has been suggested that, as a committee, we do not really understand how all of this works.  There was a misunderstanding of the questions being put.  I can only speak for myself but I imagine for most member also.  The committee will agree that we made it very clear that spin-outs and the commercialising of intellectual property were good.  Taking advantage of research from institutes in creating jobs and companies, given the value such companies can have, not just for an institute but also for a wider catchment area is all good.  That is not in question.  Researchers and academics commercialising intellectual property is fine.</p><p>None of that was in doubt or was questioned.  What was being examined was at the point where a private company establishes contact with an institute to transfer the ownership or licence of its IP how the institute is protected, how conflicts of interest managed and all of the questions and issues raised by others.  All of that is fair and it is within our remit.</p><p> Following the meeting last week one of the witnesses to whom I put questions suggested he would rather resign than continue with that line of questioning because he felt it was damaging the institute.  That was followed up by a press statement from a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills inferring something similar and suggesting that the questions that were being put would have a destabilising effect on the institution and its joint application with the Carlow Institute of Technology to become a technological university.  There was also an inference from a number of parties that somehow the line of questioning of the witness in question from the Committee of Public Accounts and me was an attempt to damage the institute.  There was also a view that I was inferring that a crime had been committed by the president of the institute.  To be fair to you, Chairman, I wish to make it very clear that at every stage and every single hearing I stressed that I personally was not alleging any wrongdoing.  I make no apology for putting questions on process and procedures.  That is what we are here to do.  We have to put robust questions, as other members did of institutes in their constituencies as well.  It is not done to damage them but to strengthen them.  What we are here to do is to strengthen processes.  We cannot allow a situation where individuals try to pick off members of the PAC and we have seen that approach from other Ministers as well.  It is not good for the PAC and we must protect ourselves.</p><p> I have received a number of protected disclosures from people who worked in WIT as researchers and I have not put any of the allegations made into the public domain.  What I have done is given a synopsis of them to the Comptroller and Auditor General this morning.  I will also meet with the head of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to give him a similar synopsis.  That is following due process and doing what is appropriate.  The HEA is doing an external review of what was an internal examination of the management of conflicts of interest in WIT.  It has asked for suggestions and ideas on the terms of reference and I submitted draft terms of reference to the HEA as well.</p></speech>

This was on my own behalf and not on behalf of the PAC.  Given that the HEA is carrying out an external review and given the limitations on the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of what he can and cannot do, it might be an opportunity for the HEA to use the Waterford example to go under the bonnet, as it were, and look at the type of issues we are looking at?  I can furnish the PAC with my suggested terms of reference and the HEA will be back before the committee at some point.</p> <p>  It is important for me to put on record that we must be able to do our job without fear or favour.  We must be able to put questions fairly.  It is unfair for Ministers of State or witnesses to put any undue pressure on us in terms of the questions we put because we simply would not be able to do our job.  I fully stand over my bona fides and integrity in terms of the questions I put.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised the management of conflicts of interest on every occasion.  We made it clear that we were not asking the individual about his own personal finances.  That was made clear publicly as well.  From that point of view, in terms of everything we did, we were doing our job on the day.</p></speech>

One of the things I am not sure is happening on a regular basis is that when we have institutions or other bodies before us giving evidence, for the want of a better word, and we ask them for information that we follow up on it in order to be thorough.  For example, I asked UCC for figures on its allocation for access for disadvantaged students and I do not know whether we got any correspondence back from it.  It is important we do that for the committee's sake because otherwise people will come in here and pay lip service but will not follow up.  I urge that we would ensure we follow up on all issues.</p></speech>

The secretariat and I keep an eye and check.  Even when we get a reply from an institution of which we might have asked eight or nine questions we might get good answers to six of them but two of them might not be fully answered.  In such cases we always go back to seek all the necessary information.  We give people a little time to come back to us.</p></speech>

I wish to puzzle out what I think is an extraordinary intervention by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  To me it is astonishing that a Minister of State would consider it appropriate to put out a statement and to rap the knuckles of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have the statement in front of me.  The Minister of State said he felt he had to come out and defend somebody's reputation and then he almost warned us to back off.  That seems to me to be the message.  Be that as it may, the question then arises as to what we as a committee do because no individual is cited.  I have no doubt Deputy Cullinane was in the Minister of State's sights, possibly for constituency reasons.  The Deputy is not instanced in the statement, however, the committee is and I wish to know what we are going to do about that.</p></speech>

I think it is completely inappropriate.  I cannot imagine what he was thinking, bar maybe jockeying for position within his constituency, but that is for him to explain.  We need to decide what we do about it.</p><p>I would have thought, at a minimum, the committee ought to write to the Minister of State and inform him that we are doing our job and that we will continue to do so.  If he has something specific to add to our deliberations he is at liberty to write to us as a committee and to offer to come in and to share the benefit of his wisdom but we need to stop this because the question then is &quot;What next?&quot;  Every Minister can fire out statements willy-nilly and attempt to undermine what has been very thorough work, and very necessary work.  We are appointed on behalf of the Oireachtas to do the job and Ministers need to let us get on with it.

People have the right to criticise us.  We are not above criticism.  In the press release by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, he also warned that any incorrect suggestions of impropriety could have a seriously destabilising effect on the institute at a critical point in its campaign for technological university status.  We should write to the Minister of State and ask him to clarify and specify what incorrect suggestions of impropriety he is referring to.  I do not think we made any suggestion of impropriety.</p></speech>

This was a decision made by the Minister of State to put this into the public domain to question the bona fides of the work of the committee and the standard of work of the committee, and essentially, to say to us very publicly to back off.

Okay, we will move on.</p> <p>  On the next item on the agenda, the last day we had a discussion here about the timeliness of the accounts being presented to us and we were on the verge of sending Waterford Institute of Technology and all the organisations here home.  It is a waste of the committee's time being asked to consider accounts that cover the period 2013 and 2014 - that is what we had in front of us.  We will not be accepting that.  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General recently completed a report on this and we will come back to that.  We want to immediately send out a signal to all those bodies that it is not acceptable and there will be consequences.</p> <p>  The outcome of the meeting on the last occasion was we asked them to ensure they had their audited accounts for up to 2016 properly completed by the end of June to submit to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit, and hopefully we would have that after the summer recess when we come back in September.  Even at that point in time, it will be over a year after their financial statements.  That is reasonable.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General and committee are in the same space on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might wish to respond.</p></speech>

We have 26 third level institutions.  There has been a systemic problem in the sector.  We have increased resources, and that was one of the things that I have highlighted in the report on the timeliness of financial statements.</p> <p>  We have made progress.  For instance, already the Trinity College accounts for 2015-2016 have been certified so that within six months the whole process is completed.  We got the financial statements and the audit was completed, the parallel audit by KPMG was completed and the whole lot done within six months.  I am expecting to have the accounts from Maynooth also by the end of this month.  It demonstrates that it can be done.</p> <p>  If the committee members want to look on the screen, there is a graphic from the report on the timeliness of financial statements that shows the universities.  The white panel in the graphic is 12 months after the period of account and one can see that some of the financial statements do not come to us within 12 months.  One can also see the whole process, from us receiving the accounts to the accounts being signed off.  In relation to Trinity, it is done in a three-month period, and as I said, we have made progress even relative to that.  We are working to bring them all forward but it will be a big ask to have the 26 of them done by September coming for the 2015-2016 period.</p></speech>

We refer specifically to those.</p> <p>  What the Comptroller and Auditor General might assist us with is - it is public knowledge but not member seems to know about it - this idea that they all are doing two sets of audits.  It tripped out that Galway had KPMG doing an audit and then the Comptroller and then Auditor General does a different audit on substantially the same figures but in a different reporting structure and the bottom-line figures are not the same because they are for different purposes and maybe different items are included.  It bemused the public to think that there are two different sets of financial statements out there.</p> <p>  We need a note on this.  It is utterly confusing.  We spoke about consolidating accounts.  Which set would be talking about?  We will need the Comptroller and Auditor General's help on this.  Perhaps he has it already covered.</p></speech>

There are two different issues in what the Chairman raised.  One is the two sets of financial statements.  Effectively, that is a historical hangover.  Prior to 2003, the HEA specified the universities were to produce what was called the funding statement.  We raised the issue with them that this did not comprehend any subsidiaries and that it was not being done on a generally accepted accounting practice basis.  In consultation with the HEA and the universities, we developed a template for them, but agreement was reached, because the HEA wanted to hang on to the funding statement, that effectively the two sets of financial statements and a reconciliation statement between the two sets of financial statements would be produced.</p> <p>  As well as that, the accounting systems in the universities were set up to produce the funding statement but not the consolidated financial statements.</p></speech>

Effectively, things like pensions are missing, the subsidiaries are missing and so on.  My audit certificate is solely in relation to the gap accounting - full accrual accounting - for the universities, including all of their subsidiaries.</p> <p>  Separately, the colleges had traditionally hired commercial auditors to audit the financial statements produced by their finance units and to give a report to the governing authority and what had happened was that that process was gone through, the result was given to the authority and then the authority released that set of financial statements to me for me to carry out an audit, and we were in second place in relation to it.</p></speech>

We have an arrangement with them.  We go in and look at the work they have done.  If it addresses the areas that interest us or that we feel are appropriate we can rely on them once we have formed a judgment.  We do additional work, particularly around propriety, regularity and so forth.  We do not audit the subsidiaries per se.  We try to minimise the cost to the public sector.</p></speech>

There is an item of correspondence, PAC32-R-408C, directly related to this.  It concerns the financial statements for the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, which was a serious outlier in terms of late accounts.  The letter we received from it during the week states that when "setting targets for the resolution of these issues [that is its accounts] we expect to resolve the 2013-2014 financial statement issue in the middle of May 2017 and the 2015 financial statements by June 2017".  It says that the support of the senior auditor of the Comptroller and Auditor General has provided templates for the remainder of the work, which will be progressing satisfactorily.  We are writing back to say that we want confirmation from the board in the first week of July that it has complied with the two timetables it has given us.</p></speech>

We will proceed with the rest of our correspondence.  We had many issues to cover with the third level colleges at the last meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is category A correspondence for today's meeting.  Nos. 410A and 411A are the briefing documents from the Department of Education and Skills and Caranua.  We note and publish them.</p> <p>  Nos. 421A and 425A are the opening statements from the Secretary General at the Department of Education and Skills and from the chief executive officer of Caranua.  We note and publish them.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 405B is correspondence from the president of Dundalk Institute of Technology.  We note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 412B is correspondence from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General at the Department of Social Protection, providing a report to the committee on issues we raised when the Department's representatives were before the committee last October.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 421B is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General at the Department of Education and Skills, providing follow-up to our meeting on 28 March.  Items covered include accounting treatment of assets transferred to school authorities, redundancy payments, youth employment initiative, DEIS, contributions from religious institutions, gender balance in higher education, public sector benchmarks and campus companies.  We note and publish that.  Members can consider that documentation further.</p> <p>  In category C correspondence, Nos. 400C(i) to (iii) is correspondence dated 27 March 2017 received from an individual regarding a response received from the Department of Education and Skills about the use of public money on behalf of an employee or board member of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  The correspondent highlights the difference between the stated policy and the practice in the case mentioned.  For completeness, I propose that we write to the Department for an explanation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is Nos. 401C(i) to (iv), which is correspondence from Deputy Thomas Broughan providing information and analysis on speeding offences and court outcomes between January 2015 and October 2016, prepared by PARC - Promoting Awareness Responsibility &amp;amp; Care on our Roads - Road Safety Group, on the north side of Dublin.  The analysis draws attention to the percentage of cases struck out because a summons was not served.  Nearly half of all cases are struck out for this reason and only about 25% of cases result in a conviction.  The last committee was informed in June 2015 that a criminal justice fixed charge working group was examining this matter and that at the time a number of recommendations from the Garda Inspectorate were to be followed up.  It is timely that we write to the Department of Justice and Equality for an update and observations on the analysis provided by PARC Road Safety Group.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will keep Deputy Broughan informed.  He has been working on this for some time with the group concerned.</p> <p>  No. 408C is correspondence dated 5 April 2017 from the chief executive of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  We have covered that as it is about the timeliness of the accounts.  We will note it.</p> <p>  Nos. 413C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 7 April 2017 from the Console liquidator company Friel Stafford regarding the situation for staff employed by Console which is now in liquidation.  We also have related correspondence, which is the next item No. 424C, from the Secretary General at the Department of Health.  It is on the same topic.  The letter from the liquidator contains facts and information about staff who worked for Console or people who were engaged by Console who have not been paid for their work.  We asked that the staff be paid.  We already had a letter from the HSE saying it was not its problem and that it had no legal obligation.  The letter from the liquidator states that there were 70 individuals who were referred to as staff, but 12 of them were direct employees and have been dealt with by the normal unpaid wages and redundancy payments of the Department of Social Protection.  Two did not submit applications, ten did submit applications, nine have been paid and one is getting their forms in now.  The 12 direct employees, therefore, are being dealt with by the State mechanism for their unpaid wages and entitlements.</p> <p>  The issue concerns the other 58.  These individuals were not direct employees of Console but were operating on a contract basis and submitted invoices.  They are listed by the liquidator as unsecured creditors.  We know that means they will get nothing at the end.  They might get a penny in the pound, as it were.</p><p>He gives us a detailed breakdown.  He met the 58 contractors and the 12 direct employees.  The 12 people have been dealt with.  He said most of the 58 contractors were offered employment and had taken it up.  They are now working with Pieta House.  He is also saying all he can do legally is treat them as unsecured creditors.  The letter from the Department is on the same topic.  We had the letter from the HSE previously.  It notes that contracts were offered to 52 people and that 47 took up contracts with Pieta House.  It notes that the Department hopes the outcome of the liquidation process will provide recompense.  That is wishful thinking.  It also notes that the Department considered the matter under the appropriation account.  It is sympathetic, but it can do nothing about it.</p><p> We cannot let this go.  We had representatives of Console before the committee.  We had the internal audit report carried out by the HSE before the committee last autumn.  The committee showed grave concern about the staff and the service they provided.  If we were to walk away from them at this stage, we would be shallow people.  That is all I have to say.  I do not know who has the legal entitlement to pay them.  Everybody says they do not have it.  The liquidator refers to unsecured creditors; the HSE states the matter is nothing to do with it, while the Department states it is sympathetic but can do nothing.</p><p> I propose that, in the first instance, we go back to the HSE.  I am putting some of the responsibility on it because it was aware of issues in Console for a long time.  It took an excessive and inordinate amount of time to produce its internal audit report.  It went down to check every bunch of flowers delivered and purchased on credit cards, knowing that the organisation carrying out the internal audit was a basket case and that there would be problems down the line.  Had it moved earlier to deal with the Console issue, the people in question would not be waiting for the money now.  It is going to quote legal matters and there is also the question of whether we should talk to Pieta House.  On that basis, the HSE is a contributory factor in the people concerned being left without money at the end of this process because it was negligent in doing its job of looking after the taxpayers' money it had given to Console.  I do not know what legal mechanism we can use.  Perhaps I am wrong to suggest it, but it has to use its imagination.  It gives grants to all sorts of people for all sorts of thing.  There is a legitimate case and it has to think outside the box in which it has been thinking.</p></speech>

There were 70 people involved.  To clarify, 12 of them were direct employees, while the rest were not.  I agree with the Chairman in pursuing the matter.  However, there are other implications for charities.  The Charities Act has not been fully implemented or properly resourced.  This is one example of a charity which went unregulated.  The difficulties with the Health Service Executive have been outlined.  It took a long time to come to any decision but when it finally did, it carried out an excellent audit.  This is happening in other organisations, yet the Act has not been fully implemented or properly resourced, which is extraordinary.  It was brought forward in 2009, was it not?</p></speech>

I am simply pointing out that he or she is under-resourced or understaffed.  We tabled parliamentary questions on the matter and this is the end result.  People's lives are affected and they are not being paid.  Besides any difficulty with the service, it is disingenuous of the HSE to state Pieta House did not take over Console.  That is exactly what happened from the perspective of all ordinary people watching.  I know that it is a new organisation, but it took over Console with the knowledge of the Health Service Executive.</p></speech>

There are broader issues.  We discussed Console with the HSE.  Its representatives have been before us specifically to discuss the matter.  I am sure there are other cases, but we should not walk away from the one case that has been put in front of us.</p></speech>

There were issues the Chairman cited in terms of how long it had taken to arrive at the point where an internal audit was conducted.  There was an example this week where the Cabinet signed off on an <i>ex gratia</i>payment to a group of people for the right reasons in respect of pensions.  There is a precedent that these things can be done.  We should not always accept that things cannot be done legally.  There are ways and mechanisms by which Departments can make <i>ex gratia</i>payments if they consider there is justification and we can make a case.  In this instance, given the tardiness, for want of a better word, of the HSE's approach to this issue and Console over a long time, the HSE has a duty and a responsibility.  That is one avenue.  At best, there should be some <i>ex gratia</i>payment.</p></speech>

We have not received further notice.  At our last meeting we agreed that he would send a letter to clarify the evidence given at the previous meeting.  It did not clarify every issue.  We are working on scheduling a date with Mr. O'Brien to come after the recess.  It was agreed that members would send specific questions on his evidence on which they needed clarification.</p></speech>

If somebody has another specific issue that needs to be clarified about the evidence, I ask him or her to contact the secretariat, as a letter will go out early next week on the issue.</p> <p>  We have dealt with No. 431C(i) and (ii) on the Console issue.  No. 424C is also about Console and the Department of Education and Skills.  We will note and publish both items of correspondence.  They follow through from previous public discussions we have had here.</p> <p>  No. 414C is correspondence from an individual on behalf of the Shannon Protection Alliance on the Shannon to Dublin water pipe proposal by Irish Water.  The individual has stated he will be forwarding reports to the committee and wishes to make a presentation to it.  I propose that we write to him, advising that, on receipt of the relevant reports, we will decide on how best to proceed.  It might be for another committee rather than the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  No. 415C(i) and (ii) is correspondence, dated 7 April, from the Higher Education Authority which attaches a letter from Waterford Institute of Technology requesting the authority to appoint an external expert to validate the Institute's internal review of matters associated with FeedHenry, the campus company.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We have already discussed it, as well as Deputy David Cullinane's correspondence and other press statements a few minutes ago.</p><p>We note and publish that.  We note and publish item 417 as well.  Correspondence item 416C is from Clare County Council, calling on the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the costs of the administration of justice attributable to the GoSafe contract which aims at reducing speeding.  I propose that we write to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport first for a detailed note.  When we receive this we will decide how to proceed.</p><p> Nos. 418C.1 and 2 are correspondence from the Welsh public accounts committee attaching a programme for a public accounts network event on 12 June.  We note this.  It was put forward at a previous meeting and Deputy Alan Farrell has agreed to attend on behalf of the committee, accompanied by the clerk.  A travel estimate is on the screen.  Flights are &euro;175, accommodation is &euro;135, subsistence is &euro;99 and there are miscellaneous costs of &euro;50.  The cost per member is &euro;459 and for the two-person delegation it is &euro;918, which is to come out of our travel budget.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will want a brief report on the event from Deputy Farrell when he comes back.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is 419C, dated 10 April, from Deputy David Cullinane regarding the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  We have covered that.  No. 420C, dated 4 April, is from the Data Protection Commissioner to the clerk of the committee informing the committee of an investigation in respect of the forwarding by the Committee of Public Accounts of personal details of an individual in respect of an issue he raised on the granting of Aosd&aacute;na grants to a particular artist.  The individual's letter was forwarded so that the Arts Council could understand fully the argument the individual was making.  The clerk, in preparing a response to the Data Protection Commissioner, accepted fully the oversight in not redacting the person's details and has improved the system to try to ensure this does not occur again.  Is it agreed we note the correspondence?  Agreed.  A name was not redacted in error and the matter has now been dealt with.  The committee should also note that since the commencement of the 32nd D&aacute;il, in order to protect correspondence, we no longer identify members of the public when discussing private correspondence.</p><p> No. 423C, dated 26 March, is from an individual raising concerns about the investment of Caranua funds and a possible conflict of interest in respect of board membership.  Members may note that and raise it during the meeting with Caranua later today.</p><p> That concludes a lengthy discussion on correspondence and items arising from the last meeting.  The next item is No. 4 on the agenda, the statement of accounts received since the last meeting.  No statements have been submitted in the last week and there is no change to the work programme at the moment.  We are trying to finalise some dates in respect of Mr. Tony O'Brien from the HSE.</p><p> There being no other business, we will suspend for a moment to allow the witnesses to take their seats.</p></speech>

We are here to examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report No. 96 in respect of the cost of child abuse inquiry and redress.  In the session following this one, we will be examining the financial statements of Caranua, which is an independent State body set up to help people who experience abuse in residential institutions in Ireland and have received settlements, redress board or court awards.  For now, we are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Mr. Dalton Tattan, assistant secretary, Mr. Martin Hanevy, assistant secretary, Ms Catherine Hynes, residential institutions redress unit and Ms Mary Cregg, planning and building unit.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I welcome Ms Marie Mulvihill.  I remind witnesses, members and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones entirely or put them on airplane mode as they interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  They are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017041300002#H00500"><p>The report for consideration by the committee this morning pertains to an examination by my office of the cost to the State of responding to abuse over many years of children resident in certain institutions run by a number of religious congregations and subject to supervision by the Department of Education and Skills on behalf of the State.  There were three key elements to the response: a commission of inquiry to establish what occurred in the institutions; a redress scheme administered by the residential institution redress board to compensate former residents of the institutions for abuse they suffered; and a range of practical and social supports provided to former residents and their family members.</p><p>The structures put in place to account for the costs were varied and complex, with the result that it requires considerable effort to piece together the overall expenditure in any one year.  Because the work of the commission of inquiry and the redress board was almost complete at the end of 2015, I felt it would be useful, in parallel with the audits of the various 2015 annual financial statements, to compile an overview of the aggregate costs as at the end of 2015.  The report also provides information on the contributions towards the costs received from the religious institutions and seeks to identify lessons learned that may potentially assist in the event that it is decided in the future to establish further redress schemes.  We estimate that the final overall cost of investigating and responding to the abuse in the institutions will be of the order of &euro;1.5 billion.  By far the largest element, accounting for 82%, relates to the redress scheme.  The next largest element, at 12%, relates to the various supports provided for the former residents and their families.  The costs associated with the commission of inquiry which substantially completed its work in 2009 account for 5% of the total.  Awards and costs related to legal cases pursued by former residents through the courts instead of under the redress scheme make up the remaining 1%.  The religious congregations were indemnified against costs arising in such cases under a formal legal agreement they entered into with the Department of Education and Science in 2002.</p><p> The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established in 2000 and the Department initially expected it to operate for two years at a forecasted cost of around &euro;2.5 million.  In the event, the final report of the commission which is often referred to as the Ryan report was published in May 2009 and the work of the commission cost an estimated &euro;82 million.  The redress scheme which was established in 2002 accounts for the largest element of the cost, at an estimated &euro;1.25 billion.  The original forecasted cost of the scheme was &euro;250 million.  My predecessor reported on deficiencies in the methods used by the Department in arriving at that estimate.  By the end of 2015, the redress board had made awards totalling &euro;970 million to 15,579 claimants, an average award of &euro;62,250.  Some 85% of the awards were at or below a level of &euro;100,000 per person.  The highest individual award made was &euro;300,000.  By 31 December 2015, the redress board had approved legal cost payments of &euro;193 million to 991 legal firms in respect of 15,345 applications.  A total of 17 legal firms were paid between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million each, while seven were paid amounts between &euro;5 million and &euro;19 million each.</p><p> Outside of the redress scheme, a range of other supports were put in place by State bodies andthe religious congregations to assist the former residents of the institutions.  The overall spend on health, housing, educational and counselling services is estimated at &euro;176 million.  Since late 2013, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, better known as Caranua, has been providing support services for survivors paid for from cash contributed voluntarily by the religious congregations following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009.  Government policy was to pursue the sharing of the cost of redress on a 50:50 basis between the State and the 18 religious congregations.  The indemnity agreement signed in 2002 committed the congregations to contributing to the costs by transferring property, cash and other resources, totalling &euro;128 million.  Relative to the Department's then forecasted expenditure figure of &euro;250 million, this would have represented an approximate share of 50:50, but the congregations' legal commitment was capped under the terms of the agreement.  In the event, property assets comprehended by the indemnity agreement, valued at around &euro;21 million, still remained to be transferred to the State at the end of 2015.  Following publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the congregations offered additional cash and property, valued at &euro;353 million, but this was not legally enforceable.  The combined offer was revised down to &euro;226 million in September 2015.  Six years after the publication of the Ryan report, only &euro;85 million, or 38% of the remaining offer of &euro;226 million, had been received by the State.</p><p> To date, the congregations' combined commitments and offers represent the equivalent of about 23% of the overall expenditure in responding to child abuse in the institutions.  Contributions actually received from the congregations up to the end of 2015 represented about 13% of the cost.  Some further assets and cash were received during 2016 and the Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the current position. </p><p> My report includes a number of process recommendations which have been accepted by the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They include a recommendation that the Department should ensure a formal evaluation is carried out of the redress scheme so as to learn lessons for the future and assess the effectiveness of the supports provided for former residents and their dependants.  I am glad to note the agreement of the two Accounting Officers to these recommendations.</p></speech>

We received a letter from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on 10 April 2017.  In respect of that correspondence which we considered just a few moments ago before we invited him in, we were discussing Waterford Institute of Technology and FeedHenry, a matter he deals with in his letter.  All I ask him, because he is here in person, is to liaise with the HEA and perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General in due course.  We need a full investigation into the State's total investment in the organisation before it was ultimately spun out.  Colleagues of Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; from the HEA and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to take him through the detail.  We just want to raise that issue with him and ask him to be conscious of it.

The Department has also provided the committee with briefing material in advance of the meeting.</p> <p>  Special report No. 96 is a welcome overview of matters pertaining to the response to the terrible abuse of children that took place in industrial schools and similar residential institutions.  It summarises the position on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  Both bodies have almost completed their work and will be dissolved in the near future.  The report also summarises other redress-related expenditure and provides a comprehensive summary of how the costs of the various components of redress have been funded, including the contribution being made by the religious congregations that managed many of the institutions.</p> <p>  The report covers the period to the end of December 2015.  There have been developments since, particularly in terms of the contributions of cash and property and also in relation to expenditure.  Since January 2016, a further &euro;12.4 million in cash contributions has been received under the 2009 voluntary offers from religious congregations.  In addition, eight further property transfers have now been fully completed, four under the 2002 indemnity agreement and four under the 2009 voluntary offers.  The Department was advised earlier this week that one of these property transfers had been completed.  This information was received after the briefing note and my initial opening statement was provided for the committee.</p> <p>  Projected expenditure on redress is expected to reach &euro;1.5 billion, of which over &euro;1.44 billion has been expended to date.  The bulk of this expenditure, some &euro;1.24 billion, relates to the redress scheme operated by the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  This expenditure is in the forecasted range as set out in previous reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Under the scheme which was established in 2002, some 15,600 awards have been made, with an average figure of &euro;62,250 per recipient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.175" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Total legal costs of some &euro;200 million have been paid to firms that provided legal services to applicants - this represents an average of some &euro;12,800 per awardee.  The redress board has no further applications on hand and is awaiting the outcome of a number of judicial review applications which are before the courts.  Once those reviews are finalised, and any outstanding matters dealt with, the board will be dissolved. 

The review committee which reviews decisions of the redress board on awards is also fully up to date in its caseload but is awaiting the outcome of an appeal of a decision to the Supreme Court.  The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse published its final report in 2009, the Ryan report.  Since then the commission has been finalising third party legal costs and preparing for its dissolution.  There is one legal bill of costs outstanding and a hearing before the Taxing Master is awaited.  Total expenditure in relation to the commission is expected to amount to &euro;82 million, broken down between third party legal costs of &euro;31 million, the commission's legal costs of &euro;15 million and its direct administration costs of &euro;34 million.  Indirect legal costs of &euro;2 million were incurred by the Department as a respondent to the inquiry. 

The report identifies other expenditure under the redress umbrella, including the funding of &euro;12.7 million provided to the now dissolved Education Finance Board, a maximum of &euro;110 million that has been allocated to Caranua, &euro;10 million in support for counselling, and &euro;42 million in funding provided by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE for survivor support groups and family tracing.

Turning to the issue of contributions from the religious congregations that managed institutions, there are two separate rounds of such contributions - the 2002 indemnity agreement and the 2009 voluntary offers.  The 2002 indemnity agreement between the State and the 18 participating religious congregations that managed the institutions provided for a collective contribution by the congregations of &euro;128 million in cash, counselling services and property.  This committee has previously examined a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the agreement and published its own detailed report on the matter.  

The cash contributions of &euro;54.42 million under the agreement have been received, while information has been provided to the Department that confirms that counselling services in excess of the &euro;10 million provided for in the agreement have been funded directly by the contributing congregations. 

With regard to property, the Department agreed in principle that a total of 64 properties would be accepted under the agreement subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations.  This number was reduced to 61 when the Department accepted and received a cash sum in lieu of three properties where good and marketable title could not be established.  A total of 50 properties have been fully transferred.  These properties are valued at &euro;48.47 million in total.  When combined with the cash and counselling contributions referred to above, a total of &euro;112.9 million, representing 88% of the amount provided for in the agreement, has been received.  Work to complete the outstanding property transfers is actively progressing.  In most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage.  Most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients. 

In response to calls by Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for further substantial contributions towards the costs of redress made in the aftermath of the publication of Ryan report, many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement made offers which, in total, were valued at &euro;352.6 million.  These offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement. 

One significant element of the most recent offer, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127 million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers.  When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered, the exclusion of certain property offers and other offers not being reckoned as contributions, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97 million, or 51%, have been realised.  The value of the additional property that I mentioned earlier is not included in this amount as a valuation as of the date of transfer has yet to be provided.  The remaining cash offered is expected to be fully contributed or appropriately reckoned by 2018.  A number of property transfers have been fully completed and the remaining transfers are progressing. 

When the contributions provided for in the 2002 indemnity agreement are combined with the subsequent voluntary offers, the maximum total contribution that is expected to be realised stands at &euro;321 million, of which amount &euro;210 million, or 66%, has been received.  It has been the position of successive Governments that the religious congregations should commit to making further substantial contributions towards the cost of abuse.  Having regard to the work of the independent panel's report, the Government adopted a position that the congregations had the resources to bring their contribution over time to 50% of the then estimated costs.  Based on a maximum total contribution of &euro;321 million, there is a shortfall of some &euro;429 million in advance of achieving a 50% share.  The congregations have never accepted the 50% principle and have refused further requests to augment their contributions. 

The recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report have been accepted and the Department will be progressing them.  Recommendation 1.4, which recommends that the Department actively pursues the outstanding balance agreed under the indemnity agreement, is particularly important.  I can assure the committee that the Department is actively engaging with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, whichliaises with solicitors for the congregations and the HSE, in order to bring this about. 

Caranua was established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to utilise up to &euro;110 million in contributions offered in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan report to help meet the needs of former residents.  While Caranua is a body under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, it is independent and operates under its own board. 

The Department has provided support to Caranua since its establishment and exercises an oversight role applicable to statutory bodies with a view to ensuring that the organisation operates in an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with the legislation and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  The Department is in regular contact with Caranua to discuss progress and performance and related governance issues.  Caranua's annual reports and financial statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is understood that the draft 2016 accounts are currently in preparation. 

The Statement on Internal Financial Control that formed part of Caranua&rsquo;s accounts for both 2014 and 2015, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s certificate to both sets of accounts, identified a number of potential weaknesses in Caranua&rsquo;s payments processes.  An explanation was sought from Caranua in regard to these matters and a report was recently received.  The report notes the context under which the control weaknesses emerged.  These related primarily to the fact that Caranua was in a start-up situation and that it took time to have appropriate staffing resources, systems and procedures in place.  In addition, in striving to meet the needs and expectations of applicants in a compassionate and person-centred manner, Caranua is challenged to meet sometimes very stringent control requirements.  The Caranua report also sets out the response to the various issues raised and notes the measures taken to address the weaknesses identified, which it regards as being legacy issues.  The report also notes the position in regard to the recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s management letter for 2014 and 2015.  The Department has noted the responses of Caranua and the measures being taken to address the potential weaknesses and risks that have been identified.  It will continue to work with Caranua to ensure that an appropriate control framework is in place. 

I thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee.  I am happy to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

Before I start asking questions - I will ask a few and try to stay away from statements - I think it is important to place why we are here with a redress board, a commission of inquiry and the conclusions of the Ryan report.  I hope the witnesses have read the conclusions and I hope Caranua has read them.  There are 43 conclusions and recommendations.  The report is enormous.  I am going to ask if the Department has changed its attitude.  From the 2002 indemnity, there is still money outstanding 14 years later.  Conclusion 6.03 states that &quot;the deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education towards the Congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty of inspection and monitoring of the schools.&quot;  That is not referring to the Secretary General personally, but to the Department.</p><p>Recommendation 7.03 states:</p><blockquote>The Congregations need to examine how their ideals became debased by systemic abuse.  They must ask themselves how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules and, when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it, and to those who perpetrated it.  They must examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the Congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.</blockquote> <p>It is very important to place this in context.  We will be looking at Caranua and at the refusal to entertain another redress board for the mother and baby homes.  That is the context this is in.</p><p>With regard to the redress board, the figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General seem very high at &euro;1.2 billion or something.  The average payout to the survivors was &euro;60,000.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

A number of legal challenges faced by the commission caused delays.  The initial plan had been for the commission to do the work and then for redress to follow.  Obviously, that was changed.  In the case of the commission, it unsuccessfully sought to limit legal representation and, therefore, legal costs of third parties gave rise to additional legal costs for it.  Initial estimates of expenditure had been made for different reasons and the numbers were much higher than we had envisaged at the time.</p></speech>

To forecast the cost at &euro;250 million and have the outturn at &euro;1.2 billion shows me that the Department did not conduct a proper analysis.  I refer back to the deferential attitude to the religious.  It seems that persisted when officials were negotiating and making the indemnity agreement, to which I will return, and their predictions.  That deferential attitude did not change and led them to making the wrong predictions.  They can correct me if I am wrong.</p></speech>

The overarching difficulty was knowing what the numbers would be and what the level of award would be.  We could make some estimate of the level of award based on the fact that there had been a compensation advisory committee, which had been commissioned to do work on that and, therefore, we had an idea of what the range would be but we had little data on how many people might apply.  In the absence of that, it was extremely difficult.  Once we had those numbers, from 2004 and 2005 onwards, we were better able to predict what the outturn was likely to be and, from that date on, predicted it accurately, despite the fact that we did not know where in the range the awards would have been made.

The indemnity agreement provided that any transfers must be of good and marketable title commensurate with prudent standards of conveyancing practice in Ireland.  In many cases, given the age of the properties, the history and title of the property has been proved to be complex.</p></speech>

We have had an initial conversation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but we knew that there would be considerations here, for example, and we wanted to hear the views of the committee in looking at it.   We have not completed the work and we did not want to start it until the work was fully completed.

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has accepted that and he has agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations that the indemnity agreement be followed up and that there should be a look back assessment.  I would have expected that to have started given mother and baby homes and other institutions need to be looked at, that officials would have learned from this and that they would be coming to the committee telling us what lessons they had learned about their predictions, which were inaccurate, in terms of time, money and legal costs.  On occasion, 30% of the commission's expenditure was accounted for by legal costs.  It was less for the inquiry.  There were many examples throughout the world of different commissions and ways of doing things.  Is it correct that the idea behind the redress scheme was to cut down on legal costs?</p></speech>

It has to do with the scale and the systematic abuse.  The Department has a role in examining this quickly and learning lessons.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has published many reports on an ongoing basis highlighting deficiencies and the Department has not responded.  It has not completed a review.

The Deputy has summarised the nature of many of the lessons.  The uncertainty at the start about the numbers who were to be included was a key element.  The planning in respect of having a commission in advance of planning for the redress and the scale, difficulty and challenge of that is part of what we will have to look at.  We have also learned about the legal costs.  We tried and succeeded in reducing these costs significantly from comparative costs in the courts but we will have to look at how that can be further worked on for the future.</p></speech>

From what I have heard from people who have been through the system, and I have had that privilege in a different life as well, the big problem is that I know when the figure - &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;1.5 billion - is mentioned, it seems as if the survivors are getting it.  I have mentioned this already and I am going back to it.  That is not the case at all.  It is my experience on the ground that a minute part of their story is being told.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has acknowledged the abuse was systemic.  The State was integral to the extent of that abuse.  It has taken a very long time for the State to admit that.  Is that not right?  The apology was in 1999.</p></speech>

It led to the debate and discussion around the issue, the measures that have been taken and it informed changes of practice.</p></speech>

That has since been disproved and we have had the Magdalen report.  Now we are up to the mother and baby homes and again the State is doing its damnedest.  My question to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is at what point does an institution learn, if ever?  We had an apology in 1999.  We had a Minister for Education and Science in 2009 saying that the State had no role in the Magdalen laundries.  Now, on the mother and baby homes, the Government has been fast out of the trap in saying that there would be no redress.  Why?  Because this redress scheme was so expensive.</p></speech>

They are not under the aegis of the Department, are not inspected by the Department, nor were they.  The work on the Magdalen laundries was led by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am not personally accountable for that to this committee, however, I do see what the Deputy is saying in terms of the joined-up nature of the impact and the role of the State in relation to all of these.  In each case the State engaged with the people who had been in the various places.  For example, in the Magdalen laundries there was the McAleese report which was followed by Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations.  The State worked that through.  On the commission on mother and baby homes, we are all finding the horrific nature of what went on very difficult to see as we learn about it on the news and in official meetings.  That is why the Government has established a commission.  I would not say that the State is avoiding dealing with these, but I would say that it is not my responsibility to talk about the role of the State here in that regard.</p></speech>

My point is that it is denial, denial until the institution and each Department is absolutely forced to do something.</p> <p>  My final question is in relation to the mother and baby homes.  It relates to redress.  This has been used as an obstacle to a possible redress.  In all the meetings I attended, none of the survivors asked for redress.  What they asked for was truth and information so that they would be empowered.  That has not happened.  That is the problem.  The redress is a separate issue entirely.  I forget the question I was going to ask so I will come back to it. </p></speech>

We are not finished.  I am not eating into Deputy Cullinane's time.  He is the next speaker.  Has any of the people with Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; seen them?  This is very important.  The letter Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; got from the committee inviting him to this meeting since the Committee of Public Accounts was established made it very clear that when an Accounting Officer is attending and information is requested during the course of the meeting, he or she should have somebody on hand to go back and check the Department and get something e-mailed or sent over.  It should be done during the course of the meeting, because we are here for several hours, so we do not have to wait for it in the post in a week's time.  We need to know.  This is extraordinary.  I do not understand how Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; performed his function as an Accounting Officer for the Department of Education and Skills, when this amount of money is concerned and he has been able to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report - his responses are in the report - yet when we tease him out about the meetings, he says he does not know whether there were minutes taken and that he has never seen them.  How did he adequately make those responses to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report if he does not know whether or not there were minutes taken and without taking the trouble to look at them?  We are talking about hundreds of millions and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; does not even know if minutes were taken of thee 15 meetings he has referred to?  Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; ask his colleagues if minutes were taken?  I am asking him to ask his colleagues to give us the answer.  Were minutes taken?</p></speech>

How could anybody make a public appearance and answer the Comptroller and Auditor General''s report in public and say they have not even checked to know if there are minutes of meetings?  I find it very difficult.  Based on what we are hearing today, the witnesses' evidence will be inadequate.  No matter how good or bad it is, it is inadequate before we start.

We are here on behalf of a lot of people.  We are not here just for ourselves.  I am shocked by the deferential treatment the witnesses gave.  They should have shown a bit of deferential treatment to the Committee of Public Accounts and come here ready to answer the questions.  Do the witnesses not understand our frustration?  We are coming across a bit angry but I am dismayed.  It is 15 years on, eight years after the Ryan report and the witnesses are coming in here.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report, we have had a chapter in 2002, a chapter in some other year and we now have a special report.  The witnesses have arrived here today and Mr. Tattan is saying he has information online and the accounting officer has said he never saw those minutes.  How are we expected to get to the bottom of this if the witnesses are so unprepared for today's meeting?</p></speech>

We have spent a large amount of time and there have been very many internal meetings and some external meetings, in preparing to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General's draft report, in preparing for the publication of the report and in preparation for this.  It is not something we have taken lightly.  Preparation for the Committee of Public Accounts is not something I take lightly as Accounting Officer.  It is sometimes difficult to know what information may be sought when we are here.  I have brought two folders full of information with me and have read through those, reviewed them and spent a huge amount of my personal time and my team's time preparing.  I apologise for not having the minutes with me and for not being able to answer the question.  Please be assured that I and the Department take my role as Accounting Officer and the Department's preparations for the Committee of Public Accounts very seriously.</p></speech>

The criticism is that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; says he has not even seen the minutes and does not know whether they actually exist.  That is the criticism.  It is not that we wanted them to hand here but we do not know how Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; could be fully briefed to attend here.  He said there was a series of at least 15 meetings on what happened after the Ryan report in which hundreds of millions was discussed.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said the Christian Brothers withdrew a substantial portion of that.</p><p>We wanted to know what was said at those meetings and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is telling us nobody in the whole preparation went to look back at the minutes of those meetings.</p></speech>

It was not to embarrass Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  A big decision was made in relation to a sum of money, some of which was since taken back.  It is a matter of accountability.</p> <p>  I had my turn, but it is extraordinary that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; could not give an answer that there are minutes, and that he tells afterwards it is pulled out.  That is difficult.  We are back to trust.  The original estimates for all of the money were wrong.  Is that not correct?  The original indemnity was &euro;128 million.  It was a totally wrong figure.  The Department was wrong on the numbers of people coming forward.  Then, in 2009, a deal is done.  We are simply asking questions about that deal and there are no minutes.  There are minutes.  The minutes are online.  It is a question of accountability and trust, particularly when the figures are being misused by the Government to justify other decisions.</p></speech>

It is a troubling report for all sorts of reasons.  It is difficult for us, even to put questions in relation to costs, because nobody is disputing, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; stated earlier, that every cent that was given to survivors was entirely appropriate.  The issue is who pays, and the issues, in the case of any questions that we put, are around process.</p> <p>  I have to say to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; that, after reading the report several times and taking on board the gravity of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report, I found Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s opening statement to be a bland account of the issues.  That is just the first point I would make.  I wonder if the Department has any concept of self-reflection, accountability, responsibility and recognition of failures because it does not jump out at all from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s opening statement.  In fact, quite the opposite is so.  That is extraordinary.  That is merely my view and I will state that first.</p> <p>  The following is the first question I will put to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  I want to focus on policy here.  The policy was initially that the congregations that ran the institutions would share equal liability of whatever the overall cost would be.  Would Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; confirm that was the policy?</p></speech>

The decision to provide redress was made, and that the State would ensure that redress was provided was not made at the same time as a decision on shared liability.</p></speech>

I want to be clear on the facts.  On page 11, in the summary, under Contributions from Religious Congregations, the last paragraph states:</p><blockquote>Government policy is that the congregations who ran the institutions would share equal liability of the &euro;1.52 billion cost of redress i.e. contribute &euro;760 million.</blockquote> <p>The point of that, I would imagine, is that the policy at the time is that there would be equal liability, which is the question I put.</p></speech>

That asks what is the policy.  There are important distinctions.  The policy is that there would be an equal contribution.  That is the policy, but at the initial establishment of redress, the policy was not that.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

My understanding - this is from reviewing the files in detail - is that the Government's actions in setting up a redress scheme were not motivated to any significant extent by considerations about, even at the time, the balance of liability between the State and the orders.</p></speech>

This is a straightforward question.  The language used in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is straightforward where it states, "Government policy is that the congregations who ran the institutions would share equal liability ...", and it determines 50% of the overall cost of redress, which results in a figure of &euro;760 million.

What information did the Department have at its disposal?  This is not provided in the briefing document or in the opening statement.  How did the Department come up with the initial forecast of &euro;250 million?  This is important because this is the reason we are only going to get 14% of the overall cost from the religious congregations.  The amount committed to by them in the initial indemnity agreement, which they are legally obliged to pay, is based on the &euro;250 million forecast.</p></speech>

The costing that went into the &euro;250 million estimate was based on the number of cases in the courts at the time because it was very much focused on the courts.  The belief was at the time that the cases in the court would feed into the redress and it would meet the need of people based on the courts.  The average settlement figure used at the time was &euro;127,000.  When the Department met the committee about this prior to its 2005 report, it indicated it had used all the sources of information available to it in calculating the liability and, particularly, the extent to which people had applied to appear before the Laffoy commission and the freedom of information cases.  That was the approach that was taken.</p></speech>

That has been the case.  The Accounting Officer has been here.  I am not seeking to shy away from being here to reflect on what has happened.  Clearly, there was an underestimation.  The first thing is that the Government decided, notwithstanding whether there would be a contribution from the orders, that it wished to put a redress scheme in place.  The contribution from the orders is very important and the Government policy is that it should be 50%.  That was an arrangement subsequently put in place.  The most important points are that redress was made available, as appropriate, and it was and that the commission was established, held its hearings in order that it could facilitate the societal discussion that was undertaken and came to the conclusions about which Deputy Catherine Connolly talked.</p></speech>

Following the Ryan report, there was obviously outrage in this regard and the religious congregations stated they would make a contribution of &euro;353 million.  That was then reduced because there were issues with some school playing fields and associated lands belonging to the Christian Brothers.  Therefore, the contribution was reduced to &euro;226 million, of which we have received only &euro;85 million, or 38%.

We have not seen in our engagement with the orders on these issues that they are unwilling to transfer the land.  However, I stress that the figure will depend on the land value when the land is transferred, not necessarily on the land valuations included in the 2009 offer.  The land may be worth more or less than they thought it was in 2009 when the offer was made.  We are working through the land transfers with them.  They have not reneged on them and we are confident that we will receive the land.  Moving past that, we have sought what we seek through the engagement.  Initially there was the post-Ryan report engagement, after which, as the Deputy will recall, the Government changed and the new Government came in.  That Government and the then Minister who was leading on the issue, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, met the orders to ask for further contributions.  They have not committed to anything further as a result of that initiative.</p></speech>

We then had voluntary offers, amounting to &euro;353 million, and this figure was reduced to &euro;225.6 million.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is confident, notwithstanding valuations of properties, that he will get all of that sum.</p> <p>  The activity of two of the congregations is somewhat problematic.  It is fair to point out that some of the congregations have actually given the entire amount they did offer, but some have not.  The Christian Brothers initially offered, as I said, school playing fields and other lands, but it withdrew that offer.  Its value was about &euro;120 million.  It subsequently offered &euro;34 million, but it has paid only &euro;10 million.  The Sisters of Mercy offered &euro;127.5 million, of which only &euro;24.9 million has been realised.

This was not accepted by the Christian Brothers.  The Minister, having discussed it with his colleagues in government, then asked that they be transferred to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, the trust the Christian Brothers had established, and that, if they ended up selling the land, they should give 50% of the value of the sale to the State.  They turned that down.  That is what they did.  They then informed us that they were transferring the lands to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.</p></speech>

When I mentioned the offer of &euro;225.6 million by the congregations, a statement was made by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; that this value might not be realised because the land valuations might be lower.  If that is the case, we need to get the cash from the congregations to make up the value of the offer.  We simply should not accept properties that are worth less than what was actually offered voluntarily and if the land is worth less, it should be supplemented by cash payments to make up the difference.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; come back to me about the Sisters of Mercy?  A sum of &euro;127.5 million was offered, of which &euro;24.9 million was realised up to 2015.

Every one of us accepts that there was a spectacular underestimation of the liability or the extent of the problem.</p><p>The extent of the problem has produced a liability.  Deputy Catherine Connolly talked about a deferential approach.  It seems that the Department was negotiating with orders which had a far better understanding of the potential extent of the problem.  While the indemnity was given in 2002, the extent of the problem was in full view by 2009.  It strikes me as very strange that when an offer was made, despite the indemnity being given, that it was not included in a firm contract.  Given the almost grudging - that is the best word that comes to me - fulfilment of the commitment under the indemnity agreement between 2002 and 2009, surely it should have alerted the Department of Education and Skills to the need to put it firmly on a contractual basis, at the very least?</p></speech>

We are talking about finances and so on, but we are obviously also here to discuss something very different.  That is where we are.  There were offers.  The engagement of the Government, the Minister and the Department with the orders was one in which they did not believe in the 50:50 principle.  They have not signed up to and not agree with it.  They were not willing to do anything other than make offers.  They were not willing to commit to a contract in making them.  So far, in the vast number of cases where offers were made, with the exception of the Christian Brothers' property, the orders are on the way to meeting or have seen through the offers made.  They do not believe in the 50:50 principle and that is a difficulty.  Our engagement with them could only be described as being very robust in seeking additional contributions from them.  We have had very frank exchanges and correspondence about the offers and with the Christian Brothers on the withdrawal of the offer made.  It is not something we have taken lightly.</p></speech>

We engaged with them and worked it through, but they were not willing to give us joint ownership of it, which would even amount to a case of the State having half the proceeds were they to sell the land.  They have a point of view on this issue with which I do not agree, that the lands are in use by schools.  I do not agree with their point of view and wish we could have taken full ownership of the lands.  If we had taken full ownership, it might have been possible, for example, to squeeze in a new primary school in a growing area on one section of the lands, or something like that, but that has not been the case.</p></speech>

Who could have blamed them?  When the figures doubled, I presume there would have been a sizeable number of people from outside the State that would have increased the number from 7,000 to 14,000.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

There is an awareness issue.  This group of people have been through such hardships that they might not want to identify as part of the group that was subjected to this severe start in their lives.  They came through at different times.  Following the awareness raising for people outside the State, quite a high proportion of claims were from people in the United Kingdom which shows that quite a number of the people who left are in the United Kingdom.  I think 33% of them are in the United Kingdom and 6% in other countries.  They became aware at different times of what was available in different ways.  When we explain that costs went up and that the numbers of applications increased at certain times, we are not doing so to apportion blame to people for applying late.</p></speech>

One of the things that would have influenced people also is that lawyers would not end up with the lion's share of any award made.  That is why I find it very hard to reconcile the average payment of &euro;62,500 with the figure of nearly &euro;13,000, the average legal payout.  The ratio is incredibly high when one considers that it was a redress scheme rather than cases been prosecuted through the courts.</p></speech>

The comparison with the figure for legal costs, were a case to go through the courts, is a good one.  Legal costs represent about 61% of payments made when cases go through the courts.  Cases can be very expensive.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General notes in his report, under the redress scheme an in-house legal cost team was established to develop expertise in negotiating.  Where third party costs could not be negotiated in-house, they were referred to a legal costs accountant retained by the board and then, if necessary, the taxing master.  They have to put a huge amount of effort into seeking to minimise the costs involved.</p></speech>

How can we put legal arrangements in place on a less costly basis?  It is not simple.  For example, the commission took a number of steps to try to minimise the number of lawyers that could be brought in.  People took lawyers to court and lost cases.  In any redress arrangement people want to be accompanied on the legal side and we do not want to deny them that opportunity.  The idea that the State should have lawyers to accompany them to be paid at different rates would impact negatively on people's perceptions of their engagement in the process.  The approach has been to try to minimise costs, but it has to have regard to the needs of the people going through the process in as fair a way as possible.</p></speech>

Did that have an impact on the ongoing engagement between the Department and different religious institutions?  Did public pressure play a part?</p></speech>

I think the debate in society on the publication of the Ryan report and the engagement with the orders, led by the Taoiseach, led to a huge amount more being offered by the orders.</p><p>On the attitude of the orders to be willing to offer more on a voluntary basis, while it is not anywhere near 50:50 and it looks like an insignificant amount in the context of what is not there, that is not to say that it is not a significant amount as opposed to if they were not giving that much at all.  That is what I am trying to say.  Yes, there was a mindset impact on everybody in Irish society at that time.  That included the orders.</p></speech>

A redress scheme does not remove the possibility of individuals within the religious orders being held to account through the legal system.  Were any proceedings ultimately taken against people who were identified through the process?  Who would have prosecuted such cases if that was the case?</p></speech>

The redress scheme did not introduce the indemnity.  The indemnity introduced the indemnity, but the two things became associated.  To get full co-operation and to have openness in the commission, the indemnity was introduced to take it away from a prosecutorial nature and to bring it into a safer space.  On balance, for the State, but more important for the victims, that brought about as good an outcome as possible, given that some of them had a chance to tell their story and that there was redress available.  Given the horrific circumstances, on balance, that package of State responses appears to have met the need to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

We currently have a service agreement with Barnardos in Dublin for its operation and we have a performance delivery agreement with Barnardos about how they operate it.  We reviewed the scheme in 2011 and we downsized it slightly because the demand had reduced.  I am not aware of difficulties in co-operation between Barnardos, in operating the tracing service, and the orders.

They appear to be extraordinary.  We are not talking about court cases here, but redress.  I see that &euro;193 million was paid to 991 legal firms.  This represents 15% of total costs.  That appears to be large and excessive, particularly for redress rather than fighting cases in court.  It is a great deal of money for legal fees.  Some 991 legal firms have gained well from that.  Does it not appear excessive to the witness?</p></speech>

We put arrangements in place to try to minimise those costs both within the redress board and externally.  We have worked that through and we have tried to keep the costs as low as possible.  The difficulty is that the denial or limiting of legal access for people is a barrier we did not wish to cross in establishing this.  That is the difficulty and challenge when faced with the legal costs, but it is something we must examine in the future.</p></speech>

There were 16,649 applications.

The wording he used refers to systemic abuse in the boys' homes.  It was not quite as strong in the girls' homes.  There were high cases of abuse.  That is using his words in terms of the numbers.  We do not have an idea of the proportion of those who were in the schools and the homes and the relative proportion.  We do not even know the numbers who were successful claimants and the degree of claimants by type of institution or by religious order because we are not legally allowed to get that information.</p></speech>

You do not know how they break down.  In fact, some of the people were in various institutions, not just one, so it might not even be possible.  We understand that and we understand the confidentiality.  We also understand that it cannot be broken down by individual congregation because of the confidentiality, and rightly so.  I have an entirely different question.  Some 16,649 people submitted applications.  Have you any idea what proportion that is of the total number?  Was it 90% of them?</p></speech>

They could only have the number of children within that institution for whom they were licensed.  We know from the Ryan report and other narratives that, in fact, the numbers often exceeded the number for which they were licensed.  We have a difficulty with tracking children through the system.  Take the example of an institution such as Marlborough House.  Marlborough House was a detention centre for children who were waiting to be seen by the courts.  However, from Marlborough House one could easily have ended up being referred to one of the industrial schools or the reformatory schools, so there would be a degree of overlap.  Looking back, we now know the scale of systemic abuse that existed in these organisations.  We have limited information about, for example, the numbers that were licensed to operate.</p></speech>

Given that the Department had a vague idea of the licence agreements in operation for the schools at the time, why did Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; consider the 2,000 figure was a valid starting point?  It highlights a very major weakness in the original starting point.</p></speech>

What we all learned in the first ten years of the process was the systemic nature of the abuse.  We were all surprised and shocked by it.  I am not sure anybody would have fully realised and known its scale.  If one looks at what would have been the best way to do this, it would have been best to have a commission to look at the scale of the abuse and then to have a redress scheme in place.  That technically would have been the best way to go, but, unfortunately, we do not live in a technical world but a real world.  The population was getting older and there were appropriate demands for redress.  There were many court cases and the Government made a call to provide redress without having the full knowledge.</p></speech>

The board's financial statements before the committee in this session are for the financial years 2014 and 2015.  Caranua is responsible under 2012 Act for managing and disbursing funds donated by religious congregations to support the needs of former residents of residential institutions.  No Exchequer sourced funds are involved.  The Act provides for the donated funds to be used to pay grants to former residents for certain approved services, that is, housing support services, health and well-being services and education, learning and development services.    </p> <p>  Following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the religious congregations offered cash contributions that totalled a combined &euro;110 million, in addition to cash contributions committed to and paid over under the terms of the 2002 indemnity agreement.  By the end of December 2015, &euro;85 million of the total of &euro;110 million had been received into the special fund and some interest had also been earned on the balances held.  </p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of Caranua's financial statements for 2014 and 2015.  However, for both years, the audit report draws attention to the statement on internal financial control which discloses weaknesses in the board's controls over grant payments.  The concern was that these weaknesses created a risk that grant expenditure might not have been used for the proposes intended in at least some cases.  For example, for 2015, Caranua could not provide evidence that price quotations had been obtained in advance in about one third of a sample of grant applications examined in the audit.  Claimants for housing related support grants had provided proof of property tenancy or ownership in only one third of a sample of cases examined in the audit and required follow up by Caranua such as the collection of receipts for grant funded work or purchases which had been completed for only around 15% of the grants paid.  The statement on internal financial control sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the control weaknesses identified.  The adequacy of the controls will be examined again in the audit of the 2016 financial statement.</p></speech>

By way of context, I will give a brief overview of Caranua, its aims and application process.  Caranua was established, as the Chairman said, under 2012 legislation to manage a fund of &euro;110 million to support the needs of survivors of institutional abuse, people who had been placed in the care of State as children and experienced neglect and abuse in these institutions which had been managed by religious congregations on behalf of the State.  The damaging effects of this experience are lifelong and while most survivors have led fulfilling lives, the lives of many others have been limited in multiple ways because of what they endured as children.</p> <p>  In setting out to design a service for survivors we aimed to base it on their expressed needs and preferences and what was known about the effects of adverse childhood experiences and how they could be addressed.  This approach was helped by our having four survivors on the board.  We also consulted about 200 individuals in Ireland and England during 2013.  It was clear that the majority of survivors were ageing and that very many of them were disadvantaged educationally and in other ways and would find it difficult to engage with a service that was in any way bureaucratic or rigid.  It was with these survivors in mind that we designed our application process on the principle that if it worked for the most vulnerable, it would work for everyone.  Our central aim was, and is, to put survivors at the heart of everything we did.  Our application process is values-based, needs-led and person-centred.</p><p>It is broken into different stages.  When an applicant is ready to apply for services, he or she is appointed a dedicated adviser to provide support, advice and information in making an application to Caranua and, as necessary, make referrals to and-or advocate with other organisations for other services.  We try to ensure there are no barriers for someone in applying to us and we pay particular attention to ensuring our application and other information materials are accessible.  All are in plain English.  We have easy-to-read versions and short films on our website.  We organise a number of outreach events every year at which applicants and potential applicants can come to meet advisers and other staff face to face.  We hold a monthly clinic with interpreting services in Dublin.</p></speech>

We hold a monthly clinic with interpreting services in Dublin for people who are deaf or hard of hearing and offer online face-to-face assessments to them through the Irish Remote Interpreting Service.  We protect and promote the confidentiality of survivors in contact with us and do not discuss individual applications without the written permission of the applicant.  We receive value feedback from applicants and other stakeholders.  We actively seek it through informal conversations, formal feedback mechanisms and our complaints procedure.  We use feedback to review and improve our services and processes.  Applicants can also avail of the independently established process to appeal decisions made by Caranua.</p> <p>  Engagement in consultation has continued to be a cornerstone of our approach and we work closely with survivor support groups such as the Aislinn Education and Support Centre, SOCA UK, Right of Place, the Alliance Victim Support Group, Whispering Hope, Irish welfare services in the United Kingdom and the dedicated survivor counselling services that were referred to earlier.</p> <p>  The length of time it takes to assess, process and complete an application varies according to the needs and circumstances of each applicant and can span a number of months and involve an average of about 30 telephone calls for each one, in addition to other written communication.  We opened for applications in January 2014 and, to the end of March this year, over 5,000 individuals were eligible to apply to us.  A total of 4,362 had actually applied for services, 4,000 to the point of payment.  We have spent over &euro;56 million of the fund on services for survivors. </p> <p>  The average number of payments each applicant receives is eight.  The average value of a payment received by an applicant is &euro;13,000.  That is an average figure for a large number obviously and there are outliers within it.</p></speech>

These staff were carefully selected for their skills, experience and attitudes.  They are professionally qualified and experienced in the areas related to their responsibilities.  The work of Caranua is complex and an intensive induction programme, with ongoing skills development and opportunities for internal supervision and external support, is available for all staff.</p> <p>  We work hard to deliver a good service, but we do not get it right all of the time.  The comments made by the Comptroller and Auditor General are completely warranted.  Our systems were imperfect.  We accept the recommendations made and are in the process of implementing them, as reported in our briefing document.  </p> <p>  We faced a number of significant challenges in achieving good practice standards and controls.  For very good reasons, we got started quickly and organisation processes and systems have been retrofitted over time.  We are trying to balance the requirements of care and compliance.  In considering how best to do this we have concluded that having a range of direct contracts with preferred suppliers, whereby Caranua will contract directly with them for specified services, is the best way forward.  All financial transactions are between us and the supplier and there is no need for applicants to get quotes and obtain receipts.  Since the beginning of the year, we have in place a contract with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, for example, whereby it will do the work it does in terms of energy efficiency for applicants who apply to us in this regard.</p> <p>  Caranua is, by definition, a limited fund.  It has a sum of &euro;110 million.  When that money is gone, we will be gone.  We are planning to wind down the organisation by 2019, at the latest.  In the interim we will continue to deliver services to survivors and work to support other community-based and specialist services to recognise and respond effectively to the needs of survivors in order that they can be cared for beyond the life of Caranua at home and not in institutions.  This will ensure a lasting benefit for the people who have used our services and, I hope, contribute to the prevention of the abuse of children in the future.  </p> <p>  I thank members for their attention.  My apologies for having caused tremendous confusion.  I am sorry.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to say which I said earlier in relation to the Department is that I represented around ten claimants against the redress board in 2007 in my capacity as a solicitor.  I just want to make Ms Higgins aware of that.  It has no bearing on the matter, but I just want to communicate it in the interests of transparency.</p><p>Ms Higgins states in the second paragraph of her written submission that Caranua &quot;is aimed at improving the quality of life of survivors of institutional abuse&quot;.  To a certain extent, there are many reports that Caranua has actually disimproved quality of life, to some degree, in the sense that there is, of course, a financial aspect to what the organisation, not Ms Higgins <i>per se</i>, is trying to achieve.</p><p>In many ways Ms Higgins's opening statement does not add up.  She says the staff have been carefully selected for their skills, yet in the last paragraph of her written submission she states, &quot;In addition it is planned to enhance our work with other service providers so that they can be trauma informed and recognise and respond to the needs of survivors&quot;.  I know from dealing with claimants that they have suffered trauma - a heinous, horrendous trauma.  In a sense, many of them are suffering from post-traumatic stress.  On the one hand, Ms Higgins is talking about the fact that she has taken on staff for their skills and, on the other, accepting that she needs to look at the issue in terms of having staff who are trained in relation to trauma.  Will she explain that to me?  She states in her written submission that &quot;Caranua is engaged in the delivery of a care service to people who may be vulnerable&quot;.  I suggest they are and continue to be vulnerable.  If it is true - I am only putting it to Ms Higgins on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts - that they have been made vulnerable in the manner they say they have been, they have been made even more vulnerable.  I would like to hear Ms Higgins' comments on that issue also.</p></speech>

The reason for that is because a lot of survivors would not see themselves as vulnerable.  They do not describe themselves as victims and they do not like to be put into that kind of category.  It is for that reason that I am usually careful with the language that I use.</p></speech>

Our own staff are carefully selected.  They are supported, managed and supervised to deliver services that are appropriate to the people we are working with.  What is not well understood outside of specialist services for survivors are the effects of adverse early childhood experiences and therefore not all services are well attuned to why somebody might be behaving the way they are behaving and what their needs might be.  What we are planning to do over the coming years is to work more closely with mainstream service providers and specialist services to ensure that there is an awareness of early childhood trauma and the effects that has for the rest of people's lives.</p></speech>

I will talk more about the figures in a moment.  It seems to me that a lot of money was spent very quickly on a small number of claims and it was not anticipated that there would be further claims down the line.  Ms Higgins accepted that.

I apologise if I am being abrupt to Ms Higgins now.</p> <p>  I would like her to please look at the expenses, travel and accommodation costs for staff and the board from 1 January 2014 to 21 November 2016.  When I looked at this initially for 2014 to 2016, staff expenses, staff accommodation and staff travel looks as if it has gone down but not if one reads it downwards.</p><p>Staff accommodation and travel expenses for 2014 and 2015 amounted to &euro;14,834.51 and &euro;14,788.57, respectively.  Post-review, in 2016, accommodation and travel expenses amounted to &euro;11,978.04.  That does not suggest to me there has been any radical change.  In regard to the board, travel and accommodation expenses in 2014 and 2015 amounted to &euro;11,744.03 and &euro;27,170.19, respectively.  In 2016 the figure was &euro;10,688.73 which is comparable to the 2014 figure.  I will comment later on the services provided by Caranua.  In terms of expenses, I do not believe there was any radical change between 2014 and 2016.</p></speech>

Prior to 2013, expenditure on salaries and wages was &euro;188,000.  Ms Higgins referred to people being at the heart and centre of the service.  In 2014 expenditure on salaries and wages amounted to &euro;791,000.  For that amount, Caranua managed 33,751 calls, of which it only responded to 15,348, less than half the number of calls received.  In 2015 expenditure on salaries and wages increased to &euro;1.32 million and the service managed 67,604 calls, but, again, it only responded to half of those calls.  Despite a massive increase in expenditure on salaries and wages, the service still could not manage all of the calls received.  The figures to which I am referring were provided by Ms Higgins.  In 2016 expenditure on salaries and wages increased again to &euro;1.492 million and the service managed 44,582 calls, of which it only responded to 19,776.</p> <p>  Ms Higgins referred in her opening statement to 20 to 30 calls per claimant.  Despite increased expenditure by Caranua on salaries and wages - I am not saying the 24 staff are not entitled to salary increases - the service is only managing to respond to fewer than one third of the calls it receives.</p></speech>

It is the background to what we are discussing now, as it is to the redress board, which we discussed this morning.  This is important for survivors because sometimes a blaming attitude comes across from institutions generally.  During our earlier session, I read into the record some of the conclusions of that report, including that the deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education and Skills towards the congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty and so on.  I do not believe that applies only to the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  In regard to the congregations, one of the many recommendations is that they examine how their ideals became debased by systemic abuse, how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules, and when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it and those who perpetrated it.  It is important to reiterate that the congregations were specifically asked to examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.  Leaving aside the specifics of that recommendation, there is always a danger that an institution will become more important, particularly so in the case of Caranua.</p><p>It is a big challenge to ensure the institution does not become more important than what it was set up to do.  Ms Higgins would acknowledge that.  It has only been functioning for three years.  Is that right? </p></speech>

One left in June, another left in July and one remained with us until last year.  Setting up an organisation is not that easy.  There is work that needs to be done.  It takes time to establish policies, procedures and all of those things.

From January 2014 onwards, for the following three months, the organisation is simply overwhelmed.  Is that accurate?  How many thousand applications came in?  I think it was 2,500 in three months.

I became chairman at the beginning of 2014.  The previous chairman resigned on health grounds.  What I found was an organisation that was overwhelmed by the number of applications.  I found an organisation that was understaffed and that did not have proper processes in place.  It took time to get those right.  The board put them down as a priority.  To give the committee an idea of how understaffed the organisation was, in 2015 we got in Mazars, which is an organisational consultant, and it said we should have 24 staff to deal with the volume of work we had.  The Deputy can imagine how difficult it was to work with four or five.</p></speech>

This is about dealing holistically with all the requirements of an applicant, a survivor.  It is not just a form which is filled in; an assessor rings them, contacts them, and looks at all their needs and takes them through the whole process in a very sympathetic manner to find out what they need across the broad spectrum of services, whether it is housing, health or education.  I do not want to overstate it but it is a very complex operation.</p></speech>

That was an additional service we introduced as part of the 1 June changes to our criteria.  It was introduced because many survivors had said they really wanted it because the fear they would have a pauper's funeral was very significant.  The board considered the issue.  We sought legal advice on whether we could, under the terms of the legislation, introduce funeral expenses.  Caranua, obviously, is not a permanent institution.  It is temporary, but we wanted to make provision for the future for people who were not at the point of passing away.  The agreement was that we would prepay funeral costs to funeral directors.</p></speech>

He or she has nothing to do with it because Caranua is paying.  The survivor has no say in the matter and cannot enforce the contract.  Caranua has limited life expectancy and will close in a couple of years.  How will the relatives of the survivor obtain the benefits of the service in years to come?  How has it been set up?  The funeral has been paid for with an undertaker of someone who is expected to die in ten, 20 or five years' time.</p></speech>

Mr. Yeomans will have the exact figures.  We are in a situation where we know that there are about 15,000 people who are eligible to apply to us.  We even know their names and addresses, but we cannot use that information for any purpose other than verifying that they are eligible to apply to us.  We cannot contact them directly or write to them.  As we cannot make any contact with them, we are very dependent on trying to raise awareness.  We are also conscious - this is the feedback we have received from survivors - that they want to see people.  They do not want to deal with them on the telephone.  Our outreach clinics and events are one way we do this.  We organise the events and publicise them through survivor support groups and in other ways.  Advisers are present and they can be in a private room and see people individually.  It also gives survivors an opportunity to meet other members of staff and, on occasion, members of the board.</p></speech>

Matters moved quicker than anticipated this morning.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  </p> <p>  The opening statement mentioned the importance of protecting the confidentiality of survivors.  The board meeting of 23 March 2017 confirmed the view that Caranua had the authority, in cases where applicants had not provided receipts, to go directly to the supplier without the permission of the applicant.  What impact has this had on the survivors?  Does it threaten their confidentiality?  Is there not a breach in that regard?</p></speech>

We have been prevented from following up on receipts because of the way the legislation is drafted and the fact that under section 23 we cannot betray a connection between an applicant and us.  It has never been possible for us to go to suppliers to get receipts.  We are in a situation where the return of receipts is quite low relative to the number of payments made.  That has been pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is something on which we must take action.  We cannot ignore it.  One of the ways we can do it is by going directly to the supplier where receipts have not been returned.  We would not do this in every case and would not do it without telling people that we would be doing it.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have a fund that is limited.  We have a number of people and do not know exactly how many of them are likely to apply.  We were looking at a situation where a small number of applicants had received a large amount of the fund and said that if we were to continue spending money in that way, it would be spent very quickly and that, perhaps, we might not reach all of the people who could potentially apply to us.  Under the legislation, we are required to deliver our services in a way that is fair and equitable.  To address this, we looked at the sums and decided on a figure of &euro;15,000.  In fact, the average value of payments to date is &euro;13,000.</p></speech>

The Act sets out many health services that are somewhat equivalent to those set out in the Health (Amendment) Act.  It also refers to housing and education services.  We still do housing.  Our objective in helping people with housing supports is to ensure that they can remain at home safe, warm and secure so that they are not returning to institutions late in life.  Our health objectives - being active and socially connected - are based on evidence of what worked for people suffering the effects of adverse childhood experiences.  These are not specified exactly in the legislation, but we have included a number of services that can be claimed under them.  I am referring to, for example, social clubs, gym memberships and services like that that are low cost but valuable in terms of their impact on people.  Our education objective includes self-development.</p> <p>  The classes of service have not strayed from the legislation.  We have strayed a little in terms of funeral costs.  They did not clearly fit, but we argued that they fitted in under health and well-being because applicants would feel happier if they knew that their funerals would be paid for.</p></speech>

Our statistics show that since we started that in 2015, we have had 154 complaints.  Our mechanism has three stages - one is where it gets sorted out where the complaint arose; two is where a manager is involved; and three is where it goes to internal investigation.  We have had five internal investigations.  Relative to the number of transactions and activities that occur within the organisation, there are few complaints.  That is not to say there might be people who are dissatisfied but if they do not come to us, we will not get to hear about it and we are then unable to do anything about it.</p></speech>

She was employed because she applied for the job, she has a certain skill set, she went for interview and got the job.  Other people were working there and with the mandate she was given, she should have been able to do her job.  Why was there a need to employ the services of this company and how much did that cost?  Did that cost come from the budget or was it a separate cost?  Ms Higgins may have applied to the Department to cover those costs.</p></speech>

On page 6 of the briefing note that Ms Higgins provided, there is table 1 and I ask if it could be put up on screen.  I want to raise an issue that is important in terms of doing a look back exercise which, unfortunately for us, is all that we can do.  It has been acknowledged that the level of the service for survivors was poor and appalling in the past and, for them, this adds insult to injury.  We need to make sure that mistakes are not made in the future in terms of any organisation.  There is a pattern here when we see what is revealed by a look back exercise.  From table 1 we can see that the audited accounts for 2014 show that the cost of salaries and wages was &euro;791,000, that figure increased to &euro;1.3 million in 2015 and to &euro;1.492 million in 2016 and it is now at its highest in 2016.  When we note the volume of work which is set out underneath, it shows there was much more activity going on in 2015 than there was in 2016.  At a time when the number of people applying for the service, the number of applications to be  processed, the number of telephone calls received and so on are reducing, staffing costs have increased.  It strikes me that we have gone the wrong away around on this.  At a time when staff were needed, we did not have them and now when the service is starting to be scaled down, the cost of staff salaries is at its highest.  Can Ms Higgins see that problem in the first instance?</p></speech>

I draw her attention to table 2, on the screen, which covers applications by years and associated activity.  In 2015, the cost of salaries was &euro;1.3 million, having jumped from &euro;791,000 the previous year.  The cost of salaries was &euro;1.3 million in 2015 and &euro;1.492 million in 2016.  If we note the activity, 1,228 people applied for the service in 2015 and 585 applied in 2016-----</p></speech>

In 2014, 3,821 applied for the service and at that time the cost of staff salaries was only &euro;791,000.  At a time when 3,821 were applying for the service, the cost of staff salaries was &euro;791,000 and at a time when 585 people were applying for the service the cost of staff salaries is &euro;1.492 million.  I am not necessarily blaming Ms Higgins for this, it goes back to points that were made earlier.  I suggest that again this is another botched job.  We do things backwards.  When the organisation needed the staff, it did not have them, and when the activity of the service is beginning to wind down staff costs have increased.  Can Ms Higgins appreciate that point?</p></speech>

These are activities that relate to services.  Because people come into the service, it does not mean they have come in and gone, they come back.  The Deputy is right.  I completely understand what he is saying, namely, that if we had the staffing at the beginning, we would not have had the backlog, the quality of services would have been better and perhaps we would be winding down staffing at this stage.  We are where we are and we need to realise the opportunity presented by the staff that we have to really make a difference to the lives of survivors.</p></speech>

Again, I do not accept the argument that we are where we are.  Why do we always end up in that space?  We get the forecasting wrong.  We did not anticipate the level of activities there would be when the organisation was set up.  The same problems keep recurring.  People appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, they acknowledge mistakes were made and they go out the door.  The Secretary General, who is the Accounting Officer will go out the door, and we could be back here in one, two or five years if the same problems arise.  It gets a bit tiring and it is difficult for us because all we can do is put questions.</p></speech>

The evidence is very clear here.  In organisational terms, we are a very young organisation and, for us, 2013 was not a full year.  We have only a few years under our belt.  I agree completely with the Deputy that there are ways that we can collectively do more to get those things right in the first instance.</p></speech>

As elected representatives and committee members, we have received correspondence from individuals who feel aggrieved and upset.  What measures has Caranua taken to reflect its acceptance, as a corporate entity, that there were failures?  How has it communicated this to survivors, given the sensitivities involved?  We all know that we needed to make sure survivors would get the best possible service.  However, that does not seem to be the case in this instance and it is troubling, notwithstanding the reasons.  Has the board of Caranua reflected on this and discussed how it can communicate with survivors that it got it wrong?  Without acknowledging that it was necessarily at fault, Caranua should communicate that it just got it wrong and that the service was not what it should have been.  Was that message ever communicated to survivors?</p></speech>

I think we are saying in the report for 2016 that we have finally got to the point where we are really doing things properly.

It is an interesting thing that has happened to Caranua.  As I said at the beginning, we really understand the difficulties that people experience in reading and getting letters.  We know that people are very discommoded, and they will say that to us.  They are distressed when they get letters if they do not understand them or they are not able to read them.  Our practice at the beginning was to talk to people, to telephone them and to advise them on what we were doing.  We did not necessarily then send letters.  However, it happened that we then got into trouble for not sending letters because we were accused of not advising the applicants of the decision that we had made.  Hence, we had to start sending letters.</p></speech>

First, Caranua is telling the applicant the application is complete.  Second, it is not telling him or her that it is a decision that can be appealed and, therefore, the person cannot bring an appeal to the appeals officer.  Some people did and the appeals officer said he or she was awfully sorry as that was not a decision or a determination so he or she could do nothing.

What I was trying to do was address directly the key concerns.  The major concerns of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report were in relation to the lack of quotes and the lack of receipts.  I was addressing myself to that in particular by way of explaining the difficulty that we have.  Under the legislation we cannot go to suppliers directly and get receipts.  Our solution to that is, as the Deputy has just discussed with the Chair, the board can make a decision in certain circumstances.  If the board instruct that something can be done then we are not in breach of the legislation and that is what the board is proposing to do.</p></speech>

I am still waiting on the figure for the number of companies that Caranua had to bring in to put things right.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has asked how can one know whether there has been an overpayment or underpayment without receipts so this problem has been flagged.  In all of the consultations by Caranua, informal and formal, did it ever occur to the organisation to discuss the issue to decide whether the situation is a burden and, if it was, seek permission to do this work directly?  Did that occur to the organisation?  I presume it is not necessary to say there was a choice.  Part of the whole set-up of Caranua is to treat people with dignity and respect.

In July 2015 the board made a decision about a priority system.  Presumably it was brought to Mr. O'Callaghan's attention.  As Ms Higgins has just said, they were under serious pressure and they had to prioritise.  Can I presume the matter was put tothe board and that is why the board agreed to have a priority system?</p></speech>

They have come to us and, possibly, every Oireachtas Member to say they have gone forward and: "They said they met my needs.  I was informed that there was a limit on the services that could be received ... told that there was no hope in hell Caranua would pay for it ... told "wasn't entitled".  They said they have dealt enough with me and I had to make an appeal ... said I had reached my limit ... said they were prioritising first-time applicants".  I do not wish to interfere with any board decision, but I would like to see decisions based on some evidence that a fund is in trouble, which it is not, and a justification for a change in policy on a number of occasions, I believe, retrospectively.  However, I take Ms Higgins' word that it was not retrospective and that it did not happen, but there were different changes of policy over a number of years.  How is that communicated to the applicants who believe their needs have not been met, despite having received a payment or two or more?  There was no policy in the beginning.  Applicants came forward and their needs were met in respect of the initial application.  They then came forward with others.  At some stage, Caranua's policy changed and officials decided that they were in trouble and would limit the money, notwithstanding the fact that the number of applicants was reducing and there was &euro;50 million in a fund, presumably plus interest as a result of investments.</p></speech>

Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; confirm there will be a review of Caranua and the board and what is involved?  Mr. O'Callaghan should review procedures as a matter of urgency and, at the very least, write to every applicant, whether repeat or otherwise, to clarify that his or her case has not been completed if he or she considers his or her needs have not been met.  The procedures should be clarified.  The term "case complete" is not appropriate and gives the wrong message.</p><p>It was said that the organisation had only had three years and that it was a new organisation but it was never going to be an old organisation because it was given a specific period of time in which to do its work.  The extra nine months at the beginning was very helpful and then there were three years to roll out the process in the fairest and most consistent way possible but policy changes have built inconsistency and unfairness into the system.  Some applicants have been allowed to apply for more while some have been given a limit.  This has built inequity into the process which is totally and utterly against the letter and the spirit of the legislation under which the organisation operates.</p></speech>

We had an excellent memorial committee chaired by Sean Benton.  After the planning process there was a final report, one of the suggestions in which was to hold negotiations with Dublin City Council to see if there were alternative sites but none was possible because of the fact that the original design was site-specific.  The winning design followed a protracted international competition but the memorial committee considered that only one of the designs submitted was suitable to be built.  There was no need for a second round and no other design was even ranked in second place.  We considered running another international competition but it would have been another four-year process and we decided our energies would be better directed towards looking at alternatives.  We looked at a permanent exhibition to tell the stories of survivors as a permanent memorial to what happened to people who lived in institutional care in Ireland.  Our next step will be to see if the memorial committee would be interested in exploring this possibility.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is very welcome to the meeting and I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.1649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017041300002#G00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the stability programme update.  The stability programme sets out the Governments macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland and is the first update of the Government's projections since budget 2017 was introduced in October of last year.  The stability programme is presented in draft form - I am, as usual, willing to take on board constructive suggestions from Deputies.  The final version will be submitted to Brussels later this month.  The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the stability programme have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p> <p>  Turning first to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the latest data showing that the economy grew by 5.2% last year with strong contributions from consumption and, in particular, investment spending.  The Department of Finance has increased its GDP growth forecast this year to 4.3%, reflecting the stronger economic momentum in the second half of last year.  For next year, GDP growth of 3.7% is forecast.  From 2019 onwards, with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand, the economy has the capacity to grow by approximately 3% per annum.</p> <p>  The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market, with employment growth of 2.9% recorded last year.  The latter represents the addition of 56,000 jobs.  As a result, there are now more than 2 million people at work for the first time since 2008.  My Department is forecasting a continuation of robust employment growth over the forecast horizon and, on this basis, by the end of the decade there will be more people at work in Ireland than ever before.  Accordingly, unemployment is set to fall to approximately 5.5% by 2019 down from a peak of over 15% in 2012.</p> <p>  Turning to 2017 and beyond, the latest Exchequer returns demonstrate that the Government continues to deliver on its commitments.  While tax revenues were slightly below expectation, it still remains too early to discern any firm trends.  However, it is important to point out that annual growth has been reasonably strong with tax receipts 3.2% higher compared to the same period in 2016.  The performance of VAT has been very encouraging with receipts up over 17% or &euro;673 million in annual terms.</p> <p>  On expenditure, it is reassuring that spending is being managed by Departments within their allocations, with overall expenditure on delivering public services below profile.  Capital investment on infrastructure is slightly ahead of profile and well up on last year, reflecting increased expenditure on the housing programme.</p> <p>  The general Government deficit of 0.4% of GDP projected for this year is unchanged from budget 2017.  In addition, it is important to point out that our primary fiscal policy objective is to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms.  This is now within sight.  Taking account of the current trajectory and assumptions set out in the stability programme update, I am pleased to reiterate that we will achieve this medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms in 2018.</p> <p>  Our second priority in fiscal policy is to reduce the level of public indebtedness and we are making significant progress in this respect.  Our general Government debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at over 120% in 2012.  This declined to 75.4% for 2016 and 72.9% for 2017.  As a result, Ireland is on track to achieve a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% early in the next decade.  Colleagues are aware that 60% is the target set under the European fiscal rules for debt-to-GDP ratios.</p> <p>  Despite the strong momentum, a continuation of robust growth cannot be taken for granted as there are a number of significant risks on the horizon that could potentially derail the recovery.  Principal among these are the potential fallout from the UK's exit from the European Union and uncertainty associated with the policy stance in the US.  The best way of dealing with these risks is through prudent management of the public finances and competitiveness oriented policies.  This approach helped create the recovery and it will help ensure sustainable growth in the years to come.  This is what the Government will continue to do.  I thank the Chairman and colleagues for their kind attention.</p></speech>

The fiscal space is &euro;1.2 billion but there has been a strong carryover effect from the budgetary decisions of last October.  These amount to approximately &euro;500 million on the expenditure side and in the region of &euro;175 million to &euro;180 million on the tax side.  When we put the two together, that reduces the fiscal space to somewhere around &euro;500 million to &euro;550 million.  It is very narrow.  Built into the expenditure side in the carryover is money for employing extra teachers, nurses and so on.  One would need to see for what the money is allocated to see what level of activity is already built in for 2018.  We will recalculate the fiscal space around mid-June.  I would be hoping we will recalculate it somewhat in an upward direction but I would expect it to be reasonably modest.  In normal circumstances, a growing economy with a growth rate moving from 3.5% on budget day to 4.3%, which is the latest forecast from the chief economist and his team, should generate a certain buoyancy in taxation for 2017 and 2018.</p><p>That said, it does not, in itself, make a big difference in the context of the fiscal space.  We can increase the fiscal space by bringing in new tax measures or by increasing existing taxes.  However, that is a discussion we would have to have in a different space.  If we were to go down that road, we would have to be very conscious of our obligations under the confidence-and-supply arrangement and ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il was taken into confidence and that we reached an agreement before we would go that way.  I would be reluctant to raise any taxes but to give Deputy Calleary the full picture, the fiscal space can be increased by additional taxes.  It is narrow and tight but what it really means is that when everything else is paid for, that is already committed, there is about &euro;550 million or so at present.  We will recalibrate that in June and we will have a better idea then but I would not expect a dramatic change.</p></speech>

However, income tax figures are coming in under profile and the level of growth in income tax revenue is not as strong.  Mr. McCarthy said that he is puzzled by this.  We drilled down into it.  What are the Minister's views?  We have hugely strong employment growth but we are not seeing it in income tax revenues.  Income tax for the first quarter is behind profile.</p></speech>

When we drilled down, however, we found that the shortfall related to USC rather than income tax.  We reduced the take from USC in the budget and perhaps that had an additional impact beyond forecast, but I do not think so.  PAYE was up by 6% year on year and PRSI was up 7%.  There is a quirk in the USC and I have asked the Revenue to have a look at it.  Deputy Calleary will remember that there was an argument that people were reluctant to go back to work in low-paid jobs because they would lose ancillary benefits.  One of the ancillary benefits they were afraid of losing was the medical card.  Some years ago, a change was made to the effect that if somebody had a medical card &ndash; personal or family - and went back to work, he or she could hold on to it for a period of three years.  Many people going back to work, while they would be paying PRSI and income tax, would not be paying USC.  That is one possible explanation.  As well as that we are not absolutely sure how the HSE has been administering the system.  The HSE may have been a little more generous than the policy parameters anticipated.  Revenue is having a look and I will keep the Deputy informed.</p></speech>

The committee has done a great deal of work on the capital programme.  The Minister confirmed that we will reach the medium-term projection by 2018.  That should allow more space in budget 2019 for capital investment given that the convergency margins, etc., will not apply.  What is the Minister doing at European level to follow up and what is the Government doing to allow flexibility around capital expenditure?  Is the Minister considering relaxing the fiscal rules?  Is it the case that he needs support for capital expenditure not for current expenditure in terms of, to again use his phrase, "productivity enhancing public investment"?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.1657" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017041300002#H00500"><p>The first position is the current position.  That position was set out by the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 2015 when he announced the capital budget.  When one takes commercial State bodies and everything else into account, that amounts to &euro;42 billion over the period to 2021.  Since then, further revenue streams have come up with the growing economy.  There is a review of the capital programme being carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that will involve the Minister prioritising the expenditure of a further &euro;2.7 billion.  That additionality will be there and I assume the Minister will announce the distribution of that on budget day, but he has already invited submissions on the prioritisation of projects and I know he has consulted with the committee and taken its views into account.</p> <p>  In addition to that, we continue to work with PPPs, which will be off-balance sheet.  Andrew McDowell, whom committee members know as a previous adviser to the Taoiseach, is now vice president of the European Investment Bank, EIB, and he is working closely with us since the bank opened its Dublin office.  We are looking at the possibility of getting cheap EIB money constructed in such a fashion that the costs will go off-balance sheet for key projects.  To date, the position is that if a project can be shown to generate an income flow which is sufficient to service the borrowing, arguably, the European central statistics office, EUROSTAT, would allow it to go off-balance sheet.  If we were to build a metro for Dublin, for example, one would have to do a cost analysis on it and match it against the fare structure and see if the fare structure was sufficient to cover the construction costs over a 20 or 25-year period.  That is one area of exploration.  Let us consider what would happen if we were to complete the roads programme.  One of the big projects that remains is the Cork to Limerick one.  The cost currently pencilled in for this is approximately &euro;800 million, which is way beyond what is affordable even in the reassessment of the new capital programme.  It might be possible to do the road if one were willing to apply tolls to it.  The same would apply to the north-west project from Cavan to Derry, which is a North-South project.  In light of Brexit, it would be important to see what contribution the British Government would make.  The Deputy will accept there would be a big negotiation involved but if the Republic's portion of it were subject to tolling of some sort one could see how that might work.</p> <p>  One could probably do something on social housing as well but the rent flow on social housing, because of the rent structure, would be insufficient to service the investment.  A model was developed in France which is now applicable whereby 40% of the construction has to be for private housing.  Whether that is rented to generate a revenue flow or involves the sale of the asset to generate revenue over a period, by doing it that way the French have got the concept across the line with EUROSTAT.  There is a way of engineering such projects also.  We are at the early stages of discussion and we hope at European level to expand the capital programme along the lines Deputy Calleary seems to suggest.</p> <p>  There is some movement already on a loosening of the fiscal rules for investment purposes but the flexibility that has been introduced so far has not benefited us.  We continue at all opportunities at the relevant European meetings, especially Eurogroup and ECOFIN, to stress that an economy like Ireland's which is coming out of a deep recession - and out of a programme - during which there was very low investment in capital needs to beef up capital investment to grow the economy further.  While there have been some changes as to the flexibility of the fiscal rules that are applicable for investment, countries such as Italy have benefited strongly from that.  However, for reasons I need not get into, what such countries have done does not match Ireland's circumstances and we have not got a benefit from it yet but we are still knocking on that door and pushing hard and we will see where it goes.</p> <p>  We are in favour of the fiscal rules, which we think have helped quite a lot in the context of the strong economy we now have.</p><p>We are still running a deficit and as long as one runs a deficit, one obviously increases one's indebtedness.  In 2018, when we balance the budget in structural terms, we will run a surplus.  From then on there will be extra resources and there will be a different calculation.  </p></speech>

When one reads the figures, one can see what has been achieved over the past six years.  One can see there has been an incredible turnaround.  Very often we have got into the habit of being negative about things that have not been done as distinct from the things that have been done.  I do not mean this in a pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing way but it is an absolute miracle to be where we are today and everybody should be congratulated - the officials, the Ministers and the public who put up with the hard times.  When I wake up in the morning I open my newspaper and, by and large, I expect to read bad news because people are afraid to say that there is good news.  There are 2 million people at work now.  Young people can go into third level education and are fit to travel the world and get jobs.  We have a tremendous amount to be pleased with.  Like the Minister, I have been around this House a long time.  Since 1981 we have gone through various periods and it is time that we considered the positive side.</p> <p>  Having said all of that, the one thing that concerns me is we still have a total imbalance in terms of house prices.  Young people are being driven to insanity if they can manage to get a loan to buy a house these days.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I live in an area where house prices are crazy because three-bedroom houses fetch between &euro;450,000 and &euro;500,000.  No young couple can get a loan to match that amount or afford the loan repayments.  This is a small island and we must consider houses prices in the overall picture.  If I am stupid enough to get into my car and drive in here at 8.30 a.m., the journey will take me between three quarters of an hour and one hour.  If we had proper public transport and infrastructure I could travel to Drogheda or Dundalk in the same period.  I use the DART a fair bit and in Pearse Station at 5 p.m., platform 1, which is opposite to the platform I use, is jammed with people.  They actually are pushing one other to get to the front of the queue.  The trains leaving that platform go to Maynooth, Drogheda, Dundalk etc. and the people travelling are all youngish.  Commuting makes sense to people.  If one can travel from A to B in a certain amount of time and have a decent quality of life, is it not better than having a huge mortgage wrapped around one's neck for 25 or 30 years?  These are the sorts of human things that must be considered.  I suggest it is time, with low interest rates and the borrowing that could happen, for infrastructure to be provided that allows people to travel from A to B in the shortest period.  I believe the public will react.  Why would one take on a mortgage for a three-bedroom semi-detached house or a terraced house for &euro;450,000 if one could get a house for &euro;250,000 if one was prepared to travel for three quarters of an hour to an hour on public transport?  Availing of the latter would make a hell of a difference in one's quality of life.  This island is so small now because one can travel on the motorway from Dublin and reach Galway in two hours.  We need to match that option with public transport.</p> <p>  While the figures that have been outlined are grand, it makes sense to me - as anyone who has spent time in the business sector will know - that when interest rates are low, it is time to invest in things that are productive, create wealth and reduce burdens both on the State and individuals.  I suggest we consider various areas in towns and regions located within an hour of Dublin and draft an overall plan for infrastructure?  We may have to borrow money to fund the infrastructure needed to get people out of the rat race.  I am sure that lots of people who live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire find commuting to work is a rat race.  It is an absolute rat race for young couples to have a huge mortgage wrapped around their necks for 25 or 35 years.  The committee should draw up a plan with the Minister or whoever is in government that recommends ways to improve quality of life and provide the appropriate infrastructure.  We must encourage people to move away from overcrowded areas.  I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett will confirm what I have said.  It does not make sense to pay &euro;400,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and to then spend an hour sitting in a traffic jam to reach the town centre.  The committee must consider ways to shift people into areas where they can get a decent home for a decent price.  We have done a fair deal in terms of infrastructure and roads but in terms of public transport and other means of getting from A to B, the committee should undertake a project that will show where people can get a decent place to live if they are prepared to spend between 30 minutes to an hour travelling.  People are already commuting great distances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.1660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017041300002#J00300"><p>I thank Deputy Barrett for the compliments he paid to the officials in the Department of Finance and, indeed, everyone who has been involved in the recovery.  Colleagues know the Government has prioritised recovering the house building market in order that there is a supply of houses and apartments right through the country but also in the Dublin area, which again might be sufficient.  We have come through a period - starting nearly ten years ago in 2008 - in which activity was reduced initially and then stopped.  There was a period in the middle of the recession where no house was built except the occasional once-off house in rural Ireland.  There is a supply shortage.</p> <p>  Due to some abuses in the industry in the past, the dearth of activity was paralleled by a strengthening of the regulatory regime for house building and apartment building.  When I meet representatives of builders and planners I ask them why have no apartments been built between the canals in Dublin but I have been told that the price of land is too high.  The price of land in building is really the unit cost of the land.  Were the local authority to allow another five or six storeys, the unit cost would go down.  If the same patch of land sustained another five storeys with four apartments then there would be another 20 apartments and the price of land would not be too dear.  There is a combination of factors.</p><p>I am not in favour of bad planning or anything like that but every city in the world allows people to live in apartments in its central area, especially young single people.  While it does not have to be Manhattan, neither does it have to be as low rise and confining as it is in Dublin at present.  That is only one aspect of the recovery.  There is a very big Rebuilding Ireland programme that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is driving forward and I do not need to enumerate all the initiatives that are being taken.  Progress is being made both on social housing and private housing.  Ultimately, only supply will moderate prices.</p><p> The Deputy's contribution on fast, easily accessible public transport is very important.  That is the key to a lot of it.  Not everyone is going to live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or on the coast.  If people are to live in the counties around Dublin, and the city is the major workplace, it is essential that there is fast, affordable public transport to allow people to commute.  It has to be done in a way that it will not take them all morning and all evening, because people need to get home to their families.</p><p> The national planning framework is being worked on under the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  To give some context for that, the census figures have been emerging in recent weeks and they were published in a county-by-county basis today.  The population of the Republic is 4.76 million but the projection is that by 2040, which is not that far away, there will be another million people on our part of the island.  People can imagine what another one million people would do to magnify the problems which Deputy Barrett just illustrated.  The national planning framework is an essential piece of work as an attempt to take some pressure off the Dublin area and for other centres to be made more growth-friendly and more living-friendly so that there will be better population distribution.  There is no doubt that for our younger colleagues in the Parliament, these are the issues with which they will wrestle over the next 20 years.  It is about how to develop an economy that has an acceptable standard of living and that regardless of what wealth is created, the good of it is not taken away by the pressure of living in the modern economy.  Part of it is having work but another is how someone gets from where he or she lives to where he or she works.  Will everyone be on the east coast?  Looking at some of the policies of the Dublin local authorities, if it continues on the low-rise model, the city will stretch as far as Athlone when another million people come in on top of what is there already.  There are huge issues.  Maybe this committee could have a session on the national planning framework, if it is not outside its remit.  It is extraordinarily relevant to everything that we talk about on the budgetary side and the issues that Deputy Barrett raised.</p></speech>

On the calculation of headroom that will be available by the end of the year, the forecast and the Minister's statement are upbeat about there being extra space at the end of the year.  Will the Minister clarify what that is likely to be used for?  Will it be for wage increases in terms of the current negotiations with the public sector?  Will the Minister also clarify where the additional funding to replace the loss of income from Irish Water will come from?  Does he expect it will come out of the headroom mentioned in his presentation?  We discussed the disappointing income tax returns for the first quarter with the officials previously.  We still do not have an explanation for it.  Nonetheless, based on the Minister's statement today, it is likely that there will be additional space by the end of the year at budget time.  I do not think anyone who has been a member of the committee would like a repeat of what happened at last year's budget where practically on the morning of the budget, the officials told us that it was all nailed down.  I think there was general laughter around the room because most people who were following what we were being told did not anticipate that.  We are a budgetary oversight committee.  In other parliaments there is an obligation to indicate to their equivalent committees when the figures change.  Will the Minister tell the committee what the likely headroom will be this year?  What has been pencilled in for areas such as public sector pay and Irish Water?  I saw various estimates around &euro;250 million per annum for that.  Will that come out of the headroom and will it feature thereafter as a general expenditure amount in the Government accounts?</p> <p>  There is a reference to Brexit in the document.  It seems strange that the document has no demands.  There is a graph produced in the joint Department of Finance-ESRI study.  What demands, if any, is the Government or Department of Finance putting forward to allow Ireland some leeway and room to manoeuvre in the context of the difficulties that the report indicates Ireland is likely to experience as a consequence of Brexit?  To date, a number of proposals have emerged.  One is to allow increases in capital expenditure outside the deficit procedures of the EU, whereby capital expenditure for agreed projects of the kind the Minister just outlined would not be included in the deficit.  For instance, in the case of firms that are expected to lose as a consequence of Brexit, the EU globalisation fund's approach would be adapted to allow Ireland extra leeway to support these firms.  The mushroom industry in Monaghan is a well-known example of this, a lot of which came down to currency changes.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister's thoughts.</p> <p>  The Minister heavily referenced public private partnerships, PPPs, in relation to the European Investment Bank.  This may be something that we as a committee return to, but the cost of PPPs in Ireland has been exceptionally high.  We have projects like court projects.  If not today, then at a later date, will the officials talk to this committee about whether it is possible to get value for money PPPs, those being PPPs at a reasonable rate, or is it inherent in the PPP structure that they are so expensive to undertake that, like the project for the criminal courts, the annual rental cost is very high compared with the NTMA being able to borrow at very attractive terms, as the Minster noted?  I would appreciate some guidance for committee members.  We are not far from the budget.</p><p>I am sure planning for it is under way.  Last year, we spent a number of months hearing the sc&eacute;al of various people on the budget, but because of the tradition of budgets in this country, we got very little information.  On the day, a lot more was made available.  We know from the Minister's statement today that he anticipates the same happening this year.  Perhaps he would indicate on what he proposes to spend any headroom that arises.  I am sure the Minister has done the preliminary figures on the budget.  What fiscal space is he contemplating?</p></speech>

On the headroom available, there is nothing in my speech that is optimistic about headroom at the end of the year.  What everybody needs to remember is that the amount of money available will be the excess of the tax flow over expenditure when the deficit of 0.9% of GDP is taken into account.  We are behind the curve in that regard after the first three months but we think we will make up ground as the year goes by.  I would not envisage, as happened in previous years, that tax revenue will drive ahead such that there will be a lot of additional funds available for spending at the back end of the year to settle outstanding liabilities.  I do not think it will go that way this year.  I hope we will at least break even but I do not envisage a surplus on the tax flow side.  The amount of money available is different from the amount that one can legally spend under the fiscal rules.  In jumping from one to the other, one can get confused.  As I said, we are a little behind in the first quarter in terms of the flow of taxation.  As a consequence, there is a shortfall in terms of bringing the budget in as designed last October, but we hope that will correct as the year goes by.</p> <p>  On the fiscal space, on budget day we said that the space for next year would be &euro;1.2 billion.  We are planning against that, but as I said, there is already a carry-over of approximately &euro;650 million, leaving &euro;550 million as of today in terms of new distributions of funds.  There is no headroom either on the tax flow side or in terms of fiscal space.   I hope that the growing economy will generate more taxes.  A portion of the shortfall is attributable to corporation tax not coming in evenly on monthly profiles.  The bulk of that tax comes in in May-June and again in November.  We hope it will come in again.  There was an adjustment on corporation tax in 2015 which Revenue now says arose from the extra profitability of the corporate side, which drove the taxes.  The difference between 2015 and 2016 was approximately 7% such that there was not a dramatic change in tax flow.  Corporation tax accounts for approximately 15% of all taxes.  VAT and income tax drive the tax base.  We presume corporation tax will come in right as the year goes by but we do not envisage any dramatic shifts on it one way or the other.  As I said, there is very little headroom on the tax flows and the fiscal space.</p></speech>

On the question regarding the varying forecasts made last year about fiscal space up to the Friday night prior to the budget, what I am saying is that we are not adjusting the fiscal space arising from the new information because we have not got an awful lot to contribute yet with certainty.  The first readjustment of the forecast on fiscal space will be made around mid-June in the context of the summer economic statement.  I hope that a faster growing economy than anticipated will feed into an increase in fiscal space but the growing economy is only one element of the many moving parts that make up fiscal space.  All I can say is that the adjustment will probably be positive but it will not be dramatic.  I can say that with a reasonable amount of certainty at this point.  In terms of planning to spend, it will be plus but it will be marginal.  There are others issues involved.</p> <p>  There are other bills that have accrued since the start of this year and the announcement of the budget.  The Deputy will recall that to ensure we had industrial peace in the country the payment date for the tranche of the Lansdowne Road agreement which was due next September was brought forward to 1 April this year at a cost of &euro;120 million, which was not included in the budgetary figures.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that he can carry that within the global allocations already in place.</p></speech>

For the first time in my memory, after three months the Department of Health is on line in terms of budget.  That has not happened over the previous six budgets.  In terms of the Exchequer figures published last week, spend across Departments is running at 0.9% below on the current side and is slightly up on the capital side because of the additional spend on housing.  As late as yesterday the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, told me that he will not need additional provision to meet that &euro;120 million.  That is good news.  On the other hand, no provision was made for Irish Water and the abolition of water charges.  I do not know yet where the bill in respect of the refund of water charges, as recommended by the committee, is going to land in the context of legislation.  In setting out the Estimates for Irish Water we agreed a budget with it and built it into the expenditure figures going forward.</p></speech>

If water charges are abolished, there will be no funding stream for Irish Water.  The intake in terms of water charges was estimated to be &euro;240 million and expenditure in terms of the conservation grant amounted to approximately &euro;100 million.  These figures were factored into the multi-annual Estimates, but intake in terms of the charges pencilled in as the revenue flow from Irish Water was not realised.  The intake to date for this year is approximately &euro;40 million.  As I said, there are many moving parts around money flow.  This income stream was expected to result in a one-off &euro;59 million in fiscal space for 2017.  As such, there will be a reduction in fiscal space of &euro;59 million.  In other words, to keep within the fiscal space figures and the figure agreed at budget time, provision will have to be made for &euro;59 million for Irish Water, which we had not allowed for.  The figure for 2018 and 2019 is zero.  It is complicated.  In the context of a budget of &euro;60 billion, this is not a huge amount and it can be accommodated.</p><p>It is the politics of Irish Water rather than the revenue from Irish Water that seemed to be the issue.  It will go on the balance sheet.  Water has to be paid for, as does the treatment and delivery of water.  Now the decision is that it is going to be paid for out of general taxation rather than through specific charges.  There will be a possibility of charges for excessive use, as I understand from where we sit at present.  We will not have the full picture until we see the legislation coming through.  What I have described for the committee is the position on Irish Water, but I am including it only to show that if it is not allowed for in the budget, it eats into any additional resources that may come.  It does have a consequence for fiscal space also.  As members know, &euro;59 million is not dramatic in a budget of the size we are talking about.</p><p> I will do my best not to have any surprises.  It is part of the agreement between our parties, the supply and confidence agreement, that there be no surprises and that we do not surprise each other.  There are moving parts in the calculation of fiscal space that keep moving right up to the publication of the White Paper on the Friday night before the budget.  We are still adjusting until the early afternoon on the Thursday.  Sometimes they are chunky adjustments.  I am not going to hide anything from members but I want them to realise I can given them the information only when I have it.  Rather than giving them a false start, we are not recalculating the fiscal space now as we did last year.  We will not recalculate until June, at which time I hope we will be closer to the outturn than we would be if we had a shot at it now.</p><p> On the question on Brexit, making an allowance for Brexit will depend on what will happen and the solution.  If there is no deal and no free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, and if WTO rules apply and there are tariffs, there will be a 60% tariff on prime steak.  One can see what that does to the top end of the beef market.  A woman in Manchester can already buy two and a half chickens for the price of a sirloin steak.  One can see the divergence in behaviour that would occur, especially when the devaluation of sterling is driving up consumer prices in the British supermarkets by perhaps 4% or 5%.  It will depend on where it lands.  I hope, and it is our negotiating position, that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and Ireland resulting in no tariffs, such that we would not have the problems.</p><p> Some measures are being taken already.  One will be aware that a combination of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, ourselves and the European Union has been able to deliver &euro;150 million of capital to the farming community at 2.95%.  That was to protect the suppliers into the food market from the first hit of Brexit.  We do not know where it is going to land, however.  It will not be possible to measure the consequences of Brexit until we are further down the road.  Based on what the Department of Finance has done with the ESRI, as referred to, there will be a knock of about 4.5%, but that will be at the end of ten years.  If a budget is moving at 3% or 3.5% for the decade, amounting to GDP growth of 35%, and it is compounded, because it would be growth on growth, one would not be far from 40%.  The calculation is 4.5% off that rather than 4.5% in any given year.  It would be front-loaded.  Most of the hit would be in the first five years of the decade rather than the second five, but it is not as dramatic as some of the headlines would suggest.  Certainly, it would act as a brake on our growth rates and hold us back.</p><p> How does one deal with that?  One does so by managing the public finances better and continuing to make the economy more competitive rather than by having any specific sectoral intervention, although sectoral interventions might be necessary also.  We are considering a measure in the Department, along the lines of the cheap money we made available to the farming community, that would protect SMEs in our vulnerable export sector.  This, however, has state aid implications, so we have had to send the heads of what we are talking about to the competition authority in Brussels for state aid clearance.  We are planning that piece.  We can obtain more information on that for the committee if necessary.</p><p> Beyond that, we are pressing everybody and doing everything we can.  The members know the issues.  They know of the North-South issue, the freedom of movement issues, the possibility of tariffs, the common labour market between ourselves and the UK and the trade implications.  Trade worth &euro;1.2 billion crosses the Irish Sea every week in both directions, supporting 400,000 jobs, with 200,000 in each jurisdiction.  This is what would be at risk if we got a really hard Brexit but we hope we can negotiate with the European negotiators to get a deal.  Of course, our priorities are all the issues affecting the island, both the North and South.  In addition, we are unashamedly in favour of the UK getting a free trade agreement with the European Union.  If it does so, we will not have tariffs and disruption to our trade.  The nearer we can get to that position, the better it is for Ireland.  That is where we are but it is going to be a long story.  One will notice there has been movement on both sides towards transitional arrangements.  These are absolutely necessary but they also lengthen the timeframe.  With a negotiation process that takes three to four years and another period of transition before any new regime comes into play, one could be looking at a decade.</p></speech>

Bearing in mind what the NTMA was raising money for yesterday, we could get money now for investment purposes.  We would certainly get it at 1% over a long period, certainly over ten years.  We would not have to go up too far to get it for 15 or 20 years.  In comparing the public capital programme to PPPs, it should be noted that it could probably be funded out of a public capital programme as cheaply as a PPP but the advantage of the PPP is associated with the second issue, that is, what one is allowed to spend.  If it is spent on PPP, it is not coming out of the fiscal space.  The Deputy is right about low interest rates.  The price is not so much the issue as being off-balance sheet.  They are all negotiated separately and some look like very good value and others do not.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is across this.  It has the expertise.  There is no doubt that it is wide awake to the concerns.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I very much welcome the fact our economy is growing and that the jobs market is strengthening, but from my perspective, I am thinking about younger people.  When there is a narrative that the country is recovering, that things are going very well and that the number of jobs is increasing, the Parliament, which may not be as representative of those in their 30s and 40s as it should be, must recognise that there is growing depression, anxiety and fatigue among people of that generation.</p><p>They are unable to buy a first home or get permanent jobs, must deal with pension issues and, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, spend hours in their cars or on public transport on long commutes.  We have done little in recent years to address that age group's ongoing concerns.  I point to the help-to-buy scheme specifically.  I understand the incentive behind it, but the Minister is probably aware it has been termed the "help the developer" scheme, given that it has driven up prices for younger people and first-time buyers.  I am eager to see future budgets doing something to assist people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are trying to get a foot up in life, start families and jobs and get homes, which is becoming an impossibility for many.</p><p> I welcome that the Minister touched upon the national planning framework.  I support the drive to ease the pressure in the greater Dublin area.  With that in mind, there needs to be a focus on investment and development in the north west.  Speaking as someone from the Mayo constituency, we consistently have been left behind in terms of infrastructural development.  I do not begrudge any county development works but there is extra infrastructure development in Dublin, Cork and Galway in the form of the Luas and various public transport systems, even though the basics have not even been provided in the north west.  There is no motorway or dual carriageway out of Mayo or proper links to Sligo, Galway or Dublin.  Without basic infrastructure in place, it will be difficult to compete for investment and generate the jobs that will allow people to remain in the area.</p><p> Deputy Barrett hit the nail on the head where work-life balance was concerned.  The public service could examine allowing people to work from home properly for a day or two per week in an attempt to ease the pressure on commuter services and the necessity of sitting in a car for two hours each way every day.  The public sector should lead the way on this matter.</p><p> Regarding the GDP growth projections, are there plans to increase spending on the Defence Forces?  Last year, we spent 0.55% of GDP on defence whereas the European average, including neutral countries, was 1.2%.  We will be dealing with Brexit and other issues and are an island nation.  I am not suggesting that major threats are posed to our State but by any standard of a functioning democracy with a jurisdiction to protect, including its waters, we have a low defence spending.  I would like to see it increased, given that the economy is growing.</p></speech>

The best thing a government can do for a younger generation is to ensure that there are jobs.  That was our approach - the priority was to create jobs.  We have been successful in that.  When I entered office in 2011, the rate of unemployment was in excess of 15% and among young people, it was much higher.  As of last week, the rate is now 6.4%.  The ESRI projects that it will be 5.7% by the end of this year, although we believe that we will be in the mid-5% range in 2019.  As committee members know, the difference of returning to work, even for average pay of &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week, to a family that was jobless during the recession is dramatic.  That is the best thing that we can do.</p> <p>  Obviously, we prioritised education after that.  A great deal of money was invested in higher education, including third level.  Participation rates are very high now.  They increased rather than decreased during the recession.  Education directly targets young people.  Our young people are probably the best educated young people in Europe and are as good as anywhere else.  This is important.  I agree with Deputy Chambers's general analysis, in that delivering for the rising generation must be a priority in any social and economic development plan.</p> <p>  I take issue with her and various other commentaries to the effect that the help-to-buy scheme has increased the price of houses.  That claim does not stand up to any economic analysis.  In the three months of this year so far, approximately 1,000 people have received money under the scheme.  The cost is approximately &euro;10 million.  That amount of extra spending in the housing market could not possibly affect prices.  It is too small a quantum.  Prices are increasing but not on account of the help-to-buy scheme as the input is far too small.  The scheme is working.  It was designed to help young couples get a deposit for a house.  It contributes close to half of what was required for a house deposit last year.  Combined with the Central Bank's adjustment to the prudential rules, this has stimulated the starter home market again.  Starter homes are being built and young couples are buying them.  However, there is no circumstance in which an injection of &euro;10 million into the housing market could drive up prices.  It is not possible.</p></speech>

The price rises are due to other factors, principally the lack of supply in the market, the availability of money now that mortgage houses are writing mortgages and the changes in the Central Bank's prudential rules allowing people to borrow more.  The committee will recall that, when we were implementing the help-to-buy scheme through the Finance Bill, it was backdated to July.  As the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government announced that intention in July, we had a legal obligation to anyone who bought in expectation of getting the scheme.  The budget included &euro;10 million for the promises that were entered into for 2016 and &euro;40 million after that.  After three months, the total drawdown is &euro;10 million.  I am not saying that house prices have not increased.</p></speech>

If there is no supply and high demand, there is something wrong with the pricing structure.  Everyone in politics meets and talks to builders.  We meet them in the normal course of events.  I spent five years with builders telling me that they could not afford to build because the cost of building would have been less than the price that they could get.</p></speech>

When the economy was driven over a cliff in 2008, the country went bankrupt.  Anyone who is not suffering a loss of memory knows that there was very little money.  We were cutting back rather than spending.  It has only been in the past two years that a large chunk of money has been provided for social housing.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was given &euro;5.5 billion for the next five years.  Now the social housing work is moving through the housing agencies and local authorities.</p> <p>  I would be the first to admit that during the recession, we barely had enough money to keep things going.  We were doing that by borrowing from Europe and the IMF.  It is great to ask in hindsight why we did not spend money but we did not have it.  That is what it came down to.</p></speech>

I could not tell the Deputy what the allocation for defence is.  All I know is that, when I go to Europe, on the sides of the meeting that I attend, but never at an official meeting, I hear people talking about defence spending.  The rule for NATO is that at least 2% of GDP must be spent on defence.</p></speech>

That is manifest in the housing crisis, the water infrastructure crisis, investment in health, education and a whole number of other areas which could really do with significant investment.  The lack of that investment in the housing area has produced the "supply problem", as it is referred to, because we did not invest, do not have a stock and prices are up.  I would like to point out that the reason that we did not have that investment was because of the fiscal straitjacket.  Those were rules which were imposed which we agreed to.  Even now, we are still grappling with that.  There is now a consensus emerging that we should question the fiscal straitjacket, at least with regard to capital investment.  Is it not the case that we are paying - whatever about the debates on current spending - a bitter price for the fiscal straitjacket imposed by the troika and agreed to by both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il before it?  It produced dangerous imbalances in the economy, never mind the human suffering in the area of housing and the health service from the collapse in investment in those areas.</p> <p>  Is it not time to admit that the EU fiscal rules, at least on capital investment and expenditure, were wrong?  They were short-sighted rules and did not understand that counter-cyclical investment and expenditure are needed, and one does not even have to be a Marxist to think that.  It is a matter I have heard the Minister talk about more recently, but there was none of that when we needed it most and we are paying a very bitter price for it.  I am interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.  It is not just a past tense thing, because for those years, we paid out &euro;8 billion in interest on an odious debt that was imposed on us, which is broadly comparable to the collapse of capital investment.  That was the capital investment fund, but it was going out.  It is still going out.  Next year, &euro;6 billion will go out in interest, there will be about &euro;6 billion in the two years after that, and it goes on for quite some time.  That is money that could be going into the capital investment deficit and the infrastructure deficit.  We all acknowledge that is the case but Europe is imposing a straitjacket and we are agreeing to that straitjacket.  Even now, despite the apparent consensus on the problem that this presents for us, I do not really sense any fight with Europe about this.  Maybe the Minister could tell me differently, that we are fighting the good fight in Europe to change these crazy rules which are starving us of the housing investment, infrastructure investment and so on that we need.</p> <p>  Housing has been mentioned on a number of occasions.  The Minister said it is a matter of supply.  I agree and just gave my analysis of why we have a supply problem.  Is it just a matter of supply, or is it also the type of supply?  That is to say the balance of public, not for profit housing compared to an overwhelmingly privately controlled property market and development land.  Would the Minister not agree that that balance is all wrong?  Whereas housing output in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s would have been from the State directly providing a much higher proportion, 30% to 40% at times, now it is down to abysmally low levels of direct output by the State of not-for-profit housing, whereas the vast bulk of housing output now is from the private sector.  That creates the imbalance and problems of unaffordable prices.  Unless we increase the supply of not-for-profit, directly-provided State housing, that balance will never be corrected.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</p> <p>  There is a section in the stability programme about NAMA where the Minister says that its debt and bonds are to be redeemed by the end of 2017.  Had the Minister not accelerated the redemption of those bonds and used the money for investment in infrastructure and housing, we might have had more for that.  I think it was a mistake for the Minister to accelerate that process to the extent that he did.  I ask him to talk about what will happen after the redemption.  Presumably we are into the black in NAMA in financial terms, once we have redeemed the debt.  Do we know exactly what assets are left, what they are worth, what they could be used for and how much profit is projected?  We need more detail on all of this.  How much of the profit generated by NAMA will go to private bodies?  NAMA is often referred to as a public body but, of course, it is not a public body.  It is 51% privately owned.  We do not even know who some of the private owners are, incredibly.  They are undisclosed investors.  How much of the profit of NAMA will go to the 51% that is privately owned?</p> <p>  On the revenue side, does the Minister find it concerning or think it is an issue for us to consider from a budgetary point of view that, while profits have gone up pretty consistently for the last number of years - the witnesses could tell us what the latest available figures are but I think pre-tax profits were about &euro;95 billion-----</p></speech>

That is from the last figures that I saw but maybe that could be corrected.  We are getting about &euro;6 billion back in revenue, which is roughly 6% on pre-tax profits.  Figures from earlier years show the gross pre-tax profits from before deductions and allowances were about &euro;70 billion.</p><p>That is an extraordinary jump in profits, while we are getting very little back.</p></speech>

Does the Minister not think we should look at this?  We have spoken of insulating ourselves from the effects of Brexit but surely the real lesson is to diversify our economy.  Our small open economy, which could also be referred to as the "leprechaun economy", is making us very vulnerable.  The productivity of the Irish worker is off the Richter scale, in fantasy land, something which is connected with transfer pricing and the behaviour of multinationals, particularly in the area of IP.  Does the Minister not think that our failure to react increases our vulnerability and that we are too dependent on this?  We are even talking about courting more banks and financial institutions into the IFSC when we should be diversifying the economy into areas that would be less vulnerable to external shocks.  If we wanted to do that, the lack of capital and infrastructure investment would be a major problem.  I am thinking of areas such as arts, forestry, universities and energy self-sufficiency, which could insulate us to some extent from the ups and downs of the global market and potential changes to multinational behaviour but we are doing very little in those areas.  It is an urgent task if we are to protect the economy and develop in a sustainable way in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

He condemned the straitjacket of the fiscal rules in Europe which did not allow us to spend more money, particularly in capital investment, and he went on to deplore the fact that we had to pay &euro;6 million in interest.  The reason we had to pay &euro;6 million in interest was because we had a debt of some &euro;200 million and if one borrows and spends more one pays more in interest.  Both remarks cannot be correct at the same time.</p></speech>

The Irish people, in a referendum, voted for the fiscal rules.  It was not unilaterally imposed on the people by a Government.  I am glad we have the fiscal rules and I hope they continue, though I would like them to be refined in certain ways that would better suit the Irish experience.  If we had fiscal rules back in the days of the Celtic tiger we might not have gone over the cliff and if we had had them in earlier times we might not have had constant swings from boom to bust in the Irish business cycle, in which it is great for two or three years and then it goes bust and 300,000 or 400,000 people lose their jobs.  The fiscal rules are preventing that from happening.</p></speech>

In 2004 or 2005 the Minister for the Environment decided that, in allocating housing budgets, local authorities would be allowed to go into the market and buy private houses rather than construct social housing, and this certainly reduced the supply.  The argument at the time, which I understood, was that by building large social housing estates one risked developing ghettos whereas, if the budget was used to buy in private housing estates, there would be a much better social mix and thus a much more sustainable housing model.  However, local authorities not only stopped building houses, they took out their capacity to build houses by winding down their construction sections.  While the housing agencies can now build houses many local authorities do not have sections dedicated to the construction of social housing, as they had when I was a member of a local authority, with design people and engineers who could deliver it.  That is one argument but not the only one and there was a very strong social reason for going the other way.  There are now very big housing budgets and we prioritised this at the start of this Government.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities have &euro;5.5 billion over the next six years for social housing and, by any standards, that is a very strong investment.</p> <p>  NAMA has a social obligation and is committed to building and providing 20,000 units, houses and apartments.  It has already delivered between 4,000 and 5,000 and is continuing its work.  NAMA was financed with primary bonds and secondary bonds.  The primary bonds, worth &euro;30 billion, are due to be fully paid in 2017 and the secondary bonds run out to 2020.  The advice given to NAMA, which it has passed on to me, is that it would not be good financing to repay them any sooner and the cheapest way to pay them off would be to let them go until 2020 and settle them then.  It has the wherewithal to settle the subordinate bonds and it estimates a profit of &euro;2.5 billion at present, while its residual assets are somewhere north of &euro;4 billion.  Over the next year and a half to two years I would expect the &euro;2.5 billion, in a thriving property market, to go up further and this will be money largely for the Exchequer.  There may be a small amount, perhaps &euro;10 million, to settle the structures put in place at the beginning of the process.</p></speech>

The system is not structured in such a way that they share in the profit.  We will check the exact figure for the Deputy.  The &euro;2.5 billion, and anything added to it in the next couple of years, will be Exchequer money.  When that matures, the Minister for Finance will need to look at whether or not to take the money into the Exchequer.  Our European friends, however, will probably insist that it is taken off our debt.</p><p>Alternatively, it might be left within a NAMA structure whereby NAMA could spend on extra housing or social infrastructure.  There is a way of modelling whereby we might be able to use that.  NAMA is off balance sheet, as the Deputy knows.  There is a gap up to 2020 in which it might be possible to do clever financial engineering so that we could dedicate some of the NAMA profits to some investment purpose which, for a while anyway, would remain off balance sheet.  I have no plan in that direction.  I am just pointing out that there are options that should be considered by whoever is around in a couple of years' time.</p><p> The Deputy referred to corporation tax.  Going back to 2013 and 2014, the Deputy will find that it was short of &euro;4 billion.  In last year's figures and this year's estimate it is about &euro;7.5 billion.  Taking &euro;7.5 billion in revenue on &euro;90 billion pre-tax profits, if the Deputy's figure for that is correct, it comes in somewhere about 8.6% or 8.7% rather than the 6% he referenced.  Revenue has said that the extra yield on corporation tax is not due to any changes in law but is coming from the extra profitability of the corporate sector.</p></speech>

I saw figures recently and, although I cannot recall the exact amount, it was something like 11,000 new companies incorporated in the first three months of the year.  They are in every direction.  Some of them will never trade but a lot of them will.  We can see it in all parts of the country now - small operations of two, three, ten or 12 persons.  There are a lot of them in the food business and in light engineering and the digital economy.  The diversification is there.  The general advice to companies that are too dependent on the UK market is to diversify their market.  The argument would be for a diversification of markets rather than of activity, if the Deputy can get the distinction.</p></speech>

They are critical for our tourism industry.  Is there some indication on table 9 that Brexit is beginning to bite slightly?</p> <p>  Going on to table A2.3 in the appendix, which is a comparison of vintages of receipts and expenditures for 2017, is there not a very significant deterioration of the underlying balance there, between the budget and this SPU?

Something must be happening if we got that notification.  Once the director of the new office is put in place, it will be on its way.  We will not hold it up.</p></speech>

There is nothing on the executive or policy sides that would prevent it from being expedited.  It is one of the essential components of new politics to give independence to people like the Deputies to cost matters.</p> <p>  I saw the Dublin Port figures.  There are also figures from Dublin Airport, which say the opposite.  There may have been a transfer of business from ferries to air transport in the bad weather for part of the year.  I am not sure what the cause of it is.  The traffic through Dublin Airport has gone up very significantly.  The volume of trade going through Dublin Port had, of course, increased very strongly as well.  </p> <p>  Is Brexit already beginning to bite?  The economy was very strong in the first quarter.  A lot of jobs were added on.  Retail sales are up by 6% and trade in exports has been very good as well.  There is no evidence yet.  All the anecdotal evidence, such as that to which the Deputy referred at Dublin Port, we are aware of and watch them all the time.  There is no hard evidence that it is beginning to bite.  The big effect of Brexit so far is the decline in the value of sterling.  It is dearer for British visitors to come here now, to book hotels, eat out and do all the things they did before.</p></speech>

With the projected balance and so on, 2019 is going to be a fantastic year for whomever is lucky enough to be Minister for Finance - it could well be Deputy Noonan still, heading for a decade in office.  As we achieve this structural balance and move away from the convergence criteria, does that not give us a significant amount of leg room, even before 2019?  The Minister said he had some ideas.  What exactly has he done to try to expand the fiscal rules?  I do not agree, by the way, with a word the Minister has said about Greece.  Greece has different issues.  It has a huge defence budget because it was locked in a century-long struggle with a country across from it that took half its territory, for example.  What has the Minister done to try to widen the fiscal envelope for us so that we can start doing the things we want to do?  Health is severely rationed in many areas.  I welcome Orkambi and so on but we still have these totally unacceptable waiting lists.  There are so many other things.  I agree with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Chambers.  We are not even meeting depreciation rates in terms of capital spending.  What has the Minister done to push out that fiscal rule door for us?</p></speech>

We argue very strongly along with some of our smaller country colleagues that the methodology for calculating the structure of the fiscal space was flawed.  It was not accurate in the estimate of where smaller, open economies were in the business cycle.</p><p>There was a committee set up to redraft the rules in that respect.  Because of our arguments, our chief economist, Mr. John McCarthy is chairing that particular group in Brussels.  Maybe, with the permission of the Chair, Mr. McCarthy can give the committee some insights. </p></speech>

The Minister raised this matter at ECOFIN.  The fiscal space is calculated on the basis of ten-year averages of growth rates and its potential.  Let us talk about growth rates.  Some growth rates are backward-looking and some are forward-looking.  The fiscal space is supposed to be revised every three years.  On foot of the Minister's intervention, we argued that it was unfair to Ireland because the backward-looking application was taking into account the very bad years, when growth was minus 5% or minus 6%.  That was feeding into the average.  The intervention was at a technical level.  We provided a technical argument that one should forget about those years and that it should be updated more frequently.  That was agreed at a technical level and then Ministers agreed it at a political level.  That in itself opened up additional fiscal space and it was about two years ago.  We just made our argument strongly and it was agreed upon at the Commission and at political level.  There were some positives on that front.</p></speech>

At the moment the stability programme update, SPU, is still fairly dismal.  We are still in a stranglehold and that is the way we feel as a committee.  Can we somehow use the positive figures that will have an impact in 2019 and backdate them for ourselves in order that there is a better and more expansive budget in 2018, particularly in areas like housing and health or on things we need to improve in this country?</p></speech>

There will be a couple of moving parts, as the Minister has said.  We should have those by May or June and the Government will publish the summary economic statement.  As he has said, however, they are not game changers.</p> <p>  As for all the flexibility that exists within the rules, we simply do not qualify for it because of where we are in the cycle.  Capital smoothing is an additional piece of flexibility that works for us.  For instance, capital was increased for this year of 2017, because one only takes a quarter of the increase over 2016 into account for this year.  In fact, that was one of the reasons we were able to increase the fiscal space in the couple of days that led up to the budget.  We have availed fully of the existing flexibility, from what I can see.</p></speech>

Portugal and Spain seem to be able to get away with capital adjustments.  Spain has built about 20 metros in the past ten or 15 years.  Can we take advantage of capital in the same way?</p></speech>

I hope to be in Luxembourg at a meeting, chaired by the president of the EIB, specifically about Irish-related investment projects around mid-May.  I hope we will get an agreement there that the EIB will evaluate a series of projects and cross-check them with EUROSTAT because there is no point in going down the road if we get stopped later.

The levels of debt and the debt-to-revenue ratio are still very significant.  I have asked the Minister a question on this matter two or three times.  I am looking at the 60% between the fixed rate treasury and amortising bonds and the floating rate bonds.  Should we take advantage of the current interest rate situation to refinance some of the &euro;35 billion?  We should not leave that as one of the negative contingencies for 2019-2020, whether it is this Government or the next one.

I shall mention to the NTMA that the Deputy raised the matter.  I did speak to the agency before and it is pretty happy with the policies that it has in place at present.</p> <p>  I have a note that deals with the issue that I can read for the Deputy.

The deficit for this year will be 0.4% of the GDP or approximately &euro;1 billion or less.  The borrowing plans for the NTMA are between &euro;9 billion and &euro;13 billion.  The bulk of what it is borrowing is for refinancing and is to deal with the peaks and valleys effect that the Deputy has mentioned.  If one considers what the agency raised yesterday on the markets - it may have been for five or seven years - it was definitely for a short duration but it was modelled on refinancing so that the maturities would come in during the slack years.  I will raise the matter again with the NTMA to see if there is more scope.  The agency is very conscious of it.  </p></speech>

It was good to hear him respond in such a feisty and robust form.  Since I returned to the meeting in the past 30 minutes or so, there has been a heavy emphasis on nostalgic events and recalling of events.</p> <p>  I have three questions that will not take up too much time.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.  Memories and events of the past have been mentioned.  Who can forget them?  One of the criticisms of the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration in the run up to the crisis, and the same criticism was made in the period immediately after the crash, was that the Government did not heed various advices that had been issued or the wisdom of august bodies.  We delved to see what the advices were.</p><p>The only person offering advice on events leading up to the crash was a little known economist at the time in University College Dublin, UCD, but all the major bodies such as the Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, were predicting soft landings etc.  That is why I raise this question.  I do not have the Minister's grasp of economics.  I am a psychotherapist so I bow to the Minister's superior knowledge but I do have a good memory and a good emotional memory for the events.  We do not seem to have similar conditions for a property bubble in that people are not borrowing to the same extent.  I accept that but interest rates are at a record low and that cannot last forever so people are borrowing at a very low rate.<br/><br/>For the first time in approximately 20 years I went to look at a show house - I have had no reason to look at one - in my constituency, Rathfarnham.  It is a three or four bedroom end of terrace in Ballyboden, Dublin 16, a good middle class area and the starter price is &euro;560,000.  That is a peak of the boom price, as I remember them.  I know the situation is different now.  I heard what the Minister said about the help-to-buy scheme but I am conflicted because there is significant opinion that differs with what the Minister said about the help-to-buy scheme fuelling prices.  They may not be big players in the commentary space, such as <i>DAFT.ie</i>and <i>myhome.ie</i>, which have said the help-to-buy scheme has contributed to inflation in house prices but the Governor of the Central Bank has also said it.  The Minister disagrees with him but he is a significant player in terms of offering economic advice.  He has said he does not think there can be any doubt that if one has additional capacity to enter the system there will be impact effect, even though it applies only to new builds.  He says it will drive up prices.  Could the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

I did, however, say that the connection between supply and demand is price.  If there is a shortage of supply and there is excess demand it will have an effect on price.  I would concede to the Deputy that the announcement of the help-to-buy scheme probably had a psychological effect which might have influenced prices.  Inputting in the first three months of the year an extra &euro;10 million into the market does not seem to me to affect price very much.  That is not the way it works.  There are differences of opinion and in this respect I think my opinion is as good as any other opinion that is around at present because there are all sorts of opinions.  That is not to say the Deputy's opinion is not good either.</p></speech>

This is the opinion of the Governor of the Central Bank.  If there is one lesson I have learned coming out of the crash, and I think the nation has learnt it because it is the lesson we were asked to learn, it is to listen to advice that is being offered.  It is not enough for the Minister to describe the Governor of the Central Bank as eminent and to say that he respects his opinion.  He is the Governor of the Central Bank and he has said the help-to-buy scheme is driving up house prices.  The Minister is conceding a little bit on that but I am not here to argue the point.  As a layman and as a public representative who is concerned for people who have to buy homes, I want to know what steps does the Minister think he could take?  Will the Minister take my word, when I say man to man, psychotherapist to Minister for Finance, that &euro;560,000 for an end of terrace starter home, a fine home - it does not even have an "A" energy rating, it has a "B" rating, is back to the peak prices?  I know Rathfarnham well.  What could the Minister do perhaps on the supply side to help cool it down a little bit?  I am concerned for the young constituents, as I am sure the Minister is for those in Limerick and other places, that the prices will stretch out of their reach.  This is when interest rates are at rock bottom and I would have a real concern that when they borrow, and borrow large sums that are cheap to repay now and quite cost efficient, within a year or two, when the low interest rates have maxed out at rock bottom rates and start to rise, that will have a significant impact.  As I represent my constituents I ask the Minister to please be conscious of the potential impact the help-to-buy scheme is having on the demand side.  Could he commit to anything on the supply side that would incentivise builders rather than the profit side to get into the game?</p></speech>

The Deputy put his question as if there was nothing happening on the supply side.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is Deputy Coveney.  He got an enormous budget last year of &euro;5.5 billion and has introduced dozens of supply side initiatives to help the supply of houses.  He is the Minister responsible for housing but I am sure the Deputy is familiar with that.  My job as the Minister for Finance is to provide the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with sufficient funds to fund all these schemes and to see if nuancing of tax arrangements can help the housing situation but my influence on it is marginal.  The main driver of housing policy is the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  It is incorrect to say, and I am sure the Deputy does not believe it, that there are no supply side initiatives taken when he has been introducing supply side initiatives for 12 months.  They are working.  This year he says the supply will go from 12,000 or 13,000 last year to somewhere between 18,000 and 19,000 this year.  He is predicting approximately 23,000 for next year.  The ESRI says what is required is 25,000 a year and he will not be too far off that in 2018 but of course to make up for the years when nothing or very little was built one would need to overshoot for four or five years over the 25,000.  He has taken a series of initiatives.  The Deputy should be fair to him and give him credit.</p></speech>

We cannot have that.</p><p>The point is that the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed the building regulations, which were brought in at the bottom of the recession when things were worst and they made it worse.  The price of a site is a factor in Dublin.  It is especially a factor in the cost of apartments, but it is the unit cost of the site which is the issue and the Dublin local authorities should allow another five or six storeys to be built because if one puts another 20 apartments on the same site, by going up, one reduces the unit cost of the site.  It is very simple and yet there is an absolute refusal to do it.  Consequently, there is very little apartment building, if any at all, in the area within the canals in Dublin.  Elevation is one issue and over regulation was an issue but the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed that dramatically.</p><p> All along the quays the regulation said one had to have two parking spaces for cars.  It is the one place in the country where one has every form of public transport from taxis to buses, access to Luas, and the DART is not so far away, yet two parking spaces were required for people whom one would be trying to encourage not to have cars if one was planning properly.  There was a load of crazy stuff done but it has to be dismantled.  It is not all a function of national government, quite a lot of it is on the planning side and quite a lot of it is local authority-driven.</p></speech>

I cannot track it at the moment on my phone so he should please forgive my vagueness about it.  I refer to a reply from the Department of Finance about congestion costs, but I could be wrong it might be the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which are estimated to cost the economy in Dublin approximately &euro;350 million.  It is allied to and in addition to the previous questions, which the Minister answered.  I am interested in what the Minister said about the EIB in terms of the investment potential there.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, has offered us precious little consolation when he said the future of transport in Dublin is buses given that the net additional buses received by Dublin Bus this year was 20.</p> <p>  When Transport Infrastructure Ireland was before the committee there was talk about measures that could be taken on the M50 to increase capacity for five years without extending the road but funding has not been provided for that, yet the cost of congestion in the city is estimated at approximately &euro;350 million.  Is there anything, in addition to the replies the Minister has given to previous speakers, that he can offer to Dubliners on the potential for further and future investment in transport infrastructure that is non-car related but that is public transport-related and could give them some consolation in terms of dealing with the chronic congestion in the city?  The Minister can give me a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

In terms of upcoming infrastructural investment outside of the east coast and the Dublin area in particular, the need for direct access by sea to the Continent rather than through Britain means an expansion in investment is required in the Minister's part of the world, namely Foynes, where he is originally from and a deep sea port potentially in the north west, which I heard spoken about yesterday, in my own area in the south east, Rosslare, for passenger traffic and Waterford Port for freight.  There are knock-on consequences in terms of investment in road infrastructure in particular.  The Minister will be slightly familiar with the Limerick to Waterford road which is no more than a cow track in parts.  I know of no other national primary road that passes through as many towns and villages as that one.  I also draw the Minister's attention to the Limerick to Cork road, which he mentioned, and the Cork to Waterford road, which requires upgrading.  As we face into Brexit, but also in terms of rebalancing some of the economic growth in the country as well, is there not a significant argument for investment in regional infrastructure being more necessary now than ever?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.1796" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017041300002#T01100"><p>Yes and those issues are being taken into account in the national spatial plan that is being developed.  The main route to the Continent is not direct ferry services at present, even though there is significant container traffic out of Waterford Port and Rosslare, it is using the UK as the land bridge, as it is called whereby people drive across.  I cannot see how that would not be maintained because if one looks at the situation in Italy where every day thousands of trucks drive through Switzerland in both directions carrying goods and services from Italy to Germany and France and so on and they have an arrangement whereby one seals the truck so that it does not have to be physically examined and there are legal arrangements that apply.  What I found while negotiating in Europe over the years is that if one can find a space in the European legal spectrum one can bolt a new project onto it.  It seems to me that if such traffic can be managed between Italy and across Switzerland and the bigger European countries we can continue to use the land bridge.  If there is a free trade area between the UK and the European Union there is one set of difficulties but if there are tariffs there is a bigger set of difficulties.  If there are tariffs one would need a big expansion in Dublin Port and other ports.  It would probably be prudent to have extra ferry services from the south east as well for direct access to the Continent.</p> <p>  I was talking to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, about it and he told me that if it reverted to World Trade Organization regimes they would need about four years to put the investment that would be required into the port of Dover to handle the general customs activity that would be generated.  They are looking at very long timeframes.  It depends on where it lands; if we are into a tariff situation there will be a lot of investment consequences.  If there is free trade the consequences are more limited.  To go back to a previous question, the fright we have got from Brexit should, arguably, be taken on board and we should diversify our markets and make sure we have direct access to the Continent.</p></speech>

For those who do not know me, my name is Jonathan Sugarman.  I was the risk manager for UniCredit Bank Ireland, a bank with a roughly &euro;30 billion balance sheet, which was located in the Irish Financial Services Centre in Dublin 1.  I joined the bank in May 2007.  For those unfamiliar with the term risk manager, it is like a policeman who works within a bank on behalf of the banking regulator, which in this case was the Central Bank of Ireland.  Effectively, I was there to look out for the people of Ireland.  My job and that of all risk managers in all banks, regardless of where they are located, is to ensure the regulations regarding how a bank is run are adhered to and upheld.  If they are not, it is my duty not just to my employer but also to the regulator to inform them of any activities which may not be within the limits of the regulations under which the bank operates.  In 2007, the regulations under which I operated in UniCredit Bank Ireland were unambiguous and very clear as were the penalties for any infringement which might occur.  In my case, failure to immediately notify the Central Bank of a breach of these regulations could result in a mandatory fine and-or five years in jail.</p> <p>  It is against this backdrop that I wish to talk to the committee today.  I spent the first couple of months at the bank in 2007 familiarising myself with the systems, products and internal control mechanisms.  Having previously worked for two German-owned banks in Dublin, I was well familiar with the risk management practices and the regulations which governed them.  Approximately two months into my tenure at UniCredit, I began to notice anomalies which were irregular but which happened with a frequency that suggested to me that they urgently required further investigation.  Within a very short space of time, it became commonplace for me to have daily meetings with the chief executive officer of the bank to discuss the ever increasing number of breaches of regulation that I was observing.  I was told not to worry, that these were simply IT related glitches and that there was nothing for me to worry about.  I thought this was somewhat unusual as being a risk manager I would personally suffer the full weight of the law if it were proved that I was aware of such breaches of regulations and did not report them to the Central Bank.  Needless to say, as a new employee in a new bank, I went along with the instructions of my CEO for another week or two but there was no effort whatsoever being made to prevent or investigate the real cause of these glitches.  It must be borne in mind that the relevant liquidity regulations came into force on 1 July 2007, which is two months after I started working at UniCredit, and I was only too well aware of the penalties for not complying.</p> <p>  I now refer the committee to item 6 which I have provided the committee with, which is the requirements for the management of liquidity risk that were issued by the Financial Regulator, as he was called then in 2006, to be enforced in 2007.  I refer the committee to page 24 on item 6.  It details the penalties applicable for any breach of regulations which took place after 1 July 2007.  I will quote from Irish law.  Section 58 of the Central Bank Act 1971 which refers to offences and punishments as amended by the substitution of section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1989 states that a holder of a banking licence who commits by act of omission a breach of a condition duly imposed and which relates to their licence "shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable (i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both, or (ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;50,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both".  Further down the page, one can read, "if the contravention, breach or failure in respect of which he was convicted is continued after conviction, he shall be guilty of an offence on every day on which the contravention, breach or failure continues after conviction".  That means that every single breach was a criminal act.  Section 60 of the 1971 Act contains an extension of the offending provisions.  It states "Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any wilful neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary, member of any committee of management or other controlling authority of such body or official of such body, such person shall also be guilty of the offence", which means not only am I guilty but my regulator is equally guilty once I have notified him.</p> <p>  There is no dispute of the fact that I reported a 20% liquidity breach to the Central Bank in the late summer of 2007.  I urge the committee to understand the significance of such a breach.  The following explanations should make it relatively easy to understand.  Regulation states that a breach of 1% should send alarm bells ringing and red lights flashing.  The Central Bank must be notified immediately.  In the context of driving a car, this would mean there is a speed limit of 100 km/hr.  Driving at 101 km/hr is a breach of law that has to be reported immediately to the authorities.  UniCredit Bank Ireland only bothered to oblige the law and notify the regulator when we were speeding at 120 km/hr.</p><p>The immediate questions that should have been raised by the regulator as soon as I notified it of this breach should have  been, "How on earth did you get to a 20% liquidity breach?  Were you not aware when you exceeded 5% or 10%?  Where were you when you hit 15%?"  A breach of 20% implies that the bank came perilously short of liquid assets.  The most liquid asset is cash.  The events at UniCredit in the summer of 2007 occurred against the backdrop of the first bank run that Europe had seen since the Second World War.  The entire branch network of Northern Rock in the United Kingdom had thousands of customers queuing at the door in fear that the bank was unable to return the cash that they had deposited with it.  In the meantime, the management systems at UniCredit Bank Ireland were showing serious shortages of liquidity on a regular basis.  As the members can see from the above section of the banking regulations, it would not only have been me as the risk manager who would have been liable for prosecution but also, the chief executive officer of UniCredit and, more importantly, and I cannot stress this highly enough, any other controlling authority, which in this case was and still is the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p> What I find incredulous is that my life has been utterly destroyed simply because I did the right thing but the people who are jointly liable for the failure to adhere to the regulations, which this House formulated and passed into law, got off scot free.  There were no sanctions whatsoever placed on UniCredit or more importantly, on the Central Bank of Ireland.  I remind the committee that I have been unable to work for over ten years and I am totally unemployable as a result of my upholding the law of the Republic of Ireland.</p><p> Had the regulator done its job, it is my contention that the liabilities which were placed on the shoulders of the Irish nation, specifically the blanket guarantee which was given to all the Irish banks, overnight, which was effectively a blank cheque underwritten by every citizen in the State, would not have been necessary.  This happened just a year after I resigned over the same issue of liquidity.  A year after that, the country was saddled with a &euro;64 billion debt incurred by the banks who violated the liquidity regulation, the same regulation that I had tried to warn the regulator about a year previously.</p><p> At the heart of this matter is the fact that neither the parent company in Italy nor the Italian central bank knew anything about this breach of regulation until 2010, some three years later, as can be observed in the video clip, provided to the members in item 14, in which Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, recently states this unequivocally.  The Central Bank of Ireland should have notified both of them immediately.  It is now ten years later and Mr. Draghi has said he has never heard of this.  He said that directly to Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, who is here today.  </p><p> The question that  must now be asked is: How is it that the Central Bank was remiss in carrying out its statutory function and nobody has ever been officially sanctioned because of it?  My life was destroyed but the lives of those who work and worked in the Central Bank were not.  The members of the committee must ask why and only they can ask why and get the answers.</p><p> In the recent banking inquiry with which this committee, and four members of this committee in particular, are more than familiar, another whistleblower emerged.  The particular investigation in which they were involved was the regulatory stream.  The banking inquiry whistleblower made it very clear to members of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis that they were of the opinion that the Central Bank of Ireland was being deliberately obstructive in regard to the investigation and it was alleged that the Central Bank withheld certain documentation.  This was later corroborated by a former employee of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I am aware that the banking inquiry whistleblower made several attempts to ensure that I would give evidence to the joint committee, but I fail to understand why my attendance was prohibited at that time.  The members of the committee were aware of my case and I fail to understand why it has taken the committee this long to invite me in here today.</p><p> There are a number of threads of commonality which run through all the banking systems in this country and one of them is most certainly the delay between matters of potential or actual financial malfeasance being reported and the time it takes for official Ireland to admit that it just may have an Issue that must be dealt with.  The harsh fact of the matter is that official Ireland has absolutely and completely destroyed the lives of every single whistleblower who has come forward regardless of from which organ of the State.  It took Maurice McCabe ten years of battling against the State to finally begin repairing his life because the State made it as hard as possible for him and his family.  The same goes for John Wilson and how he was treated.  I should mention the Mary Boyle case and, more recently, the cover-up of the Grace scandal.  The problem with this country is that official Ireland, those civil and public servants at the very top levels, the ones who have their hands on the levers of power, seem to be completely immune from any form of sanction, while those who do the right thing are vilified and their lives destroyed. </p><p> The reason there is such a row about getting people to pay for water, or about people lying on trolleys is that at the end of the day, the banks and their highly paid executives have always got to be paid and it will always be the poor people of Ireland who will suffer the most unless this House finally has the guts to do what is right.  That is  why I am in shock with respect to items I submitted, by 10 o'clock last Monday, for the members of the committee to see that  I had to wait until an hour before the close of business yesterday to be told that I had to redact them.</p></speech>

I must make this clear.  If I were to be in possession of a single document such as the copy of the breach that I reported to the Central Bank, that would mean that I would be in breach of my contract with my employer.</p><p>Those documents are the possessions of my employer.  I had no right to have made my own copies and would have been rightfully sued by my employer for doing so.  What I do have, and this is part of what was redacted yesterday afternoon, is my correspondence with the Central Bank of Ireland.  I still cannot understand why I was not able to give that correspondence to the committee in its entirety.  It is lamentable that it took from 10 a.m. on Monday until an hour before the close of business yesterday to tell me that I could not present the committee with those documents.</p></speech>

I went to the Garda station that is next to a petrol station and a Tesco store, between Rathgar and Ranelagh.  Members may be familiar with that Garda station which is on a corner.  I walked into the station in broad daylight, referred to Irish regulations and told garda&iacute; that I had broken the law and when I had broken it.  Hopefully there is still a record in that Garda station of that complaint.  My complaint was that I was a criminal and was there to tell garda&iacute; about a crime.  The garda with whom I dealt was frightfully helpful.  She said, "Leave it with me and we will get back to you on this".  A few weeks later I received a call informing me that my complaint had been forwarded to the Garda fraud squad.  I was told that the fraud squad had a section or a person dealing with financial fraud or finance criminality.  Never again did I hear from anybody.</p></speech>

I had two meetings with the Central Bank of Ireland which were witnessed by a barrister.  At the second meeting, the officials attending the meeting admitted to having had sight not only of the breach that I reported to them in the summer of 2007 but of further breaches that had occurred during that summer which had not been reported to anyone.  All that happened that day was that I co-signed, together with my CEO, a statement to the effect that - excuse the language - "Sure, it's grand, it's okay, we don't need to tell anyone."  These records have to be maintained for seven years.  Every document signed and produced every day is maintained for seven years.  Obviously, when the Central Bank went back and investigated, it had full sight of these daily reports.  Going back to the letter of the law which I quoted earlier, each and every breach was a crime and yet we never reported them.</p></speech>

I and the barrister accompanying me wrote to the Central Bank and asked for the minutes of our meetings.  I asked for permission in advance to record the meetings but this request was refused.  This was puzzling to me because I was the one who was coming to do the talking.  Why could I not record my own voice?  The answer was no, I could not record my own voice, so we waited for the official minutes.  We wrote to the Central Bank and received a letter, which is included in the items I sent to the committee, which says &quot;case closed&quot;.  There were no minutes, no nothing.  Three months later, there was a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>to the effect that the regulator had remained silent.  A week after that headline, all of a sudden there were minutes dated the day after the aforementioned headline appeared.  First we have the meeting, then the case is closed and then, after that newspaper headline, there are minutes which bear no relevance to what actually took place at the meeting.</p></speech>

In terms of the collapse, the overnight guarantee was put in place a year after I resigned because we had no money.  That is what the report says.  The Irish banks said that they could not open up on Monday morning because they had no liquidity.  The bank bailout that ensued meant all these banks were kept going.  I fail to understand why it was decided that a small business was of vital importance to the country but five separate boards of directors had to be maintained and paid for by the taxpayer.  These are banks that had all been run into the ground.  As an economist, my view is that we should have protected depositors up to a certain amount of money.  Given that five banks had collapsed, the State, for the sake of competition, should have taken ownership of two and slowly revived the banking system, much like what was done in Iceland.  However, if one looks at Holland and Belgium, one sees that they did something similar to what was done in Ireland in terms of Fortis Bank and Dexia.  These were merged into existing banks in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Effectively, they collapsed but they just changed their names.  I hope that answers the question in terms of collapse.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Sugarman think that the lack of interest in the admission was because these were foreign banks and that the ultimate impact of any disaster would not be felt directly by Irish consumers?  Does he think there was a different level of scrutiny of Irish banks as opposed to foreign banks, like the one in which he worked?</p></speech>

It refers to Senator Norris raising my issue in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the response of the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  Ms Barrington wrote that the allegations were of interest to German taxpayers, given that they were picking up the &euro;100 billion tab for the collapse of Hypo Real Estate following its purchase of Depfa, a German bank which was headquartered in the IFSC in Dublin.  Ms Barrington asserted that the Germans had pinned much of the blame for the bailout costs on the Irish regulator, citing its light touch regulation of Depfa.  Irish banking sources, however, pointed out that Hypo's due diligence of Depfa should have picked up any problems.  They also suggested that the Germans were trying to wash their hands of a problem partly of their own making.</p><p> At any rate the Irish taxpayer had a lucky escape when it came to Depfa as the cost of bailing it out would have come on top of the &euro;73 billion we are paying to bail out our inadequately supervised banks, and it would probably have totally bankrupted the country.</p></speech>

The first relates to an article by Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i>around Easter 2010.  In the article I am referred to as &quot;James&quot;.  The headline is: &quot;The finance manager who tried to play by the rules&quot;.  The article states:</p><blockquote>Catastrophic as this week's banking bailout figures are, they could actually have been much worse.  It is a matter of sheer luck that in 2007, before the credit crunch, a Dublin-based bank called Depfa was bought by the German financial group Hypo Real Estate.  Very few people in Ireland had ever heard of Depfa.  Although it was as German as sauerkraut, it was actually the largest bank in Ireland - bigger than AIB.  It was, in legal and regulatory terms, an entirely Irish company.  When the financial crisis unfolded, Depfa brought down Hypo.  The cost to the German government so far is &euro;102 billion.</blockquote> <p>I think that will give the committee some idea of why the people were then coerced into a bailout of roughly &euro;70 billion.</p></speech>

I have heard from several sources that I was most definitely discussed at the meetings of the banking inquiry and that my name, that of UniCredit Bank and the breaches of liquidity at UniCredit were mentioned at the banking inquiry meetings on more than one occasion.

Surely it is there for all to see, especially for committees of the Houses.  By then, Deputy Joan Burton, before she became a Minister, had raised the issue in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, as well.  Surely, if my issue appears on the publicly available records of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it is more than sufficient for committees operating within the Houses to access that information.</p></speech>

It states that although the Irish financial regulator audited the bank shortly after my resignation, it did not seem to draw any significant conclusion.  The article goes on to say that a top manager of another international bank in Dublin corroborated Roland K.'s story, and I am Roland K. in this story.  The article states that the top manager knows Roland to be a scrupulous and very conscientious manger and that he has seen evidence of the breaches at the bank.</p></speech>

Liquidity is basically how much cash there is in the till.  I do not care about whether a bank owns St. Stephen's Green or had 20 Ferraris outside because those are illiquid.  Cash is liquid.  I need to know at least twice per day, if not every ten minutes, during a crisis how much cash we have in the till.  That is my job, that is, to ensure that, according to the regulation of the Central Bank, which stipulates very clearly how to count the cash in the till, I am able to tell my bosses at any time of the day what our position is.</p></speech>

This applies to all banks operating out of the IFSC.  We are the children of wealthy and established continental European and American banks.  We know that if we are short &euro;2 billion or &euro;4 billion during the day, we can ring our parents, ask for a couple of billion euro and promise to give it back by 5 p.m. or tomorrow.  The most definitive set of accounts is what we are doing at the close of business at 5 p.m.  Every trade done after that comes into the following business day.  The close-of-business accounts tell us whether a bank had enough cash at that moment in time.  The Central Bank allows a bank to breach by 1% because Senator Burke, for example, might go to it at 4.55 p.m. because he wants &euro;250 million of the &euro;300 million credit line that it gave him.  It is the Senator's to be had, so the bank must give it to him.  Having done so, the bank might then be in breach because it would not have enough cash, which is why the Central Bank allows a 1% breach, but nothing more.  Even then, the bank must notify the Central Bank and its own audit committee immediately about how close it is sailing to the wind.</p></speech>

This was written in May 2010.  That means that in May 2010, Ms Barrington of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>contacted UniCredit Milan and asked what it had to say for itself following Senator Norris's statement that it had been in repeated breach, but it had emphatically denied that it was the bank.<br/><br/>How is it possible that three years after the events, the parent bank is claiming that the matter has nothing to do with it?  Theoretically, the bank would have told Mommy and Daddy that it got into a bit of trouble in Dublin.  Not only that, but because Jonathan Sugarman notified the regulator and given that Brian Lenihan, in his response to Senator Norris, stated that all central banks co-operated, one would assume that the Irish Central Bank would have notified its Italian counterpart, Banca d'Italia, and asked whether it knew that it had a petulant child in Dublin who did not know how to calculate liquidity and was caught with its pants down.  It is only three months ago that Mario Draghi, currently the ECB president but, at the time, the governor of Banca d'Italia, with UniCredit the biggest Italian bank on his watch, told Luke &quot;Ming&quot; Flanagan, MEP, that he had no idea what the MEP was talking about.  I have included this in my submission to the committee.  How can it be that, if everyone had done what he or she was supposed to do, Mario Draghi claimed three months ago that he had never heard of this matter or that, three years after the situation arose, the bank was emphatically denying to the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>that it was the bank to which Senator Norris referred?</p></speech>

In them, there is a clear reference in a conversation between Anglo executives and the Central Bank to breaches of liquidity.  However, that is nothing; we have just discussed it.  Where is the report?  It had to be reported immediately.  Let the public of Ireland, which bailed out this bank, see that it acted in accordance with the law when other people are being locked up for not having a television licence.  Let us see that Anglo at least attempted to operate under the terms of the licence and notified the Central Bank on paper that it was in breach but, no, all we have is a phone call.

In the Financial Regulator there were teams and each team was assigned to particular banks.  Obviously, I dealt with the team assigned to UniCredit Bank Ireland.  I urge the Deputy to look at today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which states the Central Bank found weak controls at some IFSC banks.  The article states the &quot;inspectors found problems including mistakes in the calculation of credit Risk Weighted Assets ..., the failure to control weaknesses and inadequate resources in the regulatory reporting function&quot;.  This is ten years later and appears in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p></speech>

We might wake up tomorrow morning and discover that we need another blanket guarantee if we still cannot calculate.  I believe that online there was further detail on this item in <i>The Irish Times</i>which says that some of these calculations are being done manually.  This is incredible: multibillion euro banks are doing their calculations of capital and risk weighted assets basically on the back of a coaster.  People are feeding in numbers to spreadsheets and saying here is the figure.  This is happening in Dublin today.  What has changed?</p></speech>

The latter overheated and that led to the establishment of NAMA to deal with the Irish banks' loan books.  Subsequently, there was a substantial commercial real estate sector in the non-Irish domiciled banks.  Does Mr. Sugarman have any knowledge of the commercial real estate sector today not, perhaps, being balanced as it should be?  I asked the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, the same question last week.</p></speech>

I could not emphasise more, let us not forget and as the Deputy says, that the entire downfall of the Irish banking system was on account of commercial property real estate.  The price tag for that was &euro;65 billion or &euro;70 billion, for all of these banks put together.</p></speech>

Yet this one bank alone, operating from the IFSC, has cost &euro;100 billion.  It is incredibly important that people understand the magnitude of business that is carried out every day in the IFSC and, as Fintan O&rsquo;Toole says, it is by sheer chance that we, the citizens of Ireland, did not have to foot the bill for that &euro;100 billion as well.  The anguish of Irish citizens today, between hospitals shutting down, water charges, etc., is only because of the &euro;65 billion.  Can the Deputy imagine if we had been saddled with that &euro;100 billion as well?  That is only for one bank.</p></speech>

The question is: when the bank made that call, what did it tell its parents about why it needed the money?  I could have easily said that Deputy D'Arcy has just asked us for a loan of &euro;500 million but I have only &euro;350 million so can Mummy and Daddy in Milan give me another &euro;150 million because this is a really good deal.

The dynamic between parent banks and their subsidiary children banks are, I am sure, unique to each but there are formal legal regulations that govern this.  It is not by chance that Deutsche Bank turns up here and says it wants to open a bank.  Who is Deutsche Bank?  There are forms, regulations, procedures for all of this.  That is why I am surprised that Mr. Lenihan said to Senator Norris that the central banks fully co-operate with one another yet, when contacted, the Governor, Mr. Draghi, said he had never heard of this.</p></speech>

As can be seen, these regulations were issued in 2006.  This is item No. 6 of what I provided to the committee.  I ask committee members to turn to section 9.4, in which it says that it relates to the implementation of these new regulations.  Although the letter of regulation was issued in June 2006, if members look at the last paragraph at the bottom of page 23, it says that the revised liquidity report will be prepared in parallel with the existing requirements for a six-month period commencing January 2007.  If members look at the last sentence in that paragraph, it is that limits on the level of maturity mismatch - that is bank-talk for liquidity - will take effect on the completion of the six-month parallel run in 2007.  That is to say that both calculations are done in the six-month parallel run.  From 1 July 2007, these new regulations and methods were the only ones that applied.  It is significant that three years later, we saw that the regulator, still called the Financial Regulator, re-issued the same requirements.  It says "Requirements for the Management of Liquidity Risk".  This time, it was issued in June 2009.</p> <p>  I ask the Chairman to turn to section 9.  It is entitled "Reporting".  One can see, if the two sections from these regulations - which were three years apart - are compared, that section 9 is on reporting, reporting obligations etc.  Section 9.1 is "Licensed Credit Institutions", section 9.2 is "Banking Groups", section 9.3 is "Branches of EEA and non-EEA Banks".  I dare the Chairman to find section 9.4, on implementation.  There is no reference in the 2009 legislation to this being law in Ireland in 2007.  Reference will be found, in the preamble, to banking Acts going all the way back to 1942, 1971, 1989 and 2001.  Nowhere in this document will one find a reference to the year 2007.  The simple reason for that is that none of this was upheld.  There is only one silly man, Jonathan Sugarman, who took this law seriously.</p><p>A year after he resigned, we had a pile up on the M1 called the overnight guarantee so we better reissue the law and pretend it never existed.</p></speech>

The Central Bank admitted to me at our meeting that it had sight of other breaches that had gone unreported, that is, it had seen other crimes during my tenure at UniCredit.

One of the Chairman's questions that Mr. Sugarman answered was regarding staff.  Mr. Sugarman said that a company cannot force an employee to commit a crime.  When he said that, did he mean that he could not be forced to commit a crime by the CEO or the directors of the bank or that he could not ask the staff members who were under him to commit a crime?</p></speech>

I will be more than happy to furnish the committee with the document in which my position was ratified.  I therefore bear sole or joint responsibility with the CEO for everything that goes on in that bank.  If I have to repeatedly sign off liquidity figures that are breaches and the bank does not report them to the Central Bank, that is a crime.</p></speech>

That licence allows the bank to conduct its affairs as a bank within the regulations, limits and laws of the Republic of Ireland.  If every bank had adhered to those laws, we never would have found ourselves in a position where we had to either give the banks an overnight guarantee or bail them out for &euro;65 billion.  How on earth did we arrive at such a situation?  Not only were market risks ignored, because liquidity is a market risk, but credit risks were also ignored, which is why there were decisions being made about forking out &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million without any credit analysis.  In the same way that my job is about market risk analysis, there is a department in the bank that carries out credit analysis.  Is it a wise idea to give &euro;100 million to this developer to build X number of houses on a bog?</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Maria Egan, who is a pharmacist in the medicines and controlled drugs unit.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide the Department of Health&rsquo;s observations on the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016.</p> <p>  By way of background, this Private Members' Bill was published by Deputy Gino Kenny and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in July 2016.  Much of the text is similar to that contained in the Cannabis Regulation Bill 2013 published by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, though there are important differences between the two Bills.  In early November the Minister for Health announced a review of policy on the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  He requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide him with expert advice.  On 1 December, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann debated Deputy Kenny's Bill.  During the debate the Minister expressed his concerns about elements of the Bill and noted he was awaiting the HPRA&rsquo;s report on medicinal cannabis.  The Bill passed Second Stage and was referred to the select committee.  The Minister received the HPRA&rsquo;s report on 31 January.  He published the report on 10 February and announced that he will establish a medicinal cannabis access programme for certain medical conditions.  Last month the Minister established an expert reference group which is drafting guidelines to facilitate the prescription, supply and use of cannabis treatments for qualifying patients under the access programme.</p> <p>  The regulation of medicinal products and drugs is currently achieved by an array of enactments, including the Misuse of Drugs Acts, the Irish Medicines Board Acts and the Pharmacy Act, all of which aim to ensure medicines that reach the patient are of an acceptably high quality and are safe and effective for use by that patient.  The research, manufacture, marketing, distribution and promotion of medicinal products is regulated by European Union legislation, which has been implemented in Ireland by various regulations and orders.  The misuse of drugs framework already defines systems of control for the production, supply, import, export, record-keeping, research and destruction of controlled substances, including cannabis and its psychoactive extracts.  It also sets out the criminal sanctions that apply for possession, sale, supply or trafficking in controlled substances, including cannabis.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be aware that cannabis is currently a schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act and it is the most widely used illegal drug in Ireland.  Cannabis is not an authorised medicine and it has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  It is important to note that while there is a view that there is a legal impediment to prescribing cannabis, it is not the case.  The Minister for Health may grant a licence for cannabis, containing THC, where the licence application has been endorsed by a consultant.</p> <p>   The Department is of the view that the current Bill is not necessary and is not in the public interest as it proposes to establish a parallel regulatory process for cannabis and undermines the regulatory frameworks already in place for controlled drugs, medicines authorisation and the operation and oversight of retail pharmacies.  The Bill proposes to establish two new agencies, one of which, the cannabis regulation authority, will to a large extent duplicate functions already being carried out by other State agencies, in particular the HPRA and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</p> <p>  While the Department does not believe the legislation is appropriate or necessary, should the Oireachtas decide to proceed with the Bill, there are a number of issues which we would like to bring to its attention.  I have already referred to the cannabis regulation authority which is dealt with in Part 2 of the Bill and our concern that it establishes a parallel system of regulation cutting across the functions of existing agencies.</p><p>We are also concerned about the reference to the development of a consumer oriented licensing system in section 6(2)(b).  Cannabis is not a normal consumer product; it is a controlled drug.  We must ensure that any system that is established is patient oriented rather than consumer oriented and that it protects patients and the wider public.</p><p> There is a reference to fees in respect of the grant of a retail licence in section 27.  Retail licences are confined to pharmacies.  It is noted that retail pharmacies already pay a fee to register with the PSI and it difficult to see the justification for this additional fee on pharmacies to support a system of parallel regulation by the cannabis regulation authority.  There is also a reference to fees for &ldquo;signs relating to a licence&rdquo; in section 27(3).  This is a puzzling reference and suggests that pharmacies could be advertising by way of signage that they are licensed to sell cannabis products.  In our view, unless it is expected that a very large number of licences will be issued, the fee income is unlikely to meet the running costs of the proposed authority.</p><p> Part 3 establishes a cannabis research institute.  In the view of the Department, it is not necessary to establish such an institute.  There is already a considerable amount of research into the illegal or recreational use of cannabis.  If a researcher wishes to conduct clinical trials on cannabis, that is already permitted under existing legislation.</p><p> We note that one of the functions of the institute is to encourage employers to review drug-free workplace policies, as provided for in section 12(1)(b).  There are good reasons many employers have drug-free policies in place and we are unclear as to why a research institute would encourage them to review these policies.</p><p> We also note that it is a function of the institute, in section 12(1), to commission and publish research in the areas of safety, risks and benefits of medicinal and-or recreational use.  We are unclear why the institute would be mandated to commission research into the benefits of recreational cannabis.  There is a further reference to recreational cannabis in section 41.</p><p> Section 23(1) deals with disqualifications for holding a licence on conviction of certain offences.  It is noted that trafficking or sale or supply of illegal drugs is not specifically mentioned and that, according to section 23(7), a conviction for possessing cannabis will not disqualify a person from being granted or continuing to hold a licence under this legislation.</p><p> The Department notes that in Part 7, it is intended that a doctor will issue a certificate to patients, as provided for in section 32.  In the interests of patient safety, we believe that a prescription is more appropriate and that it should include details that are currently required to be present on prescriptions for controlled drugs.  The Department notes that the HPRA report recommends that for the access programme, patients should be under the care of a consultant and we would support this position.</p><p> The Department is particularly concerned about section 42 which removes cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  This means that possession, sale or supply of cannabis would no longer be an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Cannabis would no longer be a controlled substance with the misuse of drugs framework.  While there are a number of offences created in the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill in sections 8, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 39, I would point out that there are no penalties in terms of fines or imprisonment specified for any of the offences outlined in this Bill.</p><p> There are other issues of concern and also technical problems with the Bill, for example, the use of the imperial system rather than the metric system in sections 16, 17 and 33.  However, it would take some time to go through the Bill on a section by section basis.</p><p> To conclude, the basic position of the Department is that we do not see this Bill as being necessary or in the public interest.  Cannabis has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients.  The Bill places the regulation and oversight of medicinal cannabis under a unique and separate legislative and regulatory framework from all other health products.  This Bill attempts to circumvent existing regulatory regimes and establish a parallel system for cannabis.  Given that there is currently insufficient clinical evidence in respect of the efficacy and safety of many cannabis products we should proceed cautiously.  It is the view of the Minister for Health and the Department that at this time, the cannabis access programme is the responsible way to proceed.</p><p> I thank the Chair.  We will be happy to address any follow up questions.</p></speech>

I am the registrar and chief officer of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  I am joined today by Dr. Cora Nestor, head of pharmacy practice development with the PSI.<br/><br/>I will begin by explaining the role of the PSI as the pharmacy regulator.  I will then make some general points on the Minister&rsquo;s recently announced scheme to provide access to cannabis for medical reasons, followed by some specific points on proposed provisions in the Bill.  I will keep my remarks relatively brief and we will, of course, be happy to take questions from the committee.<br/><br/>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is the statutory regulator of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland and is established as a public body under the provisions of the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The PSI&rsquo;s core mission is to work to protect and promote the health, safety and well-being of patients and the public.  The PSI has a range of functions, established under legislation, which together create a regulatory framework intended to ensure the safety of patients and the public as users of pharmacy services.  Our functions include maintaining the registers of pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies or retail pharmacy businesses, which is the terminology used in the Act.  We also set the requirements for pharmacists&rsquo; education, their continuing professional development and for their standards of professional conduct.<br/><br/>As part of our regulatory remit, we inspect retail pharmacy businesses to assess compliance with pharmacy, medicines, including veterinary medicines, and controlled drugs legislation.  We have powers to initiate investigations where we have reason to believe there may be serious non-compliance.  These inspections and investigations may involve co-operation with other relevant public bodies and may also lead to prosecution of persons and businesses who have committed offences under relevant provisions.  In the case of individual pharmacists about whom there is a serious concern, or a complaint made as to their fitness to practice, the PSI can initiate statutory conduct proceedings which, after due process, can lead to sanctions being imposed on individual pharmacists and-or restrictions being placed on their practice.  The PSI is, by law, independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.  For public accountability purposes, the PSI operates under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The PSI is governed by a 21 member council appointed by the Minister for Health.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, on 10 February the Minister published the report, Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review, which had been produced at his request by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  I know that the committee has previously heard from the HPRA in respect of the report and its specific recommendations.  As the pharmacy regulator, the PSI does not have any direct role in the scientific review and approvals process for medicines.  However, given the role of the PSI as the regulator of the profession responsible for medicines supply, it is relevant to state that the PSI agrees with the HPRA statement to this committee on 7 March that, &quot;The best outcome for patients is the development of authorised ... cannabis-based medicines where the safety, effectiveness and quality can be assured, and understood by the patient and health care professionals.&quot;<br/><br/>In circumstances where cannabis products may be made available to meet specific patient need outside of the normal medicines authorisation process, the PSI agrees with the careful and prudent recommendation of the HPRA report, and the subsequent decision of the Minister, that a controlled access programme be established.  The PSI also agrees that the operation of the programme should involve careful monitoring, including the registration of patients, doctors and pharmacists who are participating in the programme.<br/><br/>On the use of cannabis for medical reasons, the PSI also notes the advice provided to the Minister for Health by the Chief Medical Officer, as published by the Department of Health on 6 March 2017.  In that advice, the CMO refers to the central role played by doctors and pharmacists in ensuring the safe and effective use of any drug that is prescribed.  He goes on to say:</p><blockquote>In establishing an access programme for medical cannabis, it is therefore critical that the views of these professionals, through their professional bodies, are considered.  Efforts are underway to ensure that the planned access programme reflects those views and that the roles and responsibilities of doctors and pharmacists in prescribing and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes are clarified prior to its establishment.</blockquote><p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, as the pharmacy regulator, welcomes and support this engagement process and we are actively involved in the deliberations of the expert reference group which has been established.  The objectives of PSI&rsquo;s involvement are primarily focused on ensuring that the access scheme works for patients who are accessing cannabis for medical use under the scheme and that those patients can have their prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists in a timely, effective and safe way.</p><p> There are two specific points that PSI wishes to make on the Bill.  The role of the PSI is primarily to implement pharmacy and medicines law as enacted.  Hence I will leave it to my colleagues from the Department of Health to address in detail the provisions in Deputy Gino Kenny&rsquo;s Bill and what amendments the Department believes may be required, which Mr. Eugene Lennon addressed earlier.  I will make two points which are intended to be helpful to the committee in its consideration of the Bill.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, the PSI operates the regulatory framework for pharmacists and pharmacies as prescribed in the Pharmacy Act 2007 and regulations made thereunder.  The PSI has been operating these provisions for ten years and our experience is that the regulatory framework is robust and works to protect the public.  The PSI believes that the current system of regulation is capable, subject to the views of the expert reference group, of regulating the supply of cannabis for medical use under the controlled access programme.  In so far as the Bill proposes that a parallel retail licensing scheme, including additional statutory inspections, would apply to registered retail pharmacy businesses, the PSI would regard this as an unnecessary duplication of existing provisions which are already well-proven in practice.</p><p> A central concern for the PSI is to ensure the public can rely on the professionalism of pharmacists and the quality of regulated pharmacy businesses when seeking to have medicines dispensed on foot of prescriptions from authorised prescribers.  In so far as the Bill proposes a system of medical certificates as being the basis on which supply would be made by a retail pharmacy business, the PSI is strongly of the view that moving away from the current requirements whereby medicine and controlled drugs can only be supplied on foot of an original and valid prescription, signed and dated by the prescriber, would represent a weakening of the overall regulatory control framework and an unnecessary deviation from well-established practice.</p><p> I assure the committee that the PSI, as the statutory and independent pharmacy regulator, takes its responsibilities towards public safety seriously and is committed to ensuring pharmacists and pharmacies can be trusted by patients and the public to provide safe and reliable pharmacy services.  The PSI is also committed to the well-being of the public and, in this regard, is playing an appropriate and assistive role in the design and implementation of the Minister&rsquo;s access programme for cannabis for medical use.  Once the access scheme is established, the PSI will ensure pharmacies and pharmacists comply with the provisions of the programme and we will also ensure pharmacists are fully aware of their duties and responsibilities to patients under the terms of the programme.  The PSI believes that the access programme can operate effectively within the current regulatory framework under the Pharmacy Act 2007 and related medicines and controlled drugs legislation.</p><p> I hope my opening statement has been helpful.  I thank the committee for its invitation here today and both I and Dr. Cora Nestor are happy to assist further by taking any questions which members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, he advised that the Bill seeks to set up a parallel regulatory process and that he believes this undermines the regulatory frameworks already in place for controlled drugs.  Would it be Mr. Lennon's view that the existing regulatory framework would be up to the task of regulating cannabis and that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, would be able to take on that task?</p></speech>

Wholesale distributors for medicinal products, including for distribution of controlled drugs, are already registered with the HPRA.  The HPRA has a whole range of functions with regard to a controlled drug like cannabis or a medicinal product, which some people would see cannabis as.  Those functions are under the remit of the HPRA already.  We seem to be setting up quite an elaborate parallel system.  We are talking about licences for retail pharmacies here already.  They are already registered with the PSI.  There is a whole system for this.  The only thing not currently dealt with is the provision in this Bill for cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes.  That is not Government policy at the moment and is the only provision that other State agencies are not dealing with at the moment.</p></speech>

I presume that will produce guidelines about how this is going to be managed from now on with regard to the prescribing and use of medicinal cannabis.  What is Mr. Lennon's view on the timescale for when the expert group will be reporting back?  Have we any idea of what kind of structure we are talking about?  For argument's sake, I have met a number of people who are using medicinal cannabis at the moment, though not through any regulation.  I understand that quite a number of people are in that position.  If we have an expert group that gives guidelines, when will that expert group report back?  I presume there would be a large number of applications initially.  Would it be able to deal with those?  What kind of structure is it envisaged will be established to deal with those applications?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#E01100"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and I have two retail pharmacy businesses registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  I am obviously a pharmacist.</p> <p>  I will refer to the access programme before I look at the Bill, and perhaps somebody from the Department could outline this matter very clearly to us.  My understanding is - perhaps I have misinterpreted it - that before any of this conversation started in recent times, with the advent of the Bill, the mechanism has always been there for an Irish-registered medical consultant to apply to the Minister for Health for access to a schedule 1 controlled drug under specific circumstances for a named patient under the consultant's care if the consultant is to dispense and monitor those.  There is and always has been a facility for an Irish-registered medical consultant to apply to the Minister before any access programme starts.  I would like that to be clarified for the committee.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke brought up the issue of the access programme.  I would like to know where we are and where we are going with that.  Three conditions are specified and my understanding is that it is not just three.  There are three now and there would be a view to including other conditions or indications as more data emerge.</p><p>Will the witnesses clarify the position?  The provision is not necessary in light of the fact that people can access this product if they have a proper prescription from the registered consultant.</p><p> I have an issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality being listed in the first section as opposed to the Minister for Health.  Is it not the latter who has the overriding power?</p><p> I have concerns about referring to the cohort of patients who might require this as "consumers".  They are patients.  Regardless of anything else, this is still a Schedule 1 controlled substance.  That is done to guarantee public safety, which Mr. Byrne mentioned was one of our roles.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly referred to research.  It is my understanding that there is no barrier to research in that universities can get special exemptions for it.  We would never get anywhere if we did not have exemptions, particularly as we could not trial a drug.  Will the witnesses clarify the position in that regard?</p><p> Offences are listed in section 8, the final line of which reads, "is guilty of an offence."  Perhaps I have missed it and someone from the Department will guide me, but is there a penalty - the word "penalty" is sensitive for some of us - for these offences?</p><p> As a pharmacist and a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I have concerns about the functions of the institute listed under section 12(1)(a)(i), which refers to "medicinal and/or recreational use".  It is strange that a Bill with "Medicinal" in its Title swings into a recreational format.  The so-called benefits of recreational use are a different conversation to the medicinal framework.</p><p> We have a very robust system of assessing the safety risks of medicines.  In my academic days, it used to be referred to - perhaps this is no longer the case - as the Swiss cheese theory.  We do not want the holes to line up and something to slip through that would damage patient health.  This subsection circumvents the rule that all of us in the field have worked hard to get right in order to protect patient safety.  Any shifting of those regulations could leave us with the Swiss cheese effect even though our first job is to do no harm.</p><p> The systems regulating the sale and supply of controlled drugs are robust and pharmacists must comply with the regulatory framework.  The public may not know it, but we take controlled drugs seriously.  We cannot have baskets of them lying on the counter.  Every tablet must be accounted for.  If one goes missing, the Garda needs to be called.  The destruction of controlled drugs must be monitored.  Let us say that cannabis is moved from being a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 2 drug.  Speaking in a professional capacity and assuming we can get concentrations and dosages right, the current framework is suitable and this substance could be slapped down on top of it.</p><p> I am not being sarcastic, but I do not understand the reference to drug-free workplace policies.  I hope that the consultant performing my operation or the pilot flying my plane is not using cannabis.  There must be a distinction between something that is okay and something that, as a psychoactive substance, will impair judgment.  We must be careful.</p><p> As I mentioned last week, it is currently the case that subscription medicines cannot be promoted to the public.  I cannot understand why there would be different rules for any Schedule 1 drug even if it is moving to another Schedule.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me on the situation.</p><p> I wish to address the dosing of medicines.  Perhaps Ms Egan will explain something.  Just because something has been around for a long time does not mean that it is all right.  Aspirin comes from the willow - I hope I am correct in that - and people gave children baby aspirin until recently.  That moved to age six and then 16 in my time.  Just because something is a naturally occurring product does not mean that it is okay.  For example, one will find out what happens if one eats enough foxglove.  Codeine used to be given to breastfeeding mothers but that changed in the period between my second and third children being born.  We are constantly building on evidence.  Once a drug is authorised, the yellow card reporting system keeps updating our data with what we learn.  All of this is done in the interest of public safety.</p><p> Perhaps one of the pharmacists will outline to the committee that, from a pharmacokinetics point of view, children are not small adults.  Their metabolic processes and how they process drugs are different.  If a child is one quarter my size, I cannot just quarter the dose.  Perhaps someone will articulate the distinct pharmacokinetic difference between a child's metabolism and that of an adult.</p><p> Someone might enlighten me as to why there are references to the imperial system of measurement, for example, ounces.  I do not understand why we would measure anything in ounces.  I am very concerned about the lack of detail on dosing and concentration.  As a pharmacist, I would find it difficult to dispense something if I did not know what it contained.</p><p> I will add something before I drive everyone completely mad.</p><p>My understanding is that if this Bill goes to the D&aacute;il and is voted through, any doctor would be able to prescribe cannabis for any patient, for any condition, anywhere in this country.  That includes children and pregnant women, breast-feeding women and people on multiple medications.  When we dispense we look at dosage, indications, side effects, contra-indications and interactions with other medicines, as well as people with reduced kidney and liver function, whether over time, because of age or because of other diseases.  This is of great concern to me.  When the HPRA authorises something, it rubber-stamps it as being okay.  It is not okay to be ingesting cannabis, either by eating it, smoking it or taking it transdermally while also breast-feeding a neonate, as it is deposited in breast milk.  The role of the HPRA is to protect public safety and help health care professionals to make decisions in the interests of the public.</p><p> The other issues include different registering and I do not see why the framework is any different.  As a pharmacist, I have serious concerns about this Bill.  I have other views on the decriminalisation and rescheduling of drugs but my main issue is with the use of the word "medicinal".  I am concerned that we would weaken our regulatory framework in any way and expose the public to adverse effects.</p></speech>

I agree that all medicines have their danger levels and we are always advised that it is dangerous to overdose.  However, I am most worried about health.  As legislators, we have a very important role in the health and well-being of the community.  If our health experts and our regulatory authorities are not happy and if they specify their reasons, we have to take it into account as our responsibilities are to the public at large.  There has been more than one occasion on which particular procedures, which had the<i>imprimatur</i>of the authorities, were followed but wrongly so, as it later transpired, so we have a duty to ensure that whatever we authorise must be clear and we must have due regard to the expert information we get from the authorities whose job is to protect public health and well-being and the public good.  There are potential legal liabilities and there is a possibility of the public making claims as a result of proceeding in a direction that is later proved to have been not in the public interest.</p><p>As a legislator, I have no hesitation in saying that I have to be bound by the medical and expert opinion given to us.  At the moment, that indicates to me that this Bill, as proposed, is not satisfactory and not acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Lennon" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#G00300"><p>I will ask my colleague, Ms Egan, to respond to the questions from Senator Burke and Deputy O'Connell on the work of the expert reference group.  I confirm that, as Deputy O'Connell said, a system is in place for a licence to be issued for the prescription, possession and importation of cannabis-based treatments that contain THC if that application for a licence is endorsed by a consultant.  As we said, a licence has been issued so a system is in place under current legislation.</p> <p>  The Deputy is also right that the legislation should refer to the Minister for Health because it concerns controlled drugs and medicinal products.  On the question of penalties, a lot of offences are listed in this Bill and it removes cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act.  However, while there are offences under this Bill, there are no penalties, no terms of imprisonment and no fines for any of those offences so there is no deterrent effect.</p> <p>  Ms Egan and our PSI colleagues will say a bit more about protecting children and women but these are issues which the expert reference group will look at.  The expert group will focus initially on cannabis products being made available for the three conditions outlined by the Minister on 10 February but it is essential that it is not closed off from other conditions in the future.  We have to provide guidelines for clinicians and pharmacists and information for patients so that we protect them.  This is an unauthorised and unregulated product so we have to be cautious and prudent in setting up a scheme to make it available to members of the public.  I agree that we should not see patients as consumers in a market system. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Egan" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#G00400"><p>I will put the reason for the cannabis access programme into a bit of context.  The evidence for the effectiveness of cannabis, which is being discussed in the public domain at the moment, in treating a number of conditions, including curing some serious medical conditions, is anecdotal and such an approach ignores the fact that the scientific data supporting them do not exist.  As a result of these concerns it is very important that the access programme draws on the expertise of medical specialists who are responsible for the management of the qualifying patient groups.</p> <p>  The HPRA's report concluded that robust scientific evidence on safety and effectiveness does not support the use of cannabis for clinical indications other than in very limited cases.  Its review concluded that the cannabis access programme that is being established could include access to cannabis-based therapies for the treatment of patients with spasticity associated with MS, resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; and severe refractory treatment-resistant epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anti-convulsant medications.  Under the access programme, patients with a diagnosis of any of these medical conditions will be under the care of a specialist consultant.  We would all agree that the use of cannabis products in patients, especially children, with these very serious medical conditions should only be permitted under the direction and supervision of a specialist doctor.  This is particularly important given that very few cannabis products are authorised as medicines.</p><p>As my colleague has already said, they have not gone through the normal regulatory approval process for medicines which are, of course, designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  Through our work in setting up the cannabis access programme, we are engaging with clinicians, patients and pharmacists who will be central to the work of drawing up guidelines on the safe use of cannabis for those patients who will be prescribed these treatments through the access programme.  A reference group has been established and is being independently chaired by Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan, the director of health technology assessment at HIQA.  She is also an assistant professor in pharmacoeconomics at Trinity College Dublin.</p><p> The aim of the group is to produce operational, clinical and practice guidelines for the access programme for medicinal cannabis in Ireland and to answer many of the operational questions that have been identified to date.  This process is being informed by the HPRA report.  The membership of that group draws on a broad range of representation from areas including oncology, palliative care, anaesthesiology and general practice.  There are two patient representatives on the group.  It includes adult and paediatric neurology, multiple sclerosis, psychiatry, pharmacy practice, the pharmacy regulator, health care ethics, a health technology assessor and the health products regulator and ourselves.  The reference group began its work on 30 March and it is making progress on the drafting of the guidelines.</p><p> As well as having regard to the HPRA report, the group will also be guided by other international scientific evidence in developing these operational guidelines and implementing the programme.  The focus of the work is to provide an operational framework as to how the scheme will work into the future.  It needs to address clear questions such as the clinical criteria for patients accessing cannabis for medicinal purposes.  It will include areas such as the use of any of these particular products in specific patient populations such as expectant mothers or whether there would be contra-indications for specific patient populations.</p><p> The cannabis access programme will be established but ultimately the decision on the appropriate course of treatment for any patient will be a matter for the clinician treating that patient and the Minister for Health would not have a role at that stage.  Somebody asked how long it will take to finalise the guidelines.  In announcing this programme, the Minister has requested that the group complete its work by the end of June this year so the access programme can be up and running as soon as possible.  This work is well under way but it will take time to generate the answers to these fundamental and very important operational issues that need to be addressed.  There is also the question of legislation that will be required to underpin the programme.</p><p> Deputy O'Connell asked about other conditions that were not included in the HPRA report.  Whereas the HPRA report did not conclude that certain other indications should be facilitated through the cannabis access programme, this does not mean patients cannot access such treatments if the consultant deems it appropriate.  My colleague has already explained that the licence application process remains open to a consultant to apply for a named patient if assurance can be provided that the treatment will be monitored and overseen for that patient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Byrne" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#H00200"><p>To follow up on the comments from the Department of Health officials, the position of the PSI is as set out in our statement.  We very much support the work to develop the access programme and the members of staff of the PSI are involved with that work.  We are very committed to ensuring our contribution to that work is very much focused, as I stated earlier in my statement, on the principle that the access scheme will work for patients accessing cannabis for medical use.  From the point of view of supply being made through registered pharmacies by registered pharmacists, all of that would be on a safe, sustainable and proper footing.  In exercising their professional judgment, pharmacists should do so in circumstances where there is as much clarity as possible in the decisions they make.  A registered pharmacy is not just a shop and it is very important to say it is a particular type of service.  It is governed by very clear regulatory requirements as to how the service operates.  With regard to the dispensary aspect of a pharmacy in particular, it would operate under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, who is subject to accountability requirements of the PSI and a statutory code of conduct.  Everything the pharmacist does happens within the regulated entity and the pharmacist exercises his or her professional judgment at all times.  The PSI position is that this creates an appropriate scheme of regulation that is focused very clearly on the safety of the public.  The code of conduct goes into these matters in great detail and the PSI's role is to ensure those mechanisms work in practice.</p> <p>  In circumstances where we are looking at an access programme that represents a degree of change to existing circumstances, we have no reason to believe that pharmacists in general would not be disposed to following the PSI concept of engaging in and taking part in developments that are about trying to meet patient need in new and different kinds of ways.  At all times this desire would be balanced with the need to maintain public safety.  The balance is not easy or simple and the deliberations of the committee are very much highlighting that complexity.  Our role is to try to be part of that balancing discussion while bringing our expertise and experience to bear on that.</p> <p>  In summary, we believe the access programme accords with those kinds of principles and the requirements of public safety.  We are very keen to be involved in ensuring it delivers for patients who come to a pharmacy with a prescription so they can have the prescription dispensed in a safe and effective way.</p></speech>

There is a reference to the changes for codeine in the context of lactating mothers and the shifting of the age for aspirin.  It is important to get the message out there that just because something grows in a field, it does not mean it is okay.  I would like the witnesses to briefly outline how we constantly look at our data and just because something is a plant does not mean it is fine.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Connell has stated, even when a product receives approval from the medicines regulator, it does not mean the monitoring stops there.  It is continuously monitored in the wider population.</p><p>The HPRA oversees a pharmacovigilance system for all medicinal products.  Some products are particularly high risk.  It is the responsibility of the pharmacist to ensure patients are made aware of any side effects they may experience and what to do if they experience those side effects.  Patients are also encouraged to report their experiences to their doctor or the pharmacist.  This information is constantly collated and reviewed.  At national and European levels, medicines are constantly reviewed to determine whether they remain safe for use and to ensure their benefits continue to outweigh the risks.  We are constantly learning, particularly so in terms of products such as the one we are discussing, because they are different.  While they remain different they need to be monitored by the experts to ensure if they are to be used they are safe to use.</p></speech>

In terms of the supply of products, a pharmacist must be capable of calculating the dose of a product, advising the patient on how to use it and on any influence it might have on other medicines they are taking and on other issues such as interactions with food and so on.  In regard to vigilance and the access programme, my understanding is that the HPRA's recommendation is that data on patients going through the programme should be collated.  There would be an opportunity arising from the access programme to collect data and to continuously learn in regard to the safety profile which the HPRA says has not been established.</p></speech>

Some of the technical issues have been covered by other Deputies and Senators.  My questions relate to the Bill and the Health Products Regulatory Authority's recommendation on the access programme.  </p> <p>  When the Department of Health was asked for its views on the Bill did the Chief Medical Officer have any input in that regard?  Did that office express any particular views on this Bill as proposed and on the broader issue of the HPRA's recommendations on the access programme or were its views sought?</p> <p>  With regard to the European Medicines Agency and its recommendations, does it follow suit that if a medicine is recommended by the European Medicines Agency the Health Products Regulatory Authority is obliged to licence use of the product in this State or does the European Medicines Agency supersede the Health Products Regulatory Authority?  What is the relationship between the two agencies in terms of authorisation for the use of any drug or medicine?</p> <p>  Mr. Lennon mentioned in his opening remarks on the Bill that the Department is of the view that it is not necessary and is not in the public interest.  Is the Bill not in public interest because it proposes to establish parallel regulatory authorities or because of concern about health implications?  Perhaps Mr. Lennon would elaborate on that issue.</p> <p>  On the access programme, is there sufficient architecture in place in terms of regulation to allow for the dissemination of cannabis for medicinal purposes through the pharmacies or is additional regulation or legislation required to fulfil the HPRA access programme recommendations?  </p> <p>  The report states that there is evidence to suggest that this product could be beneficial in the treatment of pain, although some of that evidence is not supported by broad clinical trials.  Does the HPRA continually analyse the clinical evidence produced on a regular basis in regard to all products and medicines and does it have the capacity to monitor the international evidence in that regard, be it in favour or otherwise of a health product currently being authorised in the State through an access programme or the pharmacies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#J00500"><p>The term "expertise" has been used a lot.  What specific experience, knowledge or expertise do the Department of Health officials or the PSI representatives have in the area of medicinal cannabis, research in that area or clinical expertise in the specific area of medicinal cannabis products?  My understanding - I am happy to be contradicted - is that they have no such knowledge, expertise or experience.  Also, what specific experience, knowledge or expertise does the HPRA have in the area of medicinal cannabis products because it has cited none in its report and to my knowledge it has none.  Again, I am happy to be contradicted.</p> <p>  Why do the Department of Health recommendations run counter to the evidence provided by people who have extensive knowledge and expertise in the area of medicinal cannabis, namely, Professor Mike Barnes, consultant neurologist, professor of neurological rehabilitation and author of the authoritative report on medicinal cannabis for the UK Parliament.  According to Professor Barnes the evidence is strongest for the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in the area of pain whereas the so-called access programme being proposed excludes this cohort.  Professor Mike Barnes and Professor David Finn, who has spent 16 years researching the area of medicinal cannabis, say that this is the area where the evidence is strongest yet this is the area excluded by the access programme.</p><p>I would like an explanation for how that could be the case.</p><p> Could the witnesses explain what they will do for the 800,000 people in Ireland who suffer from chronic pain, of whom 40% do not get relief from existing authorised pain killers, according to Professor David Finn.  Do the witnesses believe it is acceptable that cohort, a very significant number of people who get no relief from existing authorised pain killers, should continue to be criminalised for using medicinal cannabis products?   If we adopt the witnesses' recommendations, that will be the case.  They will be criminals.  They are currently criminals and they will stay criminals.  Do the witnesses think that is acceptable?</p><p> How would the witnesses respond to a survey of GPs in this country which showed that 58.6% of GPs, the people who do not regulate and do not sell medicine but who actually prescribe it and are medical professionals, favour the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use.  An even higher proportion of GPs with advanced addiction specialist training level 2 agreed or agreed strongly that cannabis should be decriminalised, bringing the percentage to 60%.  Do the Department of Health, the PSI and the HPRA think they know better than GPs, particularly GPs who specialise in the area of addiction?  I put it to them that they do not.  I find it incomprehensible that they are second-guessing them.</p><p> Could the witnesses tell us what they have done to look into the five other EU countries, subject to the same EU directives in terms of the regulation of medicines, which have adopted legislation similar to that proposed by Deputy Gino Kenny allowing for wide access to medicinal cannabis based on the prescription of certification of GPs and not requiring consultants?  Could they confirm that consultants have no legal status in Irish law?</p><p> Could they tell us how many people die from products that are authorised pain killers or other drugs authorised by the HPRA, specifically benzodiazepines and opiates, every year in Ireland?  That would be useful.  Following that, could they then tell us how many people are known to have died from medicinal cannabis products anywhere, in Ireland or elsewhere?  We have testimony from Professors Mike Barnes and David Finn that the side effects of medicinal cannabis products, and they acknowledge there were some, were moderate.  Is that how they would describe the potential side effects or adverse consequences of the misuse of drugs that are already authorised, particularly opiates and benzodiazepines?  How do they square that circle, or inconsistency, that we already regulate, authorise and sell drugs that are toxic, that kill people and that are regularly misused but that we propose to have a higher level of restriction on a medicinal product which although it may have some side effects, there is no evidence they are anywhere as serious as the effects of drugs already authorised and sold in chemists up and down the country on the basis of a GP's prescription?</p><p> Some red-herrings have been thrown into this debate.  Could the Department of Health confirm that we have stated repeatedly in both public and private meetings, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, that we are more than willing to amend this Bill in many of the areas on which concern has been raised.  For example, we would be quite happy - in fact, we agree - that the Minister of Health is the Minister who should be referred to.  The reason we referred to the Minister for Justice was because of the current criminalisation.  All we want with this Bill is one that will allow access to people who could medically benefit from cannabis products on the recommendation, or prescription if people want to change it to that, of a medical professional and that it would be regulated.  There would be continuous research in the area on an ongoing basis to establish the efficacy, effects and consequences of medicinal cannabis use.  That is the centrepiece of this Bill.  We are quite willing to consider amendments on everything else which has been raised, whether on penalties or on where in the Schedule it should go, and which are incidental to the central thrust of this Bill which is one to allow medical professionals, not just consultants, but GPs or other medical professionals to be able to prescribe or recommend medical cannabis to any patient who would benefit from it.  That is the core of this Bill.  Does the Department of Health not know that we are happy to accept amendments?  Could it explain why that is problematic?</p></speech>

I thought there could be a small bit of small progress but then I read the HPRA report and what exactly the cannabis access programme is.  The cannabis access programme being approved by the Government is not progress; it is regressive.  It stipulates three conditions but leaves out chronic pain.  This is absolutely bizarre.  The Barnes report, which is a very well respected report, states that chronic pain is the No. 1 issue where medical cannabis can be very effective.  That is across the board.  The three conditions named in the programme are spasticity, intractable epilepsy and the side-effects of chemotherapy.  What drugs will be administered for those treatments?</p><p>I understand the drugs that will be administered for those three treatments will be Sativex, Epidiolex and probably one or two other pharmaceutical-grade cannabis-based products.  There is a family in the North of Ireland whose daughter has Dravet syndrome and who have been turned down for Epidiolex.  If the cannabis access programme stipulates that it can be administered only in pharmaceutical-grade products, it is going nowhere.  We set out seven or eight months ago that people should have access to the full plant extract.</p><p> There have been two applications for licences.  One was successful while the other was not, which is good for one family and very bad for the other.  The officials say that this is the kind of programme which the Minister can admit.  What do they say to hundreds of people who want to access that licence system?  It is completely unsustainable.  The Minister will have 400 or 500 applications in respect of the system.  I would like the officials to comment on that.  I asked Mike Barnes last week what he thought of our compassionate access scheme for a licence and he said it is completely unworkable.  That is why we want our Bill to go through, to give the many who could benefit from it access to medicinal cannabis on the full plant extract.</p><p> As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, there is duplication.  If the HPRA can do what we propose in the Bill for a cannabis regulation authority, so be it.  I do not want duplication or another quango in this country.  If that can do exactly what the cannabis regulation authority and the cannabis research institute can do, I am happy to say let us get on with the job.  If it cannot, we have a big problem and the regulation authority and the research institute have to be put in place.  Otherwise, the Bill deteriorates.</p><p> I would like Mr. Lennon to answer some questions on points I have heard in the past couple of months about medicinal cannabis.  I wish Deputy O'Connell was still here to answer too.  She stated that one can overdose on CBD oil but one cannot.  She also said there will be blood on the hands of the State if this legislation goes through.  That is quite an extraordinary statement.  She then made parallels between thalidomide and cannabis.  That is another extraordinary statement.</p></speech>

It is a regressive programme.  It is not even restrictive.  Why is the bar so high that it means virtually nothing to anybody?  In terms of the overall picture and regardless of whether people in this room agree, there are people in this country using cannabis to treat their conditions and they are criminalised.  That is immoral.  They should have the choice to go to their GP or consultant to get medicine that may not be recognised by the HPRA.  Under the licence system, one family has gained legal access to it for their child.  Why should other families not gain access to it?  The system is not in place because it needs legislative change.  That is why we have put this Bill forward and I think we will be successful.  The onus is on everybody in this room, like it or not, to answer people who say that they will be medically discriminated against because they are not part of that access programme.  I would like to see anyone here, member or not, sit in a room with a person who suffers chronic pain and will now suffer again because they are left out, and say that to their face.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked why I said the Bill is not in the public interest and wanted the views of the Chief Medical Officer.  It is his view also that the Bill is not in the public interest.  He believes there is an established system of regulation for medicines and controlled drugs in place already and that we are setting up a parallel system for one substance, cannabis, and undermining the systems that exist for medicines and controlled drugs.  There is also the concern about the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, and I take on board Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that was not the intention.  Removing reference to cannabis from that Act, taken with references to recreational use of cannabis, to encouraging employers to review their drug free workplace policies and no penalties for the offences in this Bill gives a sense that it is heading towards decriminalisation of recreational use of cannabis.  That may be because large parts of it were taken from former Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's previous Bill, which went much further in the direction of recreational cannabis.</p> <p>  The Department and the Chief Medical Officer are concerned that any doctor could issue a certificate for any condition under this Bill because we are talking about a substance that is not a medicine and has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures and about very serious illnesses.</p></speech>

If I may bring one item to the attention of the committee, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a statement on 15 March.  It was from the consultant neurologists who treat adult and paediatric epilepsy.  On prescribing cannabis, they stated, "Currently the main barrier to the prescribing of cannabis derivatives for epilepsy is the lack of clinical evidence of its long-term efficacy, as well as lack of data on long-term side effects."  That is why cannabis is not being prescribed at the moment.</p></speech>

We reckon we will need at least three in respect of the access programme.</p> <p>  Returning to some of the other points that were made, my colleague will deal with the question about the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  Outside of the access programme, it will still be open to people to apply for a licence where their consultant endorses the treatment and feels it appropriate.  If somebody has another condition outside of the three that are in the access programme initially, it is open for a consultant to apply for a licence for treatment with cannabis.  It was suggested that we would be overwhelmed with licence applications.  That will obviously not be the case.  We have not had very many to date.  The access programme itself will not require a licence as that is not how it is being set up.  Patients will be on a register for treatment under it.</p> <p>  As reference has been made to the Barnes report, it is worth noting that the Minister initiated his review of policy on medicinal cannabis last November and now we are working on the guidelines for an access programme.  Professor Barnes published his report in the UK well over a year ago and there is no progress there.  There is no access programme or any change in anything.  We are making a lot of progress very quickly in Ireland, partly because the HPRA programme set out how something could work in a practical health care setting.  </p> <p>  Reference has been made to other European countries.  The numbers receiving cannabis are not as high as one might think.  Our understanding is that in the Netherlands, a country with a population of 16 million people where there has been access to cannabis for medical purposes for over a decade, we are talking about 2,000 patients in total.  The idea that 40% of 800,000 Irish patients will end up on cannabis is not realistic.  The numbers in other European countries are quite small.  In some of them, the access programmes are only getting going at the moment.  Denmark's population is greater than Ireland's by about 1 million.  They reckon that after four years they might have up to 1,500 people on their access programme.  The HPRA said that there are three countries in Europe with more liberal regimes and about eight countries with access programmes.  Ireland is joining those eight countries.  The majority of EU countries still do not even have an access programme for cannabis.</p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about the risk from benzodiazepines and other products.  That does not pertain to the substance of this Bill.  We have set out what we believe are issues around this Bill.  The benzodiazepine question is a different issue not covered by the proposed legislation.  Some of the issues in that regard have to do with the illegal sale of benzos rather than those prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists.  Yes, benzos cause problems for people and they are misused.  However, if used appropriately, they are of benefit to patients and there is a positive benefit-risk ratio when those products are used appropriately.  That is a different argument from what is proposed here in respect of cannabis.</p></speech>

That would include Sativex.  Epidiolex is currently undergoing clinical trials.  Other cannabis products can be allowed under the access programme.  That is one of the issues the reference group is examining but it is going to take a few months to come to conclusions.  Cannabis products other than the authorised medicines are certainly not ruled out.  A consultant would have to make the relevant recommendation and approve the treatment.</p></speech>

That remit covers the regulation of retail pharmacy businesses and of pharmacists as registered professionals.  We do not claim to be experts in areas beyond that remit.  In respect of giving a view that would be helpful to the committee, we are obviously not here to comment on actions by other professionals.  However, the role of pharmacists is not simply to stand in the dispensary and hand over whatever a prescription specifies when it is presented.  Pharmacists are expected and indeed required by the regulatory framework to use their professional skills, competencies and specialist knowledge about medicines to ensure that a patient only receives medicine that is going to be safe and efficacious in respect of his or her specific needs.  Our code of practice is a statutory code of conduct against which pharmacists are held accountable to the highest level.  It states that there may be circumstances in which the judgment of the pharmacist might conflict with the stated requirements of the patient.  That is the exercise of professional judgment.</p><p>These are not simple matters.  Our system of control for medicines to ensure the safety of patients and the public does involve various checks and balances.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about GPs issuing prescriptions.  I do not have a view on the manner in which GPs issue prescriptions.  That is entirely a matter for GPs.  Our system does not work in such a way that a prescription leads to the supply of specified medicines.  The pharmacist plays an important role and exercises his or her judgment on what is or is not dispensed in terms of a prescription.  Pharmacists commonly engage with GPs and other medical professions on what is specified on prescriptions and whether it is intended and efficacious for the patient.  There can be a lot of dialogue between the relevant professions.  It is not simply a case of prescription equals supply.  That is not the way the system works.</p><p> We are all very concerned about the well-being of people who find themselves in circumstances where they need access to medicines.  They may have conditions that are quite intractable and resistant to conventional forms of treatment.  I hope I noted Deputy Boyd Barrett's words correctly that he uttered in the heat of the moment.  It is important to note the following.  It is not the case that we, as an Irish society, sell drugs that kill people.  That is not what happens.  No pharmacy knowingly sells drugs that can kill people.  Medicines have inherent risks.  Many medicines are toxic and have toxic effects, as we all know.  It is important that the Deputy's statement does not simply sit on the record.  He possibly did not intend to make the suggestion.  In practice, we all seek to minimise and balance the risks of medicines of all kinds with the potential benefits.  As the committee reported in its report on medicinal cannabinoids that it published last January, there are risks and potential benefits.  The report called for careful cognisance of the attendant risks and made the following recommendation.  The foreword stated: "It is the Committee&rsquo;s view that Ireland should pursue a balanced course of action in considering the merits of authorising the use of medicinal cannabinoids".  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as the regulator of pharmacies, supports that position because we feel it is in the public's interest.  The foreword contained a public interest statement.  My colleague, Dr. Nestor, will make a few helpful points.</p></speech>

About 10% of the qualification refers to drugs from natural origin, which is an area called pharmacognosy and phytochemistry.  All pharmacists would, as part of their training, study this area that includes medicinal and non-medicinal cannabis.  A pharmacy qualification ensures there is expertise and knowledge of the area.</p></speech>

I asked the following direct question.  What specific expertise and knowledge does the Department of Health, the PSI or the HPRA have in the area of cannabis?  I do not doubt that the organisations employs experts in their fields.  I want to know who we have taken advice from.  Are they experts who know nothing or a lot about cannabis?  I suggest to Mr. Lennon that we would be better off taking advice from experts who know something or a lot about cannabis.  I wish to advise the committee that I shall formally write to the clerk of the committee requesting that the committee arranges an engagement with Professor Mike Barnes.  It is the least that we can do if we want to have a comprehensive view of this matter.  I say to Mr. Lennon that the fact the British political system has not responded to the recommendations made by Professor Barnes is irrelevant.  Will our attitude to medicinal cannabis be informed by somebody as expert and knowledgeable as Professor Barnes or by people who have no knowledge whatsoever about cannabis?  Professor David Finn is professor of pharmacology and has studied cannabis for 16 years.  He explained in great detail how there was strong evidence at every level to support the efficacy of cannabis-based products to relieve pain, as did Professor Barnes.</p> <p>  Professor Finn told this committee that there was a significant unmet need.  I asked the witnesses what they would do to solve the unmet need.  Mr. Lennon told me how many or how few thousand people availed of access programme in other countries but he did not answer my question. What will the Department's access programme do for the unmet need whereby people do not get pain relief from existing drugs?  I put it to him that the programme will leave them out in the cold and label them criminals if they attempt to access the product.  I asked the witnesses whether they thought it acceptable that such people were criticised and that the access programme left them out in the cold.  I put it to them that it is unacceptable.  I further asked them to respond to the fact that the majority of GPs in this country, and a higher proportion of GPs with specific knowledge in the area of addiction, favour the decriminalising of cannabis for medicinal purposes.  Why have the witnesses not taken the lead from them?</p></speech>

As Deputy Gino Kenny will know, I have expressed serious reservations about some of what is contained in the Bill.  Medicinal cannabis is an emotive issue for many people.  First, I do not agree with the establishment of a cannabis regulatory authority.  Second, I do not agree with the establishment of a research group into just cannabis.  I support the access programme but would like it extended to beyond the list being considered.  I understand that the access programme will be reviewed after five years and there is a possibility it will be extended at that time.  I ask the officials to clarify the matter.</p> <p>  There are two arguments about cannabis.  First is the provision of cannabis for medicinal purposes, which I have no issue with.  Second, there is a difference of opinion on how medicinal cannabis can be provided.  I believe existing bodies should consider the products, benefits and potential side effects.</p> <p>  I take on board what has been said by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He wants us to insist that whoever considers all of these matters has an expert knowledge of cannabis.  If the Department does not have such expertise then it must bring in experts, as part of the deliberations.</p></speech>

The argument that has been put forward would, to my mind, suggest that any novel drug would have such issues.  Nobody has expertise because it did not exist before.  Consider this for any new product, for example, in yesterday's great announcement with Orkambi.  There was nobody in the Department who knew anything about Orkambi until the data came through from the manufacturer, because the data did not exist.  I believe the argument being put forward about the lack of experts in the field is a null argument.</p> <p>  The extensive undergraduate programme and training for pharmacists gives us the capacity, through our knowledge of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and all of that, to apply those professionally acquired skills to make reasoned decisions in the interest of public safety once a new drug comes on to the market.  A pharmacist does not just stop learning the day he or she gets a certificate, but instead he or she constantly learns and updates knowledge.  There are quite cumbersome processes in place for that level of expertise to be maintained, all in the interest of public health.  I do not think it is fair to suggest that because something is new, some lad has to go off and do a degree in Orkambi or whatever.  We have the skill set, as does the technical end of the pharmacology sector.</p> <p>  I refer to an expert, a professor of pharmacology, who was before the committee.  Perhaps I am wrong but I do not believe that scientists, as in pharmacologists, as distinct from pharmacists, have any professional regulatory ethical body.  Maybe I am wrong about that.  Nonetheless, a pharmacologist is a scientist in a laboratory environment with no interaction with actual people or patients.  There is a distinct difference between a pharmacologist and pharmacist.  Pharmacologists are not mentioned in any of the regulations about misuse of drugs.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact the majority of GPs in this country are up for this.  I have seen no study which shows that to be the case, and it is regrettable that the Chairman, Deputy Michael Harty, is not here.  If that evidence has been stated here, it is important that members of the committee would get that study and consider it.</p></speech>

There are questions there.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien spoke about there being two processes, and I agree with him on that.  This is about the two processes.  My concern is on medicinal matters.  How can we help people?  What is the best way to expedite this process for people who require treatment?

Could I not say I believe a particular drug is the ideal thing for a particular problem?  Is there a difference in the way it might affect other people, given their different metabolism?  Does Mr. Lennon have the professional competence to answer that question?  What is the difference between cannabis and medicinal cannabis?  Will he shed some light as to what it might be?  I do not know what cannabis does.  I have not had any experience with it.  I do not even know what it looks like.  Is there a difference between the one a person can grow in a pot, which I have heard about, and medicinal cannabis?  We were given information previously to the effect that cannabis-based drugs are available and authorised under existing legislation, and require prescriptions or whatever the case may be.  Is that true?  Are they available?</p> <p>  Who has responsibility for the health and safety of the population of the country in the event of there being a readily available product that some people question and others do not from the point of view of medicinal benefit?  Is cannabis the only alternative?  I recognise that it has use in situations of severe pain, as I have mentioned previously, but is it true that cannabis is not the only alternative?  Does it have to be cannabis only?  Are there alternatives other than cannabis, whether medicinal or non-medicinal cannabis?  I know Mr. Lennon is going to tell me about types of cannabis in a second.  Are the alternatives successful or not, and is Mr. Lennon professionally qualified to answer that question?</p></speech>

These consultants deal with patients and families every day.</p><p>I have spoken to a number of them about the cannabis and THC issue and they tell me the scientific papers they have read about it.  The same applies for any other new treatment coming along.  They inform and educate themselves about new treatments and they are anxious to find them.  If new treatments are available, they will upskill for those treatments.  As I noted from the earlier statement, if they are unwilling to prescribe currently, it is generally because they are not satisfied with the level of clinical evidence that is available.  That is what I have to say about expertise.</p><p> The access programme is progressing and people are working on guidelines.  They are also looking at guidelines that exist in other countries.  I know in the past week that the people in the expert group drawing up the guidelines for clinicians and prescribers, as well as information for patients, have been looking at information from Australia, the United States, Canada and other places.  They have considered the type of guidelines that would help inform the various health professionals when it comes to prescribing cannabis and dispensing and supplying cannabis-based treatments for people.  We are looking at what happens abroad.  I know that when the HPRA did its report, it contacted medicines agencies and experts in other countries as part of its work.</p><p> Reference was made to a survey of GPs and I understand there was a 15% response rate to the survey.  The survey was probably taken before this Bill was published and before the access programme or the publication of the HPRA report.  The question may not be directly relevant.  Of the minority of GPs that responded, the numbers given by Deputy Boyd Barrett are accurate regarding those who said that medicinal cannabis should be available in some form.  In a sense, it is.  There is the option of the licence when endorsed by a consultant.  There will be the option of the access programme for the three conditions initially and possibly for other conditions in future.  In parallel with the access programme, the licensing option will still exist.  If a consultant has a particular patient where nothing is working, based on the reading of scientific papers the consultant may believe that cannabis-based treatment may be the right option.  The consultant can then apply to the Minister.</p></speech>

We have informed both health professionals and patients that this continues to be the case when they contact us.  The reluctance comes from the fact that many consultants are not happy with the state of the clinical evidence.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked the difference between medicinal cannabis and cannabis, which is interesting.  Sometimes the terminology can be used to distinguish between street cannabis and cannabis that people wish to take for medical purposes.  Sometimes the cannabis is the same in the sense that it is the same dried cannabis material that is grown.  It is the whole-plant cannabis that Deputy Gino Kenny referred to.  It is available in certain countries, such as Canada or the Netherlands, and one can get a tub of leaf cannabis.  It is the same material that people might smoke illegally in a recreational way.  In other cases, what people refer to as medicinal cannabis has been processed further into an oil, powder or some other form.  It is the same constituent material and there are different strengths to cannabis, as there are with recreational or illegal cannabis.  There are different strengths of THC and CBD when cannabis is used for medicinal purposes.  It is the same material and the purpose can be different.  Sometimes the form is also different.  There is an cannabis product, Sativex, which is authorised for treatment of multiple sclerosis and there are synthetic cannabinoids that are authorised, including Nabilone.  There is a pure CBD product going through clinical trials now that is called Epidiolex.  It is at phase 3 trials and some of the health professionals working in the epilepsy are quite interested in seeing the results of the next stage of those trials.</p> <p>  There is the question of indemnity.  We checked with the State Claims Agency and it indicated that if a consultant is prescribing cannabis, either under licence from the Minister or part of the access programme, he or she will be covered by the clinical indemnity scheme in those cases.  I suppose in the way it is operating currently, the treatment must be endorsed by a consultant in either through licence or the access programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-13a.2452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Egan" time="09:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017041300002#P00400"><p>There was a question from Deputy Durkan about whether one medicine would have the same effect on anyone that it was given to.  That is not the case.  Once a medicine is authorised, it is done for specific patient populations and contraindicated in many cases as well.  The doses will be different for separate patients and the same dose would not apply to an adult as against a child or even with a patient with reduced kidney or liver function.  Doses must be adjusted.  That point is particularly relevant when one thinks about the use of cannabis.  The endocannabinoid system, which is the system of cannabinoids in the body, was really only discovered in the late 1990s.  Professor Finn probably went into much detail about how little is known about that system and how we do not know how cannabis interacts with that system, produces its effects and may interfere with other medicines that a patient may be taking.  It could result in an enhanced effect of some other prescribed medicines or reduce the intended effect.  Those outcomes will potentially be negative for a patient.  The issue must be very carefully thought through before any decision is made about prescribing any medicine to a patient.  It is done on a very individual basis.</p></speech>

Retail pharmacy businesses are governed by their own indemnity insurance and they are required to have that.

These issues must be checked further.  Some GPs have made individual contact with their medical protection society.  It seems that if one is operating within a system where the overall treatment has been improved by a consultant, there is a level of protection.  Where GPs will be working under guidelines approved by the expert reference group established as part of the cannabis access programme, it will provide a certain amount of protection.  These are among the issues that are being discussed as part of the establishment of the operational basis for the access programme.  The issue was discussed with health professionals in the very recent past as part of that work.</p></speech>

I am unsure of whether the Bill is directly similar to other countries' legislation.  Parts seem more similar to models to be found in North America.  Ireland has moved quickly.  Twelve months ago, this issue was not being discussed much.  In the space of just a few months, there has been an expert report, an access programme and an expert group that is drawing up the guidelines for that programme.  The situation is moving rapidly.  Twelve months ago, the position was that cannabis was illegal and could not be used for any medical purpose.  We are now on a particular pathway and are proceeding in what we regard as a responsible way, given that we are discussing a product for which there is not sufficient clinical evidence and that is not an authorised medicine.  However, we are stepping outside the normal rules to an extent and are trying to do something in a controlled way.</p></speech>

We have heard heartbreaking testimonies from people who I and, probably, Mr. Lennon have met and who were in terrible circumstances.  However, if this journey has only been about the cannabis access programme that the Government is promoting, that is not progress.  In fact, the Department is condemning those who use medicinal cannabis to criminality.  That is criminal and immoral.
