Firstly, I would like to say that I welcome this opportunity to share my experience in the roles I held in Anglo Irish Bank and IBRC with the members of the joint committee.  I look forward to answering, as best I can and to the extent possible, any questions you have in relation to my performance in those roles and wider matters relating to the bank both pre and post its nationalisation.</p> <p>  To enable best usage of the time allocated to this session, I have narrowed the focus of my opening statement to deal with what I believe are the key areas of my testimony.  By way of background, I have worked in financial services for a substantive part of my career to date, beginning in corporate treasury roles in First Active and KBC, followed then by a variety of roles within Anglo Irish Bank and, latterly, IBRC.  These roles in Anglo were performed over a 15-year period from 1998 to 2013.  From 1998 up to managing the sale of the credit ... under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of the bank's deposits and NAMA bonds to Allied Irish Banks plc in February 2011, my main role was to raise customer deposits in order to fund the bank's balance sheet growth.  I performed that role as a corporate deposit manager up to 2001, as head of retail banking from 2001 to 2006, as director of corporate and retail treasury from 2006 to 2008 and as head of retail banking again from 2008 to 2011.  During this period, I reported to the head of corporate deposits, head of treasury, director of treasury, the managing director of Ireland and the head of operations in the bank, respectively.</p> <p>  I was appointed to the senior executive board or the SEB for a 12-month period from in and around the middle of 2006 to 2007.  This was a management level below the main board of the bank.  I also served on a number of management committees and subsidiary company boards at various times.  I did not, however, serve as an executive director or member of the board of Anglo Irish Bank or any of its sub-committees.</p><p>Following the appointment of Mike Aynsley as the new CEO in late 2009, I became a member of the new leadership team of the bank and worked in a number of significant post-nationalisation restructuring projects.  Finally, in early 2011, I was appointed as head of corporate treasury, or corporate affairs and communications, a role I held until my departure from IBRC in February 2013.  For the purpose of clarity, my responsibilities in all of the roles previously mentioned did not extend to lending to customers or involvement in the credit, risk, audit or compliance functions of the bank.<br/><br/>The primary role of the group treasury role of Anglo was to fund the bank's lending growth.  Both wholesale and customer funding were sourced for this purpose.  By 2008, a significant portion of the bank's balance sheet was funded with customer deposits from two main categories, namely, retail deposit customers and corporate deposit customers.  These deposits were the lifeblood of the bank and the business proposition was interest rate and customer service driven.  The marginal returns offered for surplus cash on deposit made it worthwhile for customers to switch banking relationships for this aspect of their business alone.  The corporate deposit customer profile ranged from SMEs to large corporate and institutional clients across practically every business sector.  Retail customers were predominantly older savers with lump sums to invest.<br/><br/>The centres for sourcing corporate deposits in Anglo Irish Bank grew from a small network of branches in Ireland and offshore in the '70s to a large group treasury centre in Dublin in the '80s, followed by an ... additional branches in the UK and another large treasury centre in London in the '90s.  From 2000 onwards, further centres in Austria, Dusseldorf, Jersey and Boston were used to source corporate deposits in line with asset growth.  As a result of this planned expansion, deposits from corporate customers in Anglo grew year-on-year to &euro;32 billion in 2008, accounting for 36% of the total funding position of the bank.  The strategic intent to broaden its funding base to include deposits from retail customers was established in 2001 in line with the introduction of the SSIA, or special savings incentive scheme, in Ireland.  Once established, the retail savings function in Ireland became successful very quickly and attracted significant positive media coverage and commentary due to the perceived lack of competitive offerings for savers in Ireland at that time.  <br/><br/>Following this success, a strategic decision was then taken in 2004 to launch a retail savings proposition in the United Kingdom.  While the UK savings market was, at the time, one of the most competitive in Europe, it was agreed to proceed and, following a test-and-learn period in early 2005, the bank began to enjoy considerable success with UK savers and growth was driven using high interest rates advertised in best-buy tables, in online and offline media and other comparator and aggregator sites such as <i>moneysupermarket.com</i>.  <br/><br/>The remaining retail funding site of the bank was the Isle of Man.  This had been in operation for many years and attracted a limited but consistent level of savings from onshore and offshore high net worth savers.  While successful among its local peers in this space, the Isle of Man operation would always remain the smallest retail saving centre operated by the bank up to nationalisation.  As a result of this planned expansion from early 2001 to its peak in 2008, the volume of retail savings from those three markets alone grew to <i>circa</i>&euro;19 billion of funds entrusted.  Close to 50% of these funds had come from the UK market over a relatively short period of time, with the balance coming from Ireland and the Isle of Man.  Total deposits from retail customers in 2008 accounted for 22% of the overall funding position of the bank.  At its peak, therefore, Anglo Irish Bank had a total portfolio of &euro;51 billion of deposits, which accounted for 58% of the total funding sources of the bank.  Given the strong growth of the UK retail funding franchise, a full launch plan was developed and under consideration to enter the German savings market in 2009.  This was with a view to reducing the growing geographic concentration and significantly expanding the bank's future potential funding sources.  This plan, however, was never implemented following the nationalisation of the bank.  <br/><br/>The fast-growing concentration of UK-sourced retail funding was influenced by the increase in the Irish deposit protection scheme in Ireland and the subsequent introduction of the Government guarantee, as I have detailed in my witness statement.  The collapse of Northern Rock was the first event that weakened customer confidence in the security of their savings with Anglo Irish Bank.  The bank took thousands of calls per day from concerned customers who either wanted to withdraw funds or seek assurances that their deposits were safe.</p><p>While the UK retail centre of the bank was the main focus of calls from UK customers, Irish savers became equally nervous when queues formed outside the Northern Rock office in Dublin.<br/><br/>The collapse of Anglo's share price on 17 March was the second event to weaken customer confidence in the security of their savings.  The seriousness of this event was greatly inflated by the fact that the Anglo share price, alone among Irish banks, was being targeted by sellers and fell by <i>circa</i>15% on that day.  The outflows were significant and the bank ran a very real risk of not being able to handle the volume of inbound calls from concerned customers.  It also introduced the first real risk of the bank&rsquo;s branches in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway not being able to deal with the volume of customers calling to close their accounts.<br/><br/>The collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 was the third and final event that shook the confidence of customers in the safety of their savings.  It is my view that the bank experienced a full-blown run on customer deposits from that period up to 29 September 2008.  As the primary channel for both corporate and retail customers dealing with the bank, however, was via the telephone, this run never fully manifested itself in the public domain.  In Ireland in particular however, the word on the street was that Anglo was in serious trouble.  It was an incredibly stressful time for retail deposit customers in particular, many of whom still had all of their savings with the bank.  While having survived two material events of this nature, the events of September brought a new level of uncertainty for the staff and management of the bank and, with the share price now below 30 cent, I believe most of the senior staff honestly feared the bank might not recover.<br/><br/>Up to the start of the crisis in August 2007, Anglo Irish Bank was lauded on the stock market for its spectacular balance sheet growth and highly profitable business model.  This and Anglo&rsquo;s commentary from a multitude of market analysts and other commentators led to Anglo being put forward as an example to its competitors and peers.  In terms of the bank&rsquo;s chosen credit strategy therefore, as a predominantly property-based lender in the Irish, UK and North American markets, it was difficult to foresee that everybody internally and externally could be wrong.  The bank&rsquo;s loan default rates had remained very low for the previous decade and there remained a huge appetite for commercial property projects, in particular among investors and developers in the bank&rsquo;s chosen markets.  Existing clients of the bank who had experience and track record in that sector were on hand to meet the demand and the clients&rsquo; stated credit policy was to back and work with these types of clients where the property had strong tenants, where cashflows could be identified and secured and where personal guarantees were available as additional security.<br/><br/>Anglo was three monoline banking divisions in one financial institution, namely, lending, treasury and wealth management.  While all were successful in rapidly growing and diversifying their markets for their individual activities, each sold what could be broadly viewed as a single financial product into a highly targeted customer base, i.e., loans to borrowers in the real estate sector, deposits to interest-rate sensitive corporate and retail customers and predominantly real estate investment products often geared to high net worth individual clients.  While the global liquidity crisis affected nearly every bank worldwide to some degree in 2007 and 2008, the underlying structure of the bank, together with the pace at which it had grown in that structure, compounded the stress of that crisis in a much higher degree to other banks who had lower concentration of lending exposures, more diversified funding sources and fee income from a wider universal offering to a diverse and longer-established customer base.<br/><br/>While Anglo Irish Bank had ceased development lending to new clients and had no direct exposure to private mortgage lending, the monoline exposure to a highly mobile customer deposit base in particular hit Anglo hard and fast in late 2008, as the perceived liquidity issue quickly became an actual one for the bank.  Further complications arose for the bank out of the difficulty in reducing or stopping lending as the crisis worsened.  This was in part down to the contractual commitments to borrowers and also the risk that without further lending, some development projects would cease and result in immediate and significant loan default.  All of this took place in the face of unforeseen and therefore unanticipated risks, which included a total market dislocation and a practically simultaneous failure of each individual source of funding open to the bank over a period of less than 12 months.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that my testimony today will be of benefit to the inquiry in fulfilling its mandate.</p><p>I would like to say that I fully accept responsibility for my roles as both corporate and director . . . corporate . . . as director of corporate and retail treasury and head of retail banking of Anglo Irish Bank for any part that I may have played in its failure and the consequences it had on the Irish State.  It is genuinely something that I will always regret.</p><p> Finally, I would like to highlight that at the time of writing and submitting my witness statement to this inquiry, I do not hold any documents or other memoranda such as minutes of meetings from my time in the bank and, therefore, its contents are solely based on my recollection of events at the time.  Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.</p></speech>

So I would have been a divisional director in the bank along with three other members of the senior executive board.  Any communication with the board would have come from those meetings to the main board, because the executive directors were obviously members of those board ... of that board.  I mean, certainly, there was a conversation back in 2006 and, just for clarity, I sat on the senior executive board for less than a year.  From the records I've received, I think it was eight meetings that I would have attended as a member of the senior executive board, and I do recall that development lending, for instance, was discussed, because the bank was ... recognised that it was over-exposed to development lending, in particular, and had a policy from 2006 of not lending any more development finance to new customers.  But, outside of that, the lending aspect of the business, as I described in my opening statement, just wasn't part of my functional responsibility, so I can't add any further insight into that, I'm afraid.</p></speech>

They did come together through the senior executive board.  I think the concerns that would have been raised around funding was not in relation to the risk in terms of the credit risk but in relation to our ability to fund that prudently.  And you will see in the minutes of the ALCO meetings and also in board presentations, the presentations made by the business from the treasury perspective in terms of the quantum of funding that we had to raise in order to adequately fund that lending growth, so... sorry, to your point, and just to be helpful, the discussions, I think, at senior executive board from my perspective and others in the treasury side would have been around the need to be able to fund that appropriately.  I would not have expressed a view, because it wasn't my area, on credit risk, because it wasn't my area of expertise.</p></speech>

Back then, the chosen business model operated by the bank was one that was deemed a success, was lauded as a success in terms of its ... the value that it created in terms of its rising share price.

So there were people that had that view but it was an individual view.

I believe it was on the instigation of the head of capital markets at the time basically on how our balance sheet was being structured to fund future growth.  I believe those investment banks were BNP, Barclays and Merrill Lynch.  They came in.  We gave them substantial information in advance.  They did a due diligence process and they presented to executive directors and the wide member ... and a wide grouping of the management team and I believe I highlight in the witness statement that they reaffirmed that we should be slowing growth in terms of our lending books, that our funding bases, while they had proved successful to date, were quite thin, and what I meant by that, is we were wholesale and customer and then the customer itself was just in a couple of markets.</p></speech>

I think when confidence in, for example, in Northern Rock was lost it was around, predominantly, their lending business but it manifested itself in a loss of confidence in the savings and so, therefore, the liquidity that the bank had built up in terms of its savings and wholesale funding ran, which perpetrated a further crisis whereby they weren't able to meet their liabilities.</p></speech>

In September 2008, Anglo's loan-to-deposit ratio was 160% up from 125% in September '07.  So, as head of corporate and retail treasury during the period '06 towards '08, were you concerned at any time during that period that the growth in customer deposits was not sufficient to fund the growth in the bank's loan book.  In other words, there was clearly a growing dependence on wholesale funding as opposed to the bank's deposit base.  Was that an issue that concerned you and were you raising that with your superiors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#K03800"><p>Yes, it was an issue.  And if you go back to late 2007, early 2008, it was obvious to us that the markets that we were funding both corporate and retail deposits from were too thin.  So if you take a retail deposit business, for example, we were operating out of Ireland, which is quite a small market in European terms, the Isle of Man, which is very small, and the UK had at this stage over three years produced 50% of our retail deposit funding.  So we knew that we needed to diversify.</p><p>And hence I worked on a plan with my team for a retail expansion into Germany, which was actually pretty much launch-ready shortly after the nationalisation of the bank.  And we presented that to Donal O'Connor at the time.  And obviously the bank had been nationalised so it didn't go any further.  But there was certainly a strategic intent, to your point Deputy, that we were stretching our existing markets for too much funding and we needed to get into at least one or more ... to European markets on the retail side.  And the other strategic development was we had got approval in the United States to raise deposits from a limited number of jurisdictions in North America, which again would have opened up much further funding capability.  So in the ... I think one of the messages from the 2008 results was that the aim of the bank, predominantly through the customer deposit side, was to be 100% loan-to-deposit ratio by 2011.</p></speech>

You were a member, as you indicated to the Chairman, of the supervisory board of Anglo Irish Bank Austria.  The sale of this bank in December 2008 reduced Anglo's deposit base by around &euro;600 million at a time when the bank's overall liquidity position was coming under pressure, so can you explain why did Anglo agree to sell this subsidiary at this juncture despite the resulting loss in deposits which the bank was needing?</p></speech>

Okay, well, maybe just one minute of background: the sale of the Austrian private bank followed on from a strategy of the bank to divest of private banking businesses outside of Ireland and the UK, so there was a trust business in the Isle of Man which was sold in 2006, I think, a private bank in Geneva that was sold around the same time, a fledgling private banking operation in Dubai, which we closed very early on, and I was asked to lead the sale of the private bank in Austria following on from that.  That sale process started before the crisis.  To your point, we did pause halfway through that process as liquidity issues were hitting the bank to determine if we sell this bank we are also selling, I think, it was either &euro;575 million or &euro;600 million in deposits, so it was considered.  I had a discussion with the CEO and the finance director about it.  We decided to proceed for three reasons.  One was we had ... we were now fully engaged in a sale process and, obviously, stopping the sale of a private bank in particular is quite difficult in that you've got counterparties now actively doing due diligence etc., so we felt that pulling the sale would not just reduce the value significantly then but also any further time that we were to put it on the market.  That's number one.  Number two, our view was that the deposits at the time were a very small percentage of our overall customer funding business, so if you think about it we may have probably had about &euro;45 billion, I can't remember the number, of total customer deposits then and this was &euro;600 million.  I think the third was I don't think we genuinely believed that the liquidity stress that the bank was under would actually result in its total collapse.  We believed that we would get through it.</p></speech>

Who were you talking about there?  And on what are you basing that assertion that senior people in the bank felt the bank would not recover?  And what does "not recover" mean?</p></speech>

Yes, well, to put that in perspective, really, I suppose, what I was observing in my statement was the stress that the bank had been under for such an extended period at that stage.  I think it was predominantly around the fact that we had no answers to the constant outflow of customer and wholesale deposits at that stage in that every day was just a fight to try and reassure customers, to try and retell our story, to try and outline that we had no mortgage lending, and all of the other types of answers we would have been giving to the marketplace.</p> <p>  I also think that when the share price went to the point that it did, it probably made equity raising very, very difficult for the bank.  And so, without specific, you know, sitting down and saying, "Oh, this has to be the end", I think what I was describing really was just a sense in the bank that, you know, we were in serious trouble here.</p></speech>

So I won't go into the regulatory liquidity ratio now in terms of detail but it basically meant that from a regulatory point of view ... and I think this came in in the middle of ... or the start of 2007, the bank had to hold an amount of liquidity that was able to meet any outflows within 30 days with inflows in 30 days.  The bank ... and we then set more stringent internal liquidity ratios, and it's evident in the minutes of the ALCO meetings that the bank actually held its line in terms of liquidity ... regulatory liquidity until ... practically up to the collapse of Lehman's.  So, while liquidity was incredibly volatile, yes, the bank was liquid, yes?  So it had a lot of liquidity; in fact, we were lenders into the market for quite a period of time.  And the liquidity ratios as set by the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator were actually only breached almost September time, when liquidity stress became the most severe.  But, obviously, from March right through, we were concerned daily about larger customers pulling credit lines that they had for the bank, ongoing retail worries where people weren't renewing their savings accounts when they hit a one-year maturity, as I described earlier.  But, from a liquidity point of view, we were sound until Lehman's, in effect.</p></speech>

I'll just bring it up on the screen there, just an example of it.  This relates, I think, it's to you ... it's one of the core documents, Vol. 2, 37 to 59.  I think it's two or three pages into that document.  And the title of it is, "Stress testing: a scenario analysis - funding, liquidity, risk policy".

I mean, when I was looking at this in terms of my preparations for today, one of the things that struck me was that while the bank had, I suppose, adequately put forward a variety of different stresses that may occur to affect its liquidity and funding, practically all of them occurred throughout certainly the latter half of 2008, either to some degree and then, finally, all degree, yes?  So, if you look here at the ... and this was done, I suppose, at a time when the outlook was more benign but we are regarding the probability of a neutral stress as being most likely then, and then very low probabilities attaching to even an Irish-specific market event.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Fitzgerald.</p> <p>  In September 2008, Anglo's - and I'm referencing Vol. 2, page 33, its board's presentation and strategic options - and in September '08 Anglo's loan-to-deposit ratio was 160%.  That's up from 125% in September 2007.  That's roughly a year.  Did you regard Anglo's increasing dependence on wholesale funding as a risk to the bank and would you've ever raised these concerns with other members of the senior management team?</p></speech>

It was discussed at ALCO.  It would have been discussed with the senior executive in terms of, I suppose, the stretch that we were putting on the funding to cover that amount of lending.  But, equally, we were funding sufficiently at the time and the long-term aim was that we have 100% loan-to-deposit ratio with further initiatives.  So, if you look back, we had already moved funding from very, very small and humble beginnings - '80s, '90s, 2000.  Probably what surprised us was the success of the business in the UK market which was tentative to start off with - very competitive market - and therefore we were looking at at least one new European market in the following 12 months to try and redress that.  But, it was a concern and it was discussed.</p></speech>

So the share price of the bank fell substantially - I think at the end of the day it was close to 15% or more - and that caused obviously considerable stress among savers.

The bank had built up very, very strong, I mean one of the ... one of the great cultural things about Anglo was its relationships with customers, and I think that&rsquo;s well documented.  So, you know, we didn&rsquo;t have an online banking system, you know, customers dealt with us by phone, yes.  The fear with customers was palpable despite deposit protection, despite maybe having removed some of their savings, they were very, very worried that the bank was not going to survive and that their deposits would be lost.  I think it&rsquo;s very, very true to say that.  The stress on the staff was dealing with that, trying to reassure them as best as possible that we were doing everything we could and I think generally then among staff themselves, having been through the bones of nine months of almost constant stress - and certainly from my perspective I would have managed three runs on our savings business in particular-----</p></speech>

I think we would have always had overflow arrangements, as I mentioned earlier on we had outsourced call centres, we had plans for escalation of calls, both for good reasons and bad.  In other words, if we had a market leading product we&rsquo;d get more calls, if we had a negative environment we&rsquo;d get more calls.  Unfortunately from 2007 on it was predominantly the latter.  So we had, I think, sound operational plans in place to deal with high volumes and stress and what I mean by that, just referring to the earlier piece, of just being able to control the environment as best we could with staff working late, etc.  I don&rsquo;t think we had a plan to deal with every aspect of our funding sources drying up over that sustained period but also then in a very, very stressed way from the collapse of Lehman&rsquo;s, which really was a turning point, as I mentioned, in terms of breaching our regulatory liquidity requirements and just the sheer volume of outflows every day.</p></speech>

In what way was that run being made known to the Department of Finance, to the Central Bank to the Financial Regulator?  How was that ... how was the severity of the crisis transmitted to those people?</p></speech>

The only piece that I am aware of, because I wasn&rsquo;t - and I mentioned in my statement earlier on - I wasn&rsquo;t party to conversations with the regulator, the Department of Finance or Central Bank.  So, from my perspective I know that our risk function would have sent a daily, if not twice daily, report generated from the bank&rsquo;s systems of our liquidity position to the Financial Regulator.  It was on their behest and going right back to early in the crisis, so it was now a formal part of our day.</p></speech>

This concentration level meant the deposits in the Bank became increasingly more volatile and, while every effort was made by the treasury teams to attract deposits from a wider range of small customers, the growth in deposits and other funding sources required to fund the huge volume of lending growth during the period from 2005 onwards made that task almost impossible.  </blockquote> <p>And you finish by saying, on this point, that &quot;This was to lead to significant problems for the Bank in 2008.&quot;  Can I ask you did you ever express this concern to any member of senior management as it became clearer to you the type of problems that were emerging?</p></speech>

I'm sorry, without going on too much of a tangent but when I worked in First Active Building Society very early on in my banking career, savers would come in and they would lodge regular savings or small deposits with the bank ... with the building society through a multitude of branches which would then result in mortgages for 20 and 25 years being issued.</p></speech>

There was no treasury function-corporate deposit-taking function of note in the building society at that time and it was a stable business.  The context of my point there was that, while we operated in treasury and started off life very early on taking hundreds of thousands of euros from deposits ... in deposits from customers, the loan growth and the general market environment meant that customers had ... corporate customers, in particular, had a lot more money.  I used the billion euro overnight deposit as just an example.  There may have been one or two in those but for me-----</p></speech>

Okay.  On page 11 again, Mr. Fitzgerald, you say, and I quote:</p><blockquote>[T]he bank found it extremely difficult to reduce or stop lending as the crisis worsened.  This in part was down to contractual commitments to borrowers and also the risk that, without further lending, some development projects would cease and result in significant immediate loan default. </blockquote> <p>And then you say that in the first part of 2008 a, by any standards massive, &euro;6.5 billion was lent out.</p><p>This is a ... is this a very, very kind of a stark situation, Mr. Fitzgerald, that you are locked into something as if it is out of your control, despite the fact that everything should be saying that you should be cutting back on lending?  I mean, a picture that came to my mind, would it be too dramatic to describe Anglo as let's say a "legal prescription drug supplier" with a highly addicted client who shouldn't ... who should be weaned off the stuff but you are terrified of the effects of cold turkey, economic arrest, cardiac arrest or something like this?  Is ... does this paint, does this in your mind paint a very stark picture in retrospect?</p></speech>

I was just aware of the funding implications, yes, of the continued lending in 2008.</p></speech>

I suppose the highest level-view that I could give you on it was that lending to try and stop the lending machine in Anglo, yes, from the start of 2008 or maybe the last quarter of 2007, involved careful choosing of which projects that could be backed, I believe, which projects would need to be not backed any further.  And I suppose the point and the reason I put it in my statement was that stopping lending outright when a crisis hits - and it may well have been a factor for all of banks, all of the banks that were hit by the crisis - proved very difficult for Anglo and I don't think your analogy is wrong either.</p></speech>

Again, to say, to quote you, "[A]s I understand it, a substantial portion of the [total] new net lending figure of &euro;6.5 billion in 2008 was lent in the first half of 2008 when funding the existing balance sheet was becoming increasingly more difficult".  Mr. Fitzgerald, was that reckless trading to dole out &euro;6.8 billion at a time when you had difficulty funding the existing commitments?</p></speech>

If that was the net result that was probably the best the bank could have done at the time.  I would also add that it was our view that the credit crisis would abate and that it would resolve.  If you look at the results, the presentation of the bank in 2008, it was for, you know, dislocation in the markets to last for another 12 months, maybe 18 months, and then we would regain traction.  So it was about slowing, curtailing growth so that we could recover and move on.  I think there was never a view in the bank that, quite obviously, that we wouldn't see it to the end of the year.</p></speech>

I just want to wrap up with a couple of questions myself with you and then we will bring matters to a conclusion.  Mr. Fitzgerald, do you believe that it was appropriate that you, as a member of senior management having a team of over 300 people reporting to you, were focused solely on one area of business and that you appear to have operated in a type of isolation from the rest of the bank?  Would that be a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I think it is the way the bank operated in that it was very segregated in terms of its divisions - lending, treasury and wealth management - and within those lenders had geographic locations and individual portfolios, and in treasury it was the same.</p></speech>

If they had concerns they would make an agenda item for your business function to come up and the debate at those board meetings was always robust but in hindsight, yes, we probably could have benefited from being less segregated.</p></speech>

We did have non-executive directors with banking and treasury experience but, if you think about it, for a considerable period before and during the crisis we did not have a director of treasury at an executive level.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Okay, and we now commence with the second session of today of public hearings with Mr. Gary McGann, former non-executive director at Anglo Irish Bank.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  This morning, the focus of the inquiry is on Anglo Irish Bank.  At this session, we will hear from Mr. Gary McGann, former non-executive director at Anglo.  Mr. Gary McGann was a non-executive director of Anglo from 2004 to 2009.  He is the former group chief executive officer of the Smurfit Kappa Group.  Previously, he was group CEO of Aer Lingus and CEO of Gilbeys of Ireland.  Currently, he is chairman of Aon Ireland and Paddy Power plc.  Mr. McGann, you are very welcome before the committee today.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in terms of the ... in respect of the evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of this inquiry.

As you're aware I've provided the inquiry with a written statement setting out my views on the topics which you've asked me to cover.  I don't propose to go through my statement this morning but I'm here to answer any questions you may wish to raise with me.  I think, as you're aware, there are a number of topics which, due to legal proceedings I've been advised that I can't address and therefore you'll appreciate that I may have to temper or constrain my responses in that regard, but other than that, Chairman, I'm happy to support and help the inquiry, so I'm happy to take questions.</p></speech>

It's a memo to a board dated 30 January '07.  In early 2007 you raised a number of concerns which are summarised and addressed in the memo to the board by Mr. McAteer and Mr. Moran, dated 30 January.  Can you please tell the committee why you had these concerns and were they addressed to your satisfaction?  That's Vol. 1, page 35.  Yes.  And if I could direct you as well that, on page 37 of that document, the heading is, &quot;Banks and High Growth [not] always a happy marriage&quot; and it says:</p><blockquote>&quot;High growth banks seldom die of old age!&quot; (Mohammad Rhostom, Portfolio Manager, Brown Brother Harriman, referring to our growth).</blockquote> <p>You might, I suppose, put it in that context.</p></speech>

The particular document referred to, I can't remember it in detail, but having reviewed it I can certainly remember the context.  On this board and indeed on any board that I've served, having spent a lot of my life in plc world, I'm very conscious of how businesses interact with the equity investment markets and my advice and views to any boards I've been on are basically contained in the principle that shareholder value, which is ultimately what plcs are required to deliver in the context of a number of other things, is only delivered on a sustainable basis if it's based on a business that has a sound business model, has achieved credibility over time by virtue of its delivery against that model and has a management team which in themselves have got credibility in the market.  And my request of the team at all times was to ensure that in articulating the business, the model and the reporting of results, etc., that those factors would be borne in mind, and the manner in which that that would be reflected in terms of outcomes would be that long-term value type holders would invest in the business.  So that was the context of my, the issues I would have raised with the team.  As I said, I would have raised it with teams in other companies as well.</p> <p>  Your reference to the comment on banks with high growth-----</p></speech>

I have to say, I'm not minded, I certainly don't recollect too many of them being brought to our attention at the time, but obviously high growth has challenges attached to it, but the concept of growth, even in the banking business, subject to proper governance and proper capital adequacy ratios etc., is of itself not wrong.  The issue is to be aware of the challenges and risks associated with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#X01300"><p>I'm not sure I would go so far as to say that the model in its, kind of, in totality, was flawed.  It certainly was a model that had challenges.  I think businesses in general - and I'm mindful that banks need particular attention - but businesses in general that have a narrow product range have inherent risk.  Ironically, in the business I've run for 13 years as CEO and 17 years as an executive in the world of packaging, which is very far removed from banking, I accept, but we have a very narrow product range and the equity markets love it, because it's high-concentration expertise in a narrow area, deep and meaningful engagement.  The debt markets don't like it because obviously of the higher risk attached to it.  The way we dealt with it in my current business is we widened the geographic spread so that we actually got the portfolio effect of geography in terms of the de-risking of it.  In the Anglo case, again, the product range or the product area was narrow but there were significant moves afoot to widen the application of that both in terms of product and in terms of geography.  And it was evolving over time but not quickly enough.</p></speech>

How do you react to Mr. Nyberg's comments in that regard?  And also it makes reference to the fact that the former CEO, Mr. FitzPatrick, was appointed to the new chair of the board in contravention of generally accepted governance principles at the time.  Now you're a, I suppose, an experienced and seasoned holder of ...  on boards, both as chair and as a member of the board.  So how do you react to Mr. Nyberg's direct criticism of the board of Anglo in terms of its, the way it operated?</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Dr. Nyberg has said.  Dr. Nyberg reviewed Anglo, I think in 2011, maybe 2012 and, indeed, I met with Dr. Nyberg.  And, certainly, the conclusions he has arrived at obviously have the benefit of a holistic look at the bank in the context of what transpired.  And obviously he has the benefit of hindsight.

In the ... in the other aspect of your point, as you know, in terms of governance and the various committees and people who've opined on corporate governance, and there's been quite a number of them over the years now, there is a fundamental principle still of comply or explain.  And the comply or explain principle applies to this day in terms of independence, non-independence, etc.  The ... as I ... as it was explained to me, and as I understood it subsequently in terms of that appointment, there are a number of factors attaching to it.  One, the man had enormous knowledge and experience of the bank and arguably was the most expert person in terms of the type of bank that Anglo was.  Two, the appointment of the new CEO was from one step below the director who reports to the existing CEO, given that it was going to be an internal appointment.  And there was consideration of external candidates and it was decided against, and there are obviously views on that.</p></speech>

The context is very simple.  The business was very successful.  The environment was very strong.  The profitability and the replenishment of the capital base was stronger than any bank in Ireland.  Depositors and investors and rating agencies, etc., were all very, very happy.  And, quite frankly, in the circumstances, the obvious, in hindsight, nature of the challenge, particularly in the context of a systemic downturn, wasn't apparent.  So, challenging something with the benefit of the hindsight is very clear.  The challenge at the time was to ensure that we were in reasonably good shape and there was no evidence brought to board that we weren't.</p></speech>

I mean, the remuneration arrangements in any business, particularly plcs, are based on best practice in the marketplace as advised by the various people who are expert in this area and Anglo Irish Bank's structure was no different fundamentally than anybody else's.  There are obviously three elements to it - there is salary, there is short-term bonus and there is long-term incentive schemes.  And the basis of each of those is against market practices, the quality and the size of the business and the performance of the business.  But it's important, Deputy, that you understand the context.</p></speech>

And in that, 30 issues are raised by the Financial Regulator with the chief executive, and what would be considered as quite significant issues, particularly perhaps the extent of lending for land development, etc., and another significant issue, the exception to group credit policy.  Now, can I first of all ask you to reconcile that letter with what you say on page 5 of your written submission, "I have no recollection of the board having received any correspondence directly from the regulator's office and I was not aware that the management received any correspondence from the regulator outlining any material concern or dissatisfaction about how the bank was operating its business model, its risk profile or its lending practices."

Now, I'd like to move on then to Vol. 1, page 57.  This relates to exceptions to group lending policy, and we see there ... this concerns the month of July, but I'm going to leave July out of it actually, Mr. McGann, because the previous five months - February to June - are given, and this is commercial lending.  The exceptions to the lending policy and limits in February '08 was 26%; March, 28%; April, 28%; May, 28%; and June, 28%.  In your opinion, Mr. McGann, were these high levels of exceptions ... would you agree that there were high levels of exceptions to begin with?</p></speech>

They were exceptions in the sense that they exceeded the policy and, therefore, required a higher order of review and/or sign-off-----</p></speech>

I think what they needed was obviously a higher order of sign-off.

This is a report from NAMA.  If I can take you to the bottom of that page:</p><blockquote>Of the 1,731 cases reviewed at client level, the number found to have represented an exception to credit policy was 1,073 or 62% of clients.  The aggregate value of the exceptions identified was &euro;31.97 billion or 92% of the value of the Book which transferred to NAMA.</blockquote> <p>Mr. McGann, 92% of the total loans transferred to NAMA from Anglo were exceptions to credit policy.

So this was December 2008, a few months after the bank guarantee.  On the night of the bank guarantee, were you aware that Anglo would require this quantum of additional capital in order to remain solvent and what would your assessment be of the bank's liquidity and solvency position at the time of the guarantee?</p></speech>

I think the board were aware that there were certainly challenges in terms of how the bank's model would be sustained longer term.  I think the speed at which developments occurred into the period towards the end of September and, indeed, thereafter was huge.  The ... I think just to try and deal with it, at no point in time did we, as a board, believe we were dealing with a solvency issue.  We most certainly believed we were dealing with a liquidity issue and that liquidity was not just an Anglo liquidity issue, albeit a significant one in Anglo, but was a much wider liquidity issue across a range of different businesses.  So at the time of the guarantee, to specifically answer your question, &euro;3 billion, no.</p></speech>

The international banking world, the international plc world has norms and structures around how remuneration takes place.  Whatever about the absolute amount, the methodology is straightforward.  There's an annual salary based on a competitive marketplace that's normally advised and guided by experts in this area and REMCOs decide on the appropriate level or not.  That number tends to be market-competitive - size of business, performance of the business.  There's an annual bonus associated with short-term objectives which is pre-agreed and, for want of a better word, contracted with the management between the management and the REMCO and then there's long-term schemes to sustain long-term profitability rather than short-termism.  And against that backdrop, in the period 2007, there was a contracted commitment between the REMCO at the beginning of '07 when I wasn't a member of REMCO - but it doesn't matter - and the numbers delivered and the payout took place.  That's how it works.</p></speech>

How can you justify those levels of bonus for activities that led to, by any standards, a catastrophe for the taxpayer and the social situation of many people in this country?</p></speech>

I do accept that the remuneration system didn't have clawbacks for strategies that failed but the two need to be seen, I think, separate.  I don't think you can make that straight correlation.</p></speech>

He says there is a recipe which banks follow "which produces the worst losses, is most likely to cause hyperinflated bubbles [...] to cause catastrophic individual losses and future crises" and the recipe he says is a bank that grows like crazy, make terrible-quality loans, employ extreme leverage while setting aside no meaningful loss reserves for the inevitable catastrophic losses.  And he says three sure things that arise as a result if these ingredients are followed, there will be record profits; under modern executive compensation, the senior leadership will promptly be made wealthy; there will be catastrophic losses.  My first question, Mr. McGann, is: would you say is that a fair summation of what happened within Anglo Irish Bank and its effect on the nation?  And, secondly, Mr. Black has been saying this since the late '80s, early '90s.  Again, given your experience, could you not have foreseen that booms always give way to busts?</p></speech>

I don't buy the simplicity of that.  Nobody, for example, planned for a systemic downturn, one-in-100-years event which, basically, brought about a lot of circumstances that nobody had anticipated.</p><p>Anglo Irish Bank's capital ratios were strong.  Anglo Irish Bank was replenishing its shareholders' funds on an annual basis because of tight cost-to-income ratios, low dividend pay, or decent dividend payout ratios, etc., so I don't think it was all a one-way street.  I accept that, in hindsight, there were aspects of the model that did not stand up to the test of this type of environment, for sure.</p></speech>

Professor Morgan Kelly of UCD published a study of, I think it's maybe two dozen countries over the previous, maybe, 30 years that had a property development-housing bubble, and each one, without exception, crashed.  And you, I've no doubt, would have been familiar with the Scandinavian situation of the late '80s and the early '90s.  What I'm saying to you is that as an experienced business person, were you not aware of this danger when you saw the exponential growth of lending, speculative development and so forth within the bank that you were a prominent member of its board?</p></speech>

I have not seen, as a company that I ran in 33 different countries, the business affected in almost every one of those countries all at the same time.  So, I am saying to you the one in 100 years is in the sense of the global nature of what happened and, therefore, geographic spread and de-risking across geographies didn't necessarily underpin models of businesses in other sectors.  In Anglo's case, it didn't.</p></speech>

Clearly, Anglo's was a narrower base with the wider geography to mitigate it.

If I could just, maybe, deal with two matters myself.  I just operate with the books at the moment, with you, Mr. McGann, and it relates just to ... it's Vol. 1, page 58.  It's an extract from Anglo's risk management report 2008 and in it, Anglo's monthly risk management report notes on the continuous basis that the bank is in excess of the Financial Regulator's single sector exposure limit.  This should be 200% of own funds.  This is concentration limits lent out, that a bank should be in one area and in another area they can ... to use a phrase you used earlier, apples and oranges.  You don't put all your money in apples; you lend out to apples and oranges and other types of fruits.  But in the July '08 report noted that the exposure was 587.88% of own funds.  So, maybe if I could put the question to you Mr. McGann that as an independent, non-executive director, were you concerned at the level of exposure at any time and did you raise these concerns with management?</p></speech>

It was based on income stream lending with a collateral, with the, if you like, the underpin being the property, and then there was, obviously, collateralisation across other businesses and then personal guarantees.  But the ... if you categorise it across the basic income streams, and the source of those income streams, you get a different categorisation.</p></speech>

Construction should account to about 12%.  It's at 6% at the moment.  They're moving upwards again, which it needs to get back to a sustainable rate of 10% to 12%.  But, at that time, the construction in the country was twice, 200%, of what it should've been.  I mean it was ... that was a well-known figure around the place.  You were highly concentrated into this area, and there were exposures being raised from it.  So, I suppose, if I could return to the question and break down into two parts, were you concerned with the issue and were you bringing these concerns to management?</p></speech>

NAMA's testimony to this inquiry in terms of how loans were actually being funded was, if I could give an example, a person would maybe, from the get-go, at the very, very first development, would maybe get a loan-to-value situation where they might have to come up with 10% or 20% or 30% of the cash.  But, because we were in an escalating and hyper property inflated environment, that, by the time they moved to the next development, the value of the initial development had exceeded the loan-to-value and probably was in high positive equity, therefore that positive equity could be used as a deposit on the next development, which meant that there was no cash payment on the next loan.  What was there was a securitisation on what we subsequently found out was an overvalued development.  And this became compounded where a very small number of lenders with your institution found themselves getting massive cash loans, or getting massive loans, over a period of time, to accumulate more developments without ever spending a single cent in deposit terms.  I mean, this is the type of concentrations we're talking about.  And, when Anglo finally crashed, what we saw on its loan book was a very, very small number of people with huge debt exposure.  Was that ever a consideration inside in the bank that there is something here that we need to be looking at?</p></speech>

And, NAMA, when they were before us, and in information that they provided, estimated that circa of around &euro;9 billion of interest roll-up was included in loans transferred to it by five banks.  &euro;3 billion of it related to Anglo, and I'll just go to the testimony there.  It was actually ... I think Deputy Higgins was speaking to Mr. McDonagh at the time, and Mr McDonagh says that:</p><blockquote>I should add that that &euro;9 billion [figure] was based on data which was given to the banks before NAMA came into existence, so it was based on information we got back in the summer of 2009.  We estimated that [the] &euro;9 billion was broken down as follows; AIB about just over &euro;3 billion, Anglo Irish Bank &euro;3 billion, Bank of Ireland &euro;1.8 billion, INBS &euro;1 billion and EBS &euro;0.1 billion.</blockquote> <p>Could I ask you, were you aware of the level of interest roll-up in Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

Development lending obviously has a long lead time to income.  So interest roll-up as part of that deal is not an unusual concept.  And obviously the trade-off or the ... the ... underpinned to that needs to be, obviously, quality collateralisation and experienced developers and so on.  But the principle of interest roll-up of itself is not necessarily a failure on the original loan but, rather, part of it.</p></speech>

I think there is no doubt about it that the board were aware of a certain amount of lending.  There were initiatives taken to work on curtailing lending and to only lend new loans to well-established and existing customers where there was a long-standing relationship and confidence.  I think the board would also be very conscious of the capital base of the board and the extent to which that capital base was reasonably robust and, obviously, in the context of profits, was replenished on an annual basis in a substantial way.  So ... and I think the third issue is the extent of the downturn certainly wasn't anticipated, with the exception of some notable commentators - a small number - the general sense was we were heading for a soft landing rather than a crash of cataclysmic ... of a cataclysmic nature, so ... so the context, I think, was such that we wouldn't have necessarily had that view.</p></speech>

You know, you refer in your statement, you know, these were people of the highest calibre, but they weren't there at a crucial stage.

The survey of the board members by Mrs. Hague - that the board members were asked to evaluate themselves, I think.  Being accountable to the public, 11 thought ... of the directors thought they were excellent and two, acceptable.  Compliance with regulatory requirements, ten thought they were excellent and three, acceptable.  "Are there any areas of the board's work which cause you unease:"  No, 11 directors; yes, two.  And the two refer to the complexity of accounts and "Preparing for and managing the unexpected".  Wasn't it a board which not only didn't attend on the other date I mention, didn't seem to be in touch with what was happening in the business at all, that it could have these questions?</p></speech>

As to whether the board was out of touch or not, I mean, this is a ... this is an evaluation done by an experienced third party with a lot of board evaluation experience.  It was done quite objectively, as far as I'm concerned, in the sense that I had ... I can only testify as to my engagement with Ms Hague.  And the board's evaluation ... if you go further into it, you'll see that there was quite a variety of different answers across a number of different areas, so it wasn't as if it was just tick the box and move on.</p></speech>

Mr. McGann, you are very welcome.  Can I just start by asking you about the length of your witness statement.  It's only three and a half pages long.

Can I just ask you to square a reference in this document on page 31, where it says notwithstanding the recessionary environment:</p><blockquote>[W]e are confident that given the nature of our business model and appropriate pricing and management of risk, the Bank will continue to generate strong profits and capital.  We believe that Anglo [Irish Bank] will be the most profitable and capital generative of all publicly quoted financial institutions in Ireland over the next five year period.</blockquote> <p>This was November 2008.  We heard evidence this morning from Peter Fitzgerald that, in his view, after the Lehman collapse, so in the second half of September 2008, those in charge of running Anglo knew the game was up.  What is your view?</p></speech>

The environment was extremely challenging.  Funding and liquidity was a serious issue.  There was a strong view that that environment that prevailed, that created the funding challenges, couldn't sustain long term.  I mean, we have to remember these were times when (a) banks wouldn't lend to banks; they'd lend to the central bank ... the European Central Bank rather than lend to one another, they had to go that circuitous route.  These were times when, latterly, you had UBS and Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York basically charging people to mind their money by putting it on deposit.  So we had very unusual and hard to believe long-term sustainable circumstances.  So against that backdrop there was a belief that a recapitalised Anglo could have a future but it would need (a) stronger funding sources and (b) probably a broader funding footprint.</p></speech>

I mean, there is no doubt about it that all the banking system around the bank guarantee were struggling in terms of liquidity and therefore ... hence, I presume, the context for the guarantee.  But at all points in time the board saw this as a funding liquidity challenge.  We'd obviously issues around property valuation and the asset side of the balance sheet to be addressed, probably with capital raising but Anglo Irish Bank had a very strong track record in capital raising.  In the first half of 2007 it had basically raised &euro;500 million at a 2% discount, which even in today's standards is a hell of a fund ... or an equity raising.  It had a tier 1 bond six times oversubscribed in the first half of 2007, so this was a rapidly, kind of, changing environment.</p></speech>

Can I take you to Vol. 2?  And we'll start with page 63.  Now, the initial report here predates your period, it relates to 2003, but I just want to highlight a couple of issues where at the bottom of page 63, "In 10 [...] of [the] 12 files [examined - this is on the issue of security underpinning loans] no letter from the bank's solicitor confirming that security was complete is evident".</p><p>And it goes through various examples where no solicitor's letter confirming security being present and then the explanations were the verbal confirmation in many cases had been received and the documentary evidence had been requested from the solicitor after the loan had been issued.  Now, as I said, that was 2003.  If you keep going to page 67, at the bottom of that - this is January 2007 - it references, "The previous audit report on Banking Ireland in 2005 highlighted cases whereby advances were made on the receipt of verbal rather than written confirmation from the Bank's solicitors."  So, clearly the issues identified in 2003 continued in 2005.  Now you were on the audit committee at that time.  Do you recall these difficulties?</p></speech>

They would, in most cases, agree that this was the case and agreed actions would be taken, including getting the documentation and an undertaking that this was not going to happen in future.  I do recollect at one point basically this becoming a real issue where the chairman instructed the CEO to ensure that no lending would happen without the documentation being in place.

Page 68, &quot;We noted 5 (out of 34) cases where items of security specified on the approved credit were either not put in place or were amended without appropriate <i>written</i>approval.&quot;  Across the page, 69, at the top, &quot;<b>Confirmations of Security</b>[...] items on 7 (out of 34) accounts were still outstanding.&quot;  I mean this was crazy practice.</p></speech>

I mean, I think, on the positive side, the person appointed was probably the most experienced banker in Anglo, after the chairman himself and, obviously, a qualified accountant, a man of long experience and a man very highly regarded in terms of his knowledge, integrity, etc.  So, from the point of view of the role of risk, that was a plus.  Under him, as finance director, there was a very strong team led by a very strong CFO who, in my experience, was actively involved in a lot of the areas that you would typically see a finance director in.  In fact, the concept of a finance director, with a CFO reporting to the finance director, in my experience, is rather unusual.  But, having said that, if you pull it all together and look in hindsight, clearly, I think the answer is it certainly wasn't, in hindsight.</p></speech>

And, when this was discussed, was it discussed in detail?

Now, one could argue that this is one view of the international context.  Evidence presented to this committee shows that from late 2007, Irish banks were seen as overexposed to the credit crunch, and from early 2008, Anglo Irish Bank was being cited as increasingly risky investment above others.  The reasons given by the rating agencies at the time were its commercial property lending portfolio and its reliance on wholesale funding.  So, can you inform the committee as to whether the downgrades from rating agencies were discussed at meetings that you attended at board?</p></speech>

What had changed is obviously the circumstances and the potential confluence of a number of different issues, which is effectively what I was referring to in my, in my initial statement.</p></speech>

We had the <i>Financial Times</i>article, for example, in around the &quot;St. Patrick's Day massacre&quot;, talking about Anglo Irish Bank being in the same boat as some of the other banks that had gone bust and run into trouble.  So this wasn't a secret kind of conversation that was happening between the numbers.  There was openly people ... large institutions who were telling people to get out of Anglo Irish Bank, rating agencies were downgrading you, serious commentators in international financial press were saying &quot;stay clear of Anglo Irish Bank&quot;.

The board's focus at all time was how to ensure the viability of the business, how to sustain the business, how to protect the depositors' interests, how to ensure that the value for shareholders wasn't totally eroded.</p></speech>

I mean, there was a business model that really had to be sustained, so the focus then was on where lending was made.  There was obviously the challenge of curtailing or stopping the lending which would actually become a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of the demise of the business.  There was the whole area of having to ensure that we could source funding to sustain the business.</p></speech>

It was a presentation, I think, either to the Central Bank or to the Department, and Anglo Irish Bank stood out because they expected to lend more during that period.  They believed they were going to be highly profitable and so on and so forth.  We have heard evidence from Nationwide, for example, that they stopped all new lending in ... at end of 2007.  Was it not the prudent and appropriate thing for the board to change the strategy at a time when agencies, international commentators that were reputable, were saying that your model is "broke" and people should run from your model and from your bank?</p></speech>

I think, number two, in terms of the lending, there was a very definite focus on where lending was to be made into areas that the board and the management, most particularly in the risk and compliance committee, believed could deliver ... obviously not in the circumstances that ultimately prevailed but in a more benign downturn than we ultimately achieved.</p></speech>

I mean, I happened to be running a business where the share price was in freefall.  If I could take a quick segue just to give you a parallel in a totally different world, but it is very important that it was ... in Smurfit Kappa, we IPO'd in March 2007 with a &euro;16.50 share price.  By early 2008, mid-2008, our share price was &euro;1, so the value of the business had gone from about &euro;5 billion to &euro;300 million.  That was what was happening in a recession-proof business but because we weren't a bank, it actually didn't matter to the core model and the core business.  In the case of the bank, once the share price started to come under pressure, obviously confidence in the bank in the context of retail depositors and even corporate depositors was the issue, and that was the key focus at the time.</p></speech>

Now we learn that there was actually a private meeting in a private residence which discussed issues around the economy but nothing to do with bankers or banks, despite the fact that we have directors or board members of Anglo Irish Bank, the CEO, members of the Central Bank there.

I am going to move things to wrapping up and in final conclusion I'll ask yourself, Mr. McGann, if you want to make anything by means of final comment or contribution and maybe just to, kind of, assist you into that area, you were speaking earlier, I think with both Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Higgins, in regard to the bonus culture, or the bonus structure in Anglo Irish Bank.  Could I ask you, in your opinion, if the structure of the bonus programme in Anglo helped or hindered the pursuit of a sustainable business model and strategy?</p></speech>

That's not to say that the short-term, obviously, as we've discussed already, wasn't attractive but the weighting was towards the longer term.  Now, as you know, over time this is all evolved and, indeed, the argument is that it should be even more weighted long term and with claw backs.</p></speech>

Coming from a very well-established socialist, I don't know how that balances itself out but do you, kind of, take the comment anyway?  As one of Ireland's leading businessmen, do you feel that your business experience enabled to you to make a meaningful contribution to the governance of Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

Chairman, members of the committee, since the beginning of 2009 I have co-operated with all the various lines of inquiry and investigations by State and other bodies and I welcome the opportunity to come before you this afternoon.  In addition to the detailed written submission which I furnished to the committee in early August 2015, I come here today before you to further assist the committee - as best I can - in the crucial work you are undertaking.</p> <p>  The failure of Anglo Irish Bank and the wider banking system in Ireland was a calamity for the Irish economy and for the many people associated with the banks, including staff, customers, investors and the Irish taxpayers.  Whilst I never served as a member of the board of directors of the bank or as an executive director, I was within the next layers of management, both before its nationalisation and afterwards.  Following nationalisation by the Minister for Finance in January 2009, the new Government-appointed board selected and appointed me as director of group finance.  I will endeavour to give the committee as clear a picture as I can of the circumstances of which I have knowledge surrounding the failure of the bank.</p> <p>  I joined the bank in late 2002.  Prior to that, on completion of my university studies, I spent some eight years as a financial consultant in London and New York, primarily in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. I had no lending experience and my role in Anglo was not on the lending side.  My brief was to support the group finance director, as required, and I carried out a variety of projects in this regard.  My expertise was in corporate finance activities such as mergers and acquisitions, equity raising, financial analysis, as well as special financial assignments.  Among the projects that I managed or had significant involvement in were: major share placings, raising almost &euro;1 billion in new equity capital for the bank; liaison with international investment analysts that were conducting independent analysis on the business; assessing acquisition opportunities; and completing the disposal of the bank&rsquo;s private banking business in Austria and also in Switzerland.</p><p>Within group finance, I was involved in restructuring management accounts reporting ... to enhance reporting standards, recruiting specialist accounting skills in each area of the Dublin-based finance team, overseeing the introduction of international financial reporting standards for the bank's accounts and in assisting the leadership of the treasury trading business to devise strategy and business plans. </p><p> In late 2004, I was given the title, chief financial officer, to assist my profile in representing the bank without any change of my role.  My investor relations function meant externally I became more widely known as an executive of the bank.  My work in these and other areas reflected well on the bank internationally and increased my standing internally.  I also had responsibility for managing the group finance Dublin function.  This function included the preparation of monthly management accounts, the preparation of regulatory returns on the direction of the group finance director, and liaising with the auditors on the conduct of the audit of the Irish operation of the bank and group consolidation.  During this period, the quality of the bank's internal and regulatory reporting were greatly improved. </p><p> Events since the banking crisis have shown that the risk position of the bank and that of all other financial institutions in Ireland deteriorated to an event ... to an extent not foreseen at that time.  The same happened across Europe and elsewhere.  There are well-documented external and internal reasons for this.  The external reasons have already been aired before the committee.  I don't propose to dwell on these, except to underline that they made life impossible for many financial and regulatory institutions, with fault lines being exposed across a wide spectrum.  There was little or no perception by forecasters or authorities of the severity of what lay ahead.  In addition, the bank had a distinctive external pressure arising through the Quinn investment and leveraged contracts for difference that were held through a multitude of investment banking and other broker counterparties internationally. </p><p> There were also significant internal issues within the bank, some of which are indicated in the core documents circulated by the committee in recent weeks.  These support the view outlined in my written submission to the committee that the lending function was excessively dominant in the bank and that the risk function controls were, ultimately, insufficient.  This is best captured in the decision to consolidate the leadership of the risk and finance functions under the group finance director in 2007 and the management reorganisation of the same year.  That reorganisation saw the senior executive board narrowed to just five people, including four lenders and one non-lender.  It was apparent from these and other events that the value attached to independent views had diminished.</p><p> Group finance Dublin did not have responsibility for lending by the bank.  Group finance Dublin did not have any responsibility in group risk management, which was the key control function in the conduct of the bank's lending business.  At all times since the late 1990s, risk and finance teams were entirely segregated with distinct areas of responsibility.  This continued to be the case even after the aforementioned change to leadership.</p><p> Management accounting and audit relied on the integrity of the data inputted by the lending divisions, regional operations and other departments in the bank.  This data was adjusted to account for impairments and provisions set out in a monthly report prepared independently by the risk management department based on its detailed assessment of loan risk.  As in almost all banking institutions, the interrogation and scrutiny of lending data and underlying risk was the responsibility of risk management.  Inadequate controls in this area was one of the factors in the subsequent difficulties that faced the bank. </p><p> From the second half of 2007, throughout the year 2008 and into 2009 the bank was in constant spasms of crisis.  Strenuous efforts were made to determine the extent of the bank's downside exposure to the ensuing financial turmoil, both within and outside of the bank.  My role throughout this time was primarily looking at capital opportunities for the bank in international capital markets.  The incessant downward spiral in each of the economies in which the bank lent money, but most particularly in Ireland, exacerbated the scale of losses in each half year.  None of these reviews by multiple parties from within and outside of the bank identified the scale of the potential losses.  In addition, none of them, from what is known to me, found defects in financial reporting in respect of lending impairment.  </p><p> Internal audit within the bank, which reported directly to the board audit committee and the chief executive, would have conducted its own reviews on processes and procedures.  The factors contributing to the failure of the bank were multifaceted and complex.  There were many actions, decisions, events and circumstances surrounding this and all viewed through a different lens than the one we use today.  </p><p> I would like to conclude by expressing my own sincere and deep regret for the great hardship that the failure of the bank and the wider banking system in general inflicted on so many.  Chairman, notwithstanding the constraints placed upon me, which the committee is aware, and the fact that I have not had access to potentially relevant materials pertaining to the bank from 2002 through to 2008 and thereafter, I will now endeavour to answer any questions you and other members of the committee have and seek to help you in relation to your lines of inquiry.</p></speech>

So, it used to trade at a discount to the market and, in 2007, had risen to a premium to the market and with that change, with that increase in value over time, a number of brokers then, at that stage in 2007 or 2008, but especially in 2007, changed their recommendation from a "buy" or a "strong buy" to a "hold" or a "sell".</p></speech>

What was important was to have open dialogue with investors and with brokers and, I think, that the bank engaged in fulsomely.</p></speech>

We heard earlier from another witness that ... three key events, basically, in the crisis for Anglo and the first was the run on Northern Rock, which also happened in the same month as that meeting that you had with potential investors.  Would you agree that the Northern Rock run was the first ... was the beginning of the crisis for Anglo?</p></speech>

I would go back to the time when a fund from a large French bank was ... it was noted into the market that they were no longer going to permit cash calls on the fund.  And I think that was the start of the liquidity crisis or the first signal that became available in the market and that was around August-----</p></speech>

If we move forward then towards the end of the year ... and in December of '07 Anglo develops a policy document for ... "Stress Testing &amp;amp; Scenario Analysis Funding Liquidity Risk".  It is in the evidence book, Vol. 2, page 37, which you would've seen.  We don't have to go into the book actually - it's not that important - but it included details for stress parameters for six different scenarios and their impact on the banks' funding and liquidity positions.  Was the Financial Regulator aware that you were doing that work internally at the time?</p></speech>

And then, so, in terms of any relationship between the work the bank was doing internally to test its own self and how it might get through or manage a crisis, there was no relationship between that work being done and the work being done by the Government, which at the time was modelling - in a simulation - the possibility of an Irish bank failing and what impact that might have on the rest of the system.</p></speech>

So, given that these ... that group risk had done this policy report and undertaken stress testing on a monthly basis, why ... in your opinion, why did the bank not react sooner then, when it came to the - and more robustly, I suppose - to the liquidity problem prior to September 2008?  Why, when you are doing this at the end of 2007 and, as you say, the crisis has begun since August, why, when it comes to September, do you find yourself, having miscalculated the risk actually and the problems that you are going to face-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.1075" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#MM02600"><p>Well, I think from the onset of the crisis, Deputy, in August-September, there was an enormous level of work undertaken in the bank to protect liquidity and it's a very difficult balancing act that a bank undertakes because any show or sign of weakness can cause, actually, the weakness to feed off itself and result in an issue.  So the bank worked very significantly to manage liquidity in the period.  There were a number of issues, I think, which are worth highlighting.  Firstly, the bank was a monoline bank and businesses that are focused, niche players tend to do very well in strong economic environments.  Businesses that are focused, niche players, on the other hand, tend to do less well when economies are hit.  Now, I don't think anybody foresaw the scale of crisis that was going to come but that was a factor that the bank had to handle.<br/><br/>Secondly, the bank was single-A rated and, over time, it became <i>de facto</i>necessary to have a double-A rating to play in the markets.  Thirdly, we had a very particular issue in respect of the CFD holding in the bank and that manifested itself and became known to me towards the end of 200.  But I think the fact that that position was held by so many international counterparties, the market became aware of that and that undoubtedly, in my view, had an impact on liquidity within the bank.</p></speech>

Just on issue 21, which is there, and it was in relation ... 21. (ii), which is on page 70, it talked about the maximum internal property development exposure target being 20% of the loan book.  But at March 2007, that exposure accounted for 25% of the loan book, but the response from the bank was that it had no concern with this, that the borrowers were proven clients with large-scale projects in UK and Ireland.  None of that's familiar to you in terms of being involved in it?</p></speech>

So coming back then to September 2008 and just before the guarantee, in fact, there's a presentation to the board entitled "Strategic Options" from David Drumm.  He notes how the market sees Anglo as a monoline bank with a concentration risk in commercial property and he's proposing a merger with Irish Life and Permanent to create a more diversified business model.  That's in Vol. 1, page 147, that report that he presented, the presentation that he gave.  So were you aware of this at the time?  Late September, you know, Anglo has the difficulties that it has, are you aware that this is being considered by management and the board?</p></speech>

And I think you mentioned ILP, I think that was considered then and certainly at least at one stage earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.1139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#NN05200"><p>Okay.  But so, when the consideration came, I mean, what did that say to you as a senior person in the bank?  Did it tell you ... did it say to you that the business had failed, that the approach that Anglo had taken in the market wasn't successful, that now it found itself in this position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.1140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#NN05300"><p>Well, Deputy, markets changed dramatically beyond recognition.  Banks globally and in Europe were under siege.  The Irish banks suffered significantly and if you were a smaller bank, that was further amplified in terms of the pressure you felt in the market.  So throughout 2008 there were numerous areas of strategic work to raise capital for the bank, to secure the bank's position, to try and diversify the bank, which was obviously one of the potential benefits from ILP.  I had some involvement with the bank's advisers, Morgan Stanley, looking at various options.  There were options considered with Rabobank becoming an investor.  There were options being considered with a larger bank taking over the bank.  So I would say a multitude of options were considered, including doing a rights issue to bolster capital in the bank.  But most banks that had tried to do that during 2008, unless they were a global branded player, seemed to damage themselves in the market.  So the market read, if you went to raise capital you had an issue and, therefore, doubly punished you.</p></speech>

So, the bank had a liquidity issue.  I thought at that time that the issues we had seen and the deterioration in the economy wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad so I really felt that liquidity, solving liquidity, would save the bank at that point in time.</p></speech>

I think the context though, just to be helpful to the committee, is banks were under siege and Irish banks were under very significant siege at the time.  International markets and players in markets can make a lot of money if share prices go up and others can make a lot of money if share prices go down.  So there are always parties looking to seek value through the rise in a share price and others looking to seek value through the fall of a share price.  At the time, clearly, markets were very sensitive.  I don&rsquo;t agree, by the way, with the version of events as written in that manner but of course all the banks at the time engaged with all the parties who were writing about the bank.</p><p>With a bank, it is very important, if you ... if issues happen in a bank - and remember at the time we had the regulator coming in because of rumours that were being spread by parties, potentially to play their own business or play their own book - it is very important that during that fragile time that some balance is given to that situation.</p></speech>

I understand your point.  At that time, Senator, all I can say to you is the bank thought it was going to work through the crisis that it was beginning to face.  And if messages are given to the market that are incorrect or inaccurate at the point in time, then that can have a very significant impact on the bank's funding and the bank's stability.  And indeed many authorities from ... including our own here in Ireland and elsewhere took action to ensure that commentators were, you know, were safe in how they put things across.  I think I heard it from another person, Mr. Cardiff, talking about, you know, if people knew at the time that they were looking at a rescue plan, that in itself, if it became public, would cause the issue.  And I think that mentality, rightly or wrongly, existed with people in the banks.</p></speech>

What I can provide, Senator, as background is that the capital norms had changed, so Anglo had significant capital well above regulatory limits.  But the market determined new limits and, as a result, banks everywhere in the world were seeking alternative sources of capital, and that public market avenues which were normal were very nervous and closed to such activities, and hence the reason to approach private equity providers and sovereign wealth providers.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, if we might just stay with you for a moment, I just want to deal with one question and then I'll bring in the other questioners now that the leads have completed.  Mr. Moran, in June 2008 Anglo prepared a financial projections for the 2008 to 2012 period.  This is less than, what, four or five months before the guarantee and just about six months out from nationalisation, one of which was an "extreme stress case".  Under this scenario, loan loss provisions were estimated at 1.2%.  That's up on the screen there at the moment.</p><p>You see it there, I think it's the second last column on the page.  And so loan loss provisions were estimated at 1.2% of the portfolio over the period of 2009 to 2012.  It's in your document books there - if you just want to reference the book rather than look at the screen, it's in Vol. 2.  I think it's page 33.</p></speech>

It's the Anglo annual report of 2009.  And here what we actually see is that, in the event, the actual impairment charge at the end of 2009 amounted to 19.2% of the loan portfolio.  So what was predicted was 1.2% and what actually happened was 19.2%.  Did management get any external economic advice or input into the stress test scenario?</p></speech>

So it was, you know, a massive multiple and, at the time, whilst people felt, I believe, that the economy was worsening and the situation was worsening, people did not anticipate the scale of what happened.  When, in 2009, the new board undertook a detailed ... or instructed the undertaking of a detailed bottom-up exercise with some external help, there were two very clear issues.  Firstly, the last quarter of 2008 had worsened dramatically and then, in the first quarter 2009, it got further worse.</p></speech>

There was preparations, at some stage or other of 2008, with regard to nationalisation legislation for financial institutions.  And there's more than what might be considered a degree of flux actually in the market.  So, in that regard, did management consider a doomsday scenario as part of this stress test exercise?</p></speech>

And that was a consequence of the flux, as you say, in the market at the time.  So there was intense involvement and, indeed, that was part of my life throughout that period, looking at how do you underscore or underpin the balance sheet given the way the economics were beginning to change.</p></speech>

So some time in the '90s it established a UK division.  Some time in the 2000s - in the noughties - it established a US division.</p></speech>

But the retrospect view is clear that - and from what I have seen in other documents and issues around certain controls - that credit appeared to weaken and controls around risk appeared to weaken.</p></speech>

I am intrigued by your reference to the credit committee.  On page 10 of your witness statement, you say "up to 200 staff members ... could serve on a credit committee", and in the appendix then you explain that when you add in the number of people who might dial in by video conference and those who would be attending directly who would be relevant, "some 30 to 60 people would attend each committee out of some 200 potential participants", and a credit committee meeting would have been held every other day perhaps.</p></speech>

I never sat on the board and I don't know if this was given to them.

It says, and bearing in mind this was November 2008, "We believe that Anglo Irish Bank will be the most profitable and capital generative of all publicly quoted financial institutions in Ireland over the five year period", the five-year period being 2009 to 2013, exclusive.  In light of the fact that this was just a few months before nationalisation, a few months before the bank was making impairment provision of over &euro;4 billion and ultimately cost many billions of euro to the State and the taxpayer, how can you rationalise for the general public how this statement was made or that conclusion was come to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.1346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#SS00800"><p>It's not my conclusion, Deputy, but I can understand fully why you can ask that question in the context of what ultimately happened.  I think others have come before the committee and explained that 2008 and the first three quarters of 2008 were very different to what ultimately happened.  The fourth quarter of 2008 saw a significant downturn but that materialised later, and in '09 and '10 the collapse in the economies, in particular in Ireland, but also elsewhere where the bank was - they were all correlated if you will - led the bank to have a much worse position than the assumptions that were used to create this view.  So, fundamentally, risk did not believe that the bank would suffer this level of losses, and the other elements of the bank's model were positive contributors.  For example, it had a cost-to-income ratio that was very low, so it meant that for revenue generated in a period, a significant element of that would convert to profit, so it had some buffers.  Now, nationalisation, from what I understand, occurred for numerous reasons, rather than implying it just to be the level of loss, but I understand your question obviously.</p></speech>

I want to - well, I suppose - ask you also in relation to your own time working in Anglo firstly.  When again, just remind me ... I was just trying to find the date that you started working in Anglo.</p></speech>

What was the overriding culture of Anglo Irish Bank?  Was it very different than other institutions that you worked in or was it largely similar?</p></speech>

From afar, Anglo was seen as a strongly performing business.  The culture in the bank was one that was very customer-centric, very customer-focused.  People were very hard-working.  That was the attitude in the bank.  So in those earlier years I was there, those characteristics were good and strong characteristics, I would say, of the culture in the bank.  It was a smaller business so people knew each other.  You know, it was relatively small at 2,000 people compared to the larger banks of 15,000 to 20,000 and beyond elsewhere in international scene.  So that's some colour of what it was like.</p></speech>

Well, I don't want to rehash the statements or the references that have been made by the first two speakers, Senator Barrett and Deputy Murphy.  You would have been portrayed in the media, in some of those books that were published and other articles, as being somewhat of an enforcer for the line.  I suppose, to use a political phrase, one could equate you with a chief whip kind of role in terms of how you were portrayed at least in the media.  Is that an accurate portrayal do you think?  Outside of the three references that Senator Barrett made to those particular meetings that took place, were there other similar events, and did you see that as part of your function?  Were you acting off your own bat or was that something that you were instructed to do?</p></speech>

That is obviously for them to comment, rather than for me.  I worked very hard in the bank.  I had that ethic about me and I was seen as someone who could take on difficult issues and look to try and solve them.  I can say no more than that.  Others can comment and, you know, these were stressful times obviously in 2007 and 2008, but others can comment, not me.</p></speech>

Finally, I wish to ask you in relation to ... it is core document 2, pages 3 to 5.  I'll get it myself, yes, "Exceptions to Credit Policy for Anglo Loans Transferred to NAMA".  Information provided by the special liquidators on exceptions to credit policy for loans transferred to NAMA shows that the aggregate value of exceptions identified was almost &euro;32 million or 92% of the value of the book which transferred to NAMA.  Can you explain for the committee why the level of exceptions to credit policy was so high?</p></speech>

I wasn't a lender.  I wasn't in risk.  I wasn't aware of that level or that headline.  Clearly, on the face of it, it's very significant and it's very surprising.  To give a more meaningful answer I think anyone who'd look at this would need to go down through and understand what was the nature of the exception.  You know, without looking at it, it's hard to comment, but the size ultimately and the percentage is of itself just a very significant level.</p></speech>

Thank you, Chairman.  It was provided to me anyway by the group chief executive and one of the key issues with a CFD, which we learned, was you don't have any rights relating to the share.  So the underlying bank can do what they want with respect to the share.  They can take the shares.  They can use them for some other reason.  They can not buy the shares.  But in effect what happened in late 2007 and early 2008 and right through 2008 that the market became very focused on share price as a proxy for risk and so you have what's called the VIX index or the fear index as it became known at the time, where that gyrated wildly and if share prices were moving up and down, whereas historically, funders would, I think, have very seldom looked at that, it now became a core area of focus for any depositor.</p></speech>

So then just to go back to your point because I think it is important to give the context, the counterparty held the risk if the ultimate investor didn't pay them.  So the counterparty at any stage could say "I'm selling."  Market players who wanted to bet on the share price going down could influence that in any way or if the share price did go down, it might have created a trigger for that CFD holder to automatically sell.  If you sell, you push the share price down again and it feeds off itself.</p></speech>

Just one other area I want to look at very briefly, if I may, is the development lending and Anglo's exposure to it in 2008, because in March 2008, your bank's exposure to development lending was 15% of the loan book.  By December, the exposure is at 23%, but this wasn't because you'd increased your lending; it was because you reclassified a section of loans.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

But, as you were saying earlier in your testimony, in early 2008 we weren't into those gigantic sums and all those extra zero spaces and guarantees.

Just to be very clear to you, I was fully aware that the bank was involved in providing interest roll-up facilities as part of its book.  The bank had a significant element of development lending, for which interest roll-up was a natural feature.  The quantum, and I say that very truthfully, the quantum of &euro;3 billion, when I saw it, I was not aware of that level prior to receiving this document.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  In doing so we will now commence session 3 of today, or 4 of today's hearings actually, with Mr. David Went, former group chief executive ILP-Permanent TSB.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session, can I ask members and those present in the public Gallery to ensure their mobile devices are switched off.</p><p>This afternoon, the focus of the inquiry is on Irish Life and Permanent and Permanent TSB.  At this session we will hear from Mr. David Went, former group chief executive of ILP-Permanent TSB.  Mr. David Went was appointed managing director of Irish Life Assurance plc Dublin in 1998 and group chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent plc in 2000.  Mr. Went retired in May 2007.  He spent most of his career with the NatWest group, where he was chief executive of the Ulster Bank group from 1988 to 1994 and chief executive of the Coutts group from 1994 to 1997.  Mr. Went, you're very welcome before the committee this evening.  Thank you.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  Yet, to assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the affirmation to Mr. Went?</p></speech>

Well, I've reviewed in detail the contents of the core books provided to me by the joint committee and while I hope to assist the committee in so far as possible, I would like it noted that much of the material provided to me in the core books relates to events which took place after my retirement from Permanent TSB, or from Irish Life and Permanent.  I hope and expect to be in a position to answer any questions the committee may have from 1998 up to my retirement at May 2007; however, I may be unable to comment on matters that occurred after my retirement for obvious reasons.</p> <p>  I will now comment on the lines of inquiry that you asked me.  First of all, the composition, skills and experience of the board members.  The merger of Irish Life and Irish Permanent in April 1999 was effected by the purchase of Irish Life by Irish Permanent.  Irish Permanent became the holding company for the new corporate group, as well as a licensed bank, and the merged board became not just the board of the bank but the group board of the enlarged entity.  I became group chief executive of ILP in 2000.  The bank chief executive became an executive director on the group board reporting directly to me.  The initial ... it was recognised that the initial composition of the board would require adjustment over a two to three-year period and over the years to 2006, a non-executive nominations committee reviewed the composition, increasingly with external assistance, and directors were appointed with a wide range of skills and experience.  There was always a majority of non-executive directors and my view is that we had a suitably skilled, inquisitive and challenging board, fully capable to supervise the business in a fully effective manner.  Board evaluation of performance was carried out regularly with external assistance.</p> <p>  Quality of the business model setting: following a strategic review of the business on my appointment in 1998, the board concluded that the acquisition of a banking customer base was a strategic imperative.  The merger with Irish Permanent plc followed and the opportunity arose to acquire the Trustee Savings Bank in 2001.  It increased customer numbers, had a substantial deposit base and permitted ILP to become a real participant in the current account market, regarded as a core product for bank assurers.  Strategic planning was carried out through a series of strategic plans, usually over three-year periods, covering a SWOT analysis review of the economic and competitive environment, potential acquisitions, costs, challenges, etc.  And a detailed annual budget focused on the operational implementation of the agreed strategy.  Discussion of both strategic plans and annual budgets considered the capital strength of the group and bank, with an overriding objective of maintaining at all times a buffer over minimum regulatory requirements.</p><p>The board was fully involved in the process and external expertise was used better to inform the process.<br/><br/>ILP developed a very clear &ldquo;Ireland First&rdquo; strategy aimed at becoming a leading provider of personal financial services in Ireland.  By the end of 2006 it consisted - with the exception of a relatively small centralised mortgage provider, CHL, in the UK - primarily on the provision of Irish house mortgages, both owner-occupier and buy-to-let, together with a significant car finance business and a commercial lending business.  We did not become involved in large development or speculative property lending nor lending on raw land, due to a combination of restrained risk appetite and skill deficits in respect of those types of lending.  The strategy focused on lower-risk, widely-spread portfolios of lending in an attractive home market where we had operated successfully for many years.  We did not anticipate the savage downturn and the damage it would do to the chosen business model, especially when combined with the complete breakdown of funding options.<br/><br/>Adequacy of board oversight over internal controls - board oversight over internal controls was comprehensive and some of the regular reports that the board received are listed in my witness statement, and I will not go into them further here.  There was a very detailed chief executive&rsquo;s report covering the performance of all business units of the group, together with the latest available financial information.  All of these reports were the subject of detailed discussion at board.<br/><br/>The appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite - as I've said earlier, the lending strategy was focused around house mortgages, both for residential purposes and investment, and this accounted for the bulk of the loan portfolio, 88%.  In addition, about 5.5% of total lending was accounted for by commercial loans for the purchase of investment property, generally with the benefit of a long-term lease.  The objective was to build up a portfolio primarily consisting of a substantial number of relatively low ticket or small ... smallish residential loans, giving a wide spread of borrowers and locations with conservative loan-to-value ratios - average 71% at inception in 2006.  However, in the event, the extent of the decline in residential property prices did not protect the portfolio on the downside.<br/><br/>Appropriateness of credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management - credit policies were reviewed regularly and changes required approval of the board and were advised to the regulator.  LTV ratios were reasonable, averaging 71% for residential home loans, although first-time buyer loan-to-values reached 87% in 2006 following the introduction of 100% mortgages in 2005.  Borrowers were tested for repayment capacity, including a stressed 2% interest test.  Similar policies were applied to residential investment property loans, with both LTV and rental cover ratios for interest payments.  Commercial loans policies primarily consisted of loan-to-value ratios to a maximum of 75% to 80%.  Instalment credit loans were automatically credit scored using industry standard scorecards with suitable controls over exception approvals.  Delegated authorities were determined on a tiered basis depending on the experience of the holder.  Larger loans would require reference to a central credit unit under the supervision of a very experienced retail lender.  Loans in excess of this discretion were referred to a group credit committee consisting of a number of experienced lenders, including the chief risk officer, and chaired by the group finance director.  Exceptions to policy were approved on a case-by-case basis, generally on a &quot;next higher&quot; basis.  The board received monthly reports on all loans in excess of &euro;6.35 million and, in relation to loans approved as exceptions to policy, within the delegated discretion system.  Similar arrangements applied to our business in the UK - CHL.<br/><br/>The stress test required by the Central Bank in 2006 included a house price reduction of approximately 22% over two years, with a modest recovery in year three, together with increased unemployment rising to 9.7% over the three years of the test.  Housing completions were assumed at 50,000 per annum throughout.  While none of the scenarios modelled indicated serious threat to the solvency of the bank, it should be noted that the actual extent of the price declines and rise in unemployment subsequently vastly exceeded those set.  However, the most significant defect in these tests lay in the absence of tests involving stress on the funding side.  Perhaps this was because of the now proven to be unfounded belief in the strength and durability of the sources of funding available to banks in Ireland.  There were no specific warning signs and, indeed, global capital markets had come through many periods of severe stress over the past 20 to 30 years and at this time had never appeared so accommodating to reasonably rated borrowers.  However, the deterioration in sentiment towards Ireland and the Irish banks post-2006 demonstrated quite clearly that there is effectively only one counterparty in wholesale markets as Professor Nyberg perceptively remarked in his report of 2011.  Failure to anticipate this truth, in common with many others, remains, in my view, the single biggest error that was committed in our business plans.<br/><br/>Analysis of risk concentration in the base, adverse economic scenarios and the impact on capital structures - as I said earlier, the overall portfolio was very widely spread and remained largely unchanged in terms of concentration in the years 2001 to 2006, which underlined the consistency of our strategy.  I've previously referred to the results of the 2006 stress test, which appeared satisfactory in terms of a robust response to economic shocks which were considered severe at that time but clearly, with hindsight, absolutely inadequate to model the actual impacts of the recession of 2008-2010.<br/><br/>Adequacy of the incentive and remuneration arrangements to promote sound risk governance - all remuneration arrangements for senior executives, including myself, required the approval of the remuneration committee, consisting entirely of non-executive directors.  In the case of the senior executives - myself and those reporting directly to me - the package consisted of a base salary, a bonus opportunity up to 60% of salary, access to group share options up to a maximum multiple of salary and membership of various group defined benefit pension schemes.  I did not become a member of a defined benefit pension scheme as I joined Irish Life at age 51, with an anticipated retirement age of 60.<br/><br/>Overall remuneration terms were reviewed regularly with the advice of international remuneration consultants.  While at this remove total reward is substantial, it was not excessive relative to that scene in the Irish market.  However, it is clear that public perception of remuneration in financial services at this time is that it was excessive and it's clear that this perception is reality for financial services executives, including myself, and I fully accept that.  Bonus payments for those reporting directly to me were based on individually designed objectives agreed with the remuneration committee, reviewed at the half year, and performance overall was agreed at year end, with bonuses based on that performance.  Monthly business reviews were held with those executives.  I do not believe that the remuneration arrangements led to a culture of excessive risk taking, given the checks and balances within the overall credit approval system, including the group credit committee structure and the treasury policy, which I think you heard about this morning.<br/><br/>Impact of shareholder or lending relationships in promoting independent challenge by the board - ILP was a publicly quoted company with a very widely spread investor base, including a substantial retail element.  As such, we met regularly with institutional shareholders in Ireland and overseas.  These meetings involved exchanges of views on company performance, strategy, etc.  While on occasion our overall performance was regarded quite unfavourably in comparison to a number of our competitors, particularly in relation to our non-involvement in large-scale property lending or lending to the SME sector, we did not change our stance on this as we lacked both risk appetite and the skills to undertake that business.  We reported the feedback to the board and considered whether we should modify strategy to take account of these views.  But in general terms, we maintained over this period a very consistent approach to the business in strategic terms.  Because of our business model, we did not have lending relationships with borrowers of the nature that, I think, are ... is implied in this line of inquiry.<br/><br/>Appropriateness of the regulatory regime - the regulatory regime has been characterised as principles-based and light-touch.  However, I would characterise it more as unbalanced, with a substantial, relatively well-resourced and quite intrusive, self-confident consumer focus contrasting markedly with an under-resourced and tentative low key prudential activity.  This seemed to be confirmed by the <i>ex officio</i>directorship of the consumer director of the regulator in contrast to the position of the prudential director.</p><p>This misallocation led to an inability of the supervisor to analyse in a meaningful way the substantial flow of information that banks provided.  In addition, when on-site inspections took place - and that was rarely - there was substantial delay in furnishing reports and dealing with bank responses.  Responses to the submission of requested information on particular topics were also very slow.  </p><p> While there was contact between the regulator and ILP group at a variety of levels, my contact was mainly restricted to twice-yearly visits to the regulator and the prudential director to review half-yearly and annual accounts.  While these meetings were businesslike and professional, they contrasted markedly with meetings I had experienced elsewhere with other regulators.  Clearly, my interactions with the regulator or certainly ... I'm sorry ... Certainly, my interactions with the regulator bore no resemblance to the extremely thorough reviews with rating agencies.</p><p> The regulator appeared reluctant to use its power of moral suasion that I believed it possessed, preferring to take a very legalistic view of its power.  I recall contacting the regulator regarding the introduction of 100% mortgages, which I regarded as an unnecessary and unwelcome development, but it was made clear to me that the regulator regarded itself as powerless to intervene.  It's my view that the regulator failed to fulfil its prudential function.  It is, obviously, primarily a failure on the part of management and boards of banks that was responsible for the crisis that emerged.  However, as with all participants in the creation of the crisis, I'm sure that different decisions at different times by the regulator could have reduced the severity of events. </p><p> The nature and appropriateness of the relationship between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and banking institutions: I have no direct knowledge of the relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and, therefore, I don't consider it appropriate for me to speculate.  I can recall only a couple of occasions when I would personally have contacted the regulator on a matter of concern and only one semi-social event - an in-house lunch with my chairman at the offices of the regulator.  We were members of the Irish Bankers Federation and we tended to prefer interactions on industry issues to be conducted by them.  To the best of my knowledge, during this period I had no contact with the Minister for Finance, the Secretary General of the Department and other senior civil servants unless perhaps at industry gatherings - Institute of Bankers' functions, IBEC, etc.</p><p> Appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: The committee has heard evidence from a number of witnesses in respect of these matters.  I have no direct experience of the nature or appropriateness of these relationships and, therefore, I do not believe I can usefully comment.  </p><p> Conclusion: In preparing for this appearance, I have reviewed thoroughly the last accounts for which I was responsible - 31 December 2006 -  together with the economic backdrop at the time in order to explain the subsequent outcomes which contributed to such negative outcomes for staff, customers, shareholders and, of course, the Irish State and its people, all of which I deeply regret.  While bank margins had declined over the period due to a combination of a very competitive mortgage market, including the introduction from the UK of tracker mortgages, together with an increased use of wholesale funding to fund customer lending, bank profits had more than doubled to &euro;202 million, while capital remained sound with a risk asset ratio at 10.4% comfortably meeting the objective of exceeding regulatory minima. </p><p> The two issues which I think best demonstrate the sharp contrast between the time of my leaving and subsequent events are the mortgage portfolio and liquidity on 31 December 2006.  Mortgage quality, which was 88% of the book on December 2006: aside from apparently healthy LTV ratios, which I have illustrated in some detail in my witness statement, the arrears position was healthy.  Since 2002, cases in arrears had halved, from 7.1% to 3.4% of the portfolio and case numbers had reduced despite the increase of mortgage accounts by approximately 20%.  The strong consensus of economic commentary, domestically and internationally, was that despite the rapid expansion of both credit and house prices the economy was fundamentally sound &ndash; the soft landing scenario. </p><p> We now know that in the period 2008 to 2010 the economy, partly from events abroad, encountered its worst recession ever, vastly exceeding the levels for which the regulator had stress tested in 2006, and, clearly, this was in the nature of the fabled 400-year flood.  The liquidity position on December 31 2006: at the end of 2006, the bank appeared to be well funded, with very easy access to a variety of apparently liquid capital market sources; long-term debt repayments were very widely spread; there was a relatively low use of securitisation; and there was a significant availability of secured repo and ECB eligible collateral together with approximately 35% customer deposits.  Long-term debt, securitisation and customer deposits together provided 65% of funding.  Moody's rating agency increased the financial ... the ratings strength of ILP to AAA in early 2007 while S and P maintained a rating of A+ at end 2007.  Events subsequently proved this funding model absolutely inadequate.  External events, together with negative views on Irish credit portfolios ensured that very rapidly all capital markets were closed to IL P with the disastrous effects that we now know.  The error here was clearly failing to recognise Professor Nyberg&rsquo;s point that in the capital markets there is only one counterparty and, hence, if one source closes to a borrower, all will close simultaneously.</p><p> In summary, Chairman, from my perspective Irish Life and Permanent was a sound and well-run business when I retired and I was shocked and disappointed at the impact of subsequent events.  I deeply regret the consequences for the staff, customers, shareholders of Irish Life and Permanent and, of course, for the Irish people.  I hope my statement will assist the committee in its task.</p></speech>

When I first heard about it, I was, in the common parlance, I was fit to be tied.  I found the ... I felt that this was a product that was not required.  The maximum LTV ratio at that stage was 92% so I did not believe that going to 100% was something that there was a crying demand for that product in the marketplace.  I also felt that this introduced into the Irish market an unattractive feature which was potentially competing on credit quality, which was ... rather than on price, service, you know, all ... a number of other things, but ... things that banks had competed on for years ... but, it had not generally been the practice in the Irish market for banks to compete on credit quality and, therefore, I felt that this was a very retrograde step.</p><p>I also felt that in general terms that it introduced for the first time into the Irish market, you know, a no-moral-hazard product for the mortgage customer, effectively.  It had always been my view that, you know, the ... having ... customers having to demonstrate some form of saving over a period of time, having to demonstrate that they had a deposit for their house ... all of those things were good social things and good from the point of view of prudential situation.</p></speech>

I gave him the gist of what I've just said to you - that I thought this was a bad product, a bad idea and that in my view the regulator should seek to forbid the product.  We went through a conversation about the fact that that the regulator was a principles-based regulator and therefore ... and played no part in the approval of specific products, all of those things.  And I made the point to him that I thought he was taking ... I thought ... that I thought he was taking a rather legalistic view of his powers and in particular at that time I would've concluded that he did not seem to think that he could use the power of moral suasion that I believed a regulator has in relation to a regulated business.  We had that discussion.  I indicated to him that I thought that, for example, you know, the particular bank that had introduced this was a subsidiary of a major UK bank.</p></speech>

I ... there may well have been some people who got them, but very very limited.  Investment property loans ... residential investment property loans were different because the tax treatment of interest on investment property loans was such that there was a very significant benefit in having as much interest charged on the loan as possible.  And obviously it increased the risk, but our experience was, and the experience up until 2006 in any event was that there were very low levels of arrears on residential investment property loans.</p></speech>

However, we had concluded that for us the primary thing that we looked at was the extent to which customer deposits, long-term debt and securitisation funded our total loan book.  And that was about two thirds of it was funded through that, and these were seen as relatively stable sources of funding, and that was ... that, therefore ... and that proportion had been relatively stable over a number of years.</p><p>Clearly wholesale funding was required to ... to finance growth and indeed, you know, looking back on it that was one of the, that was one of the key attractions that people saw in the introduction of the euro, as far as the Irish was concerned, because Ireland ... one of the problems that there had been in Ireland, why there had been such a wide divergence of interest rates between Irish rates and European rates, was that there was a relatively small pool of capital and once Ireland entered the euro, Irish banks, who had been somewhat constrained in terms of their access to, to funding, they were now ... they now had access to the second, or one of the two widest and deepest and most liquid markets in the world.  So that was ... so that was seen as a very attractive proposition.</p></speech>

So, to some extent, you know, the argument ... the argument about the sufficiency of capital is ... is a very relevant argument, however you know, liquidity is a much more significant issue in my view.</p></speech>

Mr. Went, finally can I ask you what role, if any, did you play in your institution in bringing it to a point where it needed to be rescued for the State, less than 18 months after you left your position?  What decisions did you make that helped bring that about or do you completely absolve yourself from any decisions or directions that the bank took at your time that set it on this course?</p></speech>

And, you know, I&rsquo;ve made the point that we, we made an error in relation to, with hindsight - and you know we would not have been, we would not have been in a small crowd in relation to that sort of hindsight - with hindsight, in relation to not fully recognising the point that Professor Nyberg makes on capital markets that once ... because that ultimately goes to the question of confidence and once confidence goes in an institution the institution is doomed, you know, in the long term.  So we certainly made an error in not recognising that.  And we also made an error in not recognising that there was a possibility of a 50% drop in house prices.  You know we ... that was far ... that would far and away have exceeded any drop in house prices - instantaneous, almost instantaneous, drop in house prices - that anybody would have foreseen.  So those, those were two errors that were made and I take responsibility for that.</p></speech>

I guess we always ... we were always conscious of the risk inherent because every banking business is a risk business.  I suppose we, we focused on ... there were two aspects of risk in our business.  One was the, the mortgage, you know, the mortgage portfolio and the extent to which there was a cushion in there through loan-to-value ratios and we believed that with an average loan-to-value ratio of 71% at inception, there was a substantial cushion there.  And equally we ... on the liquidity side we believed, looking at the way in which we looked at it, you know the two thirds of our funding came from long-term debt, customer deposits which would presume to be sticky, and securitisation which actually matched the tenor of the assets - that's two thirds of that, leaving only one third to be covered through short-term facilities - we concluded that that risk was satisfactory.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-03a.1670" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Went" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090300002#DDD00400"><p>I mean, the issue of tracker mortgages was discussed before we began to offer them.  The problem with tracker mortgages is basis risk because, traditionally, mortgage products were lent on a ... on what you might call an "administered rate" basis, a standard variable rate basis.  So, therefore, if interest rates went up on the deposit side, the bank had the discretion to raise the interest rates on the asset side, so there could be a pretty much immediate re-pricing of both asset and liability.  However, in the UK, in particular, tracker mortgages had become a very significant feature of the market in the '80s - sorry, in the '90s - and these ... tracker mortgages are where you lend at a fixed margin over the official rate.  So that introduces another rate ... another element of risk, which is basis risk, where if you, for example, are lending at 1% over the ECB rate and the ECB rate goes up by 0.25%, well, that reduces your margin to 75 basis points, so that's not a good thing.</p> <p>  So the ... and what ... how we analyse that risk would have been to look back over the period.  I mean, we didn't have a very long period of euro rates, but we had a reasonably long period of Deutsche mark rates, which would have been a proxy for that.  And when you look back over the previous 20 to 25 years, you would have seen periods where official rates diverged from market rates for periods of extreme stress.  In 1987, Black Wednesday, when Gorbachev was ... or Yeltsin was kidnapped in Russia, like, there was a tremendous dislocation of markets.  So individual deposits ... market deposit rates spiked and official rates didn't.  But by and large, those periods were relatively short and if you had to sit and suffer, you know, a contraction of your margin over a period of time, it wasn't a bad thing.</p></speech>

In ... with the benefit of hindsight, was that a good decision?</p></speech>

And it's fair to say that there was considerable discussion of that particular proposition at the board.  There had been some concerns in the US over sub-prime mortgages.  There was a concern that this was, you know, was a sub-prime mortgage business.  That wasn't the way in which it was conceived by Irish Life and Permanent.  It was conceived by Irish Life and Permanent as being a, sort of, a non-standard mortgage, not very far ... potentially quite close to a standard mortgage but certainly not sub-prime.</p></speech>

However, we always ... we took a very cautious approach to that.  We decided that, you know, we did not have all the skills necessary to enter into that business, so we entered into a joint venture with Merrill Lynch, where the financial risk was 50:50 split.</p></speech>

Did you at any time voice your concerns, either internally to the board of the bank, to the bankers' federation, which you mentioned in your statement, or, indeed, did you voice your concerns to the regulator, outside of that 100% mortgages issue, about lack of sufficient prudential regulation?</p></speech>

New facility breaks down the barriers between mortgage lending and other personal loans.  Permanent TSB, the country's largest mortgage provider, has announced the launch of the first cheque book-based mortgage account in Ireland.  The new facility, One Plan, would allow customers to use an ordinary cheque book to pay for items such as holidays, consumer goods, education fees and, of course, home improvements.  Any funds used for such purposes will only attract mortgage rates of interest and no other form of borrowing provides such good value to customers as mortgage borrowing.</blockquote> <p>How do you feel about that particular product now or do you think that it was marketed, as it was marketed at the time ...

That was what the basic purpose was.  So, for example, using the extension point you just made it was that, you know, you could take out a One Plan loan ... you're ... that would be ... you would have your core mortgage and then as you spent your money on the extension, you know, you could actually use ... you could actually pay for it yourself rather than having to come to the bank and ask for it.</p></speech>

Again, I want to change to the issue of remuneration and, I think, on page 5 of your statement you said: "I do not believe that the remuneration arrangements led to a culture of excessive risk taking given the checks and balances with the overall credit approval system."

There was no direct correlation between the payment of a bonus and an individual loan.</p></speech>

I mean ... just, sorry, I'll go back.  In terms of determining whether or not people were lending just for the sake of lending, there were a number of audit-type processes in relation to that.  There was a credit quality process that was run by the credit group and they would go through and look at experience of individual lenders and if the experience of individual lenders were that arrears were coming up, that would be a bad thing.  Equally, then, the internal audit function would have done separately, as part of their internal audit of a branch or wherever, they would have done a review of that.  So, to the extent that lenders were lending just for the sake of lending, I don't believe that that would have been a serious problem, no.</p></speech>

Finally, your strategy as a group was to focus on the domestic Irish mortgage market which you were ... and, I don't know, perhaps, still are one of the, you know, the largest lender.  Was there ever any effort during your time as chief executive to diversify?  You mentioned, I think, in your statement again that you felt you didn't have the necessary skill set to be looking to SMEs and to, maybe, "the productive sector", as it might be termed.  Was there ever any discussion at senior management and board level that, perhaps, that was something that Irish Life and Permanent TSB should be looking to do?</p></speech>

I'll deal with that in two parts if you like.  For the first period of my time with this group, we spent our time exiting substantial investments that we had overseas that were sub-scale, relatively unprofitable and we decided that we wished to allocate that capital to Ireland where there appeared to be much better economic opportunities and where we had a really substantial market position where we felt we could make better use of that capital.  So, that's a general point.  The second point you make about SME lending ... I came from a background of running a retail bank, Ulster Bank, and I was fully aware of the extent to which the branch manager and the overall process by which people progress in the bank and become branch managers ... the overall point ... the overall way in which that happens and I concluded and I persuaded my colleagues on the board that it was really too big a stretch for us to, if you like, reverse engineer an SME lending capability into our branch network because I just did not believe we had the skills to do that and I believed that those - and I still believe that - that those skills were actually special skills.  You know, you started off by being a clerk to a lender and then you progressed your way up, you went into an advances department, you know, all of those sort of things.  I just concluded that we could not reverse engineer those without excessive risk into our branch network and, in particular, I knew from having run Ulster Bank that the clearing banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank, actually were pretty good at doing that and we would have found it very difficult to compete in that market.</p></speech>

So, that was the broad thrust of the strategy and I think you may have heard that this morning-----</p></speech>

I mean, were you intentionally changing the balance, changing the mix?</p></speech>

But as I said earlier ... as I said in my opening statement, you know, the ... we viewed the opportunity to fund in a variety, a wide variety of wholesale markets, as a really attractive part of joining the euro.  And, you know, when we look back ... and at the time, wholesale markets, I won't say ... they almost looked invincible.  Now, with hindsight, they weren't and, in particular, I come back to this point that ... and I do acknowledge that this is a significant error ... that we did not recognise the risk that, if confidence left the Irish banking system, markets would all close, just like that.</p></speech>

Okay.  Now, wait a second ...  yes, there was a ... excuse me for reading from this, potentially ... We introduced this ... an updated liquidity policy in October 2003 and this was based on the Basel committee on banking supervisions paper, Sound Practices for Managing Liquidity in Banking Organisations, and there were three ... essentially this was looking at contingency funding and there were three specific examples.  One was a moderate entity-specific crisis; in other words, this was a crisis just about us and you know, some money had gone astray or something like that.  Under that ...an unexpected cashflow problem only likely to last a few days.  It was presumed under this scenario that wholesale and retail deposits, short-term paper funding programmes would remain intact and that we'd sell off liquid assets to meet the thing.  A severe entity-specific crisis which affected our ratings and this would have been where we would have suffered a major downgrade - two notches on long term and one on short term - and it was assumed there that unsecured sources would be severely affected.  The scenario could take weeks to possibly three months to stabilise and it was anticipated that not only would we use our liquid assets, but we would use securitisation, you know, the eligible collateral to do that.  And the final one, then, was an industry-wide crisis where there are liquidity problems in the banking system as a whole causing widespread disruption to markets.  The best defence is described as maximising our ability to deal with stress under scenario two.  Under that scenario, we also assumed that the regulatory authorities would be aggressive in providing support to the system, making Central Bank borrowing effectively the swing factor in ensuring the survival of the institution.  We implemented ... we conducted those tests using the Basel requirements every month and they were submitted to ALCO, you know, to our asset liability committee, on a monthly basis.  So, this was not something that we did not consider.  We did consider it.</p></speech>

I wasn&rsquo;t around at the time so I&rsquo;m ... I&rsquo;m speculating to some extent ... but, no, I'm speculating to some extent.  Perhaps it was because people took a more negative view of the asset portfolio of Irish Life than they did of other people&rsquo;s portfolios, that&rsquo;s one aspect of it.  So, therefore, depositors wanted to withdraw their money more than they might have done with other people.  Equally, because we had a very wide sort ... we had a substantial reliance on ... we had a substantial amount of short-term funding, that all just stopped straight away.  Commercial paper average duration was 40 days so once the commercial paper market was shut, like, you know, that was it.  So that was what ... and I&rsquo;m not sure that any analysis of this, any stress testing of this would actually have taken you to where it actually went to.</p></speech>

The ... PTSB were very active in the residential investment property market, called RIP in the era - and I think it may be a good Freudian slip.

And I think you have somewhere in these papers some examples of changes in credit policy and I presume the reason for having them in here is to show the way in which the thought process, in terms of the changes, operated.  And that's, you know ... so every time there was a change in credit policy, a logical process was gone through and the decision obviously at the end was that this was a ... you know, this was not an imprudent way to go.</p></speech>

Well, you know, when ... the volume we did was a factor of the volume available in the market and the volume that ... and our traditional and historical market share.  Our market share over these five or six-year period ... this five or six-year period, would have ranged from at the bottom 20% up to around about 23% and that was below our historical average.  So, you know, we weren&rsquo;t doing anything out of the ordinary as far as ... as far as market share was concerned.  It wasn&rsquo;t as if we had come from, you know, making one house loan in 2000 to making 15 million house loans in 2006.</p></speech>

What happened to Irish banking?  It was conservative, it lent wisely, although conservatively, the people in it were pillars of society and respected, they were valued members of society, they promoted thrift.

First of all, I'd have to say I&rsquo;m heartsick by what happened to Ulster Bank.  I left Ulster Bank in 1994.

I mean, you know, you go back to the &ndash; and I won&rsquo;t debate this philosophically too much &ndash; but you go back to the point you made about, you know, Ulster Bank being a very sound, solid bank and everything else.  If you also go back to that time, the one consistent thread of political comment on banking was that banks weren&rsquo;t actually sufficiently in tune with the requirements of their customers.

The point being made then that short-term funding became a huge need for your organisation.

That is what we had done in all of our previous manifestations for over 100 years.  That was our primary business.  We did not get involved ... you know, no matter how sexy or how exciting the spectre of development lending, you know, lending for raw land, anything like that, we did not do that.  We stuck to what we knew and we stuck to what we knew and we stuck to it in a way in which we felt that ... you know, the average loan-to-value ratio of our entire mortgage portfolio was 71%, so that meant there was 29% of equity in the portfolio.  That&rsquo;s a very substantial amount of equity to start with.</p></speech>

For example, in the buy-to-lets, in reducing ... or in one situation where, if a proposal for a buy-to-let essentially is not self-financing on a stand-alone basis, the applicant&rsquo;s net disposable income is assessed to establish if the deal is affordable and you reduced the income for a single person to &euro;40,000 and then other ... some other changes that you made at that time.  I mean, wasn&rsquo;t ... I agree with you, you didn&rsquo;t go into the wild speculation that we have heard about in other areas of ... that left us with ghost estates, etc., but within the area that you were working in, did you not, kind of, emulate what was happening elsewhere in a different way?</p></speech>

And in terms of the growth in the portfolio, as I said, you know, we traditionally had provided 25% of mortgages to Irish people, and through this period our market share was somewhere between 20% and 25%.  So we ended up doing no more than we had done over the previous 100 and odd years.</p></speech>

As an aspect of that, Mr. Went, can I ask you, in relation to the price of a home ... because you were experts in this field and evidence to this inquiry show that between 1996 and 2006 the price of an ordinary home increased each year for ten years by the equivalent of the average industrial wage.</p><p>And that's an astonishing, I think you will agree, perhaps, statistic.</p></speech>

And when you combined, you know, when you looked at historical affordability criteria of borrowers, you know, over this period by and large despite ... despite house price increases affordability actually improved because tax rates went down, interest rates, you know, in the ... in 1987, a house mortgage cost 15% for a period of time.  By the time you got to 1997 or 2005, you were talking about 5%, so the interest rate had gone down.  So the overall level of affordability of monthly repayments was actually at a very high level.</p></speech>

The average life of a mortgage in Ireland is about ... certainly for the previous 40 years, is about six or seven years.  So, therefore, the actual ... the initial ... no, no ... the initial term of a mortgage is, sort of, irrelevant because people change houses.  They move lenders, whatever.  So roughly ... so the average life of a mortgage, and you can actually see that throughout the papers here, is about six or seven years.  So the initial term of the mortgage is actually, sort of, irrelevant.  It doesn't really matter that much because most people move houses.  They get ... they decide they'd get a better rate from a lender or whatever, so, you know, 40-year mortgage ... it's very emotive I admit that, but it actually isn't that relevant in practice.</p></speech>

I just ... it just, kind of, following the discussion there that you were having with Deputy Higgins, and it was, kind of, in my mind anyway, I just want to bring up two slides on the screen.  I don't know if you've seen them before.  It's not ... I'm not going to be asking you questions, it's just, kind of, to give a bit of context as to what was being discussed.  What we have here on the first screen is two tables, one showing the ratio of average new house price to the average industrial wage and it traces a period from 1996 to 2006, and what we see there is a very, very upward trajectory over the ten-year period.  In the next slide below we see a ratio of average-----</p></speech>

If I can just move on to the other slide, and what we have there is the residential house price annual, and we see it moving from 1992, the blue line being new house prices and the red line being second-hand house prices, both growing quite exponentially as well over that period.  And in the slide below, we have the residential house price quarterly, and, once again, the blue line is new house prices and the red line is second-hand house prices and we see significant increases there of quarter-on-quarter, with the whole thing peaking in and around 2007, 2008, the latter part-----</p></speech>

Now, in your earlier discussion then, and we're, kind of, because we're moving to conclusion, that I would be looking, say, from witnesses as well maybe to give insights that allow us to, kind of, move towards findings and conclusions ....listening to you to this afternoon there seems to be three things, kind of, on the table with regard to the mortgage environment.  There's market share, there's competition and there's volume.  So market share is not necessarily a fixed thing.  If there is an increasing house buying market and you've 25% of the market that's more houses that are being sold and bought, and, likewise, shrinking, so just to say that you've maintained market share over a period of time doesn't reflect the volume that was actually going on.</p></speech>

So, could I put it to you, Mr. Went, that, as a proposition and to get your thoughts on it, that during the 2000s right up to the property crash, as indicated on the slides that I showed, house prices were escalating at an unprecedented level year-on-year?  Average industrial wage, as Deputy Higgins would also ... that the average house price was increasing by the average industrial wage year on year.  And, in these circumstances, regular and even above regular income earners should have been priced out of the market earlier in the decade because the house prices were going up.</p></speech>

You know, we're a nation that wants to own their own home, and as, whether it is a first-time buyer or a second-time buyer, as they reach, if you like, the peak of what they can get as a mortgage under existing terms, that's clearly a pinch point.</p></speech>

One would have been incomes rising.  The other would have been interest rates lowering.  The other would have been taxes being reduced.  There would have been an extension of mortgage terms, you know, at the outset, because obviously if you ... despite the fact that your ... the average mortgage lasts for six or seven years, you know, if you price ... if you calculate something on the basis of 40 year repayments rather than 25 year repayments, that's a much lower amount of a monthly payment.  So there's a whole series of things that can happen to make, you know, to give the ability to borrow more to a particular borrower.</p></speech>

An experience I had knocking on a door one day in Cork was to meet a couple.  One was a public servant who was on a mid-income level and the other one was working in the pharmaceutical industry in Cork.  Back in the day, one of them would have been able to afford a house on their own, and it was like an episode of Dan Paddy Andy.  The bank manager told them that they needed to get married so they could get a mortgage.  So it's like going to a matchmaker instead of going to your bank.  Even with the combined incomes, they could no longer afford an entry price house and they were earning too much to qualify for affordable housing.</p></speech>

Now, just the basic premise of product sales and capitalism or whatever: to buy a product, somebody ... for instance, like a car ... if I go out and buy a new car tomorrow, somebody needs to buy my second-hand car off me.  And that maintains the market because there's entry into the market.  By 2005 and 2006, because entry into the market is becoming harder for these couples who are above average earnings, was that not a sign that the market was eventually going to collapse?  Forget about land speculation.  If people can't afford to buy a home, the market will collapse anyway, just like the car market will collapse if I can't sell my car second hand.</p></speech>

If you are directed by the chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry, therefore the utmost caution must be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room and, to assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right, and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Gantly please.</p></speech>

So I worked in Irish Life and Permanent as treasurer from 2000 to early '09, effectively the period covered, obviously, by this inquiry.  And in that role I was responsible for all activities relating to treasury, counterparty credit exposures, market risk, funding and liquidity management.  The treasury function itself was physically located in the IFSC and my direct reporting line was to the group finance director.  I was a member of the senior management of the group at that time.  I was not a member of the board nor was I a member of the bank executive.  With regard to board-appointed committees, I was a member of the assets and liability committee; I was a member there since 1994.  I was also a member of the group risk committee, which was set up in 2007, and the group CEO had set up a new strategy team in early to mid-'07 and I was not a member of that group.</p> <p>  So given my role and the lines of inquiry that I've been asked to address, I'd just like to make a few brief comments regarding liquidity in the banking system and to make some specific comments in relation to Irish Life and Permanent's liquidity and, indeed, funding strategies.  So a fundamental function of the banking system is the provision of maturity transformation whereby banks fund longer-term assets with shorter-term liabilities.  This provides longer-term liabilities to households and corporates, which facilitates long-term capital investment with obvious economic benefit and social benefit, indeed.  The provision of maturity transformation creates liquidity risk for banks.  So the regulatory liquidity standards that banks are required to adhere to seeks to mitigate that risk and, in addition, Irish Life and Permanent's funding strategy sought to further mitigate that particular liquidity risk.  So Irish Life and Permanent's funding was broadly split into three thirds: long-term debt, customer accounts and short-term wholesale debt.  We also held and managed a liquidity portfolio, which provided a substantial buffer against any adverse movement in our short-term wholesale liabilities.  Irish Life and Permanent's balance sheet differed from the two main banks in that 85% of the assets comprised residential mortgages, which were highly liquid in normal market conditions.  Irish Life and Permanent was also a bank assurer which was created post the merger of Irish Life, the country's largest life assurer, and Irish Permanent in 1999.  The bank's credit rating and its ability to raise debt in capital markets benefitted from that particular group structure.  Despite extremely difficult market conditions in 2008, Irish Life and Permanent raised over &euro;3 billion of long-term debt through bilateral transactions.  Residential mortgages on top of that could also be used as collateral for drawings with the ECB.</p> <p>  So by 2008, Irish Life and Permanent had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 275%, which was significantly higher than that of the other Irish banks.  Irish Life and Permanent had, as I said, the backstop of being able to access ECB funding by using its less risky residential mortgages as collateral, a point which is acknowledged in the Nyberg report.</p><p>I would also say that, you know, a low loan-to-deposit ratio is not a panacea in itself.  The Turner report, which was commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK in October '08 and was published in March '09 ... and in that Lord Turner, the then chairperson of the FSA in the UK, was asked to review the causes of the crisis and to make recommendations on changes in regulation and supervisory approach to help create a more robust banking system.  The report provides a very clear and in-depth analysis of the root causes of the crisis and provides a very clear template for suggested changes to make to the banking system to make it more robust.  So, with regard to funding that particular report highlights the fact that Icelandic and Irish banks were active deposit takers in the UK market and these deposits, while they did reduce their loan-to-deposits ratios, as the crisis dragged on and deepened these deposits did not remain sticky and were ultimately not renewed, so-called "sticky deposits" obviously being less likely to be withdrawn in a crisis event.  </p><p> So Mervyn King, the then Governor of the Bank of England, made the point that the crisis revealed faultlines in global regulation and supervision, pointing out that global banking institutions are global in life but national in death, a point that we clearly saw.  So, Irish Life and Permanent's funding strategy was formulated with the intention of providing a sustainable, stable funding platform and this strategy was formulated against the conventional wisdom that a liquidity event would be very short-lived.  The banking system is susceptible to liquidity events.  I had first-hand experience of significant liquidity disruption in markets during the Russian debt crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.  Global markets also experienced a severe liquidity shock post the 11 September attacks and, in both those instances ,regulatory authorities acted very decisively to find a quick solution to the problems and that was actually achieved.  So the recent crisis, which was clearly systemic, its impact unprecedented, the duration of the disruption in markets was not anticipated and, inevitably I think, the regulatory liquidity requirements which were in place were not sufficient to withstand that particular shock.  So regulators, clearly, are revising capital and liquidity standards in order to strengthen the system and prevent a recurrence of recent events which, regretfully, have had such a devastating impact on Irish citizens.</p><p> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

The life company's business was quite independent so I suppose that is in the first case.  I guess the ... my main interaction then with the bank <i>per se</i>... I mean, obviously, I had a direct reporting line to the finance director which I've said, I would have had obviously a lot of access with the CEO and other members of the bank, I suppose, but by physically not being there you clearly were removed so that had some impact, I think, yes.</p></speech>

I suppose, the issue was a treasury problem, a global treasury problem, so I would say back in mid-'07, you know, there were actions happening in the markets, there were credit spreads were starting to widen, there were markets just starting not to function and things that I'd seen happen for 30 years - you know, normal functioning markets - just really started to implode in a way that I had never seen before.</p></speech>

I gave a presentation to the risk committee in November 2007 and there were senior members of the ... from the banking side there including the CEO, the group finance director and the ... it's part of the documents that you have and it's basically saying that we had ... I mean, our funding strategy in the short term was based about a geographic and product diversification and I show a list in that and I'm clearly saying that there is traditional avenues that we have used extensively, you know, forever, as it were, have suddenly started ... are drying up, essentially, so like the USC commercial paper market for instance, which is a very short-term borrowings, would be instigated by banks there - that was a &euro;2 trillion market that within three months, four months just absolutely dried up so this was just ... we had never seen anything like this before.</p> <p>  I think, in answer to your question, I think there was a sense with ... that something was going to come over the hill to kind of rescue this, whereas, in fact, as I said for sure people thought liquidity crises were normally short term - that would have been my absolute opinion - so I think people thought that something ... I don't know what was in mind but that something was going to happen that was going to actually sort this out.  And I suppose it dragged on ... "muddled on" would be as best I could describe it, and then you mention September '08 and, I suppose, the final kind of, in my opinion, cliff that really ... that the markets fell over then was the collapse of Lehman and that really was the straw that broke the camel's back, if I could, yes.</p></speech>

No, I was.  I had one meeting with the Department of Finance which, I think, was post the guarantee so I wouldn't have a relationship there.  I suppose, just within treasury itself, we would have had very direct contact with the regulators - both the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank - and that would be conducted on a, really, a weekly and daily basis so the ... our liquidity manager would have been in contact, regular daily contact with the Central Bank money desk and, in the first place, that would have been for the conduct of normal market transactions so this would be repurchase agreements which the ECB would do on a regular basis so in normal times that was a ... the normal repos that they undertook were conducted once a week for a two-week duration and then the LTROs, or long-term refinancing operations, would have been done every three months for a three-month term.  Now obviously, as the crisis, you know, dragged on they extended the term of those long-term operations to three months to six, to 18 and eventually out to two years.</p> <p>  Going back to your question, I mean I would have been absolutely aware that ... I knew people ... I would have had a very close working relationship with the finance director who was my immediate boss and I would have been absolutely aware of ... that there was regular contact with the regulator and, indeed, I would have been at some of those meetings myself.</p></speech>

Do you believe or do you think that the Financial Regulator, while you were giving information all the time and, as you say, you had a professional relationship and you were in touch, increasingly in touch, was the Financial Regulator's office slow to take control of the situation or did the Financial Regulator's office do a good job?</p></speech>

I was at a meeting I can recall in ... I guess it must have been somewhere around the summer to the autumn of 2008 with the CEO and the group finance director and there was certainly a sea change I think then that we were saying well, what was ... I was there to really say what was going on in the marketplace.  I presented a picture and I think the regulator absolutely knew that the markets were in bad shape.  So they were getting the information.  I suppose the ... ultimately, the only real reaction, if you like, that I physically saw would have been the announcement of the guarantee because I can't recall that there were any other changes that would have happened.  I mean at ECB level, it was being fed back and there was a longer-term repos were being provided so there was clearly an awareness that the system which normally ... the traditional, you know, method that banks would have used to fund was utterly drying up and that the lender ... ultimately, the lender of last resort was increasingly becoming the lender of first resort.</p></speech>

I couldn't really answer for how they saw it but I do think there was a little bit of ... I suppose it was incredibly unusual.  People have used the expression "one in a 100 year event".

So in the normal course of events, you know, pre ... let's call it up to mid-07, I mean securitisation from the 90s on had become more sophisticated, wider investor base and we could use securitisation to fund longer term.  And, typically, a securitisation would be funded for five years ... would be the duration and I know Mr. Went earlier referred to the weighted average life on mortgages being somewhere around six so we were actually, kind of, almost match-funding the assets.</p> <p>  So when the conventional sources of securitisation actually started to dry up, I was extremely nervous about what was going on in the marketplace.  What we started to do was we identified with the help of our colleagues in the wider bank to ... we identified the pools of mortgages.  If you want to do a securitisation, you'll say ... typically say &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion in that case in that instance.  They have to satisfy certain criteria.  You've got to have ... you've got to be able to ... because they're going to be put into a special investment vehicle and the cash flows have got to be very clear.  There's a lot of criteria that it must kind of adhere to.</p> <p>  So back in '07, faced with the markets as I saw them, I put in place a plan to create pools of ... to have pools available for essentially what would have been deemed to be internal securitisations.  So at the time then, the ECB in the normal course of events would, as I said earlier, would be engaged in repos in their normal market activity and would get more involved with, you know, as required I guess.  And at the time, residential mortgages counted as tier 1 collateral for drawings with the ECB so this was a very valuable asset for us to have.</p></speech>

I think one of the documents that you'll have seen in the documents that were submitted to you would have shown that the strategy in the bank ... there was a strategy presentation in 2005 and the drive was towards ... it was faced with ... I think at the time the market share was somewhere in the bank was about 17% and I know, as David Went referred to earlier, the bank always saw itself as having a kind of 20%-25% market share was its kind of target.  That's where it saw itself being and the response to that, you know, was to actually go for higher volume, lower margin and there was a migration then of existing customers to the tracker product, okay.  So I think with the benefit of hindsight, I think that was not maybe the most perfect strategy to adopt but, as I say, that's with the benefit of hindsight.</p></speech>

Well, in the first place, I would have engaged in discussions with the rating agencies, and I can't remember the exact timing.  I think it was Moody's first and then Standard and Poor's, if I remember, but I can remember being in London, you know, at a presentation to the rating agencies and having a discussions afterwards.  And, you know, I was asked what did I think and my view was that, you know, the presentation went as well as it could go, the case was very fairly presented but I thought that they would downgrade us.  So, I think, somewhere in there too, I think, there is a statement, maybe about how rating agencies actually behave.  So, you know, you could argue, you know, 12 months ago the Irish story was clearly becoming ... at the sovereign level was becoming clearly better but it takes the rating agencies ... they tend to be, I think, after the event.  And ... but ... I suppose, it's not as important if you're ... if the curve is rising, but if you're in a crisis, it clearly adds, and adds significantly, to the problem.  It has a disproportionate influence in a downgrade.</p></speech>

I mean, again, they would have been drawing that, obviously, from the information that was going through to the Financial Regulator and so on.  But was that something that you were aware of, that the three institutions were bracketed in the same breath - they would be talked about together - or did it matter at all by then?</p></speech>

I mean, clearly, if you're talking about business models, we're very different organisations.  I mean, my sense ... and, again, you know, markets ... a huge part of markets is, kind of, confidence and rumour, but, like, post-Lehman, the talk globally was, you know ... I suppose, I was thinking ... you say to people ... everybody would say to you, like, "There's a big liquidity problem out there but we're fine", and that doesn't actually ... that doesn't stack up.  So my sense at the time, and, I think, the regulator's actions on, I think, it was 20 September or post the meeting on 20 September when they increased the retail deposit from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 ... I mean, clearly., that was reflective of the fact that there was ... there were liquidity issues but my understanding would have been that those liquidity issues were there for all of the banks.</p> <p>  I can only speak, obviously, to Irish Life and Permanent's position.  We certainly experienced, you know, some run on ... "run" would be probably too strong.  I mean, we had corporate customers who would have been non-Irish who would have rolled over their funds so they might place one-week money with you or they might place overnight money, but they could do that for 365 days a year.  So that's, kind of, was the nature of the business.  So we did see in the two weeks, say, up to the guarantee, we saw some of that money not being renewed, particularly, I would say to you, the overseas element to it, but it wasn't huge.  But, I mean, obviously, the issue was ... and you're saying, "Well, if this continues."  And, as I said, post-Lehman, it was just the heat really just seemed to get turned up.  You felt something was just going to give, yes.</p></speech>

I can recall in the ... in some of the documentation, there is a reference at a board meeting to discussing basis risk between seven and 30 days' funding so basis risk was ... you know, therefore, was discussed.  The principal area where it would have come up would have been at ALCO meetings, which I was a member of.  And if ... when trackers were introduced, I suppose, if you went back to '99, obviously, and the creation of the euro in the financial markets, I mean, clearly, we had come from a situation where you had the Irish market with all its, kind of, vagaries and a lot more volatility.  If you went back to the '80s, you know, just currency problems and you'd get 16% and 17% interest rates.  So with the euro, it wasn't written in stone but, for sure, I was asked this question and it was something I tracked myself.  The ECB ... there was ... broadly, it appeared that they were running with a policy where they were running about a five basis points, in other words, 0.05%, between the ECB rate and the one-month rate, and I certainly would have been asked that question and would have reflected that, and, equally, would have pointed out that our funding was ... tended to be over 30 days so you straightaway had basis risk between the ECB rate and the one-month.  The tracker products were clearly priced off the ECB rate so there was risk there and it was ... and we pointed it out.</p></speech>

So, if you like, then the crisis impacted, well, ultimately on them all, but the first place that it is going to hit you is going to be in your short-term debt.</p></speech>

I think there was a reaction to some extent to competitive pressures.  It was also, I suppose, the ... a very stated objective of the group to be the No. 1 provider of retail financial services so I think there was an element of cross-sale seen in this, to be fair, as well.  I did say that in that ... in a normal conditions that you had this roughly five basis points basis risk and if ... so, if you're writing a track with 100 basis points you're saying, "Well, actually it's 95 but we can live with that."

We'll move on.  Can you comment on the reasons why Permanent TSB had an exposure to Icelandic banks of &euro;92.4 million and what was the total amount written off on these exposures, if you know?  And, that is referenced in the core booklets as well.  Vol. 1, page 79, there's a letter which I'm sure you've read from Peter Fitzpatrick to Mary Burke in October '08.  What's the background to that issue, that exposure?</p></speech>

The bulk of it was triple A rated.  It was sovereigns.  But, as part of that portfolio we did have an exposure to Icelandic banks, I suppose, which back in 2006-2007 had been rated triple A.  So that was ... I mean, the purchase of those was within the terms of the credit guidelines that we actually worked within treasury.  And, essentially the crisis ... Iceland decided to default and, to the best of my knowledge, the full &euro;92 million was written off.</p></speech>

In his statement to the committee Mr. Kevin Cardiff stated that ILP was set to run out of money by Thursday, 2 October 2008.  You covered some of this earlier on.

Well these, Senator ... the liquidity issue was certainly getting more critical.  My take was that our regulatory requirement was absolutely satisfied up until the guarantee.  I'm not ... I don't know the full details behind, you know, what document he's referring to.  Clearly, we would have had ... we would have been sending liquidity reports.  They would have gone to the regulator, would show your inflows and outflows and your net position and there are going to be days where you've got bigger exposures than not.  So, I'm ... I'd really need to see the document to comment there.</p></speech>

Again, as I said, we were part of the wider group.  The solvency ratio in the life company was 1.6% and I think that effectively meant there was a bit of ... a surplus of about &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million capital within the life company.

So, we would've had a long-term debt profile somewhere out the region of probably about ten years, typically, and we purposely set it up like that because one of ... obviously every year when you sit down with the funding you're looking at your new lending growth and you're looking at the refinancing of maturing debt.  So, we looked to stagger the refinancing risk to try and mitigate that.  But, as I said, as we moved into, sort of, late '08, you know, all of the markets were just ... were just ceasing so the problems were getting worse.  So I'm not saying that there wasn't potentially ... looking into it post-Lehman you're looking down saying "Well if this doesn't stick well it's going to cause problems", absolutely.</p></speech>

So you have, kind of, no specifics of any conversations whatsoever.  Like, you know, I'm looking ... I'll go back to the e-mail that we were referring to there.  Again, on page 11 - and we have this as documentary evidence - where it talks about, "One of our Canadian Holders said that she has been informed out of London that we [ILP] in Irish Life and Permanent are the next Northern Rock."  That's just a snippet that we got in an e-mail of kind of conversations that go on in relation to the perceptions of the bank and so on and so forth.  And this e-mail is actually very much about Bank of Ireland as well, even though it is coming from ... So, like, you weren't privy to any kind of conversations in relation to the perception of investors to the bank, whether they were looking at the Irish banks all as one or whether they thought maybe Irish Life and Permanent wasn't as ... in a worse state than other banks.</p></speech>

To answer the question, clearly we have got a weighted average margin on the assets and we have got a weighted average margin on the liabilities.  What I can say is that at the end of '08 our net interest margin was 105 basis points.  That was down from 117.  Obviously trackers are going to drag that down and the SVR is going to take that up.  That is as much as I could offer, Deputy.  I don't know within that.  I suspect, I mean if you were to do the economics of it and you looked at the ... just in absolute terms, if you looked at where wholesale funding costs had gone to-----</p></speech>

Absolutely.  Am I sorry that I didn't highlight even stronger in '07 as to what was going on in the markets?  I probably am.  But, frankly, I saw the issues arising.  I don't think ... I'm not sure that I've met anybody who saw the scale of them.</p></speech>
