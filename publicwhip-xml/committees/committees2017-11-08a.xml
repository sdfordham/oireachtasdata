    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#B01800"><p>I spoke on the amendment last night but I can speak more broadly on the section now.  Section 10 inserts a new section after section 128E to provide for the introduction of a new share-option based relief for employees of SME companies, namely the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  It is designed to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises in the recruitment and retention of key employees.  It provides for a more advantageous tax treatment of gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options acquired in SME companies.  Where the KEEP applies any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying share options granted during the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023 will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will however be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.</p> <p>  There are a number of conditions.  For example, the share option must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant; the share option must be held for a minimum period of one year before exercise, with limited exceptions; and the option must be exercised within ten years of grant to avail of this programme.  Monetary limits apply at both company and employee level.  The commencement of the programme is subject to EU State Aid approval, which I expect to issue shortly.  Recent developments with regard to the employment and investment incentive programme make it even more important that the KEEP programme is effective in meeting its policy objective.  With this in mind, the scope for further adjustments to this programme is being examined.  Last night I flagged that I may bring further amendments to this on Report Stage.</p><p>However, I should emphasise that any such adjustments would require State aid approval, and I need to strike a balance between what is desirable and what I can make happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00300"><p>We estimate that over the medium term it will cost approximately &euro;10 million.  We do not expect that cost to be realised next year.  We expect that the setup period for many companies will be, perhaps not prolonged, but into next year.  Beyond that, when the scheme is ongoing, the cost will be approximately &euro;10 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00400"><p>It will ramp up towards &euro;10 million a year.  Regarding the size of the companies, this programme applies to employees of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as defined by the European Commission.  Medium-sized companies, according to the European Commission, are relatively big in an Irish context.  They can have up to 250 employees.  Therefore, there could be a relatively big company employing, say, 249 staff, with a turnover of &euro;200,000 per employee.  That would be at the upper limit of employees who could qualify for KEEP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00500"><p>Yes.  The two main criteria in this regard are that the enterprise must employ fewer than 250 persons, as the Deputy has just said, and that it must have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million or an annual balance sheet in total not exceeding &euro;43 million.  In addition, we have laid down a number of trading activities which will be excluded from the KEEP incentive.  This relates to transactions that would be speculative, dealing in commodities, some professional services, dealing in development of land and a few other areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00600"><p>I will go into an individual case of how much an individual employee, who may be relatively highly paid to be benefiting from these share options, could benefit.  I have seen an example provided by Mazars which shows that someone getting &euro;10,000 in share options at &euro;1 per share, exercising that option when they are worth &euro;3 per share and selling them when they are worth &euro;4 would save &euro;3,150 in tax.  The maximum share option per year under the scheme is &euro;100,000, with a maximum of &euro;250,000 over the course of three years.  That means that the maximum an individual could benefit in tax on a yearly basis through this programme is &euro;30,150.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00700"><p>Yes, that certainly sounds feasible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00800"><p>In turn, that individual benefits to that amount but the State loses that amount in terms of-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C00900"><p>That is correct.  It is a tax expenditure, so there is a cost to us for doing it, but much of the engagement we have had with small and medium-sized companies that are active in particular sectors within our economy point to the fact that companies far larger than them have share option schemes that they are able to fund by their scale.  They have indicated to us that a scheme such as this would be very helpful in supporting the retention and development of staff within smaller companies, in particular within Irish indigenous companies.  This is why we think this scheme has value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01000"><p>Does the Minister accept that the impact of the scheme is likely to be regressive?  One could, in theory, be a low-paid employee and get share options, but it is not very likely.  Those who avail of share options are more likely to be middle to higher income earners and, therefore, the effect would be regressive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01100"><p>My experience, having dealt with this issue in recent months, is that the availability of share option schemes has changed within our economy.  It rarely includes, to be fair to the Deputy's point, people on low incomes - I acknowledge that - but one of the developments that has occurred is that it now includes more and more middle-income employees, depending on the kind of industry they are in.  I think we saw share option schemes in the past as being forms of compensation for senior executives, but it is now the case, particularly within companies that are active in the digital economy, that they are being used, for example, to incentivise engineers and software designers, people who would very much be seen as middle-income earners and who are operationally vital to companies.  Those companies then use these schemes to try to retain those employees for the long run.  We have a growing amount of feedback to the effect that it is difficult to do this if one is below a certain level.  Companies that are below a certain level in scale tend to be more likely than not indigenous.  Again, that is why we are doing this.  However, the Deputy is correct in what he has said, that is, that this scheme will more than likely apply to people on middle incomes and above.  The only exception I can think of is if someone were to join on perhaps some form of graduate recruitment scheme.  Such schemes could include programmes such as this.</p></speech>

A qualifying share option is defined in the section.  They are new, ordinary, fully paid up shares.  Preferential shares are excluded.  These shares constitute a share in the equity, a share in the ownership of the company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01300"><p>That is correct.  The Bill states "ordinary share".</p></speech>

For a non-quoted company, how is market value determined?</p></speech>

When we discuss the relevant section, I will get more information for the Deputy on this point, but I would have thought that in the vast majority of cases, this would be granted to companies that are quoted in some way because, of course, this is a share-based scheme, and in order to have a share the company needs to be quoted in some way.  I will get information for the Deputy on this matter as we go through the section.  I have been informed that it can also apply to companies that are on the junior market.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to its extension but I want to look at how he is making this judgment.  It is provided for in the Finance Bill that a scheme will be introduced with a deadline; the deadline approaches; lo and behold, the deadline is extended.  I cannot recall when a scheme in the Finance Bill that was supposed to end actually ended.  Deadlines are more or less always extended.</p><p>What was the rationale there?  What was the rationale originally for ending the scheme at a certain point and now continuing it?  As we approach December 2020 we all know that it will, more than likely, be extended again.</p></speech>

When I reviewed all of these allowances with my officials in advance of the Finance Bill, I received advice that this scheme was of help in delivering energy efficiency goals for Irish companies and the continuation of the scheme would support the delivery of that policy objective.  That is why I made the judgment and the decision.</p></speech>

By putting it down for the end of 2020, I recognise that the end date of the scheme is still quite a bit away.  The experience I have of such schemes is that at times, there can be changes in technology and in how the allowances are used.  It is helpful to have a point at which the scheme could end, to facilitate a review of it.  That is the thinking behind this.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked earlier about the cost of the scheme.  The annual rebate for this scheme in 2015 was &euro;1.1 million for 65 claimants.  That was the cost of the scheme at that point. </p></speech>

We have had a lot of conversation around the housing crisis and the emergency the State has gone through in recent years, despite the fact that the Government fails to admit that it is an emergency.  There is a huge number of vacant homes across the State in areas where there is high pressure for housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has, for quite a considerable period, called for a vacant home tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, is leading the charge on this, among many other issues.  It baffles me that we have not seen any progress on a vacant home tax during budget 2018.  I am not arguing that every vacant property be taxed as a vacant home but at a time of huge crisis in the State and in areas of high housing pressure, it is immoral that there are vacant homes while 3,000 children and 5,000 adults are living in emergency accommodation.  In the past few months, Irish citizens have died on our streets.  People who are homeless are being forced to survive in the elements.  We need incentives to get vacant homes back into operation.</p><p>The previous section, which we discussed, contains minor incentives such as allowing pre-letting expenditure to be written off against rental income.  This is welcome and we support that amendment but it does not go far enough.  We need to take out the big stick in respect of the properties lying vacant in inner city Dublin.  The State needs to send a message to investors that if they leave their properties vacant at a time when there is massive pressure on the housing market and on supply, the State will tax them.  This amendment proposes that within six months of the passing of the Act, a report would be prepared and laid before the D&aacute;il on the subject of the introduction of a vacant homes tax.  The amendment takes this form because the Opposition is not allowed to table an amendment to immediately introduce a vacant homes tax.  If we had that ability I would have tabled an amendment to that effect.  It is important the Minister and the Government move on this without delay as we have had enough announcements.  We need serious action and I cannot understand why we are not considering a vacant home tax at this point in time.</p></speech>

In response, a key objective, identified in the fifth pillar of the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is to ensure that existing housing stock is used to the optimum degree and it focuses on measures to use existing vacant stock to renew urban and rural areas and meet housing needs.  While building new homes is a key action, another effective way to meet our housing needs is to bring vacant and under-utilised properties back into full use.  Vacant properties are an important source of potential accommodation supply as they are typically already served by existing infrastructure.  Their reuse has the potential to reduce the number of additional new homes required and to renew both the urban and rural areas of which they form an intrinsic part.</p> <p>  As regards specific measures taken by Government to tackle vacancies, action 5.1 commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy, the publication of which is expected shortly.  Action 5.9 commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas of ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  A multidisciplinary working group, led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be working to bring greater clarity to the regulatory requirements that apply and to advise both industry and local authorities on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of under-utilised older vacant buildings in the context of the regulatory requirements.  At local authority level, it is considered that there is scope for some early actions and in August 2017, all local authorities were required to designate vacant home offices and to draw up vacant home action plans to identify the real scale of vacancy in their areas, to set an ambitious but realistic target for which vacant homes could ultimately be brought back into use, whether for private sale, rent or social housing purposes, and to engage with owners to this end.  The first of these action plans were submitted to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last week.</p> <p>  Other initiatives include the repair and leasing scheme; buy and renew scheme; and the Housing Agency acquisition fund.  Many other approaches have been considered by Government in tackling vacancy issues.  On the possibility of introducing a new vacant homes tax, a strong rationale would be needed.  It would also need to be demonstrated how exactly such a tax would achieve and deliver the desired outcome.  Proof would be needed as to how its public benefit would, for example, outweigh rights contained within the Constitution.  The fairness and proportionality of such a tax would need to be carefully considered, as would necessary exemptions, lead-in times, collection and many other issues.  Bearing in mind such complexities and the consequences of tax impositions, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government sought legal advice from the Attorney General and that advice is currently under consideration.  Consideration is also required as to the involvement and co-operation of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and the implementation costs.</p> <p>  As there are multiple aspects to a vacant homes tax, I therefore oppose this amendment, which commits to laying a report on the matter within six months.</p></speech>

This was supposed to have been done months ago.  The Finance Bill is going through and there is no mention of a vacant homes strategy.  The three initiatives the Government has set in train for vacant homes are all welcome but they are minor.  They target some 6,500 vacant homes over a period of six years, which is 3% of vacant houses in the State.  It is not an adequate response to the crisis we are facing.  I urge the Minister, his Department and the Government to wake up to the realities that are out there.  Other actions need to be taken to deal with this issue.  There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State and 35,293 in Dublin alone.  However, there are 3,000 children and 5,000 adults in emergency accommodation.  When will we take out the stick to incentivise people to put their homes back into use?</p> <p>  The Minister said we needed to look at the constitutional rights of property but there is no bar to us applying a tax on a category of homes, and I do not need to be the Attorney General to say this.  We have a tax on the majority of homes in the form of the property tax, and prior to that we defined a certain category of homes, which were non-principal private residences, and applied a tax to them for a number of years.  It is completely lawful to tax houses not occupied by the owner just as it was lawful to tax houses which nobody occupied.</p> <p>  There needs to be an incentive for individuals to put their vacant stock back into use and a number of schemes can assist them in this but as it is not happening fast enough, we need a vacant home tax.  It should apply to houses vacant for six months or more within local electoral areas, LEAs, in which there is a high level of housing need and a high level of vacancy.  It would have to include exemptions for holiday homes, homes in probate, fair deal homes and so forth but it is not beyond our ability to design a scheme.  The rate would need to increase year on year.  The site tax is a similar idea to get vacant sites into use.  We are critical of the site tax the Government introduced as it left it too long, the lead-in period was too long and the rates were too low but it does increase, thereby giving an incentive to people.  Getting sites into use would be very welcome but the turnaround time would be long.  Even if an owner sold a site to a developer today, there would be a two-year lead-in period before somebody turned the key in the door.</p> <p>  We accept that a cohort of the 35,000 vacant properties in Dublin will not be suitable to be brought back into public or private use but a large proportion are suitable.  We need to introduce measures now as this is an emergency.  The Minister said he would come up with a report but he has already failed to meet his own targets.  Considering these matters without any clear commitments is not good enough.  I stay in a hotel in Dublin while I am here and every day I come into work I pass people who stay in the same hotel.  Every day, they get their kids ready for school, put their uniforms on and take two or three buses to get to their primary or secondary school.  What we have done to people in this State is horrible.</p><p>We cannot fix that overnight but this finance committee can bring in measures that would provide some light and comfort for those families.  We were elected to have the power to introduce a vacant homes tax and to encourage the 183,000 owners of those homes to bring them back into use.  Why are we not doing it?  I cannot, for the life of me, understand that.  The Minister needs to give me a good reason for not introducing a vacant home tax now.  This is not day one of the crisis - it has been going on for years.  The Minister has not given me a reason for it.  All the amendment seeks is a report.  It states: "The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a vacant home tax."  It does not even commit the Minister to introducing a vacant home tax but it tries to force the Government to bring forward a report on the vacant tax for Members to have an informed discussion on the subject.</p><p> I would prefer the Minister of Finance to go further and say he will not tolerate 8,000 of our citizens being in emergency accommodation, or people dying on the steps of this building.  He needs to send a clear message to landlords who are hoarding empty properties that, if they do so any longer, we will tax them.  This tax should increase if they do not bring their properties into use within one year and there should be another increase after two years.  This is an emergency and it requires emergency measures but nothing of this type is coming from the Minister.  The Minister should send this message not just for the benefit of landlords, but for those who find themselves homeless in this State.</p></speech>

We had a report on a specific area of corporation tax which was carried out by the academic, Seamus Coffey, and I suggest something along those lines.  The data need to be collected and identified.  There is a particular problem with commercial premises across the country, where the ground floors have not reopened and the upper floors are empty.  There are complex issues with banks which are pursuing the owners of such premises but I am sure that, in many towns and cities, a significant percentage of upper floors can be utilised.  There is not much of chance of it, however, in the context of what we know of the complications with the banks.  I support the idea of a report but I do not see where the resources are to get a meaningful report that will set out the actions that could be taken to address some of the issues.</p> <p> In the RT&Eacute; programme earlier this week, it was very clear that, in two or three of the worst cases where there were large numbers of people, the ground floors and rears of the premises in question had been commercial premises.  Rackrenting landlords had cleared out the bottom floors and crammed in bunk beds, resulting in incredible abuse.  I ask the Minister to come back with proposals and additional staff, or to set up a commission overseen by somebody like Seamus Coffey.  The statistics from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment show that there are vacant, boarded-up premises in towns all over the country where people might want to rent them and it would be useful to do something along these lines.</p> <p>  I make door-to-door calls around my constituency in Dublin and I am not sure the figures reflect what is available in my constituency.  There are serious problems for many families as regards the HSE where a relative is in hospital but intends to come home again.  Often this is not realistic and these are sensitive situations but something can be done to address them, despite the complex legal, technical, personal and family issues.</p></speech>

There are delays in the probate process.  I am dealing with individual cases and currently they are taking months.  A report during the summer stated that it was taking 16 months for probate to come through, but the properties in question remain vacant in the meantime.  We need a breakdown of the 183,000 properties regarding those that are in the fair deal scheme and those that are in probate or caught up in legal disputes, of which there are many.  Receivers are in control and we need the data urgently.  Deputy Burton is right to identify the issue of upper floors.  Within a ten or 15-minute walk of this place one will find hundreds of properties on upper floors and over offices which are vacant and not being brought into use because of ridiculous planning rules.  These are under our noses in Dublin city centre and they need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I live in and represent a constituency which is afflicted by this and I represent families who are dealing with the trauma of not having a home.  I see it with my own eyes, and represent the people affected by the tragedy of not having a home or a stable roof over their heads from which they can send their children to school, in which they can cook dinner or help with the homework and where they can do all the other things families do who have their own homes.  I am well aware of the incredible distress families are facing in this regard.</p> <p>  Last week, I said that I take the figures for the number of children at risk from poverty in our country as seriously as the economic indicators on what is happening with bond yields or unemployment rates.  I am well aware of the challenges this poses to our economy and the unacceptable cost it imposes on society, families and on mums and dads and their children.  I am doing, and will continue to do, what I can do as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the issue and this is why, next year, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, led by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will receive an increase in resources.  It is in recognition of the fact that we have to address the issue that, in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, the Department to receive the largest increase in its share of capital funding is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  I have said that we should move away from the State acquiring homes in the private market to building them via our local authorities and through other means.  I also want this issue to be dealt with and it is not accurate to say no action is taking place.  It is also unfair and inaccurate to say nothing is being done in relation to vacant homes.</p><p>I have already told the committee that by the month just gone, all local authorities in the Dublin area had to come back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with a vacant homes action plan to deal with this issue in local authorities with the powers that are available to them.  As part of that, if there were additional measures we need to consider with regard to the issues and difficulties we have on all of this, that will also be done.  </p><p> I will return to the amendment the Deputy has tabled.  Let me talk about the statistics that are available to us and some of the challenges those statistics generate.  For example, if we look at where we were between census 2011 and 2016, the stock of residential properties across that five-year period increased from 1.994 million to just over 2 million, which is an increase of 0.4%.  The number of vacant properties fell in that period.  It is at 183,312 units at the moment.  The number of holiday homes went up and most of the reduction in vacant properties has been in urban areas where we saw a decrease of 35,000 units.  The information available to us at the moment, which is information from the CSO, indicates that there are lower vacancy rates in the larger urban areas.  If I look at who owns those vacant properties - this moves into the issue Deputy McGrath just raised - the information we have is hard to come by but it indicates that over one third of vacant properties are owned by citizens over 60 years of age.  Potentially, the largest owner of this stock is our elderly and there are all kinds of reasons that property might not be in use.  If we look at the change I have referred to, over 105,000 of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now occupied.  Of those, more than half are now rented out.  Close to 40% are owner-occupied.  In the urban areas that I referred to a moment ago, up to 70% of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now rented and over half of those are by families with children.  There has been a change in the number of vacant properties between then and now.  Action is being taken by Government to deal with this issue such as the action plans I referred to by county.  That information has been shared with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the past week.  </p><p> I will address the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy is not asking me to consider the introduction of a vacant home tax.  He is asking us to introduce a report within six months of the passing of the Bill on the introduction of such a tax.  We have many challenges in terms of understanding how many homes are vacant, why they are vacant, who owns them and for how long they have been vacant.  The challenge for me is that to give an indication that this tax will be brought in without answering all of those questions first will yield further issues and questions that would have me back before the committee pretty promptly.  I will not commit to that principle until I am clear about how I can handle those matters.</p><p> Deputy Burton made a fair point.  There is information, most of it from the CSO, trying to help us to understand this issue.  More work needs to be done on this by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with which I will help it.  I want to bring this work to a conclusion as soon as possible.  There are policy issues that need to be conclusively addressed to allow me to make a final assessment on whether there is a role for a vacant home tax.  Until those questions are finally answered, I cannot commit to that principle.  Where I will not yield any territory is on the commitment to ensuring the trauma of children and families in hotel rooms and those who are homeless is dealt with conclusively.  That is what I want to see happen and I will see it happen.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot commit to the principle of the introduction of this tax because there is work under way already on how the issue could be dealt with at local authority level.  There are too many matters I want to resolve before I can commit to that principle.  I want to resolve those matters.  I want to be in a position where I can come back to the Oireachtas or committee and answer conclusively the different questions being put to me regarding the information that is available. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#G00200"><p>The Minister pointed out to me and the committee that he is fully aware of the homelessness crisis.  I accept that, although ignorance would not be a defence anyway.  Being fully aware of it and then taking no action or not taking the appropriate action makes it even worse.  The Minister gave us figures about how many vacant homes came into use between 2011 and 2016.  During the Minister's time in Cabinet, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and now as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the homelessness and housing crisis has gone out of control.  More children and adults are in emergency accommodation and more people are homeless and dying on our streets under the Minister's watch.  The Minister and his Government, through the decisions of Cabinet, have tolerated the homelessness crisis.  This is not an act of natural disaster.  We do not have a homelessness crisis as a result of a tsunami, an earthquake or an act of God.  We have it because of Government policies which stopped the building of social housing or did not adequately funding social housing.</p> <p>  The Minister will talk about the package that was given in this year's budget.  Not one single social house above the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney's targets of this time last year will be built as a result of the money the Minister has provided.  The Minister tells us he understands and I am sure he does; I believe he is a compassionate person but compassion needs to go a bit further.  The Minister needs to act because there is a crisis.  The Minister says he does not need to be lectured about it.  We do not have the luxury of waiting for another year so the Government can get its act together and start to consider the introduction of a vacant property tax.  The arguments the Minister has put before the committee border on the ridiculous.  He talks about one third of the owners of the 183,000 vacant properties being over the age of 65.  He says that might explain why they are vacant homes.  Even if we disregarded all of those owned by over-65s, we would still have 120,000 vacant properties in the State.  I am not assuming that all of those can be brought into use.  What I am saying is that if a portion of those in Dublin could be brought into use, we would resolve the housing and homelessness crisis at a greater speed.</p> <p>  This is not the Minister's first day in office.  How long has he been in Cabinet?  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, he has been approving decisions by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the previous Minister for Finance that have not gotten to grips with this issue.  Not only have Government decisions not got to grips with the issue, but they have made it worse.  The Minister might not like to hear that because I am sure he has empathy for every person who finds themselves homeless but when he decides on budget day to put a particular amount into tax cuts as opposed to putting it into building new houses, the automatic result is that the family in room 401 is going to be in room 401 this time next month and for months after.  The Minister is unwilling to bring forward a report which looks at the introduction of a vacant home tax.  The Minister talks about considering it.  Although I would disagree, the report could say there is no merit in bringing forward a vacant home tax.  As a member of the Opposition, I am trying to challenge the Government years into a crisis of homelessness and housing.</p><p>I am trying to do so in the only way possible, namely, through the Finance Bill, because Opposition Members are not able to table amendments that would give rise to a cost on the Exchequer.  This is an attempt to force the Minister to take some action by providing certainty that within six months of the passing of the Bill, a report would be produced on the introduction of a vacant house tax.  Such a report would capture all of the issues Members have raised, whether it be the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to apply a vacant homes tax or the data to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred for probate and the different categories of individuals who own the 183,000 vacant homes.  What the Minister is telling us, however, is that it will be business as usual and that no action will be taken in the Finance Bill to introduce a vacant home tax on the 183,000 empty properties.  That is not good enough.</p><p> I make no apologies for telling the personal stories of homeless families, the children involved and what these families are experiencing in terms of their mental health.  I will continue to do so because I still believe the Minister simply does not get it.  We have to ask ourselves what this country has become and who we are as a nation and people.  Why do we tolerate having 8,000 homeless persons and hundreds of patients left on hospital trolleys every day?  Why do we tolerate tax avoidance on a massive scale by major corporations?  While that is the country it has become, it is not what citizens want.  They want the Government to take serious action to address the housing and homelessness crisis.  There are approximately 20 people homeless in County Donegal where the level of homelessness is nowhere near as bad as the crisis level in Dublin.  However, even people in my county who are not touched by homelessness want the problem in Dublin to be sorted.  They have empathy and sympathy and want the Government to act. </p><p> The measure we are seeking is not radical but a small matter of introducing a vacant home tax.  For God's sake, given that we introduced a second home tax in 2010, why can we not introduce a vacant home tax at a time when there is a housing and homelessness emergency?  The Government's refusal to do so makes no sense.</p></speech>

The urgency of a vacant unit or vacant home tax simply cannot be overstated.  Let me put a human face on this matter because often, when we debate financial matters, one only hears dry figures, statistics and so on.</p> <p>  I have a long litany of cases that people in dire circumstances bring to my office every single week.  This week, a young woman in her early 20s came to my office.  She has been homeless with her young child for two and half years.  Her child is now five and half years old.  They have been housed in eight different emergency accommodations, including the Clondalkin Sonas homeless accommodation where there was a fire.  As the Minister will know, one mother and three babies were killed due to the fire.  The young woman who came to my office had been in that hostel and she was very close friends with the woman who died.  She is completely traumatised, as is her son.  She is still in emergency accommodation.  Her son is now in his third school in two and half years.  They are utterly traumatised and they have no idea when they will be housed.  The signs are, given the state of the list operated by the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it could be years.  The woman broke down several times in my office.  She is completely unable to cope.  She blames herself, she thinks she is a terrible mother for putting her child in this situation and pleaded for a secure roof over their heads.  </p> <p>  Side by side with that, close to the emergency accommodation that she is in now, and I highlighted this case before but I suspect that it is the tip of the iceberg, I highlighted recently a block of apartments in Sandyford.  I refer to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally.  The apartments have been owned by NAMA since it was set up.  NAMA has sat on between 15 to 20 empty units since it took them over the loan of the developer.  Recently, NAMA sold the properties to a vulture fund that tried to evict the rest of the tenants.  All the while, between 15 and 20 apartments have been left empty while people like the young woman and her child I referred to and so many others go through a housing trauma.  Could there be anything more urgent than putting human beings, like that young mother and her child, into those empty apartments?  For ordinary people, it is as simple as that.  It is obscene that NAMA sat on those empty apartments.  It is worth saying that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approached NAMA and asked for the apartments but NAMA said no.  The apartments are still empty while there are people like the young woman I mentioned going through hell.</p> <p>  It seems to me that we should set aside the very interesting debates on whether there are 180,000 empty units, as the CSO suggests, or a percentage of that figure.  I do not know whether the percentage is 10%, 20% or 30%.  We have to find out the correct figure, as a matter of urgency.  There are no debates about probate or anything like that but there may be a debate about what conditionality should have been put on the off-loading of NAMA assets or whether NAMA assets should ever have been off-loaded in the teeth of a housing crisis like this one.  Either way it is simply unconscionable that there are perfectly habitable empty units that people like the young woman and her child that I mentioned could live in.  Instead, she is breaking down as a human being.  The damage that has been done to her child is impossible to fathom or calculate.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried to inject urgency into this question, which I echo.  I wish to add that it is just not good enough if the Government does not move, as a matter of absolute urgency, to ensure that not a single unit that could be inhabited by people who are at the sharp end of this appalling housing emergency.  I urge that any obstacles to getting people housed in these empty units are removed, as a matter of urgency.  Whatever measures that have to be taken and whatever taxes or penalties that have to be imposed in order to get those properties for the people who need them must be taken, and they must be taken now, because we have talked about this matter for years.</p> <p>  The amendment is a very modest effort.  It must operate within the constraints of the Finance Bill and what we are allowed to propose.  We cannot propose things that result in a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment seeks to compel the Government to do something about the obscenity of empty units sitting side by side with human misery and human tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister to take the amendment on board and do something about this matter.  </p></speech>

What my track record, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, looks like is an increase in the amount of resources available to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to deal with an issue that is unacceptable to me.  I want to see us, as a society, respond to the crises that have been identified by both speakers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.95" nospeaker="true" time="10:00:00" ><p>I want to make progress and comprehensively address the trauma of families with children being relocated in hotels.</p><p>Deputy Doherty spoke about the human face of homelessness and Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the human face of a case he had dealt with.  I have met families in similar circumstances and seen the anguish this has caused.  I have also heard the human stories but I am also aware of the prospects offered to people when new social accommodation is opened, for example, on the North Strand.  I am aware of the response of local communities to the opening of new sheltered housing units in Broombridge Lodge, Cabra.  I have experienced the response of people to the progress we are trying to make in O'Devanny Gardens, which includes social housing.</p><p>Alongside the human anguish to which Deputies referred and which I have also witnessed first-hand, I have seen the human consequences of housing solutions.  During my tenure as a member of Cabinet, we have delivered 80 housing solutions on each working day thus far in 2017 and we are aiming to increase this figure to 100.  I have provided funding to deliver our social housing targets, including the delivery by local authorities of more than 2,000 new homes, the acquisition of 1,250 homes, the delivery of 380 units through Part V acquisitions and the return to use of 1,400 vacant social homes.  This is being done as a result of the Government's commitment to address the housing issue and my commitment, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the best possible contribution to doing so.</p><p>In 2018, more than 3,800 social housing units will be built directly by the State and a further 4,100 social housing units will be delivered through vacant homes, acquisitions and long-term leasing arrangements.  This is part of the Government's response to the housing issue must be viewed in the context of our expectation that general housing completions will reach 24,000 next year versus 19,000 in 2017.</p><p>These measures are being delivered through Government and market action to increase housing supply and respond to many different challenges, including the crises to which a number of Deputies referred.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of some of the difficulties we are experiencing and the scale of the challenges we face.  He indicated he did not know the answers to some of these problems.  This is because we need to interrogate some of the figures further.  In some cases we do not have figures and we need to fix that.  The Deputy know this but his assessment is that we should proceed with the tax and make a principled commitment to introducing it, as is his right.  As Minister for Finance, however, I cannot make such a commitment until I know how much we will tax, what will be the scope of the tax and what derogations and exemptions we would need to introduce.  If we were to introduce such a tax without first addressing these issues, the Deputy would lambaste me and accuse of incompetence for not addressing them in advance.  That is how this would play out.  Introducing a tax without doing the necessary preliminary work would have consequences and I would face questions from the Deputies asking me to explain my failure to act competently, in the same way as I had to deal with issues in the previous D&aacute;il concerning the implementation of the local property tax.  Deputy Doherty raised issues with me at that time on the local property tax, which it is Sinn F&eacute;in policy to abolish.  Before making such a commitment in principle, I must first ensure certain policy matters are resolved.  A significant amount of work is being done in parallel at local authority level to convert vacant properties to use.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I have set out.  However, I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to rectify and address the different policy issues the Deputies have raised, for example, the issue of data collection which I genuinely need to address.  It is only when I have dealt with these matters that I will be in a position to evaluate whether this tax can be introduced.  As I stated, without doing such work, I will have to deal with the consequences of my failure to do address these issues before the tax was implemented.  Members of the Opposition would raise these consequences with me.  While I cannot accept the amendment, I will table an amendment on Report Stage outlining how the collection of data and policy matters will be crystallised.</p></speech>

I would have expected that the Minister would have seen sense over the summer period and would have ended the help-to-buy scheme.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Instead, despite the fact that the scheme is costing in the region of &euro;40 million per year, the Minister has extended its use.  It is a supply-side problem and this scheme does nothing to deal with the supply-side pressures.  Before I go into any further detail on this, I ask the Minister to outline why he believes it is appropriate to continue with the help-to-buy scheme given that there is no evidence to suggest that it is meeting the intended rationale proposed by the Minister on its introduction that it was an effort to help individuals to gather the deposits required to meet the Central Bank and that it would lead to increased supply.</p><p>This amendment calls for the Minister, within one month of the passing of this Act, to provide a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is my party's view that the help-to-scheme should not continue.  We have opposed it from day one.  It was a scheme that should never have been introduced.  It was done on the insistence of the Minister but with the support, through its policy of abstentionism, of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has literally put money into the pockets of developers and has led in no small way to the increase that we see, year-on-year, in house prices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#M00200"><p>The help-to-buy initiative has been in operation since January 2017.  The scheme is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new build or self-build properties.</p> <p>  Following its introduction in budget 2017, and as a result of debate on the issue on this Stage of the Finance Bill last year, Deputies will be aware that Indecon Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake an assessment of the scheme.  The terms of reference for this review included an examination of whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.</p> <p>  The review was published as part of the budget documentation on 10 October.  It found that, to date, the incentive has not had a measurable effect on house prices, while it is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.</p><p>The report found that the supply of new homes was increasing modestly.  While the help-to-buy initiative does not appear to have had a direct impact on these supply levels to date, the report also noted it may be too early for this to have become apparent.  On the basis of these findings, and considering that the incentive has only been in operation for less than a year, I decided to allow the measure to continue in its current form for the coming year, subject to it being closely monitored and with a view to taking stock again prior to budget 2019.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of the help-to-buy scheme.  Its reports include the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio, and property type.  It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county.</p><p> My Department reviews taxation measures on regularly as part of the budgetary process.  Given the extensive nature of the Indecon report into the scheme, as well as the detailed statistics on the scheme published by Revenue on a monthly basis and the analyses undertaken by my own officials, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#N00200"><p>First of all, the Minister did not prepare a report before introducing this scheme.  The Indecon report makes reference to that fact and says that it should not happen again.  No evaluation was carried out.  We had a big talk earlier about how homeless families could benefit, but the Minister said that he could not introduce a vacant property tax as he would need all the statistics and so on.  When it comes to putting money into developers' pockets however, the Minister just announces the measure and then carries out an evaluation a year later, an evaluation which basically says that it cannot tell whether the scheme has contributed to supply.  What it says is that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  That is the key issue.</p> <p>  What is happening out there while the Minister is messing about with this scheme and putting &euro;40 million of taxpayers money into developers' pockets?  Let us look at the figures.  There has been a 12.8% increase in property prices over the last 12 months.  Does the Minister know where we are going?  At this point, in November of this year, we have now exceeded the property prices of 2005.  Within two years, 24 months, at the current trajectory property prices in Dublin will exceed the peak of the boom.</p> <p>  Let me tell the Minister what the report said again.  It said that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  This is a con job.  People feel good when they get this money into their pockets but when the house they are trying to buy, in Dublin for example, at &euro;300,000 has gone up 12.8% in the last 12 months, any benefits are outstripped.  These people's mortgages will now have increased by &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000.  To draw down &euro;34,000 over a 30-year mortgage means one has to pay back &euro;65,000.  It is a complete and utter con job.</p> <p>  This is not leading to supply.  The other thing which the report says is that "[t]he HTB measure does not appear to have had any significant overall impact to date on the level of supply."  It has failed.  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us that this scheme was about supply.  He then told us that it was about helping people to get deposits together.  Lo and behold, a couple of weeks later the Central Bank changed the rules.  What does the report say?  It says that "[t]here is however likely to be some purchasers who did not need the incentive suggesting an element of deadweight and particular affordability issues remain for those on lower incomes."  The report tells us this.  It does not give the Minister comfort to continue with this scheme.  There is no evidence that this scheme is leading to supply.  </p> <p>  As the report says, there is legitimate concern that it is causing inflationary pressures on property prices.  We all know, because the statistics are there in black and white, that there is what is called deadweight in the scheme.  That is to say that the vast majority of people who are availing of the help-to-buy scheme are not those who require the scheme to meet the Central Bank's deposit requirements.  Why the hell is the Minister continuing with a &euro;40 million incentive?  This money goes directly into the pockets of developers.  At a time when there are constraints on supply, additional money provided into the system increases pressures.  Those pressures result in house prices increasing.  That is why we are seeing the type of increases in house prices we have seen in recent months.  </p> <p>  In the last year house prices in Dublin city have gone up by 13.9%.  They are approximately 103% or 104% above the 2005 baseline.  They are 24% off the peak prices.  The Minister should remember that we are on course to return to peak property prices within two years.  This is happening.  What can we do to stop it?  There are many things which we can do, but we can focus on this scheme for now.  As the report says, "there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices".  There is no reason in the world to continue this scheme.  The Minister can bluff and bluster all he wants but, as the report says, there is legitimate concern that the scheme is contributing to that 12.8% increase.  Once these increases happen, it will be very difficult to reduce them again, even when supply increases.  </p> <p>  The Minister is pricing many people in the Dublin market out of house ownership.  People of my generation and younger, people in their mid-20s, are telling me that they will never aspire to own a home.  It is simply beyond their reach.  These are people who are living and working in Dublin.  The opportunities which their parents had are no longer there.  They just cannot see a way forward because of current property prices.  We know where we are going.  House prices are increasing more rapidly now than ever before.  The help-to-buy scheme triggered some of that.  The Minister is continuing with a demand-side measure while there is a serious supply issue.  This does not make any sense on any level and there is nothing in the report which should tell the Minister that it does make sense at a time when house prices are increasing at the current rate and when there is inadequate supply.</p> <p>  I will point to one more issue, which I will come to again later as it relates to other things we must deal with in the Finance Bill.  In Dublin 50% of homes are being purchased by institutions, the Irish Real Estate Fund and so on.  They are outbidding first-time bidders.  These homes are not being bought by first-time bidders.  That is happening because in previous finance Bills the Minister incentivised those funds to snap up the very few houses which are available in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am strongly arguing that the help-to-buy scheme has no merit, that it should be immediately discontinued and, at the very least, it should be monitored in respect of its effectiveness and value for money.  I am putting the Minister on notice.  Just as the Minister is complicit in accepting and normalising homelessness because of his failure to act on a vacant house tax and to provide sufficient resources to build social housing, he is also facilitating the dramatic increase in house prices which will prevent a generation acquiring homes in areas of this city and elsewhere throughout the country.  </p> <p>  There is no point crying about this in a years' or in two years' time when we will all be asking how the hell we got back to peak property prices.  This is what will lead us there.  It will be because the Minister introduced a measure which was not thought out.  He commissioned a report which is inconclusive but which says that there are legitimate concerns that the scheme is a demand-side measure which is having no impact on supply and which also says there is deadweight in the scheme.  The Minister thinks that it is appropriate to continue giving &euro;40 million away on this measure.  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

The difference in the Government's approach to the idea of vacant sites and the help-to-buy scheme indicates that is not accurate.  Ideology has much to do with it.  The resources will be found for developers but will not be found for building homes directly, which is what is needed.</p><p> Where did the help-to-buy scheme come from?  Who was calling for it in advance of last year's budget?  It was the Construction Industry Federation, which had it in its manifesto.  It did not do so because it thought it would resolve the housing crisis but because it would benefit its members, namely, developers, who will end up with the bulk of this &euro;40 million of public funds every year.  There is no evidence to suggest this is having a positive impact in allowing people to access homes, but the Government proposes to continue to give developers &euro;40 million a year.</p><p> Last year, when the scheme was first presented, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued it would increase supply.  The only way it was ever going to increase supply was by increasing prices.  Accordingly, it has created a rat race for people trying to get on the housing ladder, a race they can simply never win.  They can have the illusion of having access to money but house prices are going up beyond them, still remaining out of access.  Then the money just gets transferred to the developers.  That is what has been happening over the course of the past year.  The sum of &euro;40 million is not a small amount of money, yet the Government proposes to continue without an evidential basis.  There was no evidential basis to start it in the first place, but the Construction Industry Federation called for it and the Government did it.  A report was commissioned but there is still no evidential basis for it and the Government intends to continue with it.  It is quite incredible and it gives lie to the fact there is not an ideology behind what the Government is engaged in.  There is precisely an ideology.  It is about incentivising the private sector to deliver homes by increasing prices.  The consequences of this are more problems for ordinary people and an overheating of the property market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#O00200"><p>I add my support to this amendment.  The Minister said in his initial contribution that the judgment on the help-to-buy scheme would be the extent to which it did or did not contribute to a rise in house prices.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, brought out a report today which stated house prices have gone up by 12.8% in the past year.  In Dublin, in the past three months, the average house price has gone up by &euro;17,000.  Clearly, any value that the Minister might even ascribe to this measure from the point of view of the home buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular rises in house prices.  The only beneficiaries of this scheme are developers and builders.</p> <p>  In the early phases of the debate about the housing crisis, the cry of developers as to why they could not deliver the supply everybody said we needed was because it was not profitable for them.  There was no doubt they wanted a dramatic rise in house prices and the Government obliged.  The Government is contributing enormous sums of money through this scheme as well as through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to subsidise those who are hoarding land, manipulating prices and lobbying the Government to boost their bottom line and ensure they can make a lot of money out of the housing crisis.  The Government is being dragged by the nose by these people.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity cost to this.  Every cent the Government gives to them is money that does not go into building public housing.  It is not just a debate about whether it is effective, although clearly in its own terms it is contributing to or failing to stop the spectacular rise in house prices.  The other side of the coin is it is money that could be going into public housing.  However, the Government continues, or in the case of HBFI and LIHAF, expand corporate welfare to the very people, the builders and developers, who landed us in this mess in the first place and who, even in the teeth of this extraordinary crisis, are still manipulating it to their own advantage.  It is extraordinary.</p> <p>  I heard an interesting contribution at the Right2Change conference last weekend from the head of the plasterers' union about the cost of housing.  Much of what we hear about the cost of building housing is actually the propaganda coming from the builders and developers.  He helpfully pointed out that when one breaks down the cost of building a house, it is between soft costs and hard costs.  The hard cost of building a house comes in under &euro;200,000.  To physically build a house one needs bricklayers, labourers, electricians, carpenters and the other associated trades.  The other costs are the profit-taking of the developers, the estate agents, the architects, the surveyors and so on.  As he simply pointed out, those costs would not exist if the local authorities were building houses because they already employ all of these people.  Half of the cost of building a house goes to people in the private sector, whereas if they were built by local authorities we would only have the hard costs with most of the soft costs covered by existing local authority architects, surveyors and so forth.  Accordingly, much of the profit-taking would not be necessary at all.</p> <p>  That is the opportunity cost of the Government's approach and its ideologically dogmatic approach of believing the market will solve it when clearly the market is the problem.  Worse, the market is manipulating the situation, and yet the Government continues to feed the monster.  It is inexplicable.</p></speech>

Given the limited time since the measure was introduced, a report inevitably can only represent a preliminary assessment and, in short, the assessment is inconclusive and it is too early to say.  The Government, to use the Taoiseach's words, is admonished for not doing an assessment in advance of introducing the scheme.</p> <p>  The scheme was announced in July 2016, the details were provided in the 2016 budget and it was enacted in last year's Finance Bill.  Indecon only had a short window of actual data on which to base its analysis.  What will the Minister do in a formal sense to ensure there is a proper assessment of the cost-benefit analysis of this scheme?  The measure of success for this scheme is whether it will boost supply.  Is it the Minister's view that the scheme is essential for viability to be achieved and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, for it to be profitable for builders to build houses in a commercial market, or is it already viable in the market, given the way prices have risen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#O00400"><p>I support this amendment.</p><p>It is important that we receive a detailed report on this matter.  I opposed the scheme when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, introduced it because it did what I forecast it would do.  There is no doubt that it generated interest in the housing market, particularly among younger people who wanted to buy houses before prices started to escalate and who had, perhaps, already accumulated significant savings.  In the Dublin West constituency, there are, as the Minister knows well, many houses being built.  The fact is, however, that the window through which someone in the process of buying could make a gain was less than six weeks because the builders just increased the prices dramatically when the scheme was confirmed.  Prices have been increasing ever since.</p><p> I appreciate that the Minister is now really caught in the cross-hairs in that it is almost impossible and extraordinarily difficult to withdraw a subsidy, particularly one relating to builders, once it is in place.  The Minister should take a deep breath, however, and determine the value of the scheme at this time.</p><p> A more fundamental question arises.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance is significant in this regard.  Does Fine Gael envisage that this country should be one in which it is legitimate to aspire to own one's own home?  There are those who spoke earlier who clearly believe that only local authorities should build houses.  That is a reasonable point of view but the local authorities do not want to build and several Ministers responsible for housing, including the current one, have been trying desperately to persuade them that this is the right thing to do.  For a variety of reasons, local authorities are not really engaged in building, other than in relatively small numbers and through housing associations.  Bearing in mind that we all know Dublin's inner city very well, the problem with the housing association model is that the scale of activity is too small to meet the demand.  The associations' activities are very good.  The associations can be excellent and extremely supportive, particularly of people whose personal experience or problems affect their ability to obtain a home.  If one comes through a period of homelessness, it takes time to recuperate.  It can be absolutely awful for many people.</p><p> I wish to focus on affordability, which is critical in the kind of democracy and society we have.  Let me use the example of a couple, perhaps in the Minister's Department, who have been working for ten to 12 years since graduating from college and who are now earning a reasonable amount of money and trying to save or, in the case of a select few, have access to the bank of mum and dad, thus allowing them to obtain some parental support.  The latter is particularly the case if one is from a middle-class family.  Parents may have valuable property, perhaps on the south side of Dublin.  How can the couple in my example afford to buy a house, particularly if they are married and have children, or want to have children, or if they are in a long-term relationship?  It is an existential question.  It may also be the case for the Minister, but I am constantly involved in conversations with people who spend entire weekends looking at new and second-hand houses in the hope they can beat the escalator that is operating at present.  The new home buyer's grant has driven this to an extent.  The Minister's predecessor wanted to send a signal to the market, and the market got its signal.  Prices were ramped up, but with no thought as to the wider social consequences.</p><p> Figures published recently show that the level of home ownership in Ireland is on a downward curve.  Traditionally, most people in secure employment over a long period, be they working for the council, the Government or a private company, could aspire to buying their own homes.  This trend is really under attack and the figures are sliding.  My question is a fundamental one for Fine Gael, notwithstanding all its rhetoric about ownership.  That figures are sliding is a dreadful comment on a Fine Gael-dominated and Fine Gael-led Government, and there is no sign that the slide has started to abate.</p><p> It is obvious, particularly in Dublin West, which is one of the largest development areas in the State and where approximately 1,000 houses are to be built at several different stages over the next three years, that land values are galloping once again.  This is where there is a problem with structure and in respect of which one must  consider actions one may be able to take and that certainly do not feature in the legislation.  There are a number of quoted property companies.  It is well worth their while, in terms of their stock market valuation, to sit on land because they are making money as they do so.  The young people we all know are locked out of being able to buy, not necessarily at a cheap price but at a favourable one that would allow them to start family life and have the security of having a home.  They will have very big mortgages but we know many families who, with two incomes, can actually manage in this regard.</p><p> Alongside this, there is an enormous need for social housing.  I feel very sorry for the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What capacity does he have to persuade the councils, on their own or together with housing associations, to scale up their activities in order to meet demand?  At any given time in Irish society, approximately 30% of people do not have the capacity to fund the purchase of houses, either because they are in precarious or occasional employment or as a result of the fact that they simply cannot buy a site at a reasonable price if they are in a rural area and have some capacity to self-build, perhaps with family support.</p><p> I have described the model that has been in place.  It was heavily ruptured by the crash and the collapse of the construction industry.  I am really interested in knowing what the Minister intends to do to restart the model.  There are many reports indicating that when NAMA offered apartments to local authorities, particularly South Dublin County Council and the others on the south side, they turned them down.  I include the councillors in this.  The apartments were turned down because, for some reason or another, a number of the areas in which they were located were not deemed to be appropriate for social or rented housing.</p><p> Irish history indicates that, for people on a good income, the rented housing model is not particularly sustainable.  It is a fantasy of the people writing the property pages that everybody should be happy to rent a house as they are in Germany and northern Italy.  If one rents a house in Germany or northern Italy, one can remain in it on an intergenerational basis.  Therefore, one is not turfed out if one's mother or father dies, and one can sustain the rent.  We really need to examine our models.  Could the Minister for Finance tell us a little about how the help-to-buy scheme has helped people other than those who were involved at the very beginning?</p><p>The initiatives the Government has taken are insufficient.  Many are very good, such as the allocation of funding, in which I was involved.  However, it is being spent far too slowly.  It is significant but I do not know what the Minister is going to do to speed up production.</p></speech>

The same types of calls were made prior to this budget and I said "No".  The members accusing me of having some kind of agenda to up the margin and profitability of developers at the expense of trying to help people buy a home are either not aware of or are choosing not to bring up the fact that when I was confronted with demands for the kind of policy choice that could realise that kind of agenda, I said I was not going to do it.  I did that because I will not bring in measures that artificially increase the profitability of some parts of our economy at the expense of genuine measures that can increase supply.  Colleagues who have centred their claims regarding what I am or am not doing on the anchor that I have some kind of agenda of trying to support parts of the construction sector at the expense of increasing supply should look at the decision I made in that instance when I said I would not do it.  The reason for that was because I had no guarantee or credible assurance that it was going to increase supply, nor had I any ability to withdraw the measure if it were to be put in place and to then deal with all the difficulties that would cause, as Deputy Burton touched on a moment ago.  I knew there was a risk that if I put such a measure in place there would be no certainty of an increase in supply and no way of telling what could happen at some point in the future at huge cost to the taxpayer.  Deputies Doherty and Murphy have made all kinds of assertions about my rationale behind this measure and what I am doing but they should go back to what I decided not to do in the face of the kind of claims and arguments that won at other points in our past when this type of issue was being dealt with.</p> <p>  I wish to address the report, what I am doing and the policy choice I have made, which is to maintain it.  I will deal with Deputy McGrath's question regarding how I will evaluate it in a moment.  The scheme is, as all members know, capped at or below just under &euro;500,000.  According to the figures published in the report I made available as part of the budget documentation, 53% of claims or draw down under the scheme are for properties priced at or below &euro;300,000.  A little more than 82% of claims are for properties valued at below &euro;375,000.  The draw down under the scheme is going towards properties we are trying to change the pricing of in order to make them more affordable for our citizens.  The figures I have shared with Deputies show that, for example, 36% of claims were for properties costing between &euro;226,000 and &euro;300,000.  That shows the scheme in its short history has been concentrated on the kind of pricing levels I want to influence and it could have the possibility to continue that in the future.</p> <p>  What is the central reason I have decided to maintain this scheme for another year?  I refer members to the words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said that he wanted to have a scheme in place to try to increase supply.  Given the nature of the market I am engaging with, all members know it would take longer than 12 months or, indeed, the eight to nine months the scheme has been in operation to know if a measure to increase the supply of a particular asset, in this case housing, with all the difficulties and requirements involved in the planning process, tendering and so on, is going to have a supply side effect.  It will take longer than that.  However, those are the price ranges against which claims have been made during the operation of the scheme.  As regards the assertion that the scheme has caused the kind of price inflation we are currently experiencing, 4,487 people, families or couples have accessed the scheme to date.  That is not enough for anybody to make the claim that the scheme is shifting the needle in terms of pricing levels.  What is more likely, as, in fairness, some members have acknowledged, is that the shortage in the supply of housing is affecting the pricing levels that I want to be moderated and move into line with people's ability to afford to buy a home.  Deputy Burton asked a question on that issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty made the point that I am complicit in trying to normalise issues he believes are unacceptable.  As I have said, I want to tackle and make progress in dealing with homelessness to a greater level than we are at the moment, and deal with social issues that are unacceptable.  I hope that one of these days when the Deputy is accusing me of normalising things that I also want to change, he might acknowledge the good things that are happening in the economy in terms of job growth, changes in living standards for some people and improved investment in public services and that I have played a role in those changes.  He is entitled to the view that there are issues with which I am not dealing correctly and I would never differ with his right to hold that opinion.  However, if he believes there are policy choices I am making that are contributing to difficulties, as he does, I hope he would at least have the ability to acknowledge that it is likely there are other policy choices I am making that are contributing to improvements in our economy and society.  There is a strong case for that but I acknowledge Deputy Doherty is not willing to concede that point.  He has accused me of being complicit with developers and in their back pocket.  I have pointed to a decision I refused to make as comprehensive evidence that I am not.  Just because I have a different view to the Deputy on a matter does not mean it is bluff and bluster.  I do not accuse him of that.  I have laid out my argument and the facts available to me to back up my case.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy made reference to a CIF report and the lobbying therein.  He might also acknowledge that I did not implement the main measure the CIF and others were looking for in the budget.  I have pointed to the effect of the scheme on particular price levels.  If this is a supply side measure it is going to take longer than six to nine months to evaluate whether it is having a supply side response.  That is the basis upon which I will evaluate the scheme in the run up to budget 2019.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett holds the view, and it is a legitimate and consistent one, that the State should be building nearly all the houses our citizens need.  His view is that the private sector is not capable of doing that at pricing levels he believes are affordable for the citizens we represent.  I take a different view.  I believe the State should play a significant role in respect of the supply and regulation of houses, which is why a policy shift to local authorities building homes as opposed to acquiring them is the right policy decision to make.</p><p>I also believe many of our citizens want to own the assets they are going to buy.  The private sector does have a role to play in regard to the supply of homes and the State and its institutions have a role to play in regulating that market and in ensuring it is not developed at the expense of the common good.  </p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath asked how I propose to deal with this issue in the run up to the next budget.  By the time I get to the next budget I will have more evidence to help me understand whether this scheme is leading to a supply side response.  This will be one of the key factors in regard to the retention of the scheme.  I refer the Deputies to table 71 of the Indecon report, which shows that 22% of the people surveyed in the context of this report, when asked whether this scheme was likely to incentivise more units over the next three years, responded No.  The remaining 78% responded Yes.  It is, therefore, reasonable for me to wait to see if a supply side response is forthcoming in advance of budget 2019.  </p><p> Deputy Burton asked for my views on housing ownership.  I want to have a housing market in which more of our citizens than is currently the case are able to afford to buy homes, where home ownership is a realisable objective for the majority of our citizens and where those who wish to rent, as is the case in other European markets, are able to rent in a more stable and diverse rental sector than is currently the case.  For those citizens who are not able to do either, the Government, through the local authorities, should be building homes.  We have increased the resources available to local authorities to enable them to do that.  The Deputy made an interesting point regarding whether local authorities are accessing that funding, which is a matter I am tracking.  My experience in the past has been that they have not not been doing so.  However, as indicated as recently as this week this year the local authorities will be drawing down the funding available to them in a way that we have not seen heretofore.  </p></speech>

He is wrong.  I have acknowledged them.  I have supported many of the measures brought forward by him in this Bill, some of which I referred to when I was addressing this issue, particularly the previous measure we discussed in terms of the write-off around returning vacant homes into stock.  It is unfair of the Minister to suggest that I have not acknowledged some of the positive measures he has introduced.  That said, as Minister for Finance and a member of the Cabinet he is responsible, collectively and personally, for the decisions he has taken that have created a homelessness and housing crisis and resulted in house prices escalating at a dramatic rate.  I am hearing nothing from the Minister in terms of plans to stop this worsening.</p> <p>  This time last year we heard from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that house prices had increased by 8% year-on-year.  Since then house prices year-on-year have increased by 12%, which is a 50% increase.  This equates to an increase of approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month in the value of the properties, which is putting the purchase of a home beyond the reach of many people.  Taking account of current trends property prices will reach peak point in the next two years.  This means that at that time house prices in Dublin will be the same as they were in February 2007.  How are we going to deal with that?  Even if house prices do not hit peak they will still be over-valued.  A four bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin costs &euro;440,000.  A 12% increase will put that house beyond the help-to-buy scheme because it will be close to or exceed the &euro;500,000 threshold.  This is where property prices are now.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the issue of the VAT reduction and I responded that it was a daft idea.  It was a daft idea.  I do not think the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is daft.  It knows exactly what it is doing.  Of course, it would have bagged the VAT reduction if it had been agreed.  What the CIF did in this regard was a lobbying ploy.  It raised the issue at a time when the Minister was reviewing the help-to-buy scheme.  When the CIF engaged with the Department of Finance last year the first item on its agenda was the help-to-buy scheme.  Because of public pressure and because every economist worth his or her salt is saying the help-to-buy scheme is not working and it is contributing to house price inflation there was speculation that it would be abolished or significantly changed.  The response of the CIF was to make an even bigger demand - a daft demand in my view - that it knew would never be realised and Fianna F&aacute;il rowed in behind it, as it has traditionally done in terms of the construction sector.  The CIF put a little political pressure on in relation to a demand it did not believe it would get to ensure the first item on its agenda, the help-to-buy scheme, was secure and lo and behold the Minister fell for it hook, line and sinker.  When it comes to negotiations one creates demands, all of which one does not expect to be met but help to secure one's main demand.  This is as old as day itself.  That is what happened.   Does the Minister genuinely believe we should be patting him on the back for not giving in to the CIF demand for a VAT rebate?  Does he not know he was played?  He mentioned he did not agree to it because he could not guarantee it would lead to an increase in supply.  He also cannot guarantee the help-to-buy scheme will lead to an increase in supply.  I am not the only one saying that: it is also stated in the report.  The Minister said that the withdrawal of the VAT scheme would cause problems.  The withdrawal of the help-to-buy scheme will also cause problems.  The Minister also said that he cannot measure the affect of increases in supply from the VAT rebate because of the lead-in period.  The same applies in respect of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is due to expire at the end of 2019.  </p> <p>  There is no reason this scheme continues.  The Minister stated that draw-down is in the region of &euro;300,000.  This scheme is available not only in Dublin but across the country.  House prices in the west are increasing at a higher rate than in they are in Dublin.  House prices in the north west are increasing at a lower rate but still above the 10% rate but those house prices are not at the &euro;400,000 mark.  Average house prices in many of those counties are &euro;180,000 or &euro;190,000.  The fact that houses eligible under the scheme are in the region of &euro;226,000 to &euro;300,000 means nothing unless the Minister can say that without the scheme house prices would have been cheaper.  He cannot say that.  It is not possible for him to do so.  The help-to-buy scheme does only one thing.  I am not saying that the Minister personally is putting money into the pockets of developers.  Rather than saying something behind the Minister's back I will say it to his face.  This scheme puts money into the pockets of developers.  We are supposed to scrutinise measures in terms of their effectiveness.  In terms of effectiveness and the help-to-buy scheme the State is transferring valuable resources that could be diverted elsewhere to persons who are purchasing houses but those properties, if in the capital city, are increasing at a rate of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month or &euro;30,000 per year, such that benefit of the scheme is lost to them and that money ends up in the property developer's back pocket.  The Minister's only argument for the continuation of this scheme is that he did not give in to the developers on the VAT reduction.  I thought that the Minister knew what was going on in that regard.  I probably believe that the Minister did know what the CIF was doing.  I encourage the Minister to talk to people becuase everybody knows what the game plan was in terms of the VAT reduction.</p><p>If the Minister for Finance thinks that they were the big guys standing up to the construction sector in this, I am sorry to inform him that he was played on it because the construction sector got exactly what it wanted.  The sector got the help-to-buy scheme continued for two years at a time when the Government was wobbling and, from the soundings coming out, it was possibly going to end the scheme or significantly restructure it.</p></speech>

It is recommended in the Indecon report that one be carried out after a period of time.  The consultants made the point that they were only able to make a very preliminary assessment.  The Minister has said that he will take into account the data and that he will be in a better position in advance of the next budget.  How will that happen and what will the Minister base it on?  Will the Minister commit to doing the detailed cost-benefit analysis that was requested?</p> <p>  Indecon made the point, and I agree with it strongly, that the key challenge for the housing market is to reduce the cost of housing, including house prices and the costs of construction.  I do not see any effort being made by the Government to tackle that issue to bring down the actual costs of delivering homes.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p> <p>  Goodbody forwarded an analysis by email just a few minutes ago.  The issue of the escalating prices is accelerating.  Goodbody makes the point that following the strong monthly growth seen in July and August, prices have risen at an annualised pace of 27% in the most recent three month period.  Goodbody is raising its outlook for growth in 2017, with an increase from a forecast of 12.5% up to 15% now looking a reasonable prospect.  It is actually getting worse and is accelerating.  I am not blaming the help-to-buy scheme for all of that, and nor is Goodbody in its assessment, but the key question is what the Government is doing to bring down the cost of delivering homes.  There is general agreement that supply is the main issue, but costs and prices are rising, and home ownership is going beyond the reach of more and more people as time goes on.  These are the key issues the Minister needs to focus on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#S00700"><p>Setting aside any questioning of the Minister's motives or agendas around builders, and I do not believe that he is in any way acting as a representative of those sectors, the measure is not working on its own terms.  That is the point.  Alternatively, the money could be put where it could contribute to resolving a disastrous situation.  This is the essence.  Any benefit to the buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular growth in property prices.  The beneficiary of those increases in prices are builders and developers.  There is absolutely no question that they are the beneficiaries and are making money out of this.</p> <p>  As prices go up, arguably an incentive such as this or assistance for the home buyer is also encouraging them to get into an unsustainable market.  Let us remember what happened the last time.  People are being encouraged to buy houses at unsustainable prices where mortgages are gargantuan and the burden they will carry will be disastrous if further done the line we have another crash.  From any point of view, it seems that this is not working.  Contrast this with where the funding could be diverted.  This situation is not just about this particular incentive.  The package of this scheme, involving the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, home building finance Ireland, HBFI, leasing, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, are all reliant on the private sector and the market to deliver.  I have just done a quick tot and of the &euro;1.83 billion in the budget, about &euro;1 billion is going to the market in various ways to try to get the market to solve the problem.  This is a disastrous strategy.</p> <p>  The Minister said that in putting an alternative, our proposal is that only the State should build public housing.  Deputy Burton implied that some of us are arguing for that, but that is not what we are arguing.  We do, however, argue that there needs to be seismic shift back in that direction.  The story of the past 25 or 30 years was that the proportion of housing built by the State has dropped to negligible levels.  If, as Deputy Burton has rightly said, some 30% of people cannot purchase housing at market prices through their own resources, what does this mean?  It means the State should provide 30% of the housing.  There is no plan for that in what the Minister is doing but it is what we should be aiming at.  This is what the State used to do back in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s.  The State built that proportion of the housing stock.  The vast majority of the moneys being allocated by the Minister to resolve the problem in one scheme or another are going to the market to try to encourage and incentivise it.  I accept that the Government in Rebuilding Ireland has somewhat and in a small way shifted, although mostly at the level of rhetoric, to saying that Ireland needs public housing.  Rebuilding Ireland is still relying overwhelmingly on the market and I do not believe it can deliver.  In so far as it may increase supply, it is going to do so at unaffordable prices.</p> <p>  We need a dramatic shift in where the State puts its resources.  Let the market look after the market.  People who want to purchase their own homes, and I accept that it is the majority, are not able to purchase now because the prices in the market have gone out of control.  They would also benefit.  I underline this point, particularly given the offensive rhetoric from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - not from the Minister for Finance in fairness - about "free housing".  The implication was that social housing is free.  Social housing is not free.  People pay rent according to their income.  The point is that a person can get a house and pay according to his or her ability.  The Taoiseach's comments about "free housing" suggest that those people who want council housing or who advocate for social housing are advocating free housing, as against people who pay for their housing.  That is absolutely offensive.  It indicates a certain mindset, which needs to shift.  I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe shares that mindset, but I believe that he shares the ideological blinkers that have been put on governments because of the shift towards neoliberal thinking that has dominated for the past 25 to 30 years.  I urge the Minister for Finance to take off those blinkers and recognise that the only way Ireland can provide affordable housing is to get back up to 30% of housing being built directly by the State.  This would also stabilise, or bring down, house prices in the private market.</p> <p>  If the Government wants to bring prices down for the ordinary home buyer, it should build more council houses.  That is how it could stabilise the market.  When we give more and more incentives to developers to solve the problem, they will just use them, manipulate them and profiteer from them.  They will land hoard and release supply only when it suits them and they can make money.  They will stop the supply when they think it does not suit and when they cannot make enough money.  This is our point.  The signs are on it when we consider the experience of the past ten years, or even what has happened in the past year or two.  This is what is happening.  The Minister should consider taking on board the points we are making.</p></speech>

The housing market is beginning to expand and a significant number of houses are being built, particularly in my constituency, but it is not enough.</p><p>They are nowhere near the numbers required.  That applies to councils which are building, organisations which are building houses for rent and the private sector.</p><p> Notwithstanding all of the money being pumped in which ought to be sufficient to address the crisis, there is a failure of market regulation.  I would be the first to acknowledge that regulating the building market is intensely difficult.  It means dealing with very diverse individuals and much of the market is still only recovering from the crash, particularly for smaller and medium-sized builders.  We are talking about the perfect storm.  The industry is not even bothering to train apprentices.  In three years we will be crying out to have people brought here from other countries to build the houses we will still need.  The actions taken are not near adequate.  In that context, the proposed amendment is extremely modest.  It would provide for ongoing reporting on effectiveness and value for money achieved and the manner in which they will be monitored.  The Minister for Finance has a key power when it comes to oversight and monitoring.  I draw his attention to one element of the market that is causing huge problems in Dublin.  Because of the extraordinary increase in the price of housing land, for those involved in the provision of finance capital through companies on the Stock Exchange, bank investment or other investment vehicles, it is highly profitable to sit on land and do nothing.  That is not acceptable.  We know that there are delays in providing road and bridge access and so on.  However, there are also people who are consciously sitting on land and because of this the pace of development is being slowed down.  The value of so many portfolios is being elevated by the surge in land values and house prices.  The Minister really does have to act.  I support the amendment-----</p></speech>

The Minister knows these sites as well as I do.  They include O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street.  What is to happen in the provision of affordable housing in O'Devaney Gardens?  The council may finally move to provide some social housing.  The site has now been idle for 12 years or more.  The position is the same in the case of the site on Dominick Street.  These are prime sites that it would be wonderful to have in any city.  It is really due to market failure if we cannot move on these sites.</p></speech>

Section 664 provides for the tax free receipt of rental income from certain long-term qualifying leases of farm land.  The previous anti-avoidance provisions were inserted to prevent the exploitation of the provision by persons entering into cross leases of land in order to both generate tax free income and an allowable deduction.  It has come to my attention that a drafting error was included in the Finance Act 2015, a measure which may render the anti-avoidance provision inoperable.  The purpose of this amendment is therefore to rectify this error.  The words &quot;lessor&quot; and &quot;Lessee&quot; in section 664(8)(a) and (b) were transposed.  This amendment swaps them back to where they should be.</p><p>An additional technical amendment is also included to update terminology used in section 664 to reflect the EU basic payment scheme, which has replaced the EU single payment scheme since the start of 2015.</p></speech>

It is an investor-based tax relief under which an investor can obtain tax relief for investing in certain early phase companies.  On advice from the Attorney General, I am proposing to make a number of amendments to the incentive.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that EII is compatible with the General Block Exemption Regulation, GBER.  Under GBER, countries cannot give aid to individuals to invest in a company of which they are already a shareholder.  The GBER requirement has applied since October 2015.</p><p>The amendments I am proposing provides that a person who has a shareholding in a company, or whose relative has a shareholding in a company, may, from 2 November 2017, no longer claim relief under EII for an investment in that company.  This restriction will not apply if an individual and his or her relatives make their investments in the company while it is still at very initial stages before it commences any of its activities.  I should also emphasise that this restriction will not apply where an individual is only connected with a company through a prior investment to which EII relief applied.  Some &euro;30 million in relief is provided to investors under the scheme each year.  The value of relief affected by this change was in the order of &euro;6 million to &euro;10 million per annum.  I commend this amendment.</p></speech>

This proposal will remove that five-year exemption.  This amendment provides that exemption will apply to the profits arising on land disposed of prior to 1 January 2019.  Distributions out of the profits of such deposit disposals after that will be subject to the normal Irish real estate fund, IREF, withholding tax rules.</p><p>Given the changes I am making elsewhere in the Finance Bill 2017 on capital gains tax and stamp duty, I felt it was important that these provisions were also amended for consistency.  In applying this provision from the start of 2019, I am ensuring that this change is introduced in a timely way while avoiding any undue disruption.  I commend the amendment to the committee.  I would also like to flag the possibility of a further amendment on the IREF provisions on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State now agree that the tax break for properties held for at least five years should not have been included in the Finance Bill 2016?  At the time it was objected to by ourselves, and possibly others, on the grounds that it encourages property hoarding as well as being a big tax break.  Is there an admission that that was a mistake - not a mistake accidentally made, not a drafting error, but a mistake of policy?</p></speech>

With the movements in capital gains tax and stamp duty, and the attempts to ensure that more land is made available for development for building, circumstances change.  Circumstances arise depending on what has happened in the previous 12 months.  We are not satisfied with the quantity of land that has been made available or the quantity of building that has happened in the last 12 months, and we feel this is a better system structure for the coming year.</p></speech>

I say that because it is important to get to the core of this.  This was the major argument in the Finance Bill last year.  The Minister of State should look over the transcripts.  We kept going back over this on Committee and Report Stages.  We argued with the Government at the time that the five-year exemption from dividend withholding tax was a loophole that it was deliberately putting into the Finance Bill.  I argued very strongly that people who bought properties not just last year, but four years from then, could have no dividend withholding tax from the capital gains tax, CGT, payable.  This was a major issue.</p> <p>  Following up on that through a freedom of information request, I found that officials were communicating the fact that this could lead to hoarding before this measure was introduced to the Finance Bill and signed off.  We were unaware that there were those concerns within the Department, but we were still making the argument that this would lead to an escape from huge amounts of tax and have an effect on the property market.</p> <p>  I put forward the idea in the first place for a dividend witholding tax and I have campaigned vigorously to end the five-year CGT exemption, which is an incentive that makes it more profitable for funds to hold onto vacant lands for a period of five years than to sell them off.  The reason it is more profitable is that the Government argued black and blue with me, and with others in this committee, that that was the right thing to do.</p> <p>  It is not about circumstances, CGT, stamp duty and all the rest.  The Government got this seriously wrong.  There was a bit of arrogance last year on this issue.  THe Government would not listen to members of the Opposition who were pointing out the problems there at that time.  I welcome the fact the five-year CGT exemption or the dividend witholding tax exemption is going to be gone.  However, there is a lesson here.  We can talk about new politics and all the rest.  It is not a case of saying that we were right and the Government was wrong; this has caused damage at this point.  There are properties that could have been sold in bloc format, the way properties were sold by NAMA to investors, that have not been sold.  This is because it was more beneficial for them to hold on and avail of the five-year CGT exemption.  Those properties are in this city.  This is something the Government was aware of during that time, but it continued to march on with this ill-conceived idea.</p> <p>  We are closing a loophole, but I am not sure who applied the pressure.  I am sure certain people lobbied.  I would like the Minister of State to put on record whether there was any lobbying of the Department of Finance on introducing the five-year CGT exemption on dividend withholding tax, or the dividend witholding tax exemption.  If there was lobbying at the time, can the Minister of State inform this committee who was lobbying the Department or the Minister?</p></speech>

It would be very sudden to remove the measure just one year after its implementation.

It is being removed this year and rather than have a very disruptive alteration as quickly as that, we think it is right to give an opportunity to others to assess the impact the provision will have on their investment. </p></speech>

This is why the provision is incentivising people to hoard instead of sell.  If an owner holds the property for four years then it is better to hold on to it for another 12 months in order to be exempt from the dividend withholding tax when one disposes of the property.  If one bought the property in 2014 then one will no longer be able to avail of the exemption because the new provision kicks in on 1 January 2019 and, therefore, the five years would not have elapsed.

By the end of December 2018, however, five years will have elapsed so one will get the exemption.  That means the provision incentivises the investor to sit on the vacant land, to do nothing with it even though we are in the middle of a housing crisis and hold it for another year because it is of major financial benefit to the owner and its shareholders, due to a 20% exemption on the dividend withholding tax on the gains that are realised on the property.  Let us remember this is property that was bought by investors in 2013.  Can the Minister of State tell me the uplift in property prices from 2013 to 2017?  There has been a dramatic increase in prices.  This is why there is now a huge incentive for these companies to stash land.</p> <p>  The provision, in terms of ending the CGT dividend withholding tax exemption, is the right thing to do and we argued for it last year.  By not allowing it to kick in for another year the Government is incentivising a cohort of investors who invested during the period 2013 to 2014 to continue to hoard residential properties and apartment blocks and units that were bought by NAMA.  I refer to the conversation that was in the reply to the freedom of information request.  </p></speech>

The properties are not being sold off because the companies will benefit from the CGT exemption after five years.

The individuals will not develop or sell on the land because to hold on to it, at this point in time, is more financially beneficial to them.</p></speech>

He has discussed sections in isolation.  He mentioned a piece of land owned by a company or an investment stream and assumed that there is a gain on the purchase of a single parcel of land.  The provision will work, and we anticipate it will work, as follows.  If a company or an investor has a gain and reinvests it then there will not be a gain on that occasion.  What the Deputy has said is correct, potentially, if one takes a single parcel of land and it is operated in isolation of the entire business that is a company or an investment stream.  What he has said, in isolation, can be correct.  The point is property investment companies or individuals tend not to operate purely in isolation.  If they do move something, and benefit by not paying the 20% withholding tax and they have a capital gain, but they subsequently reinvest that then it is still not liable anyway.</p></speech>

The Government would not be closing down this loophole if that was the case.  The Government is closing down the loophole because it knows fine well that it engineered a loophole into the Finance Bill last year that incentivised people to hoard land and property.  I welcome the fact that the loophole is being closed but I am disappointed that it will continue for a year.</p> <p>  The Minister of State talked about certainty for investors and all of the rest.  What about certainty for the people who need homes?  The Government must get its priorities right.</p></speech>

There is no ifs, buts or maybes about that.  The Government can vote for that and Fianna F&aacute;il can abstain if it wants but the Government needs to understand the consequences of the provision.  Multi-million investors will escape a massive tax bill because the exemption will be extended by another year.</p></speech>

A total of 85% is foreign investment.  They are structured in such a way as to benefit foreign investors - that is the point.  These are foreign investors.  This is why it is so important for the dividend withholding tax to be paid.  The rate is set at 20%.  We will come to this point later, but they do not actually pay 20% because of double tax treaties and other issues that we can discuss later.  The Government is facilitating for another year the vast gains paid out to the foreign investors and no tax will be paid.</p> <p>  These are the big boys who came in at the bottom of the market in 2013.  That is the year the legislation is specifically targeting.  It was when the market was almost at the bottom of the trough.  They snapped up properties for next to nothing.  The properties increased in value dramatically over the following five years.  Yet, the Minister of State is trying to convince us to support a measure that would allow them to continue not paying on the vast gains they will make.  As bad as that is and as much as it stinks, the policy is also about incentivising them.  If they were thinking about selling up now or developing, the policy is an incentive to hold on for another 12 months and then they can leave the State tax-free with their gains.  That is what the Minister of State is trying to convince us about.  It does not stack up.</p></speech>

I remind him that we needed foreign equity to come in to try to move the property market.  The Deputy should not ignore where we were back then.  He is simply taking the negative and suggesting that everything was perfect.  We needed foreign funds to come in to the Irish residential property sector and the commercial real estate sector.  Many of those companies have come in.  They are building all over this city and throughout the remainder of the country.  Deputy Pearse Doherty should not ignore that.</p></speech>

We have decided that, as a result of providing tax certainty, the measures will kick in 14 months from now.  We believe it is important for a jurisdiction to have tax certainty.  This means we should not change an aspect of the policy in one budget and then alter it subsequently.  We do not believe that is good tax business.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  The Irish property market has been chaotic.  We believe this is the right thing to do now.  We believe that January 2019 is the right period for this to kick in.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State at the Department of Finance explain why it would decide to dispose of that land now, when the Government is indicating, through the Finance Bill, that if it holds on to the land for another 12 months, it will not pay the 20% dividend withholding tax on the gains relating to it?  Does the Minister of State not understand that if I represented the fund and he were speaking to me, the policy is encouraging me, if I have the interests of my shareholders at heart, to hold on to this land for a further 12 months?  We hear all the words from Ministers and the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il when they are doing soundings and so on about the property crisis.  However, this is what it boils down to: the Government is engineering into the Finance Bill an incentive to hoard land.</p> <p>  The Government cannot have it both ways.  I want the Minister of State to acknowledge that he is doing this with his eyes wide open.  If the Government wants to push ahead with it, that is fair enough &ndash; I cannot stop him.  We are not strong enough or well represented enough in this committee to do so.  However, it is my responsibility to at least ensure that the Minister for Finance and the members of the committee who vote for, against or abstain in respect of this measure understand the exact consequences of it.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has rightly taken us back to when the market was bottomed out in 2013.  However, the strategy that the Government adopted at that point has turned out to be a disastrous folly.  The theory was that by giving vast tax breaks to these investors, we would do something positive for the market.  What we actually did was hand over vast wealth to these vulture funds.</p> <p>  It was obviously a concerted strategy.  In fact, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was straight-up about it.  We now know he was busy meeting representatives from all these funds and actively encouraging them to come in.  No doubt, he was telling them they would get favourable tax treatment and that they would walk away paying no tax on the capital gains, which, we now know, are absolutely astronomical.  Even then, it would not have taken a rocket scientist to know that when the market was bottomed out these people were going to gain in a major way.  There was only one way the market was going to go at that stage, namely, up.</p></speech>

Some of us at the time were saying that NAMA should have behaved differently.  This might indeed explain the mystery of a case I brought up with the Minister for Finance earlier.  It related to apartments in Sandyford.  In that case, NAMA was sitting on empty properties and then sold them to a vulture fund.  The vulture fund then sat on the empty properties while there were homeless people all around.  It is a mystery.  Why was this happening?  Perhaps it was for precisely this reason: the decision was to simply sit on the property and let the value go up.  Then, the owners would walk away with a vast capital gain and pay no tax on it.</p> <p>  The Government is not moving immediately to close that down and is allowing it to play out.  I suspect that is because the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, said it was guaranteed and that the Government would not do anything.  It is a little like what I suspect also happened with Apple &ndash; we will move on to that discussion later.  In those critical years of 2013 and 2014, a great deal of running around was done by the then Minister.  He was talking to big corporations and property investors and telling them that the Government would look after them on the tax front.  These funds moved in and the consequences have been disastrous.</p> <p>  The Government has somewhat belatedly acknowledged this by making some moves to close down the loophole.  However, it seems to be extending it for one year because of some sort of principle of honour or because we have to honour the deal with these vulture funds.  The Government should forget it.  We should close it down now, recognise that we made a big mistake and recover whatever ground and revenues we can.  We should close down the incentive for these people to continue immorally and obscenely hoarding land and property when thousands of our citizens need places to live.</p></speech>

It is not true to say this was not the subject of hotly-disputed debate at the time.

That is my interpretation of what members are saying to the Minister of State.  It may be better to withdraw the amendment for the moment and come back to it.  If the Minister of State is referencing about vulture funds and we have had much discussion of how they purchase property and in view of their being managed by organisations such as Capita and so on and the type of disruption they are causing in people's lives, be that business or residential, I want to know far more about the amendment.</p></speech>

Many members have a different experience.  We should remember that many of the vulture funds in question have no plans to reinvest here and are in it for the short term.  A well-known maxim is that when there is blood spilled on the floor, it is time to go in.  That is what happened here.  The quantum of money we would lose in tax is a scandal, as is the fact this is holding up potential housing development at a time of emergency in that area.  However, that should be considered in light of what the funds have been achieving over that period of time.  Funds that invested in the period around 2013 will now benefit from the CGT exemption.  In 2014, commercial property returns in the State were the highest in the world.  There was a return of 40.1% on commercial property in 2014 because in 2012 the economy started to pick up and in 2013, it was already back on a growth trajectory.  That is why I say it was close to the bottom of the trough.  The Minister of State has said we needed the funds and all the rest and nobody knew what way it was going to go.  He should read any academic analysis of the situation such as that of Morgan Kelly or the NAMA report that led to its establishment and which foresaw property prices getting back to a sustainable level within ten years.  That was all well signalled and the funds knew that.</p> <p>  We can argue about whether we needed them.  I am not sure what benefit they supplied.  They snapped up properties from NAMA at rock bottom prices and made massive profits running to billions of euro on them.  They paid no taxes on those profits and the Government is now going to facilitate them further in paying no tax on profits.  Can the Minister of State tell me or anybody listening to these proceedings why the State needed them?  What benefit did they give the State?  The only benefit is their shareholders became extremely rich.  The companies that serviced the funds' legal structures got quite wealthy.  However, the funds did not service the interests of the State.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain how Irish citizens benefitted from vulture funds coming in and buying from the State, through NAMA, at rock bottom prices, flipping those properties within a short period of time for, in some cases, double, triple or quadruple the price for which they bought them and in other cases holding the assets in order that they can leave Ireland without paying tax.  How did the State benefit from that?</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State could give us a detailed note on this issue.  To be honest, this information is extremely complex.  I heard him say that this is an amalgam of different types of funds.  The fact is that we do not have the analysis we need.  I would say we need a very detailed note on this matter.  Some of the explanations are making it more rather than less complicated.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the budget, he said he would bring forward amendments on Committee Stage relating to the five-year capital gains tax exemptions for the IREFs.  We have not heard an explanation of why that should be renewed.  For how long will it be renewed?  What is the context for its renewal?  What kinds of investments are we talking about?  I need to have some of that information.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said on budget day that he was going to introduce this measure, he flagged that we would be given explanations and details.  I think we need them now.</p></speech>

He indicated in his opening remarks on this amendment that the potential exists for other amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  I would like to know the thinking on those amendments because it is relevant to what we are discussing now.  Have the windows for first returns in respect of IREFs passed at this stage?  I think the relevant dates were in January and July.  IREFs have had a legal basis since January 2017.  Were there returns in July?  Do we have data on the withholding tax and so on?  If concerns regarding the hoarding of land have led to this policy change, can the Minister of State explain what purpose will be served by providing for a delay of a further year?</p></speech>

Before lunch I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the fact that increases in land values are giving people involved in funds a perverse incentive to sit on lands while such increases continue.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this problem, which is being discussed widely.  Regardless of whether we are ultimately talking about fund valuations or something like a limited company - I appreciate that different structures are involved - there continues to be a perverse incentive to make gains and see valuations rise by sitting on lands.  I have significant concerns about the current tendency of various entities to sit on land at a time of remarkable speculation in land prompted by substantial increases in property values.  At a time of severe housing shortages - I refer not only to affordable and social housing but also to houses for purchase - this country cannot afford to have people hoarding and sitting on land for the purpose of accumulating valuation increases.</p></speech>

The current approach offers an incentive to evict people.  These capital gains tax breaks incentivise funds to evict people and they are acting on those incentives.  When they evict people, the value of the property increases.  This is what the funds are doing.  I am dealing with a property in my area that has been bought by one of these funds - I am not sure of the exact year, but I am almost certain it would have been in the period in question - which is evicting people in order to drive up the value of the property.  To my mind, that is another outrageous consequence of these tax breaks.  We are incentivising these funds to increase their capital gains before walking away tax-free.</p> <p>  I have another question that I would like the Minister of State to answer, although I suspect that he cannot or will not do so.  Do we have figures for the tax that would be gained or forgone, depending on whether we extend this relief?  I see somebody shaking their head, so I suspect the answer is "No", which is fairly shocking in and of itself.</p></speech>

As far as I know, although I would be happy to be enlightened, we do not know how much tax is going to be forgone as a result of this extension.  Do we have estimates?  We have just estimated how many firms or funds will benefit from it and what the quantum of assets will be.  Do we have estimates for how much tax will be forgone if we extend this or if we do not do so?  Do we have figures not just for the beneficiaries of this capital gains tax extension but also for the overall amount of tax forgone as a result of the extension?</p></speech>

The argument is that we need tax certainty, but there was no such need for tax certainty when it was introduced to the benefit of these vulture funds.  The Government was able to introduce it immediately, but now that it is being withdrawn it seems that a certain amount of time must be provided in the interests of having an environment of tax certainty.  The Government and the D&aacute;il are entitled to change legislation.  We are not talking about a retrospective measure here.  We have a right to change the tax code.  There seems to be a suggestion that the Government should be blackmailed because it has, in effect, promised these funds that they will not pay tax.  If the Government does not recognise that as a problem, that is fine.  It does not want to admit that the problem was evident a year ago.  The idea that they will still be able to benefit for reasons of tax certainty, even though it has been recognised that this is a problem, is a bit ridiculous.</p></speech>

There are approximately 100 IREFs, four or five of which are widely-held funds, or pension funds, in effect.  Four or five funds have had the benefit of not paying the 20% withholding tax.  The same funds will have that benefit over the next 12 months up to January 2019.  It is important to note that if they are pension funds, they are exempt in any event.  The funds in question are not vulture funds.  It is important that there is full understanding of what we are talking about and dealing with.</p></speech>

There is very significant income volatility and in recent years, there have been improvements in the taxation environment to deal with it.  In particular, the income averaging system was an important reform.  Last year, the opt-out provisions for one year were also a very significant help.</p><p>Problems persist, as the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will be aware.  Farmer organisations put forward a number of different options to provide for greater stabilisation in respect of income volatility.  I have looked at a number of them.  I am sure the Department engaged and considered them as well.  In that regard, the purpose of putting down this amendment is to call for a report examining the feasibility of introducing further provisions to deal with the issue of income volatility for farm enterprises.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#PP00100"><p>I think I am the only farmer in the room.  I may know a little bit more.  I fully recognise that farm income volatility can be a prevalent feature of the agricultural sector.  In response to this, a targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging regime.  This scheme has been in place since the introduction of farm taxation.  It provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out the income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  In effect, one fifth of the farmer&rsquo;s profits and losses for the five years is charged for a year.</p> <p>  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility, my Department sought to introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to reflect this new reality and to maximise the number of farmers who can level out volatile incomes through the averaging system.  In the Finance Act 2014, the availability of income averaging was extended to permit farmers in receipt of income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession to elect into the averaging regime.  The period of income averaging was also extended from three to five years, thereby providing a longer timeframe over which income volatility can be smoothed.  In the Finance Act 2016, an optional so-called step-out from the regime was introduced for farmers to ease financial pressures and improve cashflow for farmers in a year when they experience lower than expected incomes.</p> <p>  In addition, following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed, I have committed to continuing our engagement on exploring further taxation measures for income stabilisation and undertaking a review of agricultural tax incentives more generally in advance of budget 2019.  This will include an examination of existing schemes, including income volatility measures, as well as engagement with relevant stakeholders.  The aim of the review will be to ensure that these schemes are operating in an efficient and effective manner and meeting their policy objectives in this area.</p> <p>  Therefore, on the basis that there is already a targeted tax measure available to full-time farmers under the income averaging regime and considering that I have already committed to undertake a review of agricultural taxes more broadly prior to budget 2019, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Subsequently, in budgets 2015 and 2016, some of these were presented.  There will be a review of all reliefs in the agriculture tax review.  There will be an update and particular reference to income stabilisation.  As I said in a slightly glib way, I understand the pressures on farmers in respect of income volatility.  To put it into context, milk prices for November 2019 will be &euro;0.42 per litre.  Some 16 months ago they were between &euro;0.19 and &euro;0.21 per litre.  The volatility of milk prices internationally on the world market means the price for this product can be halved in a period of 12 to 14 months.  There are very few industries in which that is the case.  While the situation has improved a lot in the past 15 to 18 months, volatility is a serious factor in agriculture at the moment.  We are doing a full review next year.  Income stabilisation will form a substantial part of that review.</p></speech>

That amendment is no longer being pressed as a result of the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption for non-resident investors in Irish real estate funds, IREFs, now being dealt with in the previous section.</p><p>There are a number of amendments in this grouping.  To keep the debate focused, we should try to deal with them individually.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a report to be laid before the D&aacute;il within six months of the passing of the Act on the ability of certain investors in IREFs, including pension funds and other investment funds, to neutralise their tax liability in respect of either incomes or gains from Irish property held by such funds.  This leads on from the conversations we had earlier in public and private sessions of the committee in respect of the make-up of a certain number of IREFs.  Some would have a large involvement in pensions, both Irish and European institutional pension schemes and investors.  We know that, as a result, pension funds investing in IREFs are able to avail of not paying any tax.  We need to deal with that.  I am asking that a report be brought forward on the options in dealing with it.  Certain investors in IREFs, including pensions funds and international investors, can pay no income, corporation or capital gains tax on their income or gains from Irish property.  Many feel that this is simply wrong.</p><p>For example, the IPUT fund has Irish property assets of &euro;2.2 billion.  AIB recently signed a 20 year lease with this fund, which is moving in from Ballsbridge to AIB's corporate headquarters in the centre of Dublin in 2019.  The group's contracted annual rental return for 2017 is expected to be &euro;102 million.  However, 79% of this fund is owned by pension funds and institutional investors, meaning that the vast majority of its incomes and gains are not subject to taxation.  That is a major gap.  The fund has &euro;2.2 billion in Irish property assets and a rental book of &euro;102 million, yet 79% of its gains and income is not subject to Irish taxation.  This goes back to the point about taxing property and the rights here in terms of such taxation and the benefits that arise from property.</p><p>We can look at these funds and examine who really benefits.  Certain individuals benefit from them.  The lawyers obviously benefit from the structures that are put in place.  In terms of the number of staff this fund has, which one would think would be quite large given the turnover in annual rental income and assets of &euro;2.2 billion, it employed 19 people in 2016.  If we were to look at their pay bill, we would say it was large at &euro;5.3 million.  The average cost per employee is therefore about &euro;279,000 per year.  Certainly, they can afford to pay wages of that scale.  The vast majority of the income and profits they are recording is not taxable.  In respect of institutional investors, Irish institutional pension schemes make up 42% of the fund.  European institutional investors make up 37% of it.  Then we have Irish investment managers at 17% and Irish charities and universities at 4%.</p><p>I do not believe that is a healthy way to go forward.  We need to consider issuing a report on how and whether we can bring in measures that would see an appropriate level of taxation of some of these funds, which would have within them investments from pension schemes and other institutional investors that are not subject to tax.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#QQ00100"><p>Section 23 of the Finance Act 2016 introduced a new tax regime for funds that hold Irish real estate, to be known as Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property.  Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax Acts.  The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy&rsquo;s point in relation to pension funds and investment undertakings, I note that these entities are investment vehicles.  As such, they do not pay tax on the profits generated within the vehicle.  Tax is instead operated at the time that the investor, be it the pensioner or the unit holder, draws a benefit down from the pension fund or investment undertaking.  Pension funds and investment undertakings are, therefore, among a class of investors that can make a declaration that IREF withholding tax does not arise.  This is on the basis that the profits will ultimately be taxed at the investor level.  I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from Irish real estate funds will be filed in the middle of next year.  At that point, Revenue will examine the IREF taxable events in respect of which IREF withholding tax could have applied and identify reasons why such withholding tax was not operated.  If any areas of concern are identified, these will be addressed.</p> <p>  In relation to the IREF withholding tax exemption for gains on assets held in an IREF for more than five years, as we have discussed, I have brought forward an amendment such that it will not apply to disposals on or after 1 January 2019.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced by the Finance Act 2013.  The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property.  REITs must be widely held, as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a close company, that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer participators.  A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property.  No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT.  The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.</p> <p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible to share the information sought by the Deputy with the committee, or indeed with myself.  However, I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division has a dedicated team which looks after REITs.  As the REIT regime was introduced in Finance Act 2013 that team is, as part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies.  Should any issues arise from that review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials.</p> <p>  I cannot commend the amendments to the committee, but I assure the Deputies that both the IREFs and REITs are being kept under review.</p></speech>

Some 79% of IPUT, the largest investor in the State, is owned by pension funds so there is no tax.  It represents &euro;2.2 billion of Irish assets but we are not taxing it.  How does the Minister stand over that?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that we have an issue with pensions in Ireland and we are proactively trying to encourage people to take out pensions and to invest for the future.  There are a number of reliefs available and, in 2013, with REITs and IREFs we were trying to get people to invest in Irish property.  Perhaps we could ask the tax strategy group to review it as they will report next summer, just a couple of months after the six months proposed in the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

We want to encourage people to take out pensions but less than half the country has a pension.  We should not forgo tax on billions in Irish property so that the other half can get a better pension.  This other half has larger incomes.  Some 37% of the IPUT portfolio is made up of European institutional investors, as opposed to Irish institutional pensions schemes, so a large section is going untaxed.  A fundamental principle is that property should be taxed in the country where it is situated.  There are other issues which we will deal with in the other amendments but I welcome the proposal that the tax strategy group deal with this and I will withdraw my amendment.  If the tax strategy group carries out a review of the tax structure within IREFs that allows individuals to neutralise or significantly reduce tax, and comes up with proposals to deal with this, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

I briefly discussed the effect of the help-to-buy scheme on property prices with the Minister for Finance.  It is clear from CSO figures that REITs and IREFs are hoovering up a huge amount of property across the State, particularly in Dublin.  The latest figures I have show that &euro;13 billion of property is in funds, though the Minister suggests it may be &euro;16 billion.</p></speech>

The total value of Irish property within these funds is between &euro;18 billion and &euro;19 billion.  The CSO has revealed that non-household buyers, a large proportion of which comprise REITs and IREFs, had purchased 42% of new homes in Dublin by the end of July 2017.  In the middle of this housing crisis, with people queuing up for houses and being outbid for them, non-household buyers are buying 42% of available properties in Dublin.  First-time buyers only make up 25% of the market and are competing with these multibillion euro funds.</p><p>It should be remembered that there are only 100 IREFs and three REITs.  As such, 103 companies have &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion worth of fire-power.  That is the level of assets they have in their structures and they are out there competing with Mary and John who are trying to get onto the property ladder but who are being outbid all the time.  There is a reason for that.  The tax code provides a very lucrative arrangement for these funds, which allows them to outbid others.</p><p> While most of the focus of these funds is in Dublin, we see nationally that non-household buyers purchased 13% of all homes in the State in 2016.  When one isolates local authorities and approved housing bodies from the figures, one finds that, within this category, 10% can be attributed predominantly to REITs and IREFs.  As such, 10% of all homes across the State were purchased by REITs or IREFs.  The 2017 figure nationally will be ahead of that.  It is a disgrace that these tax avoidance structures are pushing up prices through the demand of the funds for property.  They have the fire-power to buy up huge tranches of housing, which results in many ordinary people being unable to even dream of owning their own homes.  We have to change the tax structures within these funds.  Whatever the argument was about the need for vultures in 2013, it is no longer that point in time.</p><p> We have a huge problem with regard to housing supply and the last thing we should do as a Parliament is unleash these tax effective or avoiding structures onto first-time buyers in the market.  They do not have a clue what is happening.  Many of them are oblivious to what we are doing in this committee but we have passed the legislation to set up the tax structures which are now competing with ordinary Dubliners and people in Donegal for first-time houses.  That is why property prices are increasing by 12.8% nationally and by higher rates in certain categories in Dublin city in particular.  It is not all attributable to that but going back to the statistics, 42% of houses bought in Dublin to the end of July 2017 were bought by non-household buyers.  Non-household buyers include a number of cohorts, namely, REITs, IREFs, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  When we isolate the national figure of 13% and take away local authorities and approved housing bodies, 10% involves REITs and IREFs.</p><p> This proposal is looking for a report on the impact IREFs and REITs are having on residential property prices in the State.  This is required urgently.  I have suggested six months to be consistent with the timeframe in terms of the reports, but it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  What is going on in the Dublin market is crazy.  This is not just coming from the left.  Economists and big firms are calling for penalties on cash buyers and non-household buyers.  There is a time for intervention.  When these non-household buyers are buying up nearly twice as much of the Dublin property market in domestic homes as first-time buyers, the time for action is long past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#RR00200"><p>On the point that non-household buyers have increased significantly, the CSO has clarified that this classification is made up of three broad categories, namely, State and semi-State bodies, charitable, religious and approved housing bodies and private companies, which are the REITs and investment funds.  It is the CSO's intention to publish a breakdown of these figures into the three categories shortly.  However, it is likely to be March 2018 at the earliest before it has any actual figures.  At that stage, we will have the information to do the analysis.  There are three REITs operating in the Irish market, of which two are active in the residential market.  IRES has approximately 2,400 apartments, while Hibernia has just over 300 apartments.  The rationale behind the introduction of the REITs was their design specifically for long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to be a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  The REIT regime brought a new source of capital into the market, reducing dependence on banking finance and freeing up available banking finance for other uses.  By facilitating collective investment, REITs also provide risk diversification for investors of all sizes to promote the professionalisation of the Irish property market.  They are also key to the development of a build-to-rent market in Ireland.</p> <p>  I hear what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  We can all have our ideological debates but all parties across both Houses want to try to improve the housing situation for everyone.  We will not have the information back from Revenue until next July or thereabouts.  As such, we have an information vacuum at this moment in time.  To put this in context, there are 2 million homes in the country.  It is difficult to pluck a figure from the sky, but if we suggest an average price of &euro;250,000 per home, that is a residential value of &euro;500 billion, excluding commercial property.  If one adds commercial property, it is impossible for me to put a figure on it.  REITs and IREFs have assets of &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion.  They have given investors, including pension funds, the opportunity to make a tax-efficient investment.  There is a serious problem, as the Deputy well knows, for Irish pension funds into the future.  He mentioned one in particular.  For each one, there are many thousands of small investors who are trying hard to have a pot for when they retire.  It has not been easy.  Again, we can have an ideological debate about whether it should be allowed at the higher rate, but for the vast majority of people, these are tax-efficient methods for investing.  At &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion, it gives smaller investors the opportunity to be tax efficient.  They do not have to be at a scale which puts them into a very wealthy person's space.  In the scheme of a property sector worth perhaps &euro;500 billion for residential and whatever the value of commercial property is, &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion is not a huge amount.</p></speech>

What information is provided in the annual return?  On the policy rationale, Ireland was a very different place in 2013.  There were apartments available in Grand Canal Dock for what now appear to be very low prices.  I can understand the logic of seeking to professionalise and institutionalise the rental market or, at least, a certain part of it.  There is such a shortage of supply of stock now, however, that I ask the Minister of State to elaborate the Government's policy on this issue currently and the logic of it.  One must compare the tax treatment here with the taxation treatment of ordinary landlords, who pay at up to the 55% marginal rate, and of Irish companies which hold property but do not meet the test to form an IREF or a REIT.</p></speech>

Our friends, PwC, in their document Irish Real Estate Investment Structures, say:</p><blockquote>[There has been a] remarkable resurgence of interest in ... Irish real estate ... spearheaded by overseas investors [not little Irish pensioners trying to save up for their pension pots] and in particular by the hedge funds and private equity groups.  Such investors are using the array of available ... structures ranging from QIAIFs to REITs to SPVs to mitigate or eliminate taxes that would otherwise arise on their real estate investments.</blockquote><p>They go on to refer to REITs: &quot;[N]on-resident investors are not liable to CGT [this is them touting these things again] on the disposal of REIT shares.&quot;  The document states REITs are &quot;not chargeable to tax in respect of ... property rental business or chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of assets&quot;.  Regarding section 110 companies, it states, &quot;While such entities are taxable at a rate of 25%, the taxable profits tend to be modest because of the use of tax efficient profit ... mechanisms such as interest ... on profit participating loans.&quot;  It goes on and on.  What PwC is touting is the fact that this is an array of structures which allows the mitigation or complete elimination of the profits extracted from the Irish property sector, much of them courtesy of NAMA, which flogged this property - our property - to these buyers in order for them to extract profit and pay no tax.  This is the greatest scandal this State has seen in recent times.  As if everything that happened in 2007 and 2008 and the cost that people paid were not bad enough, that then became the prelude to the vast unloading of property assets to foreign investors, hedge funds and so on, which then extract an absolutely enormous profit from this and pay no tax.

We should look at that too.  It is shocking, when one considers what is happening in the property market and the enormous appreciation of the value of these properties, that such buyers are walking away and paying no tax.  The other side of the coin is that I then have to traipse into PwC on behalf of residents or tenants in properties managed by PwC on behalf of these funds and plead with PwC not to evict them.  I had to do that a while ago.  These stony-faced men in PwC are looking for, in one case, 90% rent increases on an apartment block in D&uacute;n Laoghaire - the whole block.  They wanted to kick the residents out on behalf of these lovely people.  We have this array of tax structures to minimise or mitigate their tax liability and they try to evict people.  I am glad to say that because the people resisted, PwC has been forced back so far.  There have been two separate attempts by PwC to evict the whole block on behalf of, in this particular case, Apollo Global Management, which presumably benefits from this array of tax structures.</p></speech>

This is the on-the-ground reality of the matter.  I am telling the Minister of State what PwC is touting the array of structures to mitigate or eliminate tax on property investment.

PwC is the very first result, and it is all about mitigating or eliminating tax liabilities.</p></speech>

I had a problem with the way in which the Department of Finance is implementing and addressing the Act in that what I understand now happens is that general letters are written, which are received by low-level officials, who are not designated officials.  The then Minister indicated to me - others might remember part of the discussion on the Finance Act - that he was minded to address any difficulties, but I am not aware of anything being done over the past year to address an obvious gap in the legislation.  Who at this point in time is a designated official in the Department or the Revenue Commissioners, and at what level are they in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, for the purposes of the Regulation of Lobbying Act?  The finance committee, knowing and having some general information about lobbying, would give us greater insight into how and why some changes come about.  In some cases there may be valid commercial strategies that really do stand up.  In other cases it is frankly very difficult to understand.</p></speech>

This is a Government policy and has nothing<i>per se</i>to do with any of the officials, but could the Minister of State enlighten us on that policy?  In New York, San Francisco and the City of London, similar vehicles result in the large-scale turnover of less well-off tenants in favour of &quot;yuppie&quot; apartments that are done up for wealthy people, often putting them out of reach of current locals.</p><p>I understand the Minister of State's point about the needs of the small investor and so on and that this may be an attractive vehicle but, in terms of the social consequences of this type of investment, has he any concern about how some of them have operated to date in certain circumstances?</p></speech>

The 2,700 owned by or in the possession of REITs account for less than 0.15% of that amount.  I do not have a breakdown of how many properties are owned or rented, so I do not have an exact figure, but we would not be discussing the other 99.85% of properties.  REITs are an easy target and some may be doing things along the lines of what Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined.  I cannot stand over those things, nor can anyone else, but that is not a discussion on the 99.85% where people can be found treating their clients even more poorly than that.  There are 2,400 apartments with I-RES and 300 apartments with Hibernia REIT.  We will try to get the information but, in the grand scheme of things and to be frank with the committee, I would prefer to discuss the 99.85%, not the 0.15%.</p></speech>

If that contributes to someone building up a pension fund in a fair and sustainable way, I am all for it, as I am sure is every Deputy present.  However, the issue is that, in some cases, existing tenants are being turfed out and new, better off tenants are brought in at much higher rents.  Our concern is about how rents are increasing on a rolling basis.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to CSO data that will give us more information on this matter.  I support the call for more information, as it will allow us to explore what needs to be addressed on the policy side.  What undertakings will the Minister of State give?  Is he willing to explore this or is it something for which Fine Gael does not allow?</p></speech>

This is not about my mum's house, my house or people who are living in their homes.  It is about properties that are coming onto the market for sale.  Those first-time buyers cannot knock on their neighbours' doors and ask whether there is any chance of them giving up their homes so that the first-timers can buy them.  They go to the market of houses for sale.</p> <p>  I will cite the figures in terms of non-household buyers.  In 2010, some 3% of properties across the State were bought by non-household buyers.  So far this year, that figure is 15%.  In Dublin, in 2010, the figure in respect of all homes was 5%.  It has increased to 23% so far in 2017.  The figure in respect of new homes in Dublin in 2010 was 15%.  In 2017 to date, it is 42%.  These are the figures.  That is the pool of houses that are available for people who are trying to get onto the property ladder.  There is no point in talking about the others who are already in their houses and will not leave them.  If they decided to leave their homes, they would fall into that category.</p> <p>  Let us get with this.  In Dublin, 42% of new homes are bought by non-household buyers.  I welcome the fact that Revenue will break down that information into more granular detail, but let us not pretend that there is no issue.</p></speech>

We can get this information, although it will not be as accurate as what Revenue will provide in March following its analysis.  We know what local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have bought.  If we strip them out, we find that the figure has not reduced substantially.  REITS and IREFs are hoovering up the market and, consequently, pushing up prices.  We want the Minister of State to understand the problem in the first place and to get with it.  We have unleashed these fund structures onto unassuming first-time buyers whom they are outbidding in the market.</p> <p>  This is not just coming from the left.</p><p>Merrion stockbrokers said the Government should consider penalising property investors to stop first-time buyers being priced out of the market.  In its latest quarterly economic outlook, the broker says those who want a house to live in should be given precedence over those who are in it for purely investment purposes and looking to make a quick buck.  Investors are the main drivers of cash sales in the Irish property market, which account for more than 50% of transactions.  In its report, Merrion stockbrokers warned there was now a shortage of every type of housing and that the crisis was likely to get worse unless urgent action was taken.  With regard to the REITs, the tax efficient structures the Minister of State talks about, one has set new record monthly rents of &euro;2,570 in its Maple scheme in Dublin despite the tax incentive structure that it has.  It is not right.  I could use stronger language.  The fund is not in it to provide houses; that is a by-product of what they are doing.  They are in it to ensure they maximise the returns for their investors.  Our focus needs to be on Irish citizens.  We have evidence, which will undoubtedly become clearer in a number of months, that we will still see these types of structures out-purchasing first-time buyers in Dublin when we strip everything else out of it.  That is an issue.  Even if the figures were reduced to 30% instead of 42%, it will still be an issue.  We have to stop this.  If there was plenty of supply, there would not be a problem.  I would like to see penalties; I support what Merrion stockbrokers said.  The amendment is very clear.  It asks for "a report on the impact that Irish Real Estate Funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts are having on residential property prices in the State".  It is to be done within six months.  Revenue will have figures for us in March.  If the Government wants to extend that to eight months, we will do it on Report Stage, but there should be a report done on this because it is a major issue.  </p></speech>

I have been looking at REITs and their accounts over the past while.  The level of tax they are paying is staggering.  I have a couple of questions seeking clarification.  The REIT regime provides tax exemption in respect of income and chargeable gains of a property rental business held within the company that satisfies a number of conditions.  We know that one of those has to be that it makes distributions of not less than 85% of its annual property income.  With regard to calculating that annual property income, can the Minister of State confirm if property tax is properly tax deductible for REITs when computing their annual property income?  </p></speech>

I am looking at I-RES's accounts.  The Minister of State has mentioned I-RES.  None of this is secret because these are publicly available.  It tells us about the revenue from investment properties of &euro;38 million.  It deducts property taxes of &euro;581,000, which is not a huge amount, but no other landlord in the State would be able to deduct their property tax before taxation.  Deputy McGrath has raised this on numerous occasions during different Finance Bills.  It deducts asset management fees of &euro;2.7 million.  This is on top of property operating costs of &euro;7.6 million.  There is a real suspicion that this asset management fee should not be deducted.  It is a way of reducing the amount of distribution that has to take place.  I know I am springing some of this on the Minister of State but I would welcome a note from Revenue before Report Stage on this.</p></speech>

We also know that in many cases that 20% does not apply because of tax treaties.  The Ireland-US tax treaty holds less than 10% of REITs and the dividend withholding tax goes down to 15% and so on.  I have looked at the three REITs in the State and their annual reports and accounts for 2016 and 2017.  Their annual reports for 2016 showed they had a combined value of &euro;2.637 billion.  That increased according to their 2017 accounts to over &euro;3 billion.  It showed that the profit within the three REITs - I can individualise them but there is no point in going through that - was &euro;329 million.  It showed that their rent profit, which is a part of their overall profit, was &euro;117 million.</p><p>We have been able to deduce that 85% of ownership of these real estate investment trusts, REITs, are foreign owners.  This was confirmed by the Department of Finance through a parliamentary question.  It was also confirmed that the dividend withholding tax for these three REITs in 2016 totalled &euro;8 million.  According to their own accounts, they recorded profits of &euro;329 million.  As 85% is attributable to foreign ownership, it means they only paid &euro;8 million in tax, an effective rate of 3%.  We know the reason is because most of the profit recorded in their accounts is actually gains and assets appreciation.  None of that is taxed within the fund, which is an issue.  Even if one strips the gains out, one would have &euro;117 million of rental income profit.  The dividend withholding tax paid against that was &euro;8 million, an 8% effective tax rate.</p><p> These are multi-million euro funds making, according to their own accounts, in one year &euro;329 million of profit.  Of that, 15% will be dealt with differently because it is residential but 85% of it is foreign owned.  On the foreign portion, they only paid &euro;8 million tax.</p></speech>

We have tax treaties.  While 8% is paid here, other amounts are paid when they receive their dividend in other jurisdictions.  The Deputy is not calculating those.</p></speech>

Of this, they paid &euro;8 million in dividend withholding tax.  That is wrong.  It is not that they have done anything wrong.  The Oireachtas has done something wrong by creating this structure.</p> <p>  Recalling the earlier conversation, these are the guys who are outbidding first-time buyers.  They are able to do that because, out of a profit on rental income of &euro;117 million, they only paid &euro;8 million in dividend withholding tax.  That gives them the firepower to outbid individuals and buy up whole blocks of accommodation.</p></speech>
