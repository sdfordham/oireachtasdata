We will return to the correspondence from the Department of Education and Skills in module 3.  Sorry, can we just have the one meeting here everybody, please.</p> <p>  On the letter from Renua, the committee has already decided to hear expert opinion rather than advocacy groups.

I do not believe that Renua falls into either of those categories.  Unless it is an issue I will move on.  I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  I want to note that the committee on the Future of Mental Health Care is meeting today, which is not satisfactory because this committee is a short-term committee and a clash between those is not ideal.  I note that two members, Deputy Browne and Deputy Rabbitte, will have to attend.  Hopefully, they can return when it is over but that is completely understood.  The clerk will speak to the powers that be about that not happening in future, especially with a committee that tends to change its meeting times.  They should avoid this time of the week.  </p> <p>  There is a letter from Dr. McCaffrey and from Both Lives Matter.  They will be published on our website.  </p> <p>  On the issue of witnesses generally, I want to reiterate the position of the committee.  I have said this a number of times but I wish to do so again today.  We agreed last July to hear from experts.  In that regard we decided to look at the availability of witnesses who attended the Citizens' Assembly and also that members would suggest individual experts or groups that they wish to hear from here.  I have asked that we hear all opinion and I have written to members asking for suggestions so as to strike a balance.  In the past week I have asked the clerk to make formal approaches to groups but the response has been along the lines of that contained in Dr. McCaffrey's letter and from the letter from Both Lives Matter.  Their response is that it is not worthwhile for those who advocate retention of the eighth amendment to come before the committee given the decision of the committee not to retain Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution in full.  Also, sorry I am not-----</p></speech>

That decision has not been made.  We need to be very clear about the fact that the only decision that this committee has made is that Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution will not be retained in full.  I do not accept that argument.  For the purpose of our deliberations it is a pity that we have not heard legal and medical argument that would be different to what we have heard to date.  That said, members have learned a huge amount from our interaction with witnesses and we will continue to do our work with a view to reporting to the Oireachtas by 20 December.  The opportunity is still there to suggest particular witnesses to come before us but there is a struggle in getting certain sides of the argument to attend.  That is regrettable.</p></speech>

We appear to lack a procedure to allow an intervention at a relevant point because I merely sought and wish to know and request that the Chairman would read the letters into the record, the letters from Dr. McCaffrey and the letter from Both Lives Matter.  I think it is as relevant to the work of this committee that people who were invited give their particular reason.  The Chairman has given her own personal opinion as to whether a vote to recommend that the eighth amendment not be retained in full constitutes a decision in the matter and only by the most tortured twist of logic could one say that it is not a clear expression of intent from the committee.  Given that is the Chairman's particular point, I think it is appropriate that she would read into the record, as she did with other letters from invited guests in the past, the explanations from Dr McCaffrey and Both Lives Matter.</p></speech>

This exact procedure was adopted in the case of Professor Patricia Casey.  Deputy McGrath wished for her letter to be read into the record.  I did not read it into the record because she did not attend here.</p><p>We could be reading letters into the record for expects for hours here in the committee but really they were invited to attend and should attend and I think that it proves that they should be here.</p></speech>

The committee did, in my view, impugn its own credibility.  The Chairman herself was interviewed on RT&Eacute; about this.  There is a clear question mark in the public mind as to why the committee did not wait to hear from all witnesses before moving ahead with a very substantial recommendation about what the future of Ireland's abortion laws should be.

It is interesting that people outside of the jurisdiction have noted this very irregular approach taken by the committee.  It forms the basis for their refusal to come before the committee.  On that basis I believe it is in the public interest, and in the interests of the credibility of this committee, that the invited guests, and as I understand it they were invited very belatedly, be given the courtesy of putting their explanation on to the record as opposed to just saying, as the Chairman did, that they should come before the committee.</p></speech>

I understand Senator Mullen did propose this witness originally.  There was no backing documentation as to why the travel was required, which necessitated a delay in that witness being invited to the committee.  We have been making efforts for a number of weeks to assess if we could find a time that would suit him.  Only last night we heard that he did not want to come at all.  It is not as straightforward as the Senator has laid out.</p></speech>

I would submit that the explanation that the Chairman has just given is disingenuous.  The Chairman is now saying that when a name was suggested originally, that the Chairman did not take it on.  I have always stated at this committee that it is the Chairman's response, and the secretariat behind the Chairman, to propose a list that would test the issues fully.  I have always made that very clear.  The fact is that the Chairman did not do the necessary investigation and then after the event, after a decision has been made by the committee, an invitation was issued by the Chairman.  I would say that it is at the minimum a courtesy and I would argue more than that.  It is a matter of fair procedures that the Chairman would put the response on the record.  The Chairman's response just now was disingenuous.</p> <p>  With regard to the second organisation I referred to, the Chairman had already declined to bring it before the committee, as I understand it from correspondence with it.  Then the Chairman and the secretariat appear to have changed their minds.  It seems to me that different reasons are being offered for different courses of-----</p></speech>

Our job is to assess the recommendations of the Citizens' to double-check and test it as far as we can and to eventually prepare the situation whereby a referendum or referenda will be put to the people on the basis of which the people will be able to vote in the clear knowledge of what they are voting for.  I have done my best to raise questions and I have done interviews on this question as well, and I strongly believe that it is our job to test and verify and to try to ascertain where the opinions have come from in so far as we can.  I cannot do that unless witnesses present themselves before the committee.</p> <p>  I fully support the points made by Senator Mullen.  Please bring the witnesses in before the committee and we can ask questions.  Everyone is entitled to have their view heard.  It does not matter what votes are taken in this committee.  Ultimately, this is the people's decision.  It is not true to suggest, at all, that this is a foregone conclusion.  It is far from that.  What I strongly urge is this.  I want to hear logical submissions from witnesses who have different points of view.  I am not in favour of abortion but as I said before, I believe that we need to assess this situation in the light of various submissions that have been made.  Let us hear all the submissions.  To my mind it is a very serious flaw in what is happening if people do not come before the committee even though they have a strong view.  Let us hear that view and the detail behind it.</p></speech>

I have a lot of people indicating.   I am going to let Deputy McGrath in as he was just about to speak.  Unless there is something different that people want to say, we have witnesses waiting outside, and I would ask members to be conscious of that.</p></speech>

I too believe that Professor McCaffrey's letter should be read into the record.  I ask this in regard to Professor Casey as well and also Both Lives Matter.  I am proposing that they be read into the record.  I want to make that proposal to the committee here today.  I also take issue with the Chairman saying that it is a pity that we cannot get witnesses.  We have to ask ourselves why.  I have said the same privately and publically.  The secretariat should have secured the attendance of the witnesses.  We should not have been involved  or asked to get any witnesses, any of us in this room.  It is not up to us to get witnesses because we might be tainted one way or the other and everyone knows that.</p></speech>

I am making my point that I believe that it was the secretariat, with the Chairman, who should have secured the attendance of the witnesses.  We are in a situation now that the Chairman has described as a pity.  Why should we be surprised?  We took a premature vote here and we did change the intent.  I agree with Deputy Durkan.  It will be the electorate that will make the final decision on this and it will not matter what will happen in committee.  I describe it like a jury half way through a trial and the jury foreman approaches the chair and says we are going to give our opinion now,  we have found him guilty or not guilty half way through the evidence.  That is where we are.  That is why we have not got witnesses attending.  I believe that a person of that eminence that we have decided to invite should have his letter read into the record.  I am proposing that.</p></speech>

I want to make a point of order.  The Chairman said at the beginning that we have two letters from people who have declined to appear as witnesses having been invited and that those letters will be published and available on the website.  I believe that is sufficient instead of the Chairman being obliged to read a four and a half page reply into the record of this committee.  The Chairman has stated, and I fully endorse her announcement, that these letters are available for anybody anywhere in the world to read on the website.  We do not have to read every letter into the record of this committee.</p></speech>

Pulling out of giving statements at this committee is part of that wider strategy to undermine the work that has been happening and to undermine the Chairman.  Everyone was asked to submit recommended witnesses and if it was broken up proportionally, the people that are saying that it is biased submitted a certain number speakers.  If that was divvied up around the room everyone got the same amount of speakers.  It is a clear strategy every week and we are giving them time to rehearse it, which is eating into the time for the people who are here who are willing to give their time.  I will  be critical of the people who pulled out because there are people who agree with them who depended and wanted them here to hear their evidence.  They are failing to provide that side of the argument.  If they do not want to be here they should not be read into the record.</p></speech>

We will be holding three separate sessions this afternoon.  The first session will address international legal rights and services.  Our second session will consider a view of medical law and our third session will look at risks to mental health.  Before I introduce our first witnesses, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors in the Public Gallery are requested to turn off their telephones completely or put them in airplane mode.  That really is an issue.  The week before last there was an awful lot of interference, even on the RT&Eacute; coverage.  It is really important that mobile telephones are off, because it causes a lot of interference both for the staff working here and for the television studios.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the witnesses, Dr. Gilda Sedgh, principal research scientist with the Guttmacher Institute, Ms Leah Hocter, regional director for Europe, Center for Reproductive Rights, and Ms Katrine Thomasen, senior legal advisor for Europe, Center for Reproductive Rights.  You are all very welcome to this afternoon's meeting.  </p><p>Unfortunately, before we commence formal proceedings, I must advise witnesses on the matter of privilege.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now call on Dr. Sedgh to make her presentation.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here.  By way of introduction, and to add to the introduction the Chairman provided, I am a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute in New York.  We are a research and policy organisation and we conduct population-level research on reproductive health in the United States and globally.  The Guttmacher Institute advocates for evidence-based policies that promote reproductive and sexual health.  Our evidence is used by stakeholders on various sides of the discourse.  I have been asked to present evidence on abortion trends worldwide and on the characteristics of women who have abortions.</p><p>I will start by giving a global overview of abortion trends, which can provide some context for abortion incidents and trends in Europe.  This evidence was published in <i>The Lancet</i>last year, and it is based on work that we did in collaboration with our colleagues at the World Health Organization.<br/><br/>We estimate that worldwide approximately 56 million abortions took place each year between 2010 to 2014.  The annual number of abortions has increased slightly since the early 1990s.  It can be more useful to talk about how many abortions take place for every 1,000 women of child-bearing age.  This is because the absolute number of abortions can increase as the number of women in a population increases, but the number of abortions for every 1,000 women, also known as the abortion rate, is not influenced by the size of the population.  The 56 million abortions that take place each year translate to about 35 abortions for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.  Another way of saying this is that, roughly speaking, about 3.5% of women of child-bearing age have an abortion each year globally.  The global abortion rate has declined slightly over the past 25 years.<br/><br/>We have also estimated abortion incidence across the 17 major subregions of the world.  We were not able to estimate incidence for every individual country because we did not have enough data on which to base country estimates.  I refer the trends in the abortion rate in major parts of the developed world, that is, Europe and North America.  We can look at northern, western and southern Europe together because the abortion levels and trends in these three sub-regions are similar.  The abortion rate is much lower in North America and in Europe, outside of eastern Europe, than the global average of 35 per 1,000 women.  It is about 17 in North America and 21 in non-eastern Europe, and the rate has declined modestly in both of these regions in the past 25 years or so.<br/><br/>Eastern Europe is a different story.  As members are probably aware, the abortion rate was very high in eastern Europe during the Soviet era.  It declined dramatically in the past 25 years to less than half of what is was in the early 1990s.  The abortion rates in northern, western and southern Europe are the lowest sub-regional abortion rates in the world, and the decline in eastern Europe is by far the sharpest decline that we have seen in the world.<br/><br/>While we were not able to estimate abortion incidence for all countries, we compiled statistics from countries with good reporting systems for the most recent year for which such evidence was available at the time of our compilation.  I refer to the countries where it is recognised that at least 90% of all abortions are included in the official reports.  Across these 18 countries, almost all of which are all in Europe, the abortion rate varies from five per 1,000 in Switzerland to 18 per 1,000 in Sweden.  In eight of these 18 countries, the abortion rate is fewer than ten per 1,000.  Globally, when we grouped countries according to their abortion laws, we found that, on average, the abortion rate in countries where the procedure is prohibited altogether or allowed only to save a woman&rsquo;s life is not significantly different from the rate in countries where abortion is allowed without restriction as to reason.  The vertical lines around the points indicate the margins of error around these estimates and members can see they all overlap.  This is a bird&rsquo;s eye view of abortion rates in these groups of countries and it does not examine the various factors that could influence abortion rates in these countries.<br/><br/>We were also able to estimate the percent of all abortions that were obtained by married women and the percent obtained by unmarried women.  We used data from the United Nations, which defines married women to include women in cohabiting unions.  We estimate that about 73% of all abortions worldwide are obtained by married women, and 27% are obtained by unmarried women.  In the developed world, about 69% of all abortions are obtained by married women.  These are estimates across broad geographic areas, and there are variations across countries within each of these groups of countries.<br/><br/>I showed abortion rates in countries grouped by the legal status of abortion.  Last month we published estimates of the safety of abortions performed worldwide, and in groups of countries classified according to their abortion laws.  These estimates were also made with colleagues from the World Health Organization, and are also published in <i>The Lancet</i>.<br/><br/>As defined by the World Health Organization, safe abortions are those done by a trained provider or a trained person and using methods appropriate to the gestational age of the pregnancy.  Less safe abortions are those for which only one of these criteria is met, and least safe abortions are those for which neither of these two criteria are met.  About 31% of abortions are in the least safe category in countries where abortion is illegal on all grounds or only allowed to save a woman&rsquo;s life or preserve her physical health.  Less than 1% of abortions are in the least safe category in countries where abortion is permitted without restriction as to reason.  We also found that abortions are also more likely to be unsafe in low income countries than in high income countries, based on the World Bank classification of countries.  Countries with restrictive abortion laws tend to be low-income countries, and Ireland is anomalous as a high-income country with a restrictive abortion law, so it is not easy to assess the relationships of economic development and legal status with the safety of abortion.<br/><br/>We did not have enough information with which to estimate the ages of women obtaining abortions across the world&rsquo;s sub-regions.  Instead we compiled statistics from the countries with good quality reporting.  These are countries with liberal abortion laws where at least 90% of abortions are included in the reporting systems.  Across the countries with this information, about half of abortions are obtained by women in their 20s, and another third are obtained by women in their 30s.  Across all these countries, adolescents of 19 years old or younger, predominantly adolescents of 15 to 19 years old, account for a smaller share of abortions than their share of the population - that is, the abortion rate is lower among adolescents than among women in their 20s and 30s.  In almost all these countries, adolescents&rsquo; share of all abortions has decreased since the early 1990s.  In the countries that further break down the ages of women having abortions into smaller windows, the majority of adolescents&rsquo; abortions are obtained by 18 and 19 year olds.<br/><br/>According to the statistics we compiled from 15 countries, 48% to 74% of women who obtained an abortion already had at least one child.  In all but two of these countries, more than half of women obtaining an abortion already had at least one child.<br/><br/>We are currently preparing a report on the gestational ages of pregnancies when they are terminated across countries that have reliable statistics.  I refer to abortions done in the first trimester of pregnancy.  According to these preliminary findings, in all but three of these countries, 90% or more of abortions are obtained in the first trimester.<br/><br/>For four countries we have information from nationally representative surveys of women on the reasons for wanting an abortion, among those who have had an abortion.  Women obtain abortions for a wide variety of reasons.  In these surveys women were asked to give just their primary reason for having an abortion.  For example, in Belgium, about one fourth of women said they sought an abortion for socioeconomic reasons, and another one fourth had an abortion for partner-related reasons - for example, their partner did not want to have a child or their relationship was dissolving.  Approximately 18% wanted to space their children or postpone having a child, and another 13% already had as many children as they wanted or could manage.  Approximately 1% of women in Belgium said that they were having an abortion because of issues related to the health of the foetus.  In the other three countries, less than 1% of all abortions were for reasons related to foetal health.<br/><br/>In a survey in the United States, women who had an abortion were asked to indicate all their reasons for having the abortion.  An interesting take-away message from this survey is that many women gave more than one reason.  Financial issues, wanting to space or delay child-bearing and partner-related issues remained common.  Approximately 30% of women said they sought an abortion because they needed to focus on the children that they already had at home.<br/><br/>I will shift gears and wrap up by giving a broad overview of abortion laws of countries across the world.  Ms Leah Hoctor will go into more detail on this topic.  Of the 199 countries and major territories in the world, 75 allow abortion without restriction as to reason or for socioeconomic reasons; 58 countries and territories allow abortion to preserve a woman&rsquo;s physical or mental health; and 40 allow abortion to save a woman&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Ireland is one of these 40 countries.  In 26 countries, abortion is not allowed for any reason, although some of these make exceptions in cases of rape, incest or foetal anomaly.</p><p> Using the UN's classification of countries according to whether they are developed or developing, 41 of the 50 developed countries allow abortion without restriction as to reason or for socioeconomic reasons, five allow abortion to preserve a woman's physical or mental health, one &ndash; Ireland &ndash; allows abortion to save a woman's life, and three do not allow abortion on any ground.</p><p> I will end by summarising some of the key points from the review.  The sub-regions with the lowest abortion rates are those in which most countries are developed, where abortion is legal on broad grounds and there are strong reproductive health programmes.  Women obtaining abortions represent a broad spectrum of all women - young and old, single and married, childless and with children - and many who seek an abortion have multiple reasons for doing so.</p></speech>

Receiving this request was an honour.  My purpose will be to provide members with an overview of comparative European law on the termination of pregnancy.  To that end, I will describe the grounds and timeframes on which abortion is legal in 46 other European countries.  I hope that this information will assist the important and valuable deliberations that the committee is conducting on behalf of the citizens of Ireland, among whom I am proud to belong, in case my accent has not given it away.</p> <p>  Before I turn to the substance of European laws on abortion, it might be helpful to clarify certain matters regarding the Center for Reproductive Rights as it relates to Ireland.  As time is short, I will also refer members to the centre's website.  The mandate of the Center for Reproductive Rights is well known.  We work across the world, specifically in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US, to advance the legal protection of women's reproductive health and rights.  This means that the centre uses law to advance women's access to reproductive health care, including affordable contraception and family planning, safe and legal abortions and quality maternal health care.  We also work to prevent child marriage and forced sterilisation.</p> <p>  As many committee members will know, the centre's work in Ireland has focused on representing Ms Amanda Mellet and Ms Siobh&aacute;n Whelan in their complaints to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, OHCHR, and in all advocacy, governmental, media and political engagement related to those cases and the OHCHR's decisions on same.  Both decisions held that Ireland was obliged under international treaties to provide effective remedies to Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan.  The decisions specify that these remedies must entail compensation, psychological support services and reform of Irish abortion law in order to prevent similar violations in the future.</p> <p>  As the representative of Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan, the centre must call and advocate for Ireland's compliance with the OHCHR's decisions and the Government's provision of the specified remedies.  All advocacy, political or governmental engagement by the centre in Ireland has been undertaken in the context of these two cases.  The centre's general fundraising for its work in Europe includes Ireland in terms of support for its work on the OHCHR cases and its advocacy to ensure the required law reforms.  The centre is not providing any funding to Irish organisations for campaigning or political activities.  In addition to our work representing Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan, the centre has contributed modest amounts to the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, to support expert events for lawyers and medical practitioners regarding international human rights law and World Health Organization, WHO, guidelines on safe and legal abortion, as well as events to provide women and men a diversity of views and an opportunity to engage in non-directive discussions about abortion.</p> <p>  Turning to the substance of my presentation, my goal will be to provide members with a quick overview of the laws on abortion in 46 other European countries.  In particular, I will aim to outline the standard approach among most European countries to the legality of abortion.  To assist with this, I will take us through eight slides.  To supplement that information, we have provided a large chart to all members - there are hard copies in the room - illustrating the grounds and some of the timeframes on which abortion is legal in each of the 46.  All this information is taken from primary legal sources, which can be independently verified.  We have also submitted a booklet to members, containing copies of many or most of the relevant legal provisions.  We have brought some hard copies as well.</p> <p>  As members will see from the slides and supplementary materials, the Citizens' Assembly recommendations on the full set of reasons and timeframes within which abortion should be made lawful in Ireland align almost in their entirety with the laws on abortion in almost all other European countries.  As a result, if the recommendations on future legislation were adopted, it is safe to say that they would bring Irish law on abortion into line with the laws of almost all other European countries.</p> <p>  Regarding the standard legal approach to abortion across Europe, the first slide shows a map of Europe.  Almost every European country - 40 in total - is coloured either green or light yellow.  This means that they have made abortion legal either on a woman's request without restriction as to reason or for reasons of distress - those are the ones in green - or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  The countries in red or dark orange do not allow abortion on request or on broad socioeconomic grounds and only in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>  This map shows that 25 of 28 EU member states have made it lawful for women to access abortion on their request or on broad socioeconomic grounds, at least in early pregnancy.  It also shows that 40 of 47 Council of Europe member states have taken this approach.  As the committee members will know, all 28 EU member states are also members of the Council of Europe.  Only three EU member states do not allow abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  These are Ireland, Malta and Poland.  Within the 47 Council of Europe member states, these three EU countries are joined by only four micro-state jurisdictions - Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino.</p> <p>  The next few slides will focus on the approach of the countries in green and light yellow.  As we can see from the map, 36 countries have legalised access to abortion on a woman's request.  The following slide shows a quick recap of these countries.  In the majority, a woman does not need to give any reason when asking for an abortion.  In a small number, as shown in the next slide, a woman must explain that she is seeking an abortion because of social or family circumstances or because continuing the pregnancy would cause her distress.  The committee can see the breakdown across countries.</p> <p>  What about gestational limits?  All these European countries impose a time limit on the legality of an abortion on a woman's request.  We can see their time limits on this slide.  A time limit in or around early pregnancy is the norm, with a 12 week limit the most common.</p><p>In addition to the 36 countries that are green on the map and that have legalised access to abortion on a woman's request, four European countries are light yellow on the map and these four have taken a different approach.  They have not legalised abortion on a woman's request but on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  In these four countries, for abortion to be lawful doctors or sometimes social workers must certify the existence of the relevant socioeconomic or psychological reason.  The slide on display right now shows the four countries, the different reasons and the time limits involved.  </p><p> What happens in these 40 countries once the time period for abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds ends?  In almost all of them, after the time period ends, doctors can still legally perform abortions for one or more exceptional reasons.  The next slide shows the usual reasons that are allowed under the laws of almost all European countries.  Sexual assault and socioeconomic reasons are present in the laws of many countries as exceptional reasons but not always explicitly.  The terminology and the approach differs across countries.  In some of these countries, these exceptional reasons are each articulated as an explicit ground in the relevant law while in others, the grounds are implicitly included in other grounds.  We do not have time to go through all of these grounds now but will focus briefly on women's health and on sexual assault.  All of the grounds are listed in the chart that we submitted to all committee members, with a breakdown across the various countries.  </p><p> In terms of women's health, I wanted to capture for the committee the fact that although legal terminology differs across countries, in almost all of the 40 countries we have looked at the laws explicitly or implicitly allow abortion when a woman's health is at risk.  As members will see from the slide on display, the majority of these laws do not specify a time limit for this ground.</p><p> Finally, what is the approach across the 40 countries to the legality of abortion following situations of sexual assault?  First, it is important to note that in all of the 36 countries where abortion is legal on a woman's request, women who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest can always access abortion within the relevant time limit under the on-request ground.  In these countries, women who have survived sexual assault can follow a generally applicable process to obtain a lawful abortion and do not have to fulfil special procedures or report the rape.  For this reason, many of these countries do not include an explicit ground for abortion in their laws.  At the same time, about half of these countries do have an explicit ground for sexual assault in their abortion laws and this means that women who are pregnant as a result of rape can either access abortion in early pregnancy under the on-request ground or, often later in pregnancy, under an explicit, separate ground related to sexual assault.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  I hope this overview has been helpful and informative and I look forward to members' questions.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were very informative.  I have two questions for Ms Hoctor and one for Dr. Sedgh.</p> <p>  An issue of which we are aware is the difference between making abortion procedures nominally legal in State laws and ensuring practical and real access to abortion services for women.  What are the common challenges that emerge in this respect and what should Ireland do to ensure practical access to abortion if we decide to change our laws, based on the experience of other countries?  In our last meeting we heard detailed evidence on the issue of abortion in cases of rape and sexual assault, an issue that Ms Hoctor also touched on in her presentation.  In the 21 countries she mentioned that have an explicit sexual assault ground for abortion, what types of verification processes exist to determine if the ground is met?  What is her opinion of how they operate in practice and their impact on the women involved?  </p> <p> My next question is for Dr. Sedgh and I hope I am pronouncing her name correctly. </p></speech>

I am a little concerned that after a potentially divisive referendum campaign the stigma surrounding abortion could become a practical barrier to access.  Has this issue arisen in any other countries and what is its impact?</p></speech>

While I do not want to put witnesses under pressure to answer, I must point out that we are under quite tight time constraints.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#G00900"><p>In the brief time available we can identify three factors which explain why - in some cases - laws that have allowed abortion, either on broad grounds or on very limited grounds, may not enable access in practice.  Affordability and how abortion services are being covered by public health insurance or integrated into the subsidisation schemes of health systems is one factor that can impact access, even where abortion may be legal.  Often in countries that have not legalised abortion on request or on socioeconomic grounds, the certification processes that must be followed to obtain access on a health ground or in situations of foetal impairment or rape, for example, can be onerous.  These processes can often involve multiple levels that a woman must go through or multiple doctors and social workers being involved in certifying the existence of the reason.  We see other barriers in some countries which can relate to waiting periods, for example, or mandatory and sometimes biased counselling requirements.</p> <p>  In the European countries that were green and light yellow on the map, while it is not true to say that there are not sometimes problems for women in accessing a legal abortion, in general these countries have taken an approach in their laws which enables women to access services early in pregnancy at least.  That often means that some of these barriers create fewer problems.  In terms of sexual assault, which I tried to address in my presentation, all of the 36 countries in Europe that have legalised abortion on a woman's request, mainly in early pregnancy, thereby allow women who have survived an experience of sexual assault to access abortion in early pregnancy through that ground.  In that context, many women across Europe who have faced sexual assault and who then choose to have an abortion do so under the on-request ground.  Many of those countries in Europe that have explicit sexual assault grounds in their laws include a particular certification process.  The most common process is that a committee or a number of doctors and social workers must look at the case and agree that the reason exists and that there is evidence of a sexual assault.  Some countries require a prosecutor or police certificate and speak to the need for clear evidence or sometimes for a criminal legal procedure to be initiated.  Only one country refers to a process before a court in the case of sexual assault.  It is very important to understand that 40 countries out of 47 in Europe allow access, in a general sense, on request for socioeconomic grounds in early pregnancy.  It is probably in that way that women access abortion in situations of rape.</p></speech>

There are some countries where abortion is legal on broad grounds but still stigmatised, including Italy, for example.  In other countries, like South Africa for example, the grounds for legal abortion have been expanded but it is still stigmatised.</p><p>Stigma has prevented women from having access to abortion services where providers are allowed to invoke conscientious objection and mechanisms are not put in place to ensure women nevertheless have access to alternative sources of care.  A literature review has brought together 14 studies of the effects of stigma on women who have had an abortion, which is not to say it has prevented them from seeking an abortion.  Some of the summary findings of the review are that women who have abortions in these settings feel socially isolated, are afraid their loved ones will find out they had an abortion and suffer stress for these reasons.</p></speech>

Ms Hoctor referred to a number of countries in Europe.  Do these countries apply time limits in cases of fatal foetal impairment and, if so, how do these work in the context of diagnostic difficulties?  I ask Ms Hoctor to elaborate on that issue.</p> <p>  When one goes beyond Europe, I assume in countries such as Gabon terminations are not carried out in cases of fatal foetal impairment because anomaly scanning services and knowledge of the impairment of the foetus are poor.  I assume the absence of information on these matters, as opposed to cultural or other reasons, is the reason for not carrying out abortions.  I ask Ms Hoctor to clarify that matter.</p> <p>  On the issue of culture, is there any evidence of partners or fathers forcing women to have a termination against their wishes?  Has any research been done on that issue in the context of cultural differences across the globe to identify whether women are vulnerable to this potential threat of having a termination against their wishes?</p> <p>  I am interested in an issue on which the witnesses may have some observations to make.  While terminations are carried out in Finland for various reasons, in one particular area the father may be given an opportunity to present his views prior to the decision to terminate the pregnancy being made, albeit only if there are special reasons that warrant doing so.  I am not sure if the witnesses are aware of the specific circumstances but perhaps they could clarify or expand on what is meant by this aspect of Finnish law.</p></speech>

Some European countries do not distinguish in law between fatal and severe foetal impairments and will have a general ground for severe foetal impairment within which fatal foetal impairment would come.  Some countries distinguish between the two, however, and will have a specific reference to severe impairment and another reference to fatal impairment.  Some of these countries will impose a limit for severe foetal impairments but no limit for fatal impairments.  However, the majority of European countries do not impose limits in the case of a severe or fatal foetal impairment.  I believe the vast majority of them do not do so when the impairment is fatal.  In all of these countries, a detailed certification process is involved whereby doctors confirm the existence and nature of the impairment.  Where countries set out timeframes, these often fall at around 24 weeks, with some a little earlier, perhaps 20 or 22 weeks.  The most common practice, as I stated, is not to distinguish between severe and fatal, and where a distinction is made, there is often no limit for the fatal impairment.</p></speech>

It is still not one of the more common reasons, even where the necessary services are available.</p> <p>  With respect to men forcing their partners to have abortions, I am not aware of any kind of systematic or large-scale evidence to that effect.  I imagine that anecdotal evidence along those lines exists but I cannot speak to it.</p></speech>

No other European country has any kind of provision along those lines.  Finland has the provision to which the Deputy referred and a few other European countries also indicate in their laws that, if possible, the father - the woman's partner - should be involved in the decision-making process.  However, my understanding is that a degree of discretion applies and it is always considered appropriate that the woman's decision-making and her perspective be front and centre, while her partner or husband, if he is accompanying her, may be involved.  I believe Finland may be unique in specifying that a man may have a possibility of having his voice heard.  That provision is more unusual.  It is rare for the law of a country to include a reference to the views of the partner or husband being taken into account, where possible.  In some cases, the partner or husband may be asked to attend the consultation with the relevant physician or clinician, if possible.</p></speech>

From this side of the table, I expect this would be very complex for many different reasons.  For example, the male parent may not necessarily be the partner, which would give rise to complexities.  The whole issue of domestic violence also arises.  Does this happen in practice in certain countries?</p></speech>

I believe these laws are meant to deal with circumstances in which a woman wants her husband or partner to be involved with her in the decision-making process.  I do not believe these provisions are intended as a means of dealing with a conflict in views or surrounding decisions.  In almost all of the 40 European countries we examined, with the exception of Turkey, the laws which allow access on request or on socio-economic grounds prioritise the woman's wishes and decision-making and those of the doctor working with her.  There is also the right or ability of the woman to have her partner or husband involved in that process with her.</p></speech>

I wish to address a few questions to Dr. Sedgh in respect of slide 6.  Will she clarify whether she is saying that in countries where abortion is freely available, the abortion rate is similar to countries where it is very restricted or not available at all and will she expand on that?  I wish to ask Dr. Sedgh about her figures on the gestation duration of pregnancies where they are terminated.  She states that 90% of abortions are obtained in the first trimester; does she have any detail on the reasons for the other 10% of abortions?  Is there any reason to think that the reasons for women having abortions as outlined in slide 12, would be replicated here?  The figures show that roughly 25% of abortions were for socio-economic reasons; 25% for partner-related reasons; about 18% in order to space their children; 13% for reasons for having as many children as they wanted; and 1% related to health of the foetus.  Dr. Sedgh may not be able to give exact feedback but perhaps she has a viewpoint on it.</p> <p>  Would Ms Hoctor speak about her opinion on the so-called floodgates argument?  Should access to abortion be broadened after the referendum in this country?  Is there experience in other countries of a floodgate opening once abortion is allowed on demand?  Ms Hoctor responded to a colleague's question on this but where there are restrictions on abortion inserted in the Constitution in other countries, how did that affect the policy and practice in those countries and how it impacts on women and on the medical profession?</p></speech>

Let me make a couple of points.  Within each of these groups of countries there is a wide variation in the abortion rates and these figures are averages.  We do not see a strong relationship in an univariate correlation between laws and incidence.  We do see a strong relationship between contraceptive prevalence and the abortion rate.  We see it more clearly when we look at the proportion of women with an unmet need for contraception and the abortion rate.  One would then see a much stronger relationship, if that is what we were looking at in this slide, rather than the abortion laws.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughton asked about late term abortions.  Among the small proportion of women who do have late term abortions the reasons for late term abortions are where we will tend to see abortions for reasons that have to do with risks, to foetal health and to foetal life.  Adolescents comprise a larger share of late term abortion than early term abortions and it suggests that it is restrictions or barriers to accessing abortion that causes some women to obtain their abortions later.  Young women might not know they are pregnant, might be afraid to tell somebody they are pregnant and thereby also admit they have had sex, or they do not know where to go and who to ask.  In countries with restrictive abortion laws, some slightly larger proportion of abortions are done later in pregnancy compared to countries where abortion is allowed on broad grounds, so that is another indication that access to legal abortion that can drive the proportions of abortions that are done late.  </p> <p>  If it okay-----</p></speech>

They need options and choices so that they can choose and not just have one method made available to them.  They need counselling to help them navigate the side effects that accompany these methods.  They think they can avoid getting pregnant because they think they are not having sex as often as other couples so they are operating under this misconception that they are not at risk of getting pregnant.

I may help Ms Hoctor answer a question that I think might be more in the Guttmacher Institute's area.  </p> <p>  Deputy Naughton asked about the floodgates.  We have tried to look at trends in abortion incidence before and after a large change.  That is one aspect of the question.  We are not able to do that very well because where abortion is illegal we often do not have a good fix on the number of abortions that are happening and then when abortion becomes legal, the number of abortions that are on the official record begin to increase, but we do not know to what extent that represents a shift from abortions that had been clandestine to abortions that are now not more common but more on the record.  That will be the case in Ireland where we have accounts of women having abortions in England, Wales and in the Netherlands and some obtaining from Women on Web, but we do not fully know how many abortions are happening now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#J02100"><p>Let me follow on from that point.  We saw from Dr. Sedgh's slides as well that some of the lowest rates of abortion in the world are in the western European countries that we looked at in our map that would have access to abortion on request.  I am living in Switzerland at present and that was the country with the lowest incidence of abortion on the slide.</p><p>What we can see from those data is that there is no correlation between the availability of abortion on request, in early pregnancy, for example, in the law, and a higher rate of abortion.  In fact, WHO evidence indicates that once the law is changed, unsafe abortions then become safe.  In the Irish context, this would mean women who are travelling outside the State for abortion care would, in most cases, no longer do so, and women who take an abortion pill in a clandestine manner would be within the law.  Abortions had by Irish women outside the State would happen here.</p><p> I was asked about constitutions.  The Irish approach, involving the regulation of abortion starting with a constitutional provision, is very rare across the world.  In Europe, there is, I believe, only one other country in this category, Andorra.  I do not have exact numbers but I believe Andorra has a complete ban on abortion.  That protects the right to life before birth.  It applies prenatally.  Beyond Ireland and Andorra, it is virtually unheard of in Europe to include abortion within a constitutional provision.  Some countries in Latin America, such as Chile and Honduras, and in Africa have constitutional provisions that address the right to life and whether it applies before birth.  It applies prenatally in those countries.  All these countries have highly restrictive abortion laws.  Since Ireland, being in western Europe, is a country whose socioeconomic status is higher than that of Chile, Irish women can leave to gain access to safe abortion services in another country.  In Latin America and Africa, however, we see, as a result of the very restrictive laws and constitutional provisions, there are very high rates of unsafe abortion.</p></speech>

They are on horse racing, testing, etc.  I apologise if I have to leg it before hearing an answer to my questions to the witnesses.</p> <p>  I was going to raise the floodgates issue.  I note my question has largely been answered.  On page 5 of Dr. Sedgh&rsquo;s report, she refers to varying rates across countries where abortion is broadly available.  The report touches on the point that it is not necessarily a question of legality or illegality in terms of abortion rates but a question of a range of other factors.  Could Dr. Sedgh expand on some of the points on the variance within the countries where abortion is broadly legal?</p> <p>  With regard to the Siobh&aacute;n Whelan case, it was stated in the media yesterday that she was awarded &euro;30,000.  While financial considerations are of far less consequence than the emotional damage being done to women, could Ms Hoctor outline the minimum criteria Ireland needs in its legislation to avoid this?  I presume there will now be many other cases coming on stream that will highlight not only the emotional impact but also the financial cost to the State.  What do we need to do in our law to prevent what occurred from happening again, making reference to the cases in which Ms Hoctor&rsquo;s organisation has represented people?</p> <p>  My other point is on the preamble to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It has been bandied around this committee a bit.  It refers to the protection of the child before birth.  Could the witnesses deal with that in the context of clarifying what has been alleged, namely, that this gives the foetus the right to life, as such, and, therefore, prohibits abortion?  Clearly, it does not considering that all the countries among which we stand out like a sore thumb are signatories to the convention.  A little more information on this would be very useful.</p></speech>

The slide with country-specific abortion rates shows that almost half of the countries have abortion rates lower than ten.  The countries with the lowest abortion rates on record are countries where abortion is allowed on broad grounds.  The countries where we see the sharpest declines in the abortion rate on record are countries that have allowed abortion on broad grounds throughout the period of the decline.  These findings indicate that a liberal abortion law does not necessarily represent the groundwork or setting for a high abortion rate.  I could elaborate but I will stop there because there is limited time and there are many questions in the Deputy's set of questions.</p></speech>

It stated it must make abortion services practically accessible in a timely and effective manner in Ireland.  What is really key here is the phrase &quot;similar violations&quot;.  The violations that the committee found in the decision were violations involving inhuman and degrading treatment, the right to privacy, and inequality before the law.  The facts of the cases of Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan concerned the circumstances of fatal foetal impairment and the really tragic circumstances the women were in.  The analysis of the committee, however, and the decision on why the suffering the women endured was inhuman and degrading focused a lot on the experience of travel and what it meant to have to leave the country to gain access to care in another country, in addition to the breach in the continuum of care that they endured and the fact that they could not obtain health care here from doctors and nurses they knew and trusted.  What is really key for Ireland, the committee and lawmakers as they move ahead is to understand that until Ireland changes its laws on abortion so women, whatever their circumstances, will not face inhuman and degrading treatment or violations of the right to privacy and equality before the law, it may happen that Ireland will continue to appear before the committee.  I am not aware of cases that are pending.<br/><br/>Under international human rights law, making abortion legal is one requirement in a broad range of circumstances.  Another requirement, however, is to make abortion that is legal under domestic law accessible and available in practice.  This is really critical.  Poland serves as an interesting example in Europe.  In that country, abortion has been legalised on many more grounds than it is currently legal in Ireland.  These grounds cover circumstances of severe foetal impairment, rape and the risk to a woman&rsquo;s health, but do not cover abortion on request or socioeconomic grounds.  Owing to the strictures and restrictive nature of the Polish law, however, it is very difficult for women to gain access to services in practice.  Therefore, Poland has been held accountable by the European Court of Human Rights three times.  We can see, therefore, that it is not simply a matter of the grounds on which abortion is legal in a country&rsquo;s law; it is also a matter of ensuring that it is available in practice when it is legal.<br/><br/>With regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the provision is preambular.  It does not in any way refer to the right to life prior to birth, or prenatally.  In fact, in the<i>travaux preparatoires</i>, which are the legal documents used to interpret the treaty, namely, the negotiations of the states that drafted it, it is very clear and specific that the inclusion of this preambular provision was not in any way meant to lead to the application of Article 1 of the convention, on the right to life, prior to birth or in a manner as to prevent the legalisation of abortion in countries that have ratified the treaty.  In fact, we have seen from the jurisprudence and recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is the monitoring and adjudicative body that oversees the convention, that the body has called on Ireland and many other countries with restrictive abortion laws to ensure abortion is decriminalised and that adolescents and girls can gain access to safe and legal abortion services.</p></speech>

It is useful to see how we compare with other countries, particularly countries in Europe, and the cause and effect when changes are made.  I have a question about the position in Malta and Poland.  As Ireland does not allow legal abortion, women travel.  Do the delegates have any information on what happens in Malta and Poland?  The system in Poland is less restrictive than in Ireland, but nonetheless it is very restrictive.</p> <p>  In countries where there is a legal framework in place, what role does the medical profession play within it?  Is there a general trend in that regard in the regulatory process?</p></speech>

My understanding is that many women in both countries also travel outside the country, in Poland's case potentially to neighbouring eastern European countries and in Malta's case often to the United Kingdom.  Although I do not have data, I also believe that, similar to the position in Ireland, women are accessing abortion pills and ordering them online.  In Poland there are reports from non-governmental organisations that there are quite high rates of clandestine abortions.  As the socioeconomic status of women in Ireland is obviously higher relative to that of women in Poland, travel might be easier for women in Ireland than for women in Poland.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

In most of the European countries where we examined their laws the reform processes moved from a highly restrictive law on abortion in the 1970s and 1980s to the laws in place today.  Medical professionals in these societies were very involved with legislators and law makers in crafting these laws and advising on what would be workable and bring about a solution in these countries.  Many of them were dealing with very high rates of unsafe abortion and often the law reform processes occurred because of calls from within the medical profession for change because its members were seeing such high rates of maternal deaths as a result of unsafe abortions.  Usually across Europe laws on abortion in legislation or primary legal sources are also accompanied by regulations, by-laws and often medical guidelines adopted by medical professional bodies.</p></speech>

Is there a big difference between, for example, ten and 14 weeks in terms of practicality?  Is there any noticeable change or movement in any of the countries that have these limits in terms of changing because something is not workable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#L00700"><p>It might not be true in every case, but it is my understanding the limit was decided in the law reform process and I do not believe we have seen change in a European country.  A country that has set a ten or 12-week limit on request or a later limit has not shifted.  Other requirements and facets of the law have changed and developed over time.  The most common limit is 12 weeks.  Although these countries' laws were adopted at a time when medical abortion, the abortion pill, was not available, it is interesting that the ten to 12-week period in place in their laws is the time period within which medical abortion is safe and now available.  Even though that was not the case at the time, it is interesting to see that the time period they set also lines up with the time period for medical abortion being safe, as stated by the WHO.</p></speech>

With regard to the Amanda Mellet and Siobhan Whelan cases, she said in her presentation that the Human Rights Committee's judgment detailed remedies which included reform of Irish abortion law and, if necessary, the Constitution.  In her analysis of the judgment does she consider that it would entail changing the Constitution?  In other words, within the current constitutional restrictions is it possible to implement the decision?</p></speech>

It has set out an obligation of result - law reform - and will not dictate the legal model of law reform that the state must adopt.  However, the Government in its response to the decision in both the Amanda Mellet and Siobhan Whelan case has specified clearly that in order for Irish law on abortion to be changed, the constitutional provision must change.  The State made this argument in its pleadings and written submissions as the case was being considered by the committee.  It is also the position it specified clearly in its responses to the committee.  In order for law and legislative reform to occur, the constitutional reform must first take place.  On that basis, it is our view that this is critical.  Without constitutional reform, it is clear that legislative reform cannot occur.</p></speech>

Clearly, it is a basic issue we must examine.  Both delegates have answered about the floodgates being opened and so forth.  I understand Dr. Sedgh's research is mainly on groups of countries and that it is hard to be specific about Ireland's case, but is there any other comparison in respect of women in one country who have easy access to abortion in another, as we do in Ireland, and to show how statistics might have changed when the law became more liberal such that women did not need to travel?</p> <p>  I do not know if the delegates have statistics for the use of the abortion pill bought online, but are there statistics in other countries?  Judge Laffoy said the Citizens' Assembly was unable to deal with the issue in great detail, but it is one of the issues that have arisen for the committee.</p></speech>

When the Deputy was asking her question, I thought about Zambia where women travel to South Africa for abortions, but we do not have the rest of the scenario described by the Deputy, where the abortion law or access to legal abortion changes, in Zambia.</p><p> I am hard-pressed to find a case where we know definitively what happens to the incidence of abortion before and after a change in the law because of the clandestine nature of abortions before that change.  We have seen countries, my own home country of the USA among them, where the abortion rate declines after abortion has been legal for some time and that shift from clandestine to recorded abortions has taken place.  It declines because women increasingly start to use contraceptive methods or else to shift from less effective to more effective methods.  If there is concern at some point over the numbers of Irish women obtaining abortions then, all of the evidence from other countries suggests that what needs to be looked at is whether or not something might be preventing these women from using contraception.  </p><p>Members asked about abortion pills accessed online and how prominent a role these might play as a proportion of total abortions being carried out.  When it comes to medical abortion in general, these pills play a large role.  The case-loads of online services like Women on Web, from which a woman can be sure she is getting proper pills, proper dosage and proper information, are not in fact very large.  In countries with more restrictive laws, however, which are often developing countries, we see large numbers of women obtaining Misoprostal through the black market.  Misoprostal is but one of the two drugs that make up that medication abortion regimen and women are obtaining it through a variety of means: from pharmacists; from what they call their "chemists"; and from open-air markets.  The drug is often obtained in various doses and thus not necessarily the optimal dose or regimen, and without any guidance or counselling.  I do not know if that speaks to Irish concerns in particular but my overall point is that medication abortion in general can play a major role where abortion is clandestine.</p></speech>

One of our previous sessions here indicated that because Irish women who travel to Britain for abortions do not get the follow-on counselling, they do not always get information on contraception either.  Would that be the case in general?</p></speech>

We can see that some of the lowest rates of abortion are in countries where the family planning and comprehensive sexuality education are quite strong.  With regard to the regulation of medical abortion, many European countries have now developed health service protocols.  These are not based in legislation but rather are practice guidelines set by medical professional bodies on how medical abortion be provided; how it be rolled out; what requirements there might be for women to have prior consultations with doctors; and whether women would take the pill at the facility itself or perhaps take some of it at home.  This matter is properly regulated in most European countries, but within health practice guidelines rather than within legislation.</p></speech>

It concerns the word "risk".  We know from the Citizens' Assembly what it is that we are asked to consider here.  The assembly has a gradation of risk or "serious risk" to use its own term.  There are various definitions of what does or does not constitute risk.  In Dr. Sedgh's experience, is it possible or even desirable to try to grade risk in legislation?  Is it simply a matter of "risk" as determined by medical professionals?  Or can or should we consider including a definition of what does or does not constitute sufficient risk?  We are being asked to consider the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations here and risk is listed as one of the grounds.</p> <p>  The assembly also listed sexual assault among its recommendations, so this too forms part of our deliberations here.  Ms Hoctor mentioned that there are some countries which operate through possible prosecution certificates or indeed legal processes.  That sounds quite shocking to me.  Are these measures on the statute books of those countries without necessarily applying in everyday use?  In other words, do these countries have other ways around the matter?  Or is it actually the case that such certification has to be obtained?  I would like to ask Ms Hoctor to talk us through the process of how a woman might go about obtaining this as it sound to me like a very tough thing to do.  Without wishing to stray outside of Ms Hoctor's area of expertise, I wonder if she could talk to us briefly about the potential impact that having to obtain such certification might have on a woman who has been the victim of a sexual assault.

Some countries do impose such a limit.  Some countries do, as the Citizens' Assembly did, and differentiate between a health risk and a serious health risk.  The most common practice, however, is to have a health ground and not to impose any time limit.</p> <p>  I have put together a quick run-down of the terminology involved: "health is at risk"; "damage to women's health"; "continuation of pregnancy endangers women's health"; "medical reasons" is also a common terminology; and "necessary to prevent".  Of the 40 European countries we looked at, given that I focused mostly on the green and light yellow countries that also have socio-economic access and access on request, there is no qualification on the risk.  Some countries use the language of "serious", "severe" or "grave" health risk but most, approximately 25 or more of the 40, have no such qualification.  That is because, as Deputy O'Reilly mentioned herself, there is a view that best practice in law-making is to treat women's mental or physical health as a clinical matter for the relevant doctors and physicians and for the woman herself.  That is the best practice approach.  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Reilly's other question about sexual assault, it is critical to understand that the 40 countries we looked at by and large allow access to abortion in early pregnancy on a woman's request or for socio-economic reasons.  Where these countries have an explicit assault ground in their law, then, it co-exists as a separate ground side by side with the on request ground.  As we saw, only 19 or 20 countries have that explicit ground in their law.  I was not around in the 1970s when these countries were in the process of reforming their abortion laws and in the 1980s I was too young to be aware of such matters.  I would not be surprised, however, if part of the reason why many European countries have a request ground but no explicit sexual assault ground is because they were concerned about the situations of survivors of sexual assault and thus did not want to set up and then put these women through an onerous certification process.  They knew that legalising abortion in early pregnancy would mean that victims of sexual assault could get access to services within that timeframe.  Someone would have to actually go back to look at the legislative records in the relevant parliaments, however, to understand whether or not that was a consideration.</p><p>Also, it is important to understand that where these countries would have a sexual assault explicit ground in co-existence with a non-request ground or a socioeconomic ground, they would have a later term limit usually associated with that.  It is quite few that would.  In the majority of these countries, the process would involve medical professionals, and sometimes social workers.  It would be a similar process to that applied in the situation of a health risk.  I cannot give the committee information about how the few that refer to prosecutors or police authorities - these are in the minority - operate in practice.  In one country in Europe, Poland, which has legalised access to abortion on grounds of sexual assault but has not legalised access to abortion on request, we see evidence that it is difficult for survivors of sexual assault to access abortion in practice under that rape ground.  I would refer the committee to a case that came before the European Court of Human Rights, called P. and S. <i>v</i>. Poland.  That case illustrates, as was mentioned, some of the severe impacts of these kind of certification schemes.  Poland is one of the countries that requires a certification from a prosecutor.  That case concerned a minor, an adolescent girl who had been raped and who faced very severe impacts and barriers in attempting to gain access to what was a legal service.</p></speech>

Ireland has a number of interesting peers in Europe that have changed their abortion laws and moved from an orange situation or even a red situation to now becoming green.  These would be Switzerland, Portugal and Spain.  In Switzerland and Portugal, those processes involved a public referendum.  I live in Switzerland and I am aware that they vote on everything there - they vote on what side of the road they will drive on.  They liberalised, or changed and reformed, their abortion law through a public referendum process.  There would have been a legislative proposal put forward to the people of Switzerland by the legislature in 2002.</p> <p>  Spain and Portugal are the most recent.  They legalised in 2010 and 2008, respectively.  In Portugal, there was a public referendum.  It may be also of interest to the committee to look at that process.  Then Spain also moved from a restrictive model, from being orange on the map, to now being green.  Those are the most recent.</p></speech>

She stated that there are very few unsafe abortions in countries where there is a reasonably open and liberal abortion regime and there is almost a 30-fold increase in unsafe abortions in countries where legislation is very tight.  I wonder how does that apply <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Ireland where we have the right to travel and where we are in such close proximity to the UK.  Do those figures hold up for Ireland?</p><p>Dr. Sedgh also stated, which surprised me when I saw these figures previously, that 73% of abortions are performed on married women as opposed to 27% on single girls.  That would surprise people and raise a lot of eyebrows around the country because the narrative, especially, by those who are very much against abortion, is always centred on helpless young women who are probably confused, etc., whereas, in fact, the vast majority of abortions would seem to involve women who, because they are married, I assume, are older, more settled and more mature.  I would like to check that figure with Dr. Sedgh to determine am I right.</p><p>Finally, there is one statement Dr. Sedgh made that surprises me and that I cannot rationalise.  Russia jumps out on the map as being all green and, therefore, would be, I imagine, very liberal, yet Dr. Sedgh stated there was a reduction of 50% in abortions in Russia since the war or Stalinist period.  It does not add up how they are still in the green box.  What happened to cause such a reduction?</p></speech>

We do not know all of the women who are having abortions and we do not know all of the conditions in which they are having abortions but it appears to be anomalous.</p> <p>  Senator Ned O'Sullivan's next question was on the marital status of women having abortions.  There is variation across these countries.  Across developed countries, it may not be that in all of them the majority of women having an abortion are married but on average it definitely pans out that way.  One should bear in mind that married women includes cohabiting women.</p> <p>  It is interesting to me also that the unmarried women are the ones who get so much of the attention.</p><p>As they get the attention, it gives the impression that they account for the majority of abortions.  It makes some sense because it could be argued that the consequences of an unintended pregnancy are greater for a young, unmarried woman who has not yet finished her education and for whom the opportunity costs of having a child might be higher.  It could be argued that the stigma of having both an unintended pregnancy and an abortion - having had sex before that - are all compounded.  It is useful to be reminded of that statistic because it is surprising.</p><p> In Russia and eastern European countries, although I hope life has got better in Russia, abortion rates have decreased because access to family planning services has increased dramatically with the ending of the Cold War and because of increases in trade, exposure to the West and the presence of non-governmental organisations providing services.  The number of women using a contraceptive method has increased substantially from 1990 to the present.  The prevalence is still not as high as in western and northern Europe and women are not as likely to be using effective methods as women in northern Europe or using them well because of the variability in the quality of service.  We still see higher abortion rates in eastern Europe than in the rest of Europe and these are some of the reasons from the evidence we have seen.  It comes back again to contraceptive use; it is why rates decline or remain high.</p></speech>

In Ireland's case we are in the area where the purpose of an abortion is to save the woman's life.  It is also true, of course, that it does not necessarily have to be an abortion.  My definition of abortion is to terminate the life of the child still to be born to achieve a result.  As we know, it is possible to intervene to save a woman's life without killing the child.  Will Dr. Sedgh comment on this?</p> <p>  I am a little confused about the statistics for Germany as compared with those for the United Kingdom, for example.  There are liberal or readily available abortion services on socioeconomic grounds, but there are considerable restrictions in Germany related to the provision of counselling and advice.  There is a thorough examination of the person presenting, whether she is single, married or whatever the case may be.  There seems to be a heavy reliance on counselling and the provision of support services that do not seem to be a feature in the United Kingdom, for example, and certainly are not a feature for Irish women availing of abortions in the United Kingdom.  With regard to abortion rates across various countries in which abortion is legal on broad grounds, we can compare the likes of Sweden with Switzerland.  There is a dramatic difference in the level of abortions in the two countries.  Is that for some reason we have not spotted?  There seems to be something bvious that is not jumping up to hit me.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned about the suggestion the European Union is watching us and might be on our case again.  There are a number of matters on which we are watching it also.  I am a little uneasy about that slant.  This is an independent state and we observe EU law in almost every case.  In some recent times there has been a tendency for us to feel we must reiterate our right to exercise our own options.  Will the delegates comment on these matters?</p></speech>

I am aware of research within some countries which indicates that the rate of unintended pregnancies and abortion is higher among minority and disadvantaged women, or women whose access to contraceptive, family planning and reproductive health services might be compromised.  It is possible these inequities are more pronounced in some countries than in others.  It is also possible the proportion of women who face these barriers or who are disadvantaged in some way is higher in some of these countries than in others.  I am uncomfortable in even going there because I am speaking a little beyond the evidence.  I am starting with evidence and speculating based on it.  Otherwise, I do not know that I can explain well or find evidence to explain the differentials.</p> <p>  I take the point about Germany.  These are broad categories with respect to abortion laws in various countries.  On the whole, Germany is classified as allowing abortion on broad grounds, as is the United States.  In some countries, including these two, restrictions are enacted, including counselling requirements, waiting periods, etc., which allow for cause degradation across countries in which abortion is allowed on broad grounds with respect to ease of access to legal abortion.  However, I take the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

There is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, for example, which makes a comment in that regard.  The EU Charter on Fundamental Rights also makes a comment.  Does Ms Hoctor wish to comment on either of these?  If we are to be even-handed in our debate, we must ask about the human rights of the woman and those of the child.</p></speech>

They do not apply before birth and only begin once a person is born.  That is the starting point for international human rights law.  It is very clear from the jurisprudence of all of the adjudicative bodies that oversee implementation of the treaties that they are of the view that women's human rights are violated or undermined when they are not able to access abortion care safely and legally.  That is the legal approach to human rights in this matter.</p> <p>  I will also address the Deputy's original point about abortion to save the life of a woman.  It is very important to understand almost all abortions - perhaps 90% or more - in European countries occur in the first trimester of pregnancy.  That is a critical fact to keep in mind.  There may be cases later in pregnancy in which women face difficult situations and may need to access abortion care and it is very important that they can do so legally.  In Europe the vast majority of abortions take place within the first trimester.</p></speech>

I was a member of the convention on the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.  We spoke for a long time about a reference before coming to the conclusion that everybody had the right to be born.  That is from memory.

The wording in question in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is in a preambular paragraph.  It is not in an article or a provision.  It states the child "by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care ... before as well as after birth".  It is very clear from the drafting negotiations on the treaty that it was agreed by states that this provision did not mean that there was a right to life that would apply prenatally.</p><p>It was agreed that Article 1 of the treaty, enshrining the right to life, would apply from the time of birth and that is in line with the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It may be in a state's interests to take measures to protect prenatal life but human rights standards and jurisprudence have made it very clear that doing so cannot undermine the human rights of women.  It is critical that states take an approach to law and policy around reproductive health care that places women's health and rights at the centre and works out from there.</p><p> I will have to check this but I believe that even the Holy See, in the negotiations of the convention on the rights of the child, understood that the language in the preamble did not prevent states from liberalising and legalising access to abortion care.</p></speech>

They were two women who had obtained diagnoses of fatal foetal impairment and were told by doctors and nurses here that they could not legally end their pregnancies here because of Irish law on abortion, so they travelled to the UK where they were able to access medical terminations.  These women were of the view that they had suffered grievously in different ways and they wanted to work to ensure that other women would not suffer in the same way.  Accordingly, they wanted to take their complaints to the human rights committee and they claimed violations of their human rights, which the committee found.</p></speech>

The United Nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities stated that legalising abortion on disability grounds was a violation of the human rights of people with disabilities under the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.  I travelled with some people to the UN in 2015 and attended the committee.  What comment does Ms Hoctor have to make on that point?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the committee on the rights of people with disabilities has never said that women who received diagnoses of severe fatal foetal impairments should not be allowed legally to access abortion care in their countries, or that a state should prohibit women's access on these grounds.</p> <p>  The committee raised concerns regarding the legislative modality through which a state does that and gave its view that states should not include explicit legal terms in their laws regarding foetal impairment.  The committee has never expressed any concern about a woman being legally allowed to access abortion care and services.  Some countries in Europe, such as Switzerland and Sweden, have a health ground in their law but no explicit ground for access to abortion for foetal impairment.  Germany also has such a ground but in all these countries women obtain legal abortion services when they receive a diagnosis of fatal foetal impairment and the committee on the rights of people with disabilities has never expressed any concern with the laws of these countries.  In fact, along with all the other human rights mechanisms, the committee has stressed how important it is that women can access sexual reproductive health care, including access to abortion care.  The committee's concern is around the legislative modality, as opposed to whether women who are suffering due to diagnoses of fatal foetal impairment should be allowed legally to access care.</p></speech>

The committee made a statement on this quite recently, though the presentation was made in 2015.  Two weeks ago, a UN committee also stated that "fatal" and "incompatible with life" were terms that should not be used.</p></speech>

The committee on the rights of disabilities did not state that women should not be allowed to access services when they receive a diagnosis of fatal foetal impairment - it simply raised the question of how the law does that and how the law should enable women to make decisions in the course of a pregnancy with a fatal foetal impairment.  It also discussed whether or not the law should include an explicit term around foetal impairment.</p></speech>

The HSE has issued new guidelines in recent times, discontinuing the use of the terms "fatal foetal" and "incompatible with life" and using softer terminology.  I have brought forward a Private Members' Bill on the issue but the HSE has acquiesced already, with more compassionate and sensitive language on pregnant mothers or couples presented with such diagnoses.  There is a clear conflict with what the committee has stated and the quotations Ms Hoctor has given from the United Nations.  I do not accept her answers and I totally discount her answer to Deputy Durkan's questions to the effect that no life exists before birth.</p></speech>

They included the statistic that the majority of abortions are requested by married women, that more than half of women are between 20 and 29 years old, that most women who have abortions have at least one other child and that most abortions happen by the ninth week.  These are very important scientific statistics that show that there is a lot of myth from those who oppose people's right to abortion in this country.  We stick out like a sore thumb on the map, as an island isolated from the rest of Europe in this area.</p> <p>  Dr. Sedgh said we had no way of knowing exactly what the statistics are for Irish women seeking abortions abroad.  Many Irish women go to Britain but many of them do not give Irish addresses and this is probably also true of Irish women who go to Holland.  We have no way of gathering real statistics around women, abortion and this country.  Dr. Sedgh is not a health professional but she informs health professionals.  Does she, as a scientist, believe that not having absolutely correct and full statistical knowledge of how abortion impacts on Irish women is not a good thing for the health of Irish women?  Does she believe that it is not good from the point of view of getting a full picture of the full reproductive health of Irish women or for informing ourselves as legislators?</p><p>As a scientist, does Dr. Sedgh believe it is unhealthy not to have knowledge of the full statistics?</p><p> I have questions for Ms Hoctor about the availability of abortion services.  She talked about the stress and distress caused in having to leave one's country to have an abortion elsewhere, regardless of the reasons involved.  As the doctor showed, there is a huge variety of reasons women seek to terminate a pregnancy.  Having to leave one's country and suffer distress is a big issue when it comes to where Ireland falls down in protecting women's rights and, therefore, compensating them.  Can Ms Hoctor add to that aspect?  Importantly, statistics here prove that socioeconomic reasons are another huge factor for women.  In other words, if one is poor or does not have the financial resources required, one will often, as the doctor said, be subject to procuring an abortion much later rather than as early as possible in the pregnancy.  One is also put under much more stress and strain by having to get onto an aeroplane or a ferry and stay overnight in accommodation.  On top of this, one cannot take one's partner or pal along because that would cause further stress and financial strain.  Does Ms Hoctor think the socioeconomic reasons we are considering in women seeking to have an abortion are a big element in terms of the countries that allow women to access abortion services?</p></speech>

Before I discuss what we do not know and how useful it would be to know more, I acknowledge that for the women who travel to Britain for an abortion and admit that they are from Ireland, we have statistics for their ages and the gestational age at which they have an abortion.  A very small share are obtained by adolescents and they are mostly performed within the first 13 weeks.  I work in an organisation the mission of which is to conduct policy-relevant research and to support evidence-based policies.  From that perspective, yes, it is unfortunate that we do not have direct evidence within Ireland on the reasons Irish women have an abortion, the numbers of Irish women who have an abortion and the circumstances in which they have them. </p> <p>  I have mentioned that Ireland seems to be an anomaly with respect to the proportion of abortions that are unsafe.  We do not know how many of the clandestine abortions are performed by a trained person.  Even among those who have an abortion that is medically safe, we do not know what proportion of women who have an abortion experience stress related to the stigma they experience having had an abortion or the stigma they are afraid they will experience.  I have mentioned a review of 14 papers that comment on the pervasiveness of that experience among women who have had an abortion.  In the absence of this evidence directly from Ireland, I hope evidence from other countries in the region and the developed world can help us to get a sense of the circumstances experienced in Ireland.  To the extent that the Deputy's question is also a comment, I appreciate her comment that we need evidence to inform policies both here and throughout the world.</p></speech>

It was a component part of the cruel and inhuman treatment the committee found she had suffered.  It was also a component part of the finding of the committee of inequality before the law that she faced discrimination because of her socioeconomic status.</p> <p>  I refer the committee - I do not have the exact page number - to the World Health Organization's guidelines on safe and legal abortion.  The WHO also specifies very clearly that one of the results of restrictive abortion laws is the creation of social inequalities.</p></speech>

I do not expect Ms Hoctor to comment on specifics, but she may be aware, for example, that in recent weeks the Care Quality Commission in the United Kingdom brought to light information that Marie Stopes International gave bonuses to its staff members for convincing women to go through with an abortion, even in situations where they had decided not to go through with it.  That is appalling behaviour in the name of choice.  I assume that Ms Hoctor is aware of some horrifying stories from the United States, but I will not go into graphic detail.  As a multi-million dollar organisation that campaigns on the issue, has the center ever commented on cases such as the one I have cited involving Marie Stopes International or is the abortion industry always given a free pass?</p></speech>

It is important for me to clarify that it is a legal advocacy organisation which uses the law to advance women's reproductive health and rights which include access to safe and legal abortion care, quality maternal care for women who are in labour and access to affordable contraception services.  We also work to prevent child marriage and forced sterilisation.</p></speech>

It is critical to understand all western European countries have highly effective regulatory bodies in place that oversee and monitor the provision of health care, including reproductive health care and abortion services.  Also, if there are allegations of or concerns about malpractice or inappropriate service provision, the relevant regulatory body should investigate.  That is what the regulatory body in the United Kingdom is engaged in, which is an appropriate response.  That is why there are such bodies.</p></speech>

Today again validates the process we are going through.  We are here to listen to facts and evidence.  I do not think anyone can question that we are receiving an awful lot of good information, hard evidence and facts here today.  I welcome that.  Frankly, all my questions have been answered apart from one, which I will highlight.  With regard to the sixth slide of Dr. Sedgh's presentation, some people will find it fascinating, although I was not surprised, that in the countries where abortion is prohibited, 37 out of 1,000 women have abortions while in the countries where abortion is available on request, that number is 34.  In other words, there is a lower level of abortion where it is legally available.  That might come as a surprise to some members of the committee.  I know Dr. Sedgh has touched on this point already, but will she elucidate why abortion rates are lower in countries where it is available as against countries where it is prohibited?</p></speech>

The statisticians on our team would say that I was remiss if I did not point out that there is no statistically significant difference in the abortion rate of countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with liberal abortion laws because of the margins of error.  Having said that, the Senator is correct.  The point estimate is such that the abortion rate is actually lower on average in countries in which it is allowed on request.  It is probably worth reinforcing what seems to be behind what we are seeing.  First of all, in countries in which abortion is allowed without restriction as to reason we see some of the lowest abortion rates on record and also some of the highest rates on record.  Those are the countries in eastern Europe and the average rate comes out to approximately 34.  What differentiates the countries with high abortion rates from those with low abortion rates is not the legal status of abortion in those countries, but the level of unmet need for contraception or the proportion of women who wish to avoid getting pregnant and are not using a method of contraception.  We would see a completely different chart if, along the bottom axis, one was looking at the level of unmet need for contraception.  One would see very different abortion rates in those groups of countries.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

One other point occurred to me.  Dr. Sedgh or Ms Hoctor pointed out, rightly, earlier that there was quite an unusual situation in the Soviet Union and the other eastern countries, and that is why we have seen this dramatic reduction in the abortion rates.  Allowing for that and assuming the rate continues to drop, the differential between lower rates of abortion will actually be larger between countries with freely available abortion and those where it is prohibited.  Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>

I apologise if I am repeating anything which was asked recently, I was in the Chamber for another matter.  Is there any other country in Europe where there is this constant argument or discussion about the life of the live mother, who is walking around pregnant, being given equal weighting to the life of the unborn child?  It seems to be a constant discussion in this country.  Have other countries dealt with the same issue and, if so, how did they get through it?</p> <p>  On the ninth week of pregnancy, is Dr. Sedgh counting from conception, implantation or date of last period?  Will she clarify that?  When we look at the hard copy of Ms Hoctor's presentation, particularly the slide on time limits for unrestricted access, do all these countries use the same standard?  Do they use either conception point or date of last period?  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that.  I have noted from some of the documentation that perhaps we are comparing apples and oranges in some cases.  For this chart to be truly, factually correct for the committee, the starting point needs to be the same.  We do not want the committee to fall out over the number of weeks.  If we are doing this, we want to do it correctly.</p></speech>

The practice across Europe differs significantly in respect of the starting point.</p></speech>

Therefore it might be that a ten week limit is actually an eight week limit.  It is more likely that abortions are happening at an even earlier gestation than is shown in these charts.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to the committee to know if one country's limit is 12 weeks, but that it is actually ten.  Will the witnesses comment on the balancing of the rights of the woman walking around pregnant and the unborn child?  How have other countries dealt with that?</p></speech>

Andorra, Malta and San Marino, which are very small countries on the map, have highly restrictive abortion laws and do not allow abortion at all or only to protect a woman's life.  Of those, I believe only Andorra has any form of constitutional provision on the question but it does not equate the right to life of a woman with the right to life prior to birth.  It just speaks about recognising the right to life and protecting it in its different phases.  There is no equation of the rights.  My understanding is that the Phillipines may be the only country in the world to have a similar provision to the Irish Constitution.  Again, we would have to check this and come back to the Deputy.  I believe that provision was adopted after the provision in the Irish Constitution was.</p></speech>

I will ask the question anyway.  There has been a lot of talk around equating the right to life of the mother to that of the unborn child.  I think we sometimes get away from what is in the best interests of women's health.  That is what the committee should be looking at in my opinion.  If we were to start with what is in the best interests of women's health and women's health care, in Ms Hoctor's expert opinion would it be fair to say that standards of women's health care are better in countries where there is a more liberal regime in respect of terminations than in countries where there is a very restrictive regime?  Would that be a fair assessment in Ms Hoctor's expert opinion?</p></speech>

As a general rule, countries that allow abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic grounds, which are mainly countries in Europe or other OECD countries, do not see high rates of unsafe abortion or of maternal mortality.  In countries where there are highly restrictive laws and which do not take a women-centred approach to law-making around reproductive health and abortion, which are largely countries outside of Europe, there are often much higher rates of unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity.</p></speech>

I know that in recent years she has severed her links officially with the International Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF, but I think I am right in saying she has a long historical link with that group, which is one of the largest abortion providers in the world.  I note that, in her presentation, she talks a lot of facts and figures but she does not talk about how many people have been saved by the eighth amendment.  My question to her is this: does she think anyone has been saved by the eighth amendment?</p></speech>

That is on our website, the information is available and I am happy to make it available here.  When the institute was founded in 1968, we were housed in the corporate structure of PPFA.  In 1977 we became an independent organisation with an independent board of directors and our affiliation with PPFA was eventually dissolved.</p> <p>  I am familiar with estimates or assumptions about how many abortions have been averted by virtue of restrictive abortion law in Ireland.  I think the assumptions on which those numbers are based are dubious.  I could get into that if one wanted me to.</p></speech>

The position of the institute is that there are a lot of perspectives on when life begins and that women's reproductive health is best ensured when women are able to make decisions regarding their reproductive lives and reproductive health in consultation with their partners, with their faith leaders and with their health care providers.  That is the position of the institute and I think that is what the Deputy is asking me.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Dr. Ruth Fletcher, senior lecturer in medical law, Queen Mary University in London.  Is Dr. Fletcher aware of the laws around privilege and qualified privilege the reference to which I read earlier?  Although I have no difficulty in doing so, is she happy for me not to read through it again?</p></speech>

I thank the members of the committee for the invitation.  It is a great pleasure to be able to draw on the research and teaching I have been doing in the area of medical law to think practically about how we might build on the insights of the Citizens' Assembly and how we can practically translate that into legislation.</p> <p>  I thought in this presentation I would select some key points from the submission I made.  Before I get to focusing on how we might translate the Citizens' Assembly recommendations in regard to both on-request models and criteria for access in the later stages of pregnancy, there are two framing issues on which I wish to focus.</p> <p>  The first is in regard to the trend towards decriminalisation and the significance of decriminalisation.  That that is an option open to the committee members in order to progress the framework within which the Citizens' Assembly recommendations might take effect.  Basically, as I am sure the committee will be aware, decriminalisation of abortion is part of an international trend.  Even though there are significant criminal prohibitions in many different countries, we are seeing a trend towards taking the criminal law out of the regulation of reproductive health care, in particular, abortion, partly because it is about having the right tool for the job.  In a sense, criminal law is not the right regulatory tool for regulating reproductive health care and the main argument around decriminalisation of abortion health care at present is about taking the punitive aspect of law out of the regulatory tool box that is available for different kinds of abortion care.</p> <p>  One key reason people find it persuasive to take that punishment element out of the regulation of abortion care is because it is having a chilling effect on professionals providing quality abortion care and health care, and because it stigmatise this kind of reproductive health care and because it has an impact in the sense that we have seen individual prosecutions and there is fear and stigma then attached to that for individual users of abortion care.  However, it is important to remember that taking the criminal law out of the regulation of abortion care and reproductive health care, that is decriminalising, is not about deregulation or full legalisation.  Decriminalisation is about, as I say, removing the punitive element but there are still many other legal tools available to ensure that good practice is promoted and that poor practice is held to account.  That would be the function of the civil law, for example, in regard to the tort of negligence, and it would also be the function of professional regulation.  In medical law, we have other legal tools available to hold good practice to account and to promote that good practice.  Criminal law does not need to do it.</p> <p>  The second key point is that decriminalising does not necessarily mean one is fully legalising something.  One can still adopt criteria that make certain kinds of abortion care lawful and unlawful.  It is merely that one might use other sorts of public tools, such as incentive measures and funding measures, and even information, in order to monitor that boundary between what is lawful and what is unlawful.  That is the first key framing issue that we might want to think about a bit more that might help implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  The second is the guarantee of access that I have proposed in the third part of provisions that might implement the Citizens' Assembly objectives.  That is about making clear that there is a public responsibility to provide abortion care to the highest attainable standards.  One has two framing measures with regard to the statutory provisions in a possible Bill that would implement the Citizens' Assembly, namely, decriminalisation, and a positive guarantee of access to make sure that it is the Minister for Health - the public system - which is responsible for ensuring access and for implementing principles around non-discrimination.</p><p>Not only does it seek to make sure there is a level of public responsibility for delivery of a quality service but it also attempts to redress the previous situation in the sense that we know that the negative effect of abortion restriction has been most keenly felt by those who are most disadvantaged, so we can address that by making a guarantee of access as clear as possible.  Those are the two framing points on which I would be delighted to take questions and comments.</p><p> I will now focus on what I am recommending in terms of the actual grounds themselves and what might be the best and clearest way to implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  The first is on language that might implement the on-request model.  There are three main reasons parliaments and people have found on-request models persuasive.  Two of them are related to women-centred arguments but one is related to a more foetal life-centred argument.  On-request models have received public support because they take women's wishes seriously and that is one of the key reasons.  A second key reason is because they make it easier.  By that I mean there is less obstruction or less harm for the particularly vulnerable cases.  Making abortion available on request means that the barriers and scrutiny that might come with particular pathways for rape victims or women who have serious health conditions are reduced in terms of facilitating access for that vulnerable group of women seeking abortion.</p><p> The third reason is because on-request models, as committee members have heard, tend to have the impact that abortions are more likely to be availed of at an earlier stage.  There is a way, therefore, in which, in effect, if one takes the view that foetal life develops more value in a gradual way over time and if one does not have an absolutist value on foetal life, and many people think foetal life deserves some respect but just does not deserve the same kind of legal recognition women's lives do, there are ways in which many different legal regimes have recognised that foetal, prenatal, life deserves some sort of respect.  On-request models can deliver on that to some extent in the sense that they make it more likely that abortion would be earlier rather than later.  The effect of them is also to speak to people's concerns that prenatal life should have some respect but just not in the same way that women's lives would have.</p><p> The other issues to think about in relation to abortion on request, and I have recommended that we follow the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, is by providing that a person who is not more than 12 weeks pregnant may access abortion on request and without the need to demonstrate indications other than her own wishes.  Again, the woman's wishes would be the main criteria for accessing an abortion on an on-request ground.  One thing to think about in relation to that is that it might be possible, given what the Citizens' Assembly recommended, and given the recommendations based on the World Health Organization guidelines and the kind of variety the committee has been looking at in the earlier sessions, to extend that period from 12 weeks up until something more like 22 weeks, which 44% of the Citizens' Assembly recommended.</p><p> The final point is in relation to how to translate the types of recommendations that speak to making access available later in a pregnancy for especially vulnerable groups.  What I have recommended in relation to that is that we have a ground which would allow a person who is between 12 and 22 weeks pregnant, for example, to access an abortion where an appropriately qualified medical practitioner determines that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances and then in making that determination the practitioner shall have regard to the pregnant person's own wishes, feelings and thoughts on her current and future circumstances.  There is a way of making sure that the pregnant woman's concerns are part of that process but where one still has an approval process for later terminations.  An appropriately qualified medical practitioner could include nurses and midwives, for example.  We could expand the provision and enhance a local service in that regard.</p><p> For pregnancies that are of longer duration than 22 weeks, where the Citizens' Assembly wanted access at that point to be still available where there was risk to the person's life or a risk to health or in cases of fatal foetal anomaly, the idea would be that the appropriately qualified medical practitioner could consult a second appropriately qualified practitioner but that one would make it available on the legal pathway of a risk to a pregnant person's life or health.  There is a difference between the reasons people have, in particular in vulnerable situations, in terms of serious risks to health, rape or carrying a pregnancy with a serious anomaly.  Those are the reasons particularly vulnerable people might have for wanting access to abortion later in pregnancy but we do not necessarily have to use that language in the law.  The language we use in the law can be a more open ground such as risk to health or life.  In that way one removes the ways in which criteria such as rape grounds, anomaly grounds or a finding of serious risk can be an obstruction and instead one puts the details around what circumstances might qualify into the code of practice or into guidelines.  Those are really the main points I wanted to emphasise in relation to the submission.  I look forward to discussing them in more detail.</p></speech>

There is an objective value in that life in that it has potentiality to go on and become a person and because we as human beings invest in the significance of that life and the work of reproduction is an important social role.  Therefore, yes, I do think it has value but I do not think we need to translate that value into positive rights in the same way-----</p></speech>

I was struck by her rationale when speaking about on-request abortion.  I do not know whether this is her view but she appeared to cite the view with approval.  It struck me that there was something Sir Humphrey-like about the idea that an on-request basis for abortion in some way offers some respect to the unborn because it might be argued in certain cases, but I do not think the difference is that stark, that people might have abortions earlier if it is available on request.  Given that the death of the child is what results, it does not seem like an awful lot of respect for the unborn.  It is a fairly tortured sop to the unborn.  Is Dr. Fletcher not engaging in a kind of strategic argument that there is something here that she can call in some way pro-life by making abortion on demand?</p></speech>

I am trying to deliver on what is a complex range of people's wishes that are not black and white in terms of the relationship of reproduction in which a pregnant woman and a foetus are involved.  I accept that people who are against all abortions would not accept that rationale.</p></speech>

Dr. Rhona Mahony said at the time that obstetricians are not in the business of killing foetuses and so on.  Is it not the case that Dr. Fletcher and others with whom she works within a legal group, through her activism and the production of draft legislation, are proposing a radical departure from any notion that there could ever be a reason for delaying an abortion?</p></speech>

Decriminalisation is one good tool that would take the punishment element away, but there would need to be some clarity about the terms on which an abortion service is provided.  Given the history of having outsourced provision, there is not an institutional history of developing the service.  The transition from a situation in this country where abortion care has not been integrated into the provision will require positive legislation to guide the terms on which the service would be provided.  Decriminalisation is an important tool that would help to deliver that service, but not the only necessary tool.</p></speech>

That type of language is meant to work in tandem with scientific developments and allow for a review of public regulation of the service in order that it can accommodate scientific developments such as the development of the abortion Bill, for instance, but also low-tech developments.  A particular trend we are seeing internationally in medicine and science technology, one which the committee does not seem to have picked up on in a significant way, is the increasing involvement of nurses and midwives in the delivery of care, because such involvement helps to deliver a quality local service.  There are both low-tech and high-tech ways in which the guarantee of access can seek to maximise the capacity of the law and regulation to respond well to scientific developments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#V01600"><p>There are a variety of positions.  As I am not a comparative lawyer, I am somewhat straining my expertise in responding to this question.  Certainly in medical law we do see different ways employed by which a kind of constitutional value of prenatal life is devised which is not, however, equivalent to the value accorded to persons eligible for full rights-bearing protection.  In Spain, for example, the statutory language refers to the desire to respect prenatal life but states that the best way to achieve that is by providing quality reproductive health care and positive guarantees around maternity.  The respect for foetal life is channelled in particular ways.  We see these attempts at characterising a value in prenatal life because, as I said, people invest in and care for that life and because it is seen as having a symbolic and potential value for the future.  Those ethical concerns get translated into this type of category of a legal or constitutional value that is lesser in weight than that of a full rights-bearing person.</p></speech>

It could be very helpful to the Department of Health, which is currently looking at drafting legislation.</p> <p>  The point regarding objective value versus societal value is a very interesting one.  Will Dr. Fletcher expand on it?  There is a great deal of confusion as to how societal value lines up against the human rights of an actual individual in the world, experiencing life, with family, friends and a job.  The societal value placed on foetal life is very different from that and it is a distinction worth examining.</p> <p>  Dr. Fletcher noted that our work presents a good opportunity to learn from the implementation and operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  From a medical law perspective, what does she consider the most important lessons to be learned from that legislation?</p> <p>  The witness mentioned that accommodation will have to be made for conscientious objection in abortion services provision.  How best can we create a legislative model that includes such accommodation, and is there a country we might look to in so doing?</p> <p>  Dr. Fletcher made an interesting point around abortion access on foetal anomaly grounds and rape grounds and including them under a different category or classification, which would be risk to health.  Why does she consider that classification superior to creating one or more specific grounds or categories in themselves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#V01800"><p>On the question of societal value versus objective value in respect of foetal life, we must bear in mind that law is a complex toolbox and there are different ways in which we can respond to the fact there are pluralities in society and people have very different views, but those views are not black and white.  The law can work in a way that is layered and complicated in attempting to respond to the different interests people have.</p><p> This development of a recognising of a value in foetal life is an effort to respond to that plurality but also to say that there are things we want to do such as provide good maternity care, miscarriage care and education around reproductive health and sexual health.  There are things we can do which have an impact on the value of reproduction and the contribution which reproduction makes.  It is a kind of public value and societal value in the reproductive contributions that are made.  Within that model, prenatal life has some weight.  However, as it does not meet the same criteria or have the same social history or social relationships as born, living, feeling, thinking women, it is not the same weight and would always be subject to the protection of the full human rights of pregnant people.  However, there is still a way we can try to promote that public interest in doing the best we can in terms of the provision of reproductive health care.  That is one of the reasons on-request models have found support not just among pro-choice constituencies in other jurisdictions but among constituencies where people are perhaps not against abortion entirely but they have concerns about it.  Those concerns can be addressed by saying that the effect of an on-request model will make it easier for pregnant people to access abortion at earlier stages, and the views of those who adopt a kind of gradualist model of pregnancy can be accommodated in that way.</p><p> The point about learning from the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is an important one.  Medical law would normally have audit, research and reflection into legal processes and it would be a good idea to build that into our statutory processes in this area, as in any area of law.  In some areas it happens more than others.  We have seen with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act some non-delivery of abortion care that seemed to meet legal grounds, for instance, the cases of Ms Y and the woman who was detained under the Mental Health Act.  There is definitely lessons to be learned there.  Even though formal legal grounds can be created for accessing abortion and making it lawful, the interpretation of those grounds needs to be guided by professional regulation and perhaps a code of practice to ensure that they are implemented fully.  Those are the main areas.  We can learn from what did not work as well as was expected with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  Life exceptionalism - the right to life-saving abortion - can be interpreted in a more positive and human rights-respecting way to enhance the dignity of the woman whose life is threatened, for example.  We see that in some Latin American countries but it does not seem to have happened in this case.  That is therefore an interesting lesson to learn.</p><p> In terms of conscientious objection, my recommendation would be to recognise conscientious refusal to provide abortion care.  That is out of an interest in recognising plural opinions and wanting to build a system in which there is public trust.  It is not good for pregnant people accessing services if they are coming up against people who do not want to provide the care to them.  There are good reasons to have a protection of conscientious refusal to provide abortion care but it has to be implemented in a way that respects the rights of the pregnant woman.  There has to be a referral, for example, and it has to come under the guarantee of access in the sense that she has to get a safe and timely service, even though there is that particular conscientious refusal.  It also has to be clear that it does not apply to institutions, for example, as that would be contradictory.  It is supposed to protect individuals.  If an institution is protected, individuals in an institution do not get their right to differentiate from the institution.</p><p> In terms of thinking about different ways in which we could implement access when pregnant women need it at later stages of pregnancy on grounds of rape or foetal anomaly, if we use the term "rape" or a diagnosis of "foetal anomaly" in the law specifically as the reason, it generates problems, as the committee has been hearing.  Let me tackle the rape one first.  We do not need to have the rape ground specifically in the legislation.  It can be the set of circumstances which generate the risk to the woman's health.  It is a set of circumstances that generate the qualification on the legal ground.  That is a typical way of addressing the issue.  Then we do not have the sort of problems around requiring women to engage with the criminal justice system when they are not ready to or the proof problems the committee has been hearing about.</p><p> On foetal anomaly, we are trying to think about what is the best way of achieving legal criteria to implement the Citizens' Assembly's objectives.  In a sense, often we have conflicting objectives.  Here we are trying to avoid a stigmatisation around disability or vulnerability, for example.  People have concerns that we stigmatise disability or vulnerability if we specify "foetal anomaly" in legislation .  The idea is to avoid the legal stigmatisation by recognising that those are circumstances which can generate a risk to health and the ground is one that is focused on the woman or pregnant person rather than one that is focused on the anomaly of the foetus.  Again, a code of practice would be used to make that clear.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Naughton's line of questioning, if nothing else but decriminalisation happens, how does Dr. Fletcher see the situation developing?  Would it be legislation to protect the medical sector?  Alternatively, would it be left entirely to the medical sector?  Would that be wise given the litigious nature of our society nowadays?</p> <p>  Abortion on-request with space for ongoing counselling has been raised and provision appears to be urgently needed in respect of counselling.  Some countries have it and some countries do not.  One of the things adduced at this committee in the past couple of weeks was that in some situations the pregnant woman changes her mind during the course of the pregnancy.  How does one determine at which stage in the pregnancy it is correct to proceed in a particular fashion and to go for termination or not to go for termination given her natural tendency to change her mind in the course of the pregnancy?</p></speech>

As with any medical procedure, people often need a chance to deliberate and think about their options.  The question does not point to any concerns that apply specifically to abortion care.  I guess it is a question around consent and when a decision has been made about a particular health care treatment.  If the person has not had the treatment, he or she can withdraw the consent or change his or her mind at any point.</p><p>That is a normal part of engaging in health care options.  The whole point of consent in health care is that one has the right to change one's mind.  It is part of the deliberation counselling process and this deliberative process is supported by counselling and good information.  Once the pregnant person comes to the point of making a decision and going ahead with the treatment, that is the key point at which the consent operates.</p></speech>

I emphasise the need for counselling and professional support for women who have a crisis pregnancy.  A considerable percentage - 46% - of people who had an abortion had concerns afterwards, ranging from feelings of being alone to being isolated, feeling lost and sad, etc.</p></speech>

These are complex experiences and varied emotional responses are not a reflection on the decision to have a termination of pregnancy.  We have to differentiate between changing one's mind on the decision and having regrets about other things.  It is about how we address the small number of cases where people might have-----</p></speech>

In Germany that advice is available more readily than in any other country, including those where abortion is available on demand.  The responses include feeling relieved, satisfied, happy, pleased, guilty and sad.  A total of 10% said they felt confident and almost 10% were empowered but there were also feelings of loss.  There is a considerable proportion of people in that category when one adds them all up.</p></speech>

This means we need good quality counselling services and support measures and there is, through the HSE, public funding of counselling and support, both pre and post abortion care.  This can be built on as the abortion care service develops.  There are different regulatory tools for different purposes and public funding of counselling and information would address the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

I read his document on prenatal counselling but we have been deprived of the opportunity to ask questions of people who have a different view and it is extremely unfortunate, particularly in the context of what Dr. Fletcher said.</p> <p>  I reiterate what Senator Ruane said as to the usefulness of giving us advice on how the State might proceed if there was a referendum, either to amend or repeal the eighth amendment, because we do not yet know what the wording is going to be.  Dr. Fletcher suggested we should proceed on the basis of a new piece of legislation rather than trying to amend previous legislation.  Can she expand a little on that?</p></speech>

It might be simpler to repeal it in its entirety and replace it with a new Act and this would satisfy the basic objective of simplifying the statutory structure.  A second reason is that the transition from a legal regime which has taken an exceptional approach to abortion care - in that it is only available when the life of a woman is at risk - to a system which allows abortion on request, to some extent, is a major one.  They are two very different regimes so the transition would be better marked by adopting an Act that did not have limitations relating to life-saving exceptionalism as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act has.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

There were two elements to it.  Undoubtedly, a change to the Constitution was envisaged by the assembly.  I hope that it will be a straightforward repeal, although that decision has yet to be made, even by this committee.  The second phase related to legislation and it cannot predate the referendum.  The assembly identified a number of issues, for example, rape and incest, which we have discussed in the committee, that are incredibly difficult to incorporate into law.  The on-request provision would take care of some of that up to the first trimester, for example.  However, incorporating it afterwards means it could be provided for if there are other sets of circumstances.  What are the other circumstances one would have to provide for specifically to cater for that?</p></speech>

The circumstances where somebody is pregnant through rape and is distressed and vulnerable and does not want to continue that pregnancy clearly can constitute a risk to her psychological health.  It is to continue the pregnancy against her will in circumstances where she is pregnant through a violation in that way.  There are different circumstances.  That set of circumstances relating to her experience of pregnancy through rape can constitute the risk to health.  That would be the legal ground specified in the legislation.  The rape circumstance is the risk to health legal ground in statute.  Then there would be a code of practice or regulation to join the pathway between the two.</p></speech>

Is that something one can adjudicate on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#Y00700"><p>This is why I did not use the word "serious".  We have a history of the term "real and substantial" operating as a barrier.  To the same point, if one adds something such as "serious" into a ground like risk to health, that could potentially become an obstruction or barrier in respect of what counts as serious.  The empirical research on pregnant people's reasons for abortion at later stages tells us that they have very serious reasons, by and large.  We do not have an evidence base that would suggest a need for requiring that seriousness in statutory language.  It is there already in the practice of abortion seeking.  That is one reason we do not need it.  The more negative reason is that it can operate as a restriction or barrier in some instances.  If we want to move towards a policy and practice which is led by removal of barriers which might have an impact on the health and human rights of pregnant people we should avoid qualifying language such as "serious".</p></speech>

A number of questions have been asked already but I wish to raise a few matters.  The witness has given a good insight into how some or all of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations might be recommended.  We can probably take it as a given that even if we did not implement some of them, new legislation will require that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act will have to go.  I wish to explore the decriminalisation issue.  That is the only legislation on the Statute Book at present that criminalises abortion outside the narrow circumstances where there is a danger to a woman's life.  It would be necessary to remove that legislation, therefore it is not legal or illegal.  It is just there.  The regulation of the abortion pill would be through normal health regulation of products in a pharmacy or how all of that is regulated for and administered by one's pharmacist, nurse, midwife or whatever.  It is a little like the morning after pill.  It would be part of the health service, not with conditions laid down in law.  It is just a medical product that is licensed in Ireland.  Could that be done in the context of getting rid of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act post-repeal?</p></speech>

One of the options would be to repeal the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and to integrate abortion care into existing regulation.  There is much to be said for that.  Given that it is a big transition and that it will have an impact on the professional delivery of care, a statute would lay out things such as the guarantee of access.  We are used to thinking of legislation as being restrictive but we could switch and think about legislation that can be promotional of good practice.  That would be the reason a statute might be a good thing to replace that Act, to make it clear that it is a reproductive health statute, to decriminalise and to promote public provision.</p></speech>

We have a great deal of evidence, and we know ourselves, that nobody wants women or practitioners being criminalised for this.  Access is a key issue.  It has been a thread today.  Even for people who might have reservations and who would say they are not in favour of unlimited access to abortion, the best way of guaranteeing access is through early availability for the first trimester.  Perhaps the witness would elaborate on that point.  I believe Senator Mullen was a little unfair to her earlier in the comments about her point, which was, in effect, that this would respect the view of some citizens on prenatal life.  My interpretation of what the witness meant, although I might be wrong, was that people would view access to abortion on request up to 12 weeks as dealing with what at that stage, as anybody who has had a miscarriage knows, is like a heavy period.  It is a little blood clotting and perhaps a little cramping.  It is not the same as a fully grown woman.  People recognise that there is a difference between that up to the first trimester and a foetus on the point of viability.  By distinguishing in that way and making abortion available on request in the early term one is accommodating that.  Perhaps the witness would expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#Y01300"><p>Absolutely.  There are probably two key points in respect of thinking about how on request models can accommodate different people's beliefs around the value of prenatal life.  One would be where people have a type of gradualist approach, that in the early stages it is not as significant in value as it might be in the later stages.  Adopting an on request model because it makes it more likely that people would access abortion at earlier stages means, in effect, one is achieving that goal of gradualist protection.  Another point is that the lack of access in the prohibition does not have the effect of stopping abortions, so one is not achieving protection of prenatal life when one prohibits it in that way.</p><p>The two work as either side of a coin.  People who do not take a gradualist perspective, whose perspective may be about the symbolic or potential value of foetal life and it would not necessarily vary for them but again it would have less weight than the sentient woman, will be accommodated by a system which balances the different interests at issue by allowing earlier access and fewer obstacles to access in the earlier stages.  I would encourage the committee to think about whether they want to stick with the 12 week limitation, given the variety that is available in other jurisdictions and given the size of the vote in the Citizens' Assembly, which was 44% in favour versus 48% against.  If the Citizens' Assembly got to the point of thinking about how to remove barriers to access and thinking about how to apply an on-request model in various ways, with 44% supporting abortion until 22 weeks, that is a lesson for us in terms of the impact of evidence and public education on support for those models.</p></speech>

I hope to be able to answer any questions which members might like to ask by bringing the benefit of my experience and expertise, and my knowledge of the research in the field of pregnancy and mental health and illness.  I have worked as a consultant perinatal psychiatrist at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street for the past 21 years where more than 500 women attend the clinic each year.  Women are seen who are pregnant or who are in the first six months post pregnancy, which includes pregnancy loss, and where a significant mental health issue is involved.  Women attending may have a previous mental health history or a significant new crisis may develop during or after the pregnancy.  Among those who attend will be many who have suffered a miscarriage.  Others may have had a stillbirth or may have a baby diagnosed with a significant abnormality of varying levels of severity, may have had a previous termination or may be considering a termination.<br/><br/>I have previously spoken as an expert witness at the two Oireachtas hearings which led to the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  I was also invited to speak as an expert witness to the Citizens' Assembly.  I am also an expert assessor for the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK and Ireland.  This involves detailed study of the records of women who have died during pregnancy or in the first year afterwards, as a result of suicide or other mental health causes.<br/><br/>What I can say now after all of these years of working in this area, and from my understanding of relevant research and of history, is that while having a baby is, hopefully, and fortunately for many, one of the most joyful, rewarding and meaningful experiences of their lives, as the committee members all will be aware, it is also unfortunately so often not like this.  The committee members will know this from their own lives, those of their families and friends, and of course, also from listening to many of the stories told here to this committee and to the Citizens' Assembly.  Most of the committee members will have heard of, or personally witnessed, stories of depression or distress, of unwanted pregnancies, of rape, or the discovery of major foetal abnormalities, or of the termination of pregnancies in the UK and here in Ireland.  These are stories heard so regularly in my clinic in Holles Street.<br/><br/>In an ideal world, abortion would never be needed or requested, but even if we exclude medical emergencies and severe life threatening indications, we cannot wish abortion away.  It has been a part of the history of every country, including Ireland, and before it became legally available in the UK 50 years ago, and therefore available for thousands of Irish women every year since, it was illegally available here in Ireland for those who could pay.  Of course, there was infanticide, too, which was such a widespread practice.  I would urge anyone who is unaware of the nature and extent of this to read Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Rattigan's seminal history, <i>What Else Could I Do?</i>, a detailed study of hundreds of cases of infanticide in Ireland between 1900 and 1950, or the work of Dr. Elaine Farrell, who studied 4,645 infanticides in Ireland between 1850 and 1900 and published her work, entitled <i>A Most Diabolical Deed</i>.  Dr. Rattigan quoted a judge in County Clare in the 1930s who described the &quot;epidemic of infanticide cases&quot; he had to hear.  Both studies emphasise that these numbers were an underestimate of the true scale of infanticide in Ireland at that time.  We do not want to go back to an era of illegal back street abortions and infanticide.<br/><br/>In my clinical work, of course, most of the women who I see for whom a termination of pregnancy is an issue are seeing me because of their or their partner's concern about their mental health.  Sometimes that termination could potentially be very damaging for them.  For example, a woman who has a planned and much wanted pregnancy, but who develops severe depression which is clearly clouding her judgment about everything in her life, and not just the pregnancy, keeps thinking she should terminate because she would be a bad or evil mother.  She needs expert help for her depression.  A termination is almost certainly not what she wants and could be very damaging to her mental health long term.  For another, however, she is clear that she cannot continue the pregnancy, she cannot cope and continuing the pregnancy would destroy her life.</p><p>She is in no way mentally unwell but she may be terrified of becoming unwell.</p><p> How any woman responds to a pregnancy is personal to her and how she visualises and imagines what is or is not growing inside her is unique.  For example, one woman who has an early miscarriage will say that what she lost was a just pregnancy for her, not a baby, that she knows it happens in 20% of all pregnancies, and it is just nature&rsquo;s way.  It was just like a heavy period.  For another, she may have a huge sense of loss of a baby, name it and grieve for it, even if the scan actually showed a so-called empty sac, or even if she has had a rare molar pregnancy where there was only ever placental tissue and no foetus but her pregnancy tests were repeatedly positive and she may grieve as though it was a baby.</p><p> These sorts of inner perceptions and beliefs and imaginings that determine so much, and often more so than any biological reality.  It is part of what makes us human.  One woman with a baby with a fatal foetal abnormality may decide that she or they want to continue the pregnancy because she wants to hold on to that baby inside her as long as possible, and she hopes that the baby will die inside her and not shortly after, as it is safe and warm inside of her.  Another will feel she cannot bear to think of the baby suffocating inside her or being in pain, or the distress of it dying inside her.  She loves that baby but she will want a termination and she will love it afterwards.  Another woman will say she wants the baby delivered early and hopefully alive still so that she or they will be able to hold the baby for a few minutes before it dies, and may bring the pregnancy on early for that reason.  As doctors we must be aware of the complexities involved for everyone, and listen and not prejudge.</p><p> I now turn to mental health outcomes after induced abortion and the research evidence in this area.  It has been mentioned by members of the committee and some speakers in earlier sessions.  It is important to note that no significant research on this subject has been completed in Ireland.  Research from the UK, the USA and Australia, for instance, may not be applicable here or may only be in a very limited way because it is different here.  There are many other limitations to most of the research in this area, which include researcher bias, inadequate control for confounding variables and inappropriate control groups, and the failure to control for previous mental health problems.  My advice, particularly for those unused to reading medical papers, is to read any such research in a critical, informed and objective way.</p><p> The best overall publication in this area was by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK which published a systematic review of the mental health outcomes of induced abortion in which they reviewed all of the research evidence available and critically analysed all published research which reached basic scientific standards.  The key findings of this overview of all studies were as follows.  An unwanted pregnancy in itself is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems.  The rates of mental health problems in unwanted pregnancies were the same after termination or after giving birth.  The most reliable predictor of post-abortion mental health problems was having mental health problems before the pregnancy or abortion.  Women who were pressurised to have a termination and women who were exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general and to her personal experience were likely to have long-term mental health problems.</p><p> For any and every woman who might seek mental health advice in this situation, it will be the specifics of her individual situation - her distress, history, and personal beliefs and wishes - and often that of her partner which must be listened to and understood. The research evidence is helpful in general but never specific to any individual life situation.  The dilemmas for women in such difficult situations will always be painful and distressing.  I consider it my responsibility as a psychiatrist in Holles Street not to add to their pain and distress.  I hope the committee will be of the same view.</p></speech>

I will start by drawing his attention to his remarks regarding his not wanting to return to an era of illegal back street abortions and infanticide.  Any reasonable person would shudder at the thought of living in such an era.  Would Dr. McCarthy say that a scenario that is as horrific is that in modern Britain where there is an abortion rate which we estimate is four times that of the Irish rate, if we judge by the numbers of Irish women who go abroad?  In that case there is no protection in law for unborn babies up to 24 weeks and no protection where there is any kind of disability, including mild disability.  Does Dr. McCarthy agree that also presents an horrific scenario to a fair-minded, reasonable, caring doctor if they had two patients in mind?</p></speech>

I am also aware, particularly as a psychiatrist, of the history of psychiatry, women who were pregnant, and the control and often the severe things that psychiatry was involved in and responsible for during their pregnancies.  I do not want to go back to anything in history.  In my practice in Holles Street, my responsibility to anyone who comes to me is to make the best decision for them.  When someone comes to see me, I am certainly not there to encourage them to have a termination if, in helping them to come to a decision, that is the worst thing to do.  Those circumstances would have a very negative outcome.  I am equally not there to bring any personal view to her decision.  From my work in the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths, it was evident that so often, when women kill themselves, they do so while pregnant, sometimes with one baby or two, or there is infanticide afterwards.  There is a hierarchy of ideals.  An ideal is where everyone is happy with pregnancy and everything is wonderful.  If I must have a choice between infanticide, back street abortion and abortion in an everyday way, my hierarchy is to go for the least damaging option.  That is a personal view.  My professional responsibility is to deal with the individual woman before me, and maybe her partner, to help her or them come to the decision that is right for her or them.</p></speech>

We will move on as we are stuck for time.  That really is the big problem with our work.  Dr. McCarthy referred to research.  We all agree that good quality research is necessary for normal functioning of the law and we cannot ignore it.  I draw Dr. McCarthy's attention to the work of Professor David Fergusson.  I am sure we agree that he is one of the most highly published mental health professionals globally and that he would not have skin in the game when it comes to coming down on either ideological side.  Professor Fergusson has published a piece in 2013 in the <i>Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry </i>in which he reviewed the four best studies from the place which Dr. McCarthy correctly said is the place to go.  Its conclusion was that there is no available evidence to suggest that abortion has therapeutic effects in reducing mental health risks of unwanted or intended pregnancy.  There is suggestive evidence that abortion may be associated with small to moderate increases in risks of some mental health problems, and there are particular circumstances in which that might arise, such as previous mental health history.  That being the case, does Dr. McCarthy agree that it would be unconscionable that any jurisdiction providing abortion would not be in the business of checking if a woman has a prior mental health history, that it would be under a duty to advise of the potential risks if there was any evidence of mental history, and that should be mandatory practice across the board?</p></speech>

It agrees with the basic assessment point I made, namely, that the mental health outcomes after termination or pregnancy are similar.  In both cases, the risk is increased.  Pregnancy itself is a risk to mental health.  The reason I have a very busy service in the National Maternity Hospital is because of the mental health problems associated with the complications of pregnancy.</p> <p>  If a woman has a termination, she is equally likely to have mental health problems and no less or no more than a woman who does not have a termination and goes on to have a baby.  Both are vulnerable.  It is the single most vulnerable time in a woman's life.  A woman is 19 times more likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the first six weeks after the birth of a baby than in any other six-week period in her life.</p> <p>  There are certain circumstances, in particular in the case of women who have previous serious mental health problems, where women are more vulnerable to having problems whether they have a termination or go on to have a baby.</p></speech>

One of the major challenges in my clinic is that many women come to my service who do not want to have any counselling whatsoever.  First, what is a mental health problem?  Is it stress after an exam when I was 15?  Is it somebody who had anorexia?  Is it somebody who had a major depression after bereavement?  Something may have happened ten or 15 years ago.  Are we going to insist that a person has to talk to a counsellor or expert or psychiatrist in some form?  That would be absolutely impossible.  We know from our work that if somebody wants to have counselling, he or she will get counselling.</p></speech>

Counselling is one thing.  Given that there is at least one life at stake, and potentially two, the gravity involved, the culture of informed consent which applies in other areas of medicine and the duty of care involved, surely it is not excessive to expect a basic investigation to see what type of person is before one?</p> <p>  I refer to a study from Professor Ferguson.  The ground has moved.  In 1994, the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that the risk to psychological health from termination of pregnancy in the first trimester was much less than the risks associated with proceeding with a pregnancy which is clearly harming the mother's mental health.  Professor Ferguson described a big shift from that ground of seeing potential benefits to a situation where nobody is now talking about the mental health benefits of abortion.  Rather, it is case equal.  The only question is whether it causes mental health problems in certain cases.  He is very cautious in his studies.  In 2008, he noted that the specific issue of whether induced abortion has harmful effects on women's mental health remains to be fully resolved.  There is a movement away from seeing any kind of benefit on mental health grounds.</p> <p>  Dr. Ruth Fletcher argued that the concept of health should be used to encompass situations like the claim for abortion on the grounds of foetal anomaly or cases of rape, and that health could be used as a grounds to avoid legal stigmatisation.  She stated such circumstances could contribute to a risk to health.  I presume she was talking about mental health.</p> <p>  The work of Professor Ferguson, which has analysed other work, seems to suggest that one does not go there on mental health grounds.  Would Dr. McCarthy agree?</p></speech>

Men go to prison with their violence.  There is almost an attitude nowadays that no matter what happens in people's lives they need counselling.  It is rubbish to suggest that someone who has been bereaved needs counselling.  Most people, following bereavement, want to be silent or talk to their partner, spouse, mother or friend.  They do not need counselling.  After major trauma there is a notion that people need to be debriefed in some way.  The reality is that often a debriefing does more harm than good.  People who want counselling will seek out a counsellor and talk.  People who do not, but are forced to, will tell a counsellor nothing.  The session will be empty and useless and the person will resent it.  In fact, one may do people more harm by forcing them into a process which demeans them.</p> <p>  The women who come to see me in Holles Street for advice want that advice and, therefore, are very open and tend to bring up all of the key questions.  As the committee knows, it will be a very long time before we have enough psychiatrists in Ireland to see everyone.  I currently have 1.5 days a week in Holles Street and have two colleagues in the other Dublin maternity hospitals.  There are no such specialists anywhere outside of Dublin.  The idea that women would have to undergo counselling is impractical.  More truthfully, the idea that every woman who ever had a mental health problem should have that assessed by a psychiatrist before she can have a termination is an insult to women.</p></speech>

Professor Ferguson said his conclusions have important, if uncomfortable, implications for clinical practice and the law in its interpretation in jurisdictions which require abortion to be authorised on medical grounds.  He went on to state his view was that the growing evidence suggesting that abortion does not have therapeutic benefits cannot be ignored indefinitely and it is unacceptable for clinicians to authorise large numbers of abortions on grounds for which there is currently no scientific evidence.  Does Professor McCarthy agree that there has been a shift away from invoking mental health?</p></speech>

I found it fascinating when I read it yesterday.  I was particularly struck by the history of infanticide in our country.  I was not aware of it and it is another indicator of what a dark place this country was for women for so long.  It is to be hoped we are involved in a process which will move us all to a better place.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I am tempted to repeat one line from his presentation, namely, "We cannot wish abortion away".  Some of us may need to think about that.  He said that fears about the enactment of the 2013 Act would lead to significant numbers of pregnant women trying to fool clinicians into granting abortions by threatening suicide have not been borne out in real life and were never going to be.  Could he speak a little more about that, as a professional in the area?</p></speech>

When I spoke before the Seanad in the sessions that led to the development of that Act, I know people were saying there would be bus loads of such people.  I remember being asked if buses of psychiatrists would be coming in from elsewhere or women would be queuing to come to psychiatrists and lie to us or fool us by saying they are suicidal, etc.  I put it on the line and said it was ludicrous and it would never happen.  In the years since the Act was established, I have seen one woman in Holles Street in that circumstance.</p> <p>  There was the idea that women would somehow invent these stories but the women I see are genuinely distressed, whether they have a termination or keep the baby.  It is a genuine and real problem.  They are in desperation by the time they come to see somebody like me.  There is the phrase, "Sometimes the world is more full of weeping than you can understand", and it might be over my office door because of some of the stories I hear.  The idea that pregnant women would come in to see psychiatrists to fool them into thinking they are suicidal is not how it works in the real world.  It was somebody's fantasy that this would happen.</p></speech>

I see women who come back afterwards as well, and they have a level of distress.  The committee has heard the stories and I do not need to repeat them.  How could any human being react listening to women describing taking the boat rather than the plane and bringing the foetus in a bag?  I will sometimes have seen them before the termination.  They will show love for the foetus and have a photograph of it.  It is a baby they loved but this was the only way for them to deal with the matter.  They are hurt, outraged or upset that they had to go to the UK.</p></speech>

How is the 2013 Act working?  I know this was not part of Dr. McCarthy's presentation but it is relevant for decisions we must make on legislation.  Do the current procedures under the Act provide dignity to patients?  Are they workable across the country?  Do they ensure pregnant women and girls who may need an abortion due to risk of suicide would be able to access the service?  Are they necessitated and could another pathway be considered?</p></speech>

My views on abortion, to a certain extent, do not matter as the women I see who are going to have an abortion are having them anyway.  It is such an irrelevant question for me in my practice.  The women will have it here, buying their tablets on the Internet, or they will travel.  I do not even think about what is happening in the UK except that people have to travel there.  They are losing their babies anyway.  It is happening.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, as he knows there have been very few such cases.  A woman has to see two psychiatrists, who have to agree, and one obstetrician.  If everybody agrees on the case, that is it.  It is a problem and I know cases have been highlighted where things went very poorly.  Some of the psychiatrists who saw patients in those circumstances had never previously dealt with a mental health problem in a pregnant women or seen women in those circumstances.  Some of the decisions made led to court orders and various other processes because those who did the assessment never did the work in a daily way before.  Of course, there is no adequate provision of psychiatry services around the country.</p> <p>  Fortunately, there is a perinatal mental health strategy that is about to come out and it recommends that there should be full-time psychiatrists in every large maternity unit in the country.  It argues there should liaison psychiatry at least part-time in every maternity hospital around the country.  It is coming.  Fortunately, I was right in that the demand was never going to be there; it has amounted to a trickle.  Some of those women have had very faulty assessments as those who saw them had no training in the field.</p></speech>

When I read it I could tell how person-centred it was and I appreciated how human it was as well.  I am sure that translates into how the witness treats women when they come to him.  I got some solace from that in reading the presentation.  Senator Gavan posed the questions I wanted to ask so I will some comments instead.</p> <p>  Senator Mullen upset me when he used the words, "what type of person is before one".  I am not really sure what that meant.  The Senator said in reference to someone arriving and having mental health issues, and whether the person would have had mental health issues before arriving.  The phrase used was "what type of person is before  one".  I do not know the Senator's intent.  I took it to mean that if a person has a mental health issue before coming pregnant, somehow this would undermine the woman's capacity, as a person, to have autonomy and view of life and who she is.  I did not appreciate it.  As a woman and mother who sought help during my second pregnancy from the witness's counterpart in the Rotunda, I found the comment very distressing.  I will stand corrected if the intent was not there but I suggest that the Senator read the debate.  He referred to "what type of person is before one".  She would be the same person and the continuity remains the same.</p> <p>  If caring about women entering an office and women's health in general is ideological, I thank the witness for his ideology.</p></speech>

I thought I was being reasonably clear.  Senator Ruane has responded in a personal way and implied some kind of motivation or attitude in me that certainly is not there.  How can we have a fair process here if, once one has finished trying to respectfully elicit information and answers, one is attacked in a frontal and emotional way by a colleague?  It is making a farce of this procedure.  Anybody listening would know of my bona fides in my line of questioning.  It would be a great regret to me if Senator Ruane was upset but I cannot remember anything I said that would have been objectionable.  I was trying to deal with complex mental health grounds for abortion and people with a history of mental health issues being particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>  First, I clarify there was certainly nothing of bad intent in what I say.  Second, I should not need to make such a clarification.

I found the content of some of what was said quite disrespectful.  I do not intend to get into a row with anybody about it.  In fact, the more people who see it, the more the disrespect is evident.</p><p> With regard to the perinatal mental health strategy, we appreciate that it is to be introduced.  That will require a significant amount of investment and upskilling of personnel.  It is also going to require access right across the country.  We would welcome the fact that it is on its way but what we are discussing is the grounds as laid down by the Citizens' Assembly.  One of those is the mental health of the pregnant woman.  As things stand we are clearly struggling in that area.  It is true to say there is a huge amount of compassion and it is radiating from the evidence we have heard.  That is very much to be welcomed.</p><p> Does Dr. McCarthy agree with me that the added stress and trauma for a pregnant woman in terms of what the 2013 Act places on her is compounded by the lack of resources?  While we are considering the issue around access to termination on the grounds of mental health, we must also consider the resources and the implications for that.  That is going to be important for us.</p><p> We are considering risk.  I have asked this question of every single witness.  I appreciate that I usually get the same answer but it is important that we have it on the record.  My understanding is that it is quite tough for us as legislators using legalistic terminology to hand the medical professionals a piece of paperwork and ask them to make medical decisions based on it.  We use terms such as "grave risk" and "serious risk".  Will Dr. McCarthy indicate whether such terms are in use in the medical profession or is it more likely that there is just risk, that there are not categories such as "grave" and "serious"?  What kind of terminology is used?  I am conscious that what we are doing is trying to devise a legalistic framework, but when that is finished, we hand it to the medical profession.  How easy will it be to translate that?  I am conscious of the 2013 Act and the necessary complications that arise out of that, and the fact that all of the available evidence suggests, as was pointed out by a lot of people in advance of it, that it is fairly unworkable for most people.  We know the result of that.  We use legalistic terms in listing the gradation of the risk.  Is there anything we can do to help to translate that for practical use?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#HH00200"><p>First, I will make a brief response to the first part of what Deputy O'Reilly said, which echoed what Senator Ruane said.  Just because a woman has had a mental health problem in the vast majority of cases, it does not in any way affect her capacity to make decisions for herself.  That is the response to the question on capacity.  In the vast majority of women it is not a question of capacity whatsoever.  I wish to make that point.</p> <p>  As regards the 2013 Act, as I said at the outset, before the legislation was enacted, the reality is that for the vast majority of women who are depressed and suicidal in pregnancy, they do not want a termination.  However, the vast majority of women who want a termination are not depressed.  They do not need to see a psychiatrist.  For the majority of those women who are depressed in pregnancy and want a termination, they are not going to go through an Irish process.  Why would they?  They are going to go to the UK anyway or they are going to order pills over the Internet.  Even if there were psychiatrists all over the country, most of them do not feel they need to see a psychiatrist.  Most of them do not think they need to see one psychiatrist let alone two psychiatrists.  That ill was the result of saying that, whatever about general medical illnesses, in terms of psychiatry it was not going to be about serious risk or moderate risk but about one issue only, and that was the question of suicide, the probability that a woman was going to commit suicide, and if termination was the only possible solution for that, then it followed.  Therefore, it is no wonder that for the vast majority of women in this country it is an irrelevancy.</p> <p>  Suicide at least was at the extreme end.  On the idea that psychiatrists or anybody - psychologists, counsellors or parliamentarians - would discuss the gradations of a woman's mental health, that would be an impossible one for clinicians.  When we are talking about mental health, we can accept a clinician trying to make the best estimate possible over a suicide risk, but bringing it down to an assessment of a woman's mental health, bar excluding the very small group of women who may not have capacity, for the vast majority of women the idea that we could have some system where they all had to go to see a psychiatrist to have a score on their mental health is not going to work.</p></speech>

I am aware of a number of stories where abortion turned out to be a bad decision for the woman involved and where it carried long-term psychological after-effects.  Many personal stories have been told to that effect.  One well-known public story is that of Miss C who was brought to England as a minor for an abortion and then spoke publicly about how much she regretted the abortion.  Sometimes a person thinks they know what is best for the vulnerable person in question but the decision turns out to be wrong.</p> <p>  Does Dr. McCarthy think women considering abortion, in particular those predisposed to mental health issues, should be told about the possible negative consequences of abortion before the procedure takes place?  Am I correct in saying that does not happen at present?</p></speech>

I have seen women who have had long-term mental health problems following abortions.  Every time I think about that, I think of particular individuals.  I have seen huge numbers of women who have had abortions and that has not been the case.</p> <p>  The vast majority of women are aware that an abortion could be negative to their mental health.  The vast majority of women struggle with that and they are ambivalent.  Those who have mental health problems already are the ones who are most aware.  They are also aware that if they go on to have a baby, there is a risk to their mental health.</p> <p>  I was perhaps being slightly mischievous with Senator Mullen in asking whether we should get women to see a psychiatrist before they ever get pregnant.  To a certain extent it is the same question.  There are women who regret not having had a termination.  There are women who regret the failure of the morning-after pill.  There are women who regret both.  Most people have the knowledge that an abortion may be damaging to their mental health.  That is often the reason for their ambivalence.  In terms of the idea that there is a message out there that abortion is good for one's mental health always, with happy smiling faces, that is not how it is on the ground.  There will always be people who will regret serious decisions.  Becoming pregnant is a very emotional time.  A straight answer as to whether women should be aware there are potential mental health difficulties following abortion is, yes, of course, as there are after pregnancy.</p></speech>

I do not do that.  The women who come to me are aware from the beginning.  They are seeing me because of concerns about their mental health or because they have a mental health issue already or they are incredibly distressed because they have just discovered they have a baby with a fatal foetal abnormality or whatever the circumstances might be.  They are very distressed already, so I am there helping them to weigh it up, but those who are seeing me know that already.  I cannot say what happens in every single pregnancy advice centre but there certainly should be a general awareness that an abortion presents a risk for the woman.</p></speech>

Dr. Ferguson clarified the position on his research on our national broadcaster four years ago.  The man who is continually quoting him says the interpretation of Dr. Ferguson's data is that abortion is bad for mental health.  Dr. Ferguson stated that he had completed a review of the evidence and his view was that there was no evidence that abortion mitigated any mental health risks of unwanted pregnancy.  That was based upon a review of the limited research and he said that the first point was that the research was not particularly good and any conclusion drawn should be made cautiously.  That was his major conclusion; he could not find any evidence of benefits.  He went on to say that abortion does not improve mental health of women and, has no mental health benefits and poses more risks for unwanted pregnancy.  That is on the record.  Dr. Ferguson also said that research has found that abortion has no therapeutic value in reducing the mental health risk.  Instead, the evidence suggests that abortion may be associated with an increased risk of some mental health problems.  Dr. Ferguson said that statement was true.  He found that he compared women who had an abortion with equivalent groups of women who had unwanted pregnancies or intended pregnancies, the women having abortions had slightly higher rates of mental health.  Basically, what he said about his study was that there are limitations in it.  My take is that Dr. Ferguson is not happy about the conclusions that have been continually drawn by certain groups on his work to be drawn on his work.  It is important that when someone is being quoted as saying X, but is actually saying Y, then it has to be called out.  Anyway, I thank the professor for coming in to us.  It has been helpful and in particular his statement has been helpful to me.</p> <p>  The Child Care Law Reporting Project published known facts recently in the case of a pregnant girl who sought an abortion under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act on the suicide ground.  Instead, she was briefly detained under the Mental Health Act.  Ultimately, she was denied the abortion she requested.  It appears that, instead, her pregnancy was terminated via early induction or delivery.  This is being claimed by some groups as a good outcome.  These are people who want to retain the eighth amendment, even though it was determined that it was indeed her informed decision to end her pregnancy.  Does this raise any concerns for Professor McCarthy?  As a psychiatrist, is he concerned that medical professionals might err on the side of caution and end up detaining women under the Mental Health Act if a health ground were placed in law?  Does Professor McCarthy think that forcibly detaining and interring women is a good solution for health professionals and women?  How could we mitigate that risk?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#JJ00200"><p>I will reply first to Deputy McConnell's question about the Ferguson report.  It is a pretty good study but it has major limitations.  As I highlighted, almost every study has serious limitations.  That is why the meta-analysis or systematic review done by putting everything together came out with the conclusions.  The conclusion of that study and the first part of what Senator Mullen said is that abortion is not good for women's mental health - but neither pregnancy nor marriage are good for women's mental health either, as we know.  We have to know these things.</p> <p>  I heard the same interview with Dr. Ferguson on "Morning Ireland" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 when he said that his study was being selectively quoted.  There was nothing actually that I could hear from what Senator Mullen said that he was selectively misquoting.  Dr. Ferguson said we should not take too much out of the study.  He said there were major doubts and gaps.</p> <p>  In my opening statement I referred to the notion of control groups.  This is the single biggest flaw.  I am unsure how many of the scientists here do research.  Anyway, what do we mean by control groups?  I was trying to think of an analogy.  Let us suppose I did a study on people who get lung cancer and I examined whether they got stressed and whether that caused the lung cancer.  Let us suppose I asked all of them whether they got stressed before they got lung cancer.  I would find that 80% said they were stressed before they got lung cancer.  We might think in consequence that stress equals lung cancer.  However, if we have not compared those who smoke to those who do not smoke, we completely miss the key fact.  Many of these studies are not looking at comparing only women with unplanned pregnancy or women who have been pressurised to have a termination.  In other words, it is not comparing the key or important variables at all.  It is altogether selective.  It does not even examine the gestation of the pregnancy.  Many other factors are involved that are missed in the vast majority of studies.  Dr. Ferguson was honest.  He pleaded for people not to quote him suggesting the conclusions were absolute fact.  He was being misquoted.  The actual words Senator Mullen used today are in his study, but there are major flaws to it.</p> <p>  Deputy McConnell asked about a particular case.  Obviously, I cannot talk about specific cases, but a woman cannot have a termination of pregnancy past 24 weeks.  There is a responsibility for all doctors to consider the health of the foetus.  Of the few cases that have arisen, I am aware of one case where a woman was actively seeking a termination and was detained.  Actually, she could not have a termination anyway, because she was past that term.</p> <p>  We only detain a woman if she has lost her capacity or if she has a mental illness.  I was not involved in that case but, as far as I understand it, if the woman did not have a mental illness, then it was absolutely wrong to detain her.  First, I have no doubt that those involved in the circumstances almost certainly do not work in this area.  Second, they were highly anxious.  If a woman is hitting her stomach with her hands, literally pounding into her stomach, and saying that she wants a termination of pregnancy, then people will sometimes not be able to stand back.  They may panic and take the view that they must do something and then decide to use the Mental Health Act.  Psychiatry has a dangerous history in that regard, one I am acutely aware of.  Anyway, that is a major error.  If a woman does not have a psychiatric illness &ndash; this girl clearly did not and that is why the court lifted the order shortly afterwards - then it was a major mistake to detain her in the first place.</p></speech>

That was being quoted here but we do not actually know the official rate.  It is important to clarify that point on the figure.  Technically, we do not know the rate here.  It is being bandied around here.</p></speech>

I too found it interesting.  I could see the humanity in it as well, something I appreciate.</p> <p>  Professor McCarthy quoted from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK.  He noted cases of women who are exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general and whose personal experiences are likely to have worse outcomes.  I have said before at this committee and elsewhere that I accompanied a group.  It was around the time of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  I went to Liverpool Women's Hospital with Doctors for Choice Ireland.  It was specifically around the area of fatal abnormalities.  I got some indication of the way women were treated in that hospital and environment.  They were treated with great humanity and care.  That made me feel very ashamed because they did not get that here.  One person who was on that visit asked whether there was a difference between Irish women and women from the UK in how they were treated or how they felt.  The instant response from the people who took care of those women was that what differentiated Irish women was that they felt judged.  I suspect that is exactly the same whether it is a fatal abnormality or a requirement to leave the jurisdiction.  They feel different by virtue of the fact that they were forced to leave the country.</p><p>Those strongly negative attitudes and presumably the very fact that people have to leave the jurisdiction would feed into those poorer outcomes.  Would that be a fair assumption and does the witness see people when they come back who would express views like that afterwards?</p></speech>

We have to be careful about what we might think as human beings and what research evidence states.  The research evidence that is based on tends to be from the United States where people are going into clinics where there might be crowds outside abusing them as they go in and where there may be threats as they go in.  The research evidence is in that.  That is the general attitude coming across.  In terms of the individual ones it is very clear that particularly pressure from a spouse to have a termination can be a problem if an individual does not want one.  Equally, a very strong family opposition to it, when a person still goes ahead, can be damaging.  That is at a very personal level.  I am not aware of any study that has been done specifically looking at the Irish question.  Do I hear people in my office saying that?  I do not see that many coming back.  One woman said it was bizarre, it was dreadful, here she was terminating her much wanted baby and she thought it was going to be the worst day of my life but compared to the many weeks beforehand it was an extraordinarily kind occasion.  She said it was almost lovely the way she was cared for and looked after, and people were so non-judgmental.  She was comparing it specifically to how her family had responded to it.  Yes, at human level I can say that.  I do hear those stories but the research evidence is from America.</p></speech>

With the small size of my team it would be impossible beyond that.  We also sometimes see women even before pregnancy particularly if they have a major mental health problem or mental illness and are concerned about pregnancy and concerned about the medication they are going to have.  We do see women even before pregnancy or maybe they have had some particularly difficult stillbirth before or a sudden infant death.  Breaking it down, there are so many different categories that I would not give the figures here.  We will see people for up to six months afterwards including if it has been a miscarriage or a termination or a stillbirth.  We will be compassionate about that as well.  It does not necessarily stop exactly at six months.</p></speech>

I was not aware that there were any great numbers.  I also know that the numbers are unreliable anyway because I see women sometimes who have had terminations at home taking tablets and I know women who have gone to England for a termination and given an English address.  I am not sure how important numbers are in all of this in terms of the reality of the work that I do.  The reality of the work is that the women I am seeing who decide to have a termination of pregnancy - and many as I say do not - are going to the UK to have it.  I have not yet met a woman who has not had a termination because she had to stay in Ireland.  I have not had that experience.  I know of other situations where women have not been able to afford to go to the UK and I know of one case in particular.  I know there are issues with children or with refugees but it has not been a personal experience of mine.  All I can tell the Deputy is my own personal experience and what I come across.

I was making a flippant comment.  When we look at what is good for people in their lives - some are looking into it - we note that pregnancy in general is not good for women's mental health.  Termination is not good for women's mental health, but it is no worse and no better than pregnancy.  I was flippantly adding that if we were to have women assessed for their capacity before consenting to decisions in their lives, be it to have a termination, get pregnant in the first place or even get married, all of which have negative consequences for them, the psychiatrists would be very busy.  The research does show that the mental health of women in general - not in the case of the Deputy, obviously - is best when they are single and worst when they are married.  Men's mental health is best if they are married and worst if they are single.  That is the research evidence.</p></speech>

It was amazing to compare the lives of women and what it was like to live in Ireland with an unwanted pregnancy before the 1967 Act with what it was like afterwards.  Dr. McCarthy rightly referred in his presentation to the 1967 Act as the Irish abortion Act.  Without it, we would never have had abortions in this country.  It was illustrated that this was an island on which there was no access to abortion services.  There is a limited number of abortions.  There are variations on a theme across Europe.  If one were in Poland and needed help, one could get on a train and travel to Germany or Austria.  In Ireland, being an isolated island that was poor for a long time and which is now quite wealthy, we are still in the Dark Ages.  I will definitely read the studies and thank Dr. McCarthy for pointing me in their direction.</p> <p>  Anecdotally, I believe there have been more ways than one to skin a cat in the history of this country.  I was on a walking holiday in County Donegal learning the names of plants in the Irish language when I noted there was a lovely little plant that traditionally had been picked to make a tea in order to abort an unwanted pregnancy.  This has been occurring for hundreds of years.  The plant had a beautiful old Irish name and I brought home lots of it if anybody wants to have a cup of tea.  I am letting anybody who needs help know about it.</p> <p>  I want to quiz Dr. McCarthy about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and the barrier of two psychiatrists and an obstetrician a woman has to get through if she needs an abortion because she is suicidal.  Dr. McCarthy has mentioned that most psychiatrists, or some of them, had never done this kind of work.  By that, I believe he meant they had not seen pregnant women with mental health issues.  That is the professor's job and he has been doing this work in Holles Street with hundreds of women every year.  The psychiatrists who are now doing this work under the Act would not have been used to it.  Is the Act fit for purpose if practitioners such as psychiatrists are doing a job they never did before in very serious circumstances involving women whose lives are at risk?  Obviously, if one does a job for a long time, one gets used to it, but if one is starting from a position in which one is not used to dealing with pregnant women with mental health issues who request an abortion because they feel suicidal, it is a different matter.  Does Dr. McCarthy believe the Act is fit for purpose if the two psychiatrists whom a woman must see are not used to the work, given the stretched resources available in the country?  Do the psychiatrists have a choice in doing that work?  Are they forced to do it?  Are they told on the day by the HSE that they must interview two women who are suicidal because they are employed by it?  Can they opt out if they do not want to do that work?</p> <p>  Rather than going to two psychiatrists and an obstetrician and having to go through the hoops and over the jumps the ridiculous Act has forced on women with mental health issues, would it be easier for a woman to travel to Britain to have an abortion?  Who, in the main, has to go through all of this?  Is it girls?  Is it women who are below the age of independence or women who are not capable of having financial independence?  Is it very poor women?  Is it refugee women, in particular, or women in direct provision accommodation who cannot leave the country?  Does this reflect badly on the country?  As well as penalising all women by not giving them a choice in respect of their own reproductive systems, we further penalise a cohort of women, particularly those who cannot leave the country because of their immigration or refugee status.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#LL01900"><p>There were a few questions, but I will start by talking about having a sense of humour.  I am sorry that Deputy Mattie McGrath has left.  Having a sense of humour is very important in my job.  After talking about a very distressing matter, being able to share a joke and a laugh is sometimes one of the best things we can do.  Even laughing and joking after some painful losses, including pregnancy loss, is part of the process.  It is a little like being at a funeral; people will laugh and joke.  That is part of the human response in situations such as this.  It is healthy rather than something about which to be offended, I hope.<br/><br/>Obviously, the legislation was enacted at the time with the best of intentions to try to deal with all of the results of the directions of the European Court of Justice.  It was trying to address some of the issues involved.  Mental health issues had to be involved and, in those circumstances, suicide was the most controversial aspect of the legislation, as the Deputy knows.  I remember being on radio at one stage when there was a suggestion there should be 12 professionals involved.  One of my children says it was a relatively proud moment to see my name on an <i>Evening Herald</i>poster on Pearse Street.  It read: &quot;Psychiatrist calls this idea a joke.&quot;  I believed originally that the figure of 12 was a joke.  The number was eventually reduced to three.  All along I said there were simply not enough people available to do the work.  I questioned how it would work and how it would be appropriate.<br/><br/>There is an acknowledgement that there are not enough psychiatrists in the country.  Of course, there are psychiatrists.  The three Dublin maternity hospitals have part-time psychiatrists.  The major unit in Cork has a liaison psychiatrist who does a lot of work in this area.  Throughout the country, however, there are very few.  The requirement is that a psychiatrist must have treated a woman with mental health problems in pregnancy to be allowed to do this work.  He or she has to be a consultant and to have treated a woman.  That is the pragmatism of the legislation based on the problem of having enough people.  Of course, there are not enough people available with the required training.  A requirement was included afterwards that they be trained.  One of the key issues is the nature of the training provided.  There is none working in maternity hospitals.  I might see a woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy but who will have no idea of gestation or the difference between an emergency caesarean section at 24 weeks and the scar that will be on her body and a different procedure altogether if she waits a few more weeks.  She will have no idea of various things.  Equally, the assessing doctor will not either.  The amount of experience and time it takes to deal with that issue is considerable.  There is simply not enough training provided and not enough people used to doing this work.  For all of the theoretical training, it is actually a matter of practice.  I learn every day from the patients I am seeing.  That is how we learn.  Unequivocally, the system really does not work.  Since it is so clumsy, the vast majority of women will come nowhere near us, appropriately so.  It is just an unnecessary and unhelpful procedure.  Therefore, women have to travel.<br/><br/>I do not have a breakdown of the very small number of women who find themseles in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred.  Some of the cases that were very much highlighted have some involved younger people and at least one refugee.  I have not seen a breakdown of the numbers involved simply because I have not been involved.</p></speech>

He said that over the past 21 years more than 500 women attended the clinic each year.  That goes back quite a long way.  Would societal changes and attitudes to abortion have affected how women can talk about it?  Has it changed how they feel about asking for or considering a termination?  We know from opinion polls that attitudes have changed.  A few of us here campaigned back in 1983 and we have seen a difference in public attitudes.  Would that be reflected in Professor McCarthy's experience?</p></speech>

They would come into the hospital and say they had one child or no children.  On the second or third time I would see them, they would then tell me about a termination they had.  Now, I am much more likely to hear such information at the very beginning.  Of course there are changes.  When I first came back, women with fatal foetal abnormalities got no information and got no support from my obstetric colleagues.  Now there is a completely different culture and attitude towards that.</p></speech>

I presume the research was carried out in countries with very liberal regimes.  We heard evidence today that Ireland, Andorra and, I understand, Malta are the only countries in the vicinity which have very restrictive regimes.</p> <p>  Professor McCarthy, quoting women's personal experiences, said women who were exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general were likely to have worse outcomes.  My question may be unfair, but I will ask it.  Would it be fair to say a very restrictive abortion regime, where there are constitutional provisions almost preventing women from having choice, would portray a very negative attitude towards women who wish to choose whether to have a termination?  </p> <p>  Would it be fair to say that in very restrictive countries where abortion is almost impossible to obtain that would have a more detrimental effect on a woman's mental health if she then chose to have an abortion?  If somebody had to travel or obtained pills on the Internet and had an abortion, would a restrictive regime be a factor in somebody's mental health?</p></speech>

What could Dr. McCarthy extrapolate from that?  In a country with a very restrictive abortion regime and very negative attitudes to women, for instance we criminalise women who have terminations, could he say whether the outcomes for women who go and obtain a termination are likely to be worse? </p></speech>

I would not want to generalise, but it is for the individual person and whether she is really thinking in that way.  What is really likely to matter is the views of those who are close to them or if there was some really publicly severe opinion.  What comes out in research is that if her partner or a family member is really critical of them, that can be very difficult.  If there is an argument, and sometimes I will witness argument and a lot of conflict from a parent or from a partner, that is likely to add to the emotional distress that is involved.  This research has never been conducted in Ireland, but we have American research looking at those going to abortion clinics in the US, where there is very public protest with people outside these clinics protesting and trying to stop abortions.  For the person who is desperate or wants a termination, that sort of protest will not help them, or help their mental health.  We know that if women have a mental health problem as a result of that experience, even in any future pregnancy, that mental health issue may become relevant again.</p></speech>

One of his comments was why would any woman want to put herself through the process of having to go before a panel and almost have their mental health questioned.  If we were to get to a position where we had a more liberal regime for terminations, where mental health was one of the grounds for it, I presume that analysis would stand no matter whether we had terminations in all circumstances.  If somebody had to go before a panel of psychiatrists and almost prove that she had mental health issues, does it make a difference whether it is a very restrictive or a very relaxed liberal regime?  I do not know how one would deal with having to put a woman through a process that is obviously going to be distressing for her.  From the evidence we have heard today, would it be correct to presume that one of the ways one would deal with it is by on-request terminations up to a certain period?  What would Dr. McCarthy's opinion be in terms of women's mental health?  I presume Dr. McCarthy would say that it would never be good to have a woman almost have to prove her mental health status before she could access a termination, regardless of whether the regime is very restrictive or very liberal.</p></speech>

When someone comes to see me or any psychiatrist, the first and most important element will be the relationship in the room.  Can that person talk to me?  Does she feel heard and listened to?  That is the key starting point.</p> <p>  I attended a lecture some years ago given by Professor Aidan Halligan, who was an Irish paediatrician and the deputy head of the NHS in England.  Speaking about medicine, surgery or any specialty, he said that the first thing any patient attending any doctor wanted to know was whether the doctor cared.  If the doctor cared, then it was likely that the patient would be heard.  Even where there was a cardiac complaint, the patient would know that the doctor was listening.  The doctor would take a proper history and hear the person's story.  If a doctor is not interested, he or she will miss things and, often, the patient will not tell him or her things.  This is particularly the case in mental health.  For someone to tell me personal, difficult things about herself, her history, her feelings and her previous experiences requires a sense of trust.  If that appointment is imposed on her or I approach the matter in some judgmental way or bring my personal attitudes or history to it in either direction, it will be a failure of an appointment.  Insisting that a woman go through a particular process where she must see a series of psychiatrists, or even just one, when she is clear on the situation in her own mind will be a waste of an appointment and abusive of her and she will be unlikely to talk about what matters because she is being forced into a situation that is not helpful.  It would waste her time and my time and be damaging.</p></speech>

It has been most helpful.  I apologise for missing some of it, but I had to speak in the Chamber.  Since some of my questions may have been answered, I will try to move through them quickly.</p> <p>  What percentage of women suffer from perinatal mental health issues during or post pregnancy?  Is there any indication of that figure?</p></speech>

In general, 11% of women get what is called postnatal depression.  It is not a thing, but a label to highlight that after the birth of the baby is an extremely vulnerable time for a woman's mental health.  It is a peak time for many reasons.  I could spend an hour telling the Deputy about why it is such a poignant and vulnerable time for women with mental health problems.</p> <p>  According to some research, if women are asked to fill in a questionnaire during pregnancy, a higher percentage, perhaps 20%, will say that they are struggling.  The most important message is that there is no decrease in mental health difficulties during pregnancy.  In general, between 5% and 7% of women will have a significant mental health problem at that time.  That does not lessen or increase overall.  It may get much worse for an individual woman but much better for another.  After the birth of the baby, the figure increases to approximately 11%.  They have what is called postnatal depression, but for 3.5%, it is a serious problem.</p></speech>

There is none outside of Dublin.  Professor O'Keane, who works in Tallaght hospital, addressed the committee.  She has a long history of having worked in perinatal psychiatry, but she does not do that anymore.  She is not working in a maternity hospital.</p> <p>  Outside of Dublin, there are no specialists and hardly any psychiatric input in some maternity hospitals except where, for example, a very small number of women become acutely psychotic or unwell.  As to seeing women during pregnancy for assessments or afterwards in general, however, there is almost nothing outside of Dublin in terms of specialists.</p></speech>

I hope that my business managers are listening.  It is to be hoped I will be a full-time psychiatrist in Holles Street in the near future.  There are plans under the national perinatal strategy for mother and baby units, with one in St. Vincent's hospital when the National Maternity Hospital moves to that site.  It would be for the whole of the city.  As the committee knows, however, that move is some way off.  Currently, there is no mother and baby unit in the country.</p></speech>

We are trying to prevent mental health problems in the mother or treat them early.  In this way, ongoing bonding issues, attachment issues and mental health problems for the children are prevented.  If we do not intervene, then the mother is badly depressed or anxious and not getting help, which can have a negative effect on children.  That would perpetuate problems through the generations.</p></speech>

She may have had a major mental health problem previously, for example, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD, anxiety, depression, etc.  For others, something new might emerge during pregnancy, for example, anxiety or depression.  It could be any mental health difficulty.  Some women will start drinking in pregnancy.  Some will cope in unhealthy ways.  For example, I have had patients tell me that they stopped taking their antidepressants because they were fearful of damaging their babies, but because they could not sleep at night, they were drinking four glasses of wine.  Women who may have controlled their eating disorders suddenly become pregnant.  The challenges to their bodies, such as the challenge of having something inside them, can trigger a relapse of a serious problem.  Women who have managed or controlled their obsessive concerns may become completely obsessed and suffer a relapse of OCD during pregnancy that affects their anxiety and checking behaviour, perhaps because of reducing their medication or the responsibility of something being inside them.  They are checking movements multiple times.  They cannot sleep at night because they are double-checking, triple-checking and worrying about it.  Maybe they have had a foetal loss before and cannot relax during pregnancy because of that.  Maybe they are depressed.  There are a range of issues.</p></speech>

I am unsure as to when they would attend.  If they anticipate a pregnancy, would they have access to perinatal psychiatry at that stage to plan the medication aspect?  It is a major concern for some women who have an ongoing mental illness.  How is that managed?  At what point do they move over to perinatal psychiatry?  Do they need to be pregnant?  What is involved in the planning?  I would be interested in Dr. McCarthy's comments.  For people with existing conditions, for example, bipolar illness, which is manageable in many cases, anxiety about reducing or going off their medications during pregnancy can cause their illnesses to return, etc.</p></speech>

In the mental health area, particularly in complex medical regimes and specifically when there are complicating obstetric issues, women very often want to get specialists' advice.  Some of my colleagues will sometimes want me to give specialist advice.  To answer the Chairman's question, we see a small number of women before pregnancy specifically to provide this advice.  Some women may already have obtained this information when they became pregnant by googling it or looking it up on a website.  They may be perfectly happy with the local services available and may not feel a need to see me.  Others will definitely want to see me, particularly those who have a bipolar illness and are on lithium.  These women need very careful change monitoring.  The change dynamics of pregnancy and the change in renal function - all sorts of issue in pregnancy - make the situation much more complicated.  It is very much individual to the woman who will make up her mind, with the advice of her doctor, etc., on whether she should come to see us.</p></speech>

I return to an issue which was raised with me earlier.  Letters may be read into the record in limited circumstances only, as, for example, in the case of Ms Cora Sherlock where clarification was necessary.  I am reliably informed that it is a matter for the Chair, rather than individual members, to decide how correspondence is handled.  I have proposed that the correspondence in question be placed on the committee's website.  That is my decision and it is one on which I will not be challenged.  Individual members may not demand a decision or question the decision of the Chair.  This applies to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and all committees.  If any member wishes to table a substantive motion in respect of a ruling of the Chair, he or she is free to do so, provided he or she gives adequate notice to the committee.  That is the position.  My sincerely held view is that if someone is scheduled to attend and subsequently decides not to do so, it is not appropriate to read statements from him or her into the record.

Section 10 inserts a new section after section 128E to provide for the introduction of a new share-option based relief for employees of SME companies, namely the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  It is designed to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises in the recruitment and retention of key employees.  It provides for a more advantageous tax treatment of gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options acquired in SME companies.  Where the KEEP applies any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying share options granted during the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023 will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will however be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.</p> <p>  There are a number of conditions.  For example, the share option must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant; the share option must be held for a minimum period of one year before exercise, with limited exceptions; and the option must be exercised within ten years of grant to avail of this programme.  Monetary limits apply at both company and employee level.  The commencement of the programme is subject to EU State Aid approval, which I expect to issue shortly.  Recent developments with regard to the employment and investment incentive programme make it even more important that the KEEP programme is effective in meeting its policy objective.  With this in mind, the scope for further adjustments to this programme is being examined.  Last night I flagged that I may bring further amendments to this on Report Stage.</p><p>However, I should emphasise that any such adjustments would require State aid approval, and I need to strike a balance between what is desirable and what I can make happen.</p></speech>

We do not expect that cost to be realised next year.  We expect that the setup period for many companies will be, perhaps not prolonged, but into next year.  Beyond that, when the scheme is ongoing, the cost will be approximately &euro;10 million.</p></speech>

Regarding the size of the companies, this programme applies to employees of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as defined by the European Commission.  Medium-sized companies, according to the European Commission, are relatively big in an Irish context.  They can have up to 250 employees.  Therefore, there could be a relatively big company employing, say, 249 staff, with a turnover of &euro;200,000 per employee.  That would be at the upper limit of employees who could qualify for KEEP.</p></speech>

The two main criteria in this regard are that the enterprise must employ fewer than 250 persons, as the Deputy has just said, and that it must have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million or an annual balance sheet in total not exceeding &euro;43 million.  In addition, we have laid down a number of trading activities which will be excluded from the KEEP incentive.  This relates to transactions that would be speculative, dealing in commodities, some professional services, dealing in development of land and a few other areas.</p></speech>

I have seen an example provided by Mazars which shows that someone getting &euro;10,000 in share options at &euro;1 per share, exercising that option when they are worth &euro;3 per share and selling them when they are worth &euro;4 would save &euro;3,150 in tax.  The maximum share option per year under the scheme is &euro;100,000, with a maximum of &euro;250,000 over the course of three years.  That means that the maximum an individual could benefit in tax on a yearly basis through this programme is &euro;30,150.</p></speech>

It is a tax expenditure, so there is a cost to us for doing it, but much of the engagement we have had with small and medium-sized companies that are active in particular sectors within our economy point to the fact that companies far larger than them have share option schemes that they are able to fund by their scale.  They have indicated to us that a scheme such as this would be very helpful in supporting the retention and development of staff within smaller companies, in particular within Irish indigenous companies.  This is why we think this scheme has value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01000"><p>Does the Minister accept that the impact of the scheme is likely to be regressive?  One could, in theory, be a low-paid employee and get share options, but it is not very likely.  Those who avail of share options are more likely to be middle to higher income earners and, therefore, the effect would be regressive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01100"><p>My experience, having dealt with this issue in recent months, is that the availability of share option schemes has changed within our economy.  It rarely includes, to be fair to the Deputy's point, people on low incomes - I acknowledge that - but one of the developments that has occurred is that it now includes more and more middle-income employees, depending on the kind of industry they are in.  I think we saw share option schemes in the past as being forms of compensation for senior executives, but it is now the case, particularly within companies that are active in the digital economy, that they are being used, for example, to incentivise engineers and software designers, people who would very much be seen as middle-income earners and who are operationally vital to companies.  Those companies then use these schemes to try to retain those employees for the long run.  We have a growing amount of feedback to the effect that it is difficult to do this if one is below a certain level.  Companies that are below a certain level in scale tend to be more likely than not indigenous.  Again, that is why we are doing this.  However, the Deputy is correct in what he has said, that is, that this scheme will more than likely apply to people on middle incomes and above.  The only exception I can think of is if someone were to join on perhaps some form of graduate recruitment scheme.  Such schemes could include programmes such as this.</p></speech>

A qualifying share option is defined in the section.  They are new, ordinary, fully paid up shares.  Preferential shares are excluded.  These shares constitute a share in the equity, a share in the ownership of the company.</p></speech>

When we discuss the relevant section, I will get more information for the Deputy on this point, but I would have thought that in the vast majority of cases, this would be granted to companies that are quoted in some way because, of course, this is a share-based scheme, and in order to have a share the company needs to be quoted in some way.  I will get information for the Deputy on this matter as we go through the section.  I have been informed that it can also apply to companies that are on the junior market.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to its extension but I want to look at how he is making this judgment.  It is provided for in the Finance Bill that a scheme will be introduced with a deadline; the deadline approaches; lo and behold, the deadline is extended.  I cannot recall when a scheme in the Finance Bill that was supposed to end actually ended.  Deadlines are more or less always extended.</p><p>What was the rationale there?  What was the rationale originally for ending the scheme at a certain point and now continuing it?  As we approach December 2020 we all know that it will, more than likely, be extended again.</p></speech>

When I reviewed all of these allowances with my officials in advance of the Finance Bill, I received advice that this scheme was of help in delivering energy efficiency goals for Irish companies and the continuation of the scheme would support the delivery of that policy objective.  That is why I made the judgment and the decision.</p></speech>

As schemes are extended over and over again, we send a message to companies that while there is a deadline and a scheme, for example, will not be available after 1 January 2018, in reality history shows that these schemes will continue on.</p></speech>

By putting it down for the end of 2020, I recognise that the end date of the scheme is still quite a bit away.  The experience I have of such schemes is that at times, there can be changes in technology and in how the allowances are used.  It is helpful to have a point at which the scheme could end, to facilitate a review of it.  That is the thinking behind this.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked earlier about the cost of the scheme.  The annual rebate for this scheme in 2015 was &euro;1.1 million for 65 claimants.  That was the cost of the scheme at that point. </p></speech>

We have had a lot of conversation around the housing crisis and the emergency the State has gone through in recent years, despite the fact that the Government fails to admit that it is an emergency.  There is a huge number of vacant homes across the State in areas where there is high pressure for housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has, for quite a considerable period, called for a vacant home tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, is leading the charge on this, among many other issues.  It baffles me that we have not seen any progress on a vacant home tax during budget 2018.  I am not arguing that every vacant property be taxed as a vacant home but at a time of huge crisis in the State and in areas of high housing pressure, it is immoral that there are vacant homes while 3,000 children and 5,000 adults are living in emergency accommodation.  In the past few months, Irish citizens have died on our streets.  People who are homeless are being forced to survive in the elements.  We need incentives to get vacant homes back into operation.</p><p>The previous section, which we discussed, contains minor incentives such as allowing pre-letting expenditure to be written off against rental income.  This is welcome and we support that amendment but it does not go far enough.  We need to take out the big stick in respect of the properties lying vacant in inner city Dublin.  The State needs to send a message to investors that if they leave their properties vacant at a time when there is massive pressure on the housing market and on supply, the State will tax them.  This amendment proposes that within six months of the passing of the Act, a report would be prepared and laid before the D&aacute;il on the subject of the introduction of a vacant homes tax.  The amendment takes this form because the Opposition is not allowed to table an amendment to immediately introduce a vacant homes tax.  If we had that ability I would have tabled an amendment to that effect.  It is important the Minister and the Government move on this without delay as we have had enough announcements.  We need serious action and I cannot understand why we are not considering a vacant home tax at this point in time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.731" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#E00200"><p>This amendment addresses vacancy, which is a policy area acknowledged by the Government as being central to housing challenges.  In response, a key objective, identified in the fifth pillar of the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is to ensure that existing housing stock is used to the optimum degree and it focuses on measures to use existing vacant stock to renew urban and rural areas and meet housing needs.  While building new homes is a key action, another effective way to meet our housing needs is to bring vacant and under-utilised properties back into full use.  Vacant properties are an important source of potential accommodation supply as they are typically already served by existing infrastructure.  Their reuse has the potential to reduce the number of additional new homes required and to renew both the urban and rural areas of which they form an intrinsic part.</p> <p>  As regards specific measures taken by Government to tackle vacancies, action 5.1 commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy, the publication of which is expected shortly.  Action 5.9 commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas of ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  A multidisciplinary working group, led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be working to bring greater clarity to the regulatory requirements that apply and to advise both industry and local authorities on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of under-utilised older vacant buildings in the context of the regulatory requirements.  At local authority level, it is considered that there is scope for some early actions and in August 2017, all local authorities were required to designate vacant home offices and to draw up vacant home action plans to identify the real scale of vacancy in their areas, to set an ambitious but realistic target for which vacant homes could ultimately be brought back into use, whether for private sale, rent or social housing purposes, and to engage with owners to this end.  The first of these action plans were submitted to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last week.</p> <p>  Other initiatives include the repair and leasing scheme; buy and renew scheme; and the Housing Agency acquisition fund.  Many other approaches have been considered by Government in tackling vacancy issues.  On the possibility of introducing a new vacant homes tax, a strong rationale would be needed.  It would also need to be demonstrated how exactly such a tax would achieve and deliver the desired outcome.  Proof would be needed as to how its public benefit would, for example, outweigh rights contained within the Constitution.  The fairness and proportionality of such a tax would need to be carefully considered, as would necessary exemptions, lead-in times, collection and many other issues.  Bearing in mind such complexities and the consequences of tax impositions, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government sought legal advice from the Attorney General and that advice is currently under consideration.  Consideration is also required as to the involvement and co-operation of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and the implementation costs.</p> <p>  As there are multiple aspects to a vacant homes tax, I therefore oppose this amendment, which commits to laying a report on the matter within six months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.732" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#E00300"><p>The Government has had a year to come up with a vacant homes strategy and it has failed to do so.  This was supposed to have been done months ago.  The Finance Bill is going through and there is no mention of a vacant homes strategy.  The three initiatives the Government has set in train for vacant homes are all welcome but they are minor.  They target some 6,500 vacant homes over a period of six years, which is 3% of vacant houses in the State.  It is not an adequate response to the crisis we are facing.  I urge the Minister, his Department and the Government to wake up to the realities that are out there.  Other actions need to be taken to deal with this issue.  There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State and 35,293 in Dublin alone.  However, there are 3,000 children and 5,000 adults in emergency accommodation.  When will we take out the stick to incentivise people to put their homes back into use?</p> <p>  The Minister said we needed to look at the constitutional rights of property but there is no bar to us applying a tax on a category of homes, and I do not need to be the Attorney General to say this.  We have a tax on the majority of homes in the form of the property tax, and prior to that we defined a certain category of homes, which were non-principal private residences, and applied a tax to them for a number of years.  It is completely lawful to tax houses not occupied by the owner just as it was lawful to tax houses which nobody occupied.</p> <p>  There needs to be an incentive for individuals to put their vacant stock back into use and a number of schemes can assist them in this but as it is not happening fast enough, we need a vacant home tax.  It should apply to houses vacant for six months or more within local electoral areas, LEAs, in which there is a high level of housing need and a high level of vacancy.  It would have to include exemptions for holiday homes, homes in probate, fair deal homes and so forth but it is not beyond our ability to design a scheme.  The rate would need to increase year on year.  The site tax is a similar idea to get vacant sites into use.  We are critical of the site tax the Government introduced as it left it too long, the lead-in period was too long and the rates were too low but it does increase, thereby giving an incentive to people.  Getting sites into use would be very welcome but the turnaround time would be long.  Even if an owner sold a site to a developer today, there would be a two-year lead-in period before somebody turned the key in the door.</p> <p>  We accept that a cohort of the 35,000 vacant properties in Dublin will not be suitable to be brought back into public or private use but a large proportion are suitable.  We need to introduce measures now as this is an emergency.  The Minister said he would come up with a report but he has already failed to meet his own targets.  Considering these matters without any clear commitments is not good enough.  I stay in a hotel in Dublin while I am here and every day I come into work I pass people who stay in the same hotel.  Every day, they get their kids ready for school, put their uniforms on and take two or three buses to get to their primary or secondary school.  What we have done to people in this State is horrible.</p><p>We cannot fix that overnight but this finance committee can bring in measures that would provide some light and comfort for those families.  We were elected to have the power to introduce a vacant homes tax and to encourage the 183,000 owners of those homes to bring them back into use.  Why are we not doing it?  I cannot, for the life of me, understand that.  The Minister needs to give me a good reason for not introducing a vacant home tax now.  This is not day one of the crisis - it has been going on for years.  The Minister has not given me a reason for it.  All the amendment seeks is a report.  It states: "The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a vacant home tax."  It does not even commit the Minister to introducing a vacant home tax but it tries to force the Government to bring forward a report on the vacant tax for Members to have an informed discussion on the subject.</p><p> I would prefer the Minister of Finance to go further and say he will not tolerate 8,000 of our citizens being in emergency accommodation, or people dying on the steps of this building.  He needs to send a clear message to landlords who are hoarding empty properties that, if they do so any longer, we will tax them.  This tax should increase if they do not bring their properties into use within one year and there should be another increase after two years.  This is an emergency and it requires emergency measures but nothing of this type is coming from the Minister.  The Minister should send this message not just for the benefit of landlords, but for those who find themselves homeless in this State.</p></speech>

We had a report on a specific area of corporation tax which was carried out by the academic, Seamus Coffey, and I suggest something along those lines.  The data need to be collected and identified.  There is a particular problem with commercial premises across the country, where the ground floors have not reopened and the upper floors are empty.  There are complex issues with banks which are pursuing the owners of such premises but I am sure that, in many towns and cities, a significant percentage of upper floors can be utilised.  There is not much of chance of it, however, in the context of what we know of the complications with the banks.  I support the idea of a report but I do not see where the resources are to get a meaningful report that will set out the actions that could be taken to address some of the issues.</p> <p> In the RT&Eacute; programme earlier this week, it was very clear that, in two or three of the worst cases where there were large numbers of people, the ground floors and rears of the premises in question had been commercial premises.  Rackrenting landlords had cleared out the bottom floors and crammed in bunk beds, resulting in incredible abuse.  I ask the Minister to come back with proposals and additional staff, or to set up a commission overseen by somebody like Seamus Coffey.  The statistics from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment show that there are vacant, boarded-up premises in towns all over the country where people might want to rent them and it would be useful to do something along these lines.</p> <p>  I make door-to-door calls around my constituency in Dublin and I am not sure the figures reflect what is available in my constituency.  There are serious problems for many families as regards the HSE where a relative is in hospital but intends to come home again.  Often this is not realistic and these are sensitive situations but something can be done to address them, despite the complex legal, technical, personal and family issues.</p></speech>

There are delays in the probate process.  I am dealing with individual cases and currently they are taking months.  A report during the summer stated that it was taking 16 months for probate to come through, but the properties in question remain vacant in the meantime.  We need a breakdown of the 183,000 properties regarding those that are in the fair deal scheme and those that are in probate or caught up in legal disputes, of which there are many.  Receivers are in control and we need the data urgently.  Deputy Burton is right to identify the issue of upper floors.  Within a ten or 15-minute walk of this place one will find hundreds of properties on upper floors and over offices which are vacant and not being brought into use because of ridiculous planning rules.  These are under our noses in Dublin city centre and they need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I live in and represent a constituency which is afflicted by this and I represent families who are dealing with the trauma of not having a home.  I see it with my own eyes, and represent the people affected by the tragedy of not having a home or a stable roof over their heads from which they can send their children to school, in which they can cook dinner or help with the homework and where they can do all the other things families do who have their own homes.  I am well aware of the incredible distress families are facing in this regard.</p> <p>  Last week, I said that I take the figures for the number of children at risk from poverty in our country as seriously as the economic indicators on what is happening with bond yields or unemployment rates.  I am well aware of the challenges this poses to our economy and the unacceptable cost it imposes on society, families and on mums and dads and their children.  I am doing, and will continue to do, what I can do as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the issue and this is why, next year, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, led by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will receive an increase in resources.  It is in recognition of the fact that we have to address the issue that, in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, the Department to receive the largest increase in its share of capital funding is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  I have said that we should move away from the State acquiring homes in the private market to building them via our local authorities and through other means.  I also want this issue to be dealt with and it is not accurate to say no action is taking place.  It is also unfair and inaccurate to say nothing is being done in relation to vacant homes.</p><p>I have already told the committee that by the month just gone, all local authorities in the Dublin area had to come back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with a vacant homes action plan to deal with this issue in local authorities with the powers that are available to them.  As part of that, if there were additional measures we need to consider with regard to the issues and difficulties we have on all of this, that will also be done.  </p><p> I will return to the amendment the Deputy has tabled.  Let me talk about the statistics that are available to us and some of the challenges those statistics generate.  For example, if we look at where we were between census 2011 and 2016, the stock of residential properties across that five-year period increased from 1.994 million to just over 2 million, which is an increase of 0.4%.  The number of vacant properties fell in that period.  It is at 183,312 units at the moment.  The number of holiday homes went up and most of the reduction in vacant properties has been in urban areas where we saw a decrease of 35,000 units.  The information available to us at the moment, which is information from the CSO, indicates that there are lower vacancy rates in the larger urban areas.  If I look at who owns those vacant properties - this moves into the issue Deputy McGrath just raised - the information we have is hard to come by but it indicates that over one third of vacant properties are owned by citizens over 60 years of age.  Potentially, the largest owner of this stock is our elderly and there are all kinds of reasons that property might not be in use.  If we look at the change I have referred to, over 105,000 of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now occupied.  Of those, more than half are now rented out.  Close to 40% are owner-occupied.  In the urban areas that I referred to a moment ago, up to 70% of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now rented and over half of those are by families with children.  There has been a change in the number of vacant properties between then and now.  Action is being taken by Government to deal with this issue such as the action plans I referred to by county.  That information has been shared with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the past week.  </p><p> I will address the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy is not asking me to consider the introduction of a vacant home tax.  He is asking us to introduce a report within six months of the passing of the Bill on the introduction of such a tax.  We have many challenges in terms of understanding how many homes are vacant, why they are vacant, who owns them and for how long they have been vacant.  The challenge for me is that to give an indication that this tax will be brought in without answering all of those questions first will yield further issues and questions that would have me back before the committee pretty promptly.  I will not commit to that principle until I am clear about how I can handle those matters.</p><p> Deputy Burton made a fair point.  There is information, most of it from the CSO, trying to help us to understand this issue.  More work needs to be done on this by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with which I will help it.  I want to bring this work to a conclusion as soon as possible.  There are policy issues that need to be conclusively addressed to allow me to make a final assessment on whether there is a role for a vacant home tax.  Until those questions are finally answered, I cannot commit to that principle.  Where I will not yield any territory is on the commitment to ensuring the trauma of children and families in hotel rooms and those who are homeless is dealt with conclusively.  That is what I want to see happen and I will see it happen.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot commit to the principle of the introduction of this tax because there is work under way already on how the issue could be dealt with at local authority level.  There are too many matters I want to resolve before I can commit to that principle.  I want to resolve those matters.  I want to be in a position where I can come back to the Oireachtas or committee and answer conclusively the different questions being put to me regarding the information that is available. </p></speech>

I accept that, although ignorance would not be a defence anyway.  Being fully aware of it and then taking no action or not taking the appropriate action makes it even worse.  The Minister gave us figures about how many vacant homes came into use between 2011 and 2016.  During the Minister's time in Cabinet, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and now as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the homelessness and housing crisis has gone out of control.  More children and adults are in emergency accommodation and more people are homeless and dying on our streets under the Minister's watch.  The Minister and his Government, through the decisions of Cabinet, have tolerated the homelessness crisis.  This is not an act of natural disaster.  We do not have a homelessness crisis as a result of a tsunami, an earthquake or an act of God.  We have it because of Government policies which stopped the building of social housing or did not adequately funding social housing.</p> <p>  The Minister will talk about the package that was given in this year's budget.  Not one single social house above the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney's targets of this time last year will be built as a result of the money the Minister has provided.  The Minister tells us he understands and I am sure he does; I believe he is a compassionate person but compassion needs to go a bit further.  The Minister needs to act because there is a crisis.  The Minister says he does not need to be lectured about it.  We do not have the luxury of waiting for another year so the Government can get its act together and start to consider the introduction of a vacant property tax.  The arguments the Minister has put before the committee border on the ridiculous.  He talks about one third of the owners of the 183,000 vacant properties being over the age of 65.  He says that might explain why they are vacant homes.  Even if we disregarded all of those owned by over-65s, we would still have 120,000 vacant properties in the State.  I am not assuming that all of those can be brought into use.  What I am saying is that if a portion of those in Dublin could be brought into use, we would resolve the housing and homelessness crisis at a greater speed.</p> <p>  This is not the Minister's first day in office.  How long has he been in Cabinet?  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, he has been approving decisions by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the previous Minister for Finance that have not gotten to grips with this issue.  Not only have Government decisions not got to grips with the issue, but they have made it worse.  The Minister might not like to hear that because I am sure he has empathy for every person who finds themselves homeless but when he decides on budget day to put a particular amount into tax cuts as opposed to putting it into building new houses, the automatic result is that the family in room 401 is going to be in room 401 this time next month and for months after.  The Minister is unwilling to bring forward a report which looks at the introduction of a vacant home tax.  The Minister talks about considering it.  Although I would disagree, the report could say there is no merit in bringing forward a vacant home tax.  As a member of the Opposition, I am trying to challenge the Government years into a crisis of homelessness and housing.</p><p>I am trying to do so in the only way possible, namely, through the Finance Bill, because Opposition Members are not able to table amendments that would give rise to a cost on the Exchequer.  This is an attempt to force the Minister to take some action by providing certainty that within six months of the passing of the Bill, a report would be produced on the introduction of a vacant house tax.  Such a report would capture all of the issues Members have raised, whether it be the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to apply a vacant homes tax or the data to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred for probate and the different categories of individuals who own the 183,000 vacant homes.  What the Minister is telling us, however, is that it will be business as usual and that no action will be taken in the Finance Bill to introduce a vacant home tax on the 183,000 empty properties.  That is not good enough.</p><p> I make no apologies for telling the personal stories of homeless families, the children involved and what these families are experiencing in terms of their mental health.  I will continue to do so because I still believe the Minister simply does not get it.  We have to ask ourselves what this country has become and who we are as a nation and people.  Why do we tolerate having 8,000 homeless persons and hundreds of patients left on hospital trolleys every day?  Why do we tolerate tax avoidance on a massive scale by major corporations?  While that is the country it has become, it is not what citizens want.  They want the Government to take serious action to address the housing and homelessness crisis.  There are approximately 20 people homeless in County Donegal where the level of homelessness is nowhere near as bad as the crisis level in Dublin.  However, even people in my county who are not touched by homelessness want the problem in Dublin to be sorted.  They have empathy and sympathy and want the Government to act. </p><p> The measure we are seeking is not radical but a small matter of introducing a vacant home tax.  For God's sake, given that we introduced a second home tax in 2010, why can we not introduce a vacant home tax at a time when there is a housing and homelessness emergency?  The Government's refusal to do so makes no sense.</p></speech>

The urgency of a vacant unit or vacant home tax simply cannot be overstated.  Let me put a human face on this matter because often, when we debate financial matters, one only hears dry figures, statistics and so on.</p> <p>  I have a long litany of cases that people in dire circumstances bring to my office every single week.  This week, a young woman in her early 20s came to my office.  She has been homeless with her young child for two and half years.  Her child is now five and half years old.  They have been housed in eight different emergency accommodations, including the Clondalkin Sonas homeless accommodation where there was a fire.  As the Minister will know, one mother and three babies were killed due to the fire.  The young woman who came to my office had been in that hostel and she was very close friends with the woman who died.  She is completely traumatised, as is her son.  She is still in emergency accommodation.  Her son is now in his third school in two and half years.  They are utterly traumatised and they have no idea when they will be housed.  The signs are, given the state of the list operated by the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it could be years.  The woman broke down several times in my office.  She is completely unable to cope.  She blames herself, she thinks she is a terrible mother for putting her child in this situation and pleaded for a secure roof over their heads.  </p> <p>  Side by side with that, close to the emergency accommodation that she is in now, and I highlighted this case before but I suspect that it is the tip of the iceberg, I highlighted recently a block of apartments in Sandyford.  I refer to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally.  The apartments have been owned by NAMA since it was set up.  NAMA has sat on between 15 to 20 empty units since it took them over the loan of the developer.  Recently, NAMA sold the properties to a vulture fund that tried to evict the rest of the tenants.  All the while, between 15 and 20 apartments have been left empty while people like the young woman and her child I referred to and so many others go through a housing trauma.  Could there be anything more urgent than putting human beings, like that young mother and her child, into those empty apartments?  For ordinary people, it is as simple as that.  It is obscene that NAMA sat on those empty apartments.  It is worth saying that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approached NAMA and asked for the apartments but NAMA said no.  The apartments are still empty while there are people like the young woman I mentioned going through hell.</p> <p>  It seems to me that we should set aside the very interesting debates on whether there are 180,000 empty units, as the CSO suggests, or a percentage of that figure.  I do not know whether the percentage is 10%, 20% or 30%.  We have to find out the correct figure, as a matter of urgency.  There are no debates about probate or anything like that but there may be a debate about what conditionality should have been put on the off-loading of NAMA assets or whether NAMA assets should ever have been off-loaded in the teeth of a housing crisis like this one.  Either way it is simply unconscionable that there are perfectly habitable empty units that people like the young woman and her child that I mentioned could live in.  Instead, she is breaking down as a human being.  The damage that has been done to her child is impossible to fathom or calculate.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried to inject urgency into this question, which I echo.  I wish to add that it is just not good enough if the Government does not move, as a matter of absolute urgency, to ensure that not a single unit that could be inhabited by people who are at the sharp end of this appalling housing emergency.  I urge that any obstacles to getting people housed in these empty units are removed, as a matter of urgency.  Whatever measures that have to be taken and whatever taxes or penalties that have to be imposed in order to get those properties for the people who need them must be taken, and they must be taken now, because we have talked about this matter for years.</p> <p>  The amendment is a very modest effort.  It must operate within the constraints of the Finance Bill and what we are allowed to propose.  We cannot propose things that result in a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment seeks to compel the Government to do something about the obscenity of empty units sitting side by side with human misery and human tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister to take the amendment on board and do something about this matter.  </p></speech>

What my track record, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, looks like is an increase in the amount of resources available to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to deal with an issue that is unacceptable to me.  I want to see us, as a society, respond to the crises that have been identified by both speakers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.750" nospeaker="true" time="10:00:00" ><p>I want to make progress and comprehensively address the trauma of families with children being relocated in hotels.</p><p>Deputy Doherty spoke about the human face of homelessness and Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the human face of a case he had dealt with.  I have met families in similar circumstances and seen the anguish this has caused.  I have also heard the human stories but I am also aware of the prospects offered to people when new social accommodation is opened, for example, on the North Strand.  I am aware of the response of local communities to the opening of new sheltered housing units in Broombridge Lodge, Cabra.  I have experienced the response of people to the progress we are trying to make in O'Devanny Gardens, which includes social housing.</p><p>Alongside the human anguish to which Deputies referred and which I have also witnessed first-hand, I have seen the human consequences of housing solutions.  During my tenure as a member of Cabinet, we have delivered 80 housing solutions on each working day thus far in 2017 and we are aiming to increase this figure to 100.  I have provided funding to deliver our social housing targets, including the delivery by local authorities of more than 2,000 new homes, the acquisition of 1,250 homes, the delivery of 380 units through Part V acquisitions and the return to use of 1,400 vacant social homes.  This is being done as a result of the Government's commitment to address the housing issue and my commitment, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the best possible contribution to doing so.</p><p>In 2018, more than 3,800 social housing units will be built directly by the State and a further 4,100 social housing units will be delivered through vacant homes, acquisitions and long-term leasing arrangements.  This is part of the Government's response to the housing issue must be viewed in the context of our expectation that general housing completions will reach 24,000 next year versus 19,000 in 2017.</p><p>These measures are being delivered through Government and market action to increase housing supply and respond to many different challenges, including the crises to which a number of Deputies referred.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of some of the difficulties we are experiencing and the scale of the challenges we face.  He indicated he did not know the answers to some of these problems.  This is because we need to interrogate some of the figures further.  In some cases we do not have figures and we need to fix that.  The Deputy know this but his assessment is that we should proceed with the tax and make a principled commitment to introducing it, as is his right.  As Minister for Finance, however, I cannot make such a commitment until I know how much we will tax, what will be the scope of the tax and what derogations and exemptions we would need to introduce.  If we were to introduce such a tax without first addressing these issues, the Deputy would lambaste me and accuse of incompetence for not addressing them in advance.  That is how this would play out.  Introducing a tax without doing the necessary preliminary work would have consequences and I would face questions from the Deputies asking me to explain my failure to act competently, in the same way as I had to deal with issues in the previous D&aacute;il concerning the implementation of the local property tax.  Deputy Doherty raised issues with me at that time on the local property tax, which it is Sinn F&eacute;in policy to abolish.  Before making such a commitment in principle, I must first ensure certain policy matters are resolved.  A significant amount of work is being done in parallel at local authority level to convert vacant properties to use.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I have set out.  However, I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to rectify and address the different policy issues the Deputies have raised, for example, the issue of data collection which I genuinely need to address.  It is only when I have dealt with these matters that I will be in a position to evaluate whether this tax can be introduced.  As I stated, without doing such work, I will have to deal with the consequences of my failure to do address these issues before the tax was implemented.  Members of the Opposition would raise these consequences with me.  While I cannot accept the amendment, I will table an amendment on Report Stage outlining how the collection of data and policy matters will be crystallised.</p></speech>

I would have expected that the Minister would have seen sense over the summer period and would have ended the help-to-buy scheme.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Instead, despite the fact that the scheme is costing in the region of &euro;40 million per year, the Minister has extended its use.  It is a supply-side problem and this scheme does nothing to deal with the supply-side pressures.  Before I go into any further detail on this, I ask the Minister to outline why he believes it is appropriate to continue with the help-to-buy scheme given that there is no evidence to suggest that it is meeting the intended rationale proposed by the Minister on its introduction that it was an effort to help individuals to gather the deposits required to meet the Central Bank and that it would lead to increased supply.</p><p>This amendment calls for the Minister, within one month of the passing of this Act, to provide a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is my party's view that the help-to-scheme should not continue.  We have opposed it from day one.  It was a scheme that should never have been introduced.  It was done on the insistence of the Minister but with the support, through its policy of abstentionism, of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has literally put money into the pockets of developers and has led in no small way to the increase that we see, year-on-year, in house prices.</p></speech>

The scheme is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new build or self-build properties.</p> <p>  Following its introduction in budget 2017, and as a result of debate on the issue on this Stage of the Finance Bill last year, Deputies will be aware that Indecon Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake an assessment of the scheme.  The terms of reference for this review included an examination of whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.</p> <p>  The review was published as part of the budget documentation on 10 October.  It found that, to date, the incentive has not had a measurable effect on house prices, while it is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.</p><p>The report found that the supply of new homes was increasing modestly.  While the help-to-buy initiative does not appear to have had a direct impact on these supply levels to date, the report also noted it may be too early for this to have become apparent.  On the basis of these findings, and considering that the incentive has only been in operation for less than a year, I decided to allow the measure to continue in its current form for the coming year, subject to it being closely monitored and with a view to taking stock again prior to budget 2019.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of the help-to-buy scheme.  Its reports include the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio, and property type.  It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county.</p><p> My Department reviews taxation measures on regularly as part of the budgetary process.  Given the extensive nature of the Indecon report into the scheme, as well as the detailed statistics on the scheme published by Revenue on a monthly basis and the analyses undertaken by my own officials, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The Indecon report makes reference to that fact and says that it should not happen again.  No evaluation was carried out.  We had a big talk earlier about how homeless families could benefit, but the Minister said that he could not introduce a vacant property tax as he would need all the statistics and so on.  When it comes to putting money into developers' pockets however, the Minister just announces the measure and then carries out an evaluation a year later, an evaluation which basically says that it cannot tell whether the scheme has contributed to supply.  What it says is that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  That is the key issue.</p> <p>  What is happening out there while the Minister is messing about with this scheme and putting &euro;40 million of taxpayers money into developers' pockets?  Let us look at the figures.  There has been a 12.8% increase in property prices over the last 12 months.  Does the Minister know where we are going?  At this point, in November of this year, we have now exceeded the property prices of 2005.  Within two years, 24 months, at the current trajectory property prices in Dublin will exceed the peak of the boom.</p> <p>  Let me tell the Minister what the report said again.  It said that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  This is a con job.  People feel good when they get this money into their pockets but when the house they are trying to buy, in Dublin for example, at &euro;300,000 has gone up 12.8% in the last 12 months, any benefits are outstripped.  These people's mortgages will now have increased by &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000.  To draw down &euro;34,000 over a 30-year mortgage means one has to pay back &euro;65,000.  It is a complete and utter con job.</p> <p>  This is not leading to supply.  The other thing which the report says is that "[t]he HTB measure does not appear to have had any significant overall impact to date on the level of supply."  It has failed.  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us that this scheme was about supply.  He then told us that it was about helping people to get deposits together.  Lo and behold, a couple of weeks later the Central Bank changed the rules.  What does the report say?  It says that "[t]here is however likely to be some purchasers who did not need the incentive suggesting an element of deadweight and particular affordability issues remain for those on lower incomes."  The report tells us this.  It does not give the Minister comfort to continue with this scheme.  There is no evidence that this scheme is leading to supply.  </p> <p>  As the report says, there is legitimate concern that it is causing inflationary pressures on property prices.  We all know, because the statistics are there in black and white, that there is what is called deadweight in the scheme.  That is to say that the vast majority of people who are availing of the help-to-buy scheme are not those who require the scheme to meet the Central Bank's deposit requirements.  Why the hell is the Minister continuing with a &euro;40 million incentive?  This money goes directly into the pockets of developers.  At a time when there are constraints on supply, additional money provided into the system increases pressures.  Those pressures result in house prices increasing.  That is why we are seeing the type of increases in house prices we have seen in recent months.  </p> <p>  In the last year house prices in Dublin city have gone up by 13.9%.  They are approximately 103% or 104% above the 2005 baseline.  They are 24% off the peak prices.  The Minister should remember that we are on course to return to peak property prices within two years.  This is happening.  What can we do to stop it?  There are many things which we can do, but we can focus on this scheme for now.  As the report says, "there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices".  There is no reason in the world to continue this scheme.  The Minister can bluff and bluster all he wants but, as the report says, there is legitimate concern that the scheme is contributing to that 12.8% increase.  Once these increases happen, it will be very difficult to reduce them again, even when supply increases.  </p> <p>  The Minister is pricing many people in the Dublin market out of house ownership.  People of my generation and younger, people in their mid-20s, are telling me that they will never aspire to own a home.  It is simply beyond their reach.  These are people who are living and working in Dublin.  The opportunities which their parents had are no longer there.  They just cannot see a way forward because of current property prices.  We know where we are going.  House prices are increasing more rapidly now than ever before.  The help-to-buy scheme triggered some of that.  The Minister is continuing with a demand-side measure while there is a serious supply issue.  This does not make any sense on any level and there is nothing in the report which should tell the Minister that it does make sense at a time when house prices are increasing at the current rate and when there is inadequate supply.</p> <p>  I will point to one more issue, which I will come to again later as it relates to other things we must deal with in the Finance Bill.  In Dublin 50% of homes are being purchased by institutions, the Irish Real Estate Fund and so on.  They are outbidding first-time bidders.  These homes are not being bought by first-time bidders.  That is happening because in previous finance Bills the Minister incentivised those funds to snap up the very few houses which are available in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am strongly arguing that the help-to-buy scheme has no merit, that it should be immediately discontinued and, at the very least, it should be monitored in respect of its effectiveness and value for money.  I am putting the Minister on notice.  Just as the Minister is complicit in accepting and normalising homelessness because of his failure to act on a vacant house tax and to provide sufficient resources to build social housing, he is also facilitating the dramatic increase in house prices which will prevent a generation acquiring homes in areas of this city and elsewhere throughout the country.  </p> <p>  There is no point crying about this in a years' or in two years' time when we will all be asking how the hell we got back to peak property prices.  This is what will lead us there.  It will be because the Minister introduced a measure which was not thought out.  He commissioned a report which is inconclusive but which says that there are legitimate concerns that the scheme is a demand-side measure which is having no impact on supply and which also says there is deadweight in the scheme.  The Minister thinks that it is appropriate to continue giving &euro;40 million away on this measure.  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

The difference in the Government's approach to the idea of vacant sites and the help-to-buy scheme indicates that is not accurate.  Ideology has much to do with it.  The resources will be found for developers but will not be found for building homes directly, which is what is needed.</p><p> Where did the help-to-buy scheme come from?  Who was calling for it in advance of last year's budget?  It was the Construction Industry Federation, which had it in its manifesto.  It did not do so because it thought it would resolve the housing crisis but because it would benefit its members, namely, developers, who will end up with the bulk of this &euro;40 million of public funds every year.  There is no evidence to suggest this is having a positive impact in allowing people to access homes, but the Government proposes to continue to give developers &euro;40 million a year.</p><p> Last year, when the scheme was first presented, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued it would increase supply.  The only way it was ever going to increase supply was by increasing prices.  Accordingly, it has created a rat race for people trying to get on the housing ladder, a race they can simply never win.  They can have the illusion of having access to money but house prices are going up beyond them, still remaining out of access.  Then the money just gets transferred to the developers.  That is what has been happening over the course of the past year.  The sum of &euro;40 million is not a small amount of money, yet the Government proposes to continue without an evidential basis.  There was no evidential basis to start it in the first place, but the Construction Industry Federation called for it and the Government did it.  A report was commissioned but there is still no evidential basis for it and the Government intends to continue with it.  It is quite incredible and it gives lie to the fact there is not an ideology behind what the Government is engaged in.  There is precisely an ideology.  It is about incentivising the private sector to deliver homes by increasing prices.  The consequences of this are more problems for ordinary people and an overheating of the property market.</p></speech>

The Minister said in his initial contribution that the judgment on the help-to-buy scheme would be the extent to which it did or did not contribute to a rise in house prices.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, brought out a report today which stated house prices have gone up by 12.8% in the past year.  In Dublin, in the past three months, the average house price has gone up by &euro;17,000.  Clearly, any value that the Minister might even ascribe to this measure from the point of view of the home buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular rises in house prices.  The only beneficiaries of this scheme are developers and builders.</p> <p>  In the early phases of the debate about the housing crisis, the cry of developers as to why they could not deliver the supply everybody said we needed was because it was not profitable for them.  There was no doubt they wanted a dramatic rise in house prices and the Government obliged.  The Government is contributing enormous sums of money through this scheme as well as through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to subsidise those who are hoarding land, manipulating prices and lobbying the Government to boost their bottom line and ensure they can make a lot of money out of the housing crisis.  The Government is being dragged by the nose by these people.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity cost to this.  Every cent the Government gives to them is money that does not go into building public housing.  It is not just a debate about whether it is effective, although clearly in its own terms it is contributing to or failing to stop the spectacular rise in house prices.  The other side of the coin is it is money that could be going into public housing.  However, the Government continues, or in the case of HBFI and LIHAF, expand corporate welfare to the very people, the builders and developers, who landed us in this mess in the first place and who, even in the teeth of this extraordinary crisis, are still manipulating it to their own advantage.  It is extraordinary.</p> <p>  I heard an interesting contribution at the Right2Change conference last weekend from the head of the plasterers' union about the cost of housing.  Much of what we hear about the cost of building housing is actually the propaganda coming from the builders and developers.  He helpfully pointed out that when one breaks down the cost of building a house, it is between soft costs and hard costs.  The hard cost of building a house comes in under &euro;200,000.  To physically build a house one needs bricklayers, labourers, electricians, carpenters and the other associated trades.  The other costs are the profit-taking of the developers, the estate agents, the architects, the surveyors and so on.  As he simply pointed out, those costs would not exist if the local authorities were building houses because they already employ all of these people.  Half of the cost of building a house goes to people in the private sector, whereas if they were built by local authorities we would only have the hard costs with most of the soft costs covered by existing local authority architects, surveyors and so forth.  Accordingly, much of the profit-taking would not be necessary at all.</p> <p>  That is the opportunity cost of the Government's approach and its ideologically dogmatic approach of believing the market will solve it when clearly the market is the problem.  Worse, the market is manipulating the situation, and yet the Government continues to feed the monster.  It is inexplicable.</p></speech>

Given the limited time since the measure was introduced, a report inevitably can only represent a preliminary assessment and, in short, the assessment is inconclusive and it is too early to say.  The Government, to use the Taoiseach's words, is admonished for not doing an assessment in advance of introducing the scheme.</p> <p>  The scheme was announced in July 2016, the details were provided in the 2016 budget and it was enacted in last year's Finance Bill.  Indecon only had a short window of actual data on which to base its analysis.  What will the Minister do in a formal sense to ensure there is a proper assessment of the cost-benefit analysis of this scheme?  The measure of success for this scheme is whether it will boost supply.  Is it the Minister's view that the scheme is essential for viability to be achieved and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, for it to be profitable for builders to build houses in a commercial market, or is it already viable in the market, given the way prices have risen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.763" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#O00400"><p>I support this amendment.</p><p>It is important that we receive a detailed report on this matter.  I opposed the scheme when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, introduced it because it did what I forecast it would do.  There is no doubt that it generated interest in the housing market, particularly among younger people who wanted to buy houses before prices started to escalate and who had, perhaps, already accumulated significant savings.  In the Dublin West constituency, there are, as the Minister knows well, many houses being built.  The fact is, however, that the window through which someone in the process of buying could make a gain was less than six weeks because the builders just increased the prices dramatically when the scheme was confirmed.  Prices have been increasing ever since.</p><p> I appreciate that the Minister is now really caught in the cross-hairs in that it is almost impossible and extraordinarily difficult to withdraw a subsidy, particularly one relating to builders, once it is in place.  The Minister should take a deep breath, however, and determine the value of the scheme at this time.</p><p> A more fundamental question arises.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance is significant in this regard.  Does Fine Gael envisage that this country should be one in which it is legitimate to aspire to own one's own home?  There are those who spoke earlier who clearly believe that only local authorities should build houses.  That is a reasonable point of view but the local authorities do not want to build and several Ministers responsible for housing, including the current one, have been trying desperately to persuade them that this is the right thing to do.  For a variety of reasons, local authorities are not really engaged in building, other than in relatively small numbers and through housing associations.  Bearing in mind that we all know Dublin's inner city very well, the problem with the housing association model is that the scale of activity is too small to meet the demand.  The associations' activities are very good.  The associations can be excellent and extremely supportive, particularly of people whose personal experience or problems affect their ability to obtain a home.  If one comes through a period of homelessness, it takes time to recuperate.  It can be absolutely awful for many people.</p><p> I wish to focus on affordability, which is critical in the kind of democracy and society we have.  Let me use the example of a couple, perhaps in the Minister's Department, who have been working for ten to 12 years since graduating from college and who are now earning a reasonable amount of money and trying to save or, in the case of a select few, have access to the bank of mum and dad, thus allowing them to obtain some parental support.  The latter is particularly the case if one is from a middle-class family.  Parents may have valuable property, perhaps on the south side of Dublin.  How can the couple in my example afford to buy a house, particularly if they are married and have children, or want to have children, or if they are in a long-term relationship?  It is an existential question.  It may also be the case for the Minister, but I am constantly involved in conversations with people who spend entire weekends looking at new and second-hand houses in the hope they can beat the escalator that is operating at present.  The new home buyer's grant has driven this to an extent.  The Minister's predecessor wanted to send a signal to the market, and the market got its signal.  Prices were ramped up, but with no thought as to the wider social consequences.</p><p> Figures published recently show that the level of home ownership in Ireland is on a downward curve.  Traditionally, most people in secure employment over a long period, be they working for the council, the Government or a private company, could aspire to buying their own homes.  This trend is really under attack and the figures are sliding.  My question is a fundamental one for Fine Gael, notwithstanding all its rhetoric about ownership.  That figures are sliding is a dreadful comment on a Fine Gael-dominated and Fine Gael-led Government, and there is no sign that the slide has started to abate.</p><p> It is obvious, particularly in Dublin West, which is one of the largest development areas in the State and where approximately 1,000 houses are to be built at several different stages over the next three years, that land values are galloping once again.  This is where there is a problem with structure and in respect of which one must  consider actions one may be able to take and that certainly do not feature in the legislation.  There are a number of quoted property companies.  It is well worth their while, in terms of their stock market valuation, to sit on land because they are making money as they do so.  The young people we all know are locked out of being able to buy, not necessarily at a cheap price but at a favourable one that would allow them to start family life and have the security of having a home.  They will have very big mortgages but we know many families who, with two incomes, can actually manage in this regard.</p><p> Alongside this, there is an enormous need for social housing.  I feel very sorry for the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What capacity does he have to persuade the councils, on their own or together with housing associations, to scale up their activities in order to meet demand?  At any given time in Irish society, approximately 30% of people do not have the capacity to fund the purchase of houses, either because they are in precarious or occasional employment or as a result of the fact that they simply cannot buy a site at a reasonable price if they are in a rural area and have some capacity to self-build, perhaps with family support.</p><p> I have described the model that has been in place.  It was heavily ruptured by the crash and the collapse of the construction industry.  I am really interested in knowing what the Minister intends to do to restart the model.  There are many reports indicating that when NAMA offered apartments to local authorities, particularly South Dublin County Council and the others on the south side, they turned them down.  I include the councillors in this.  The apartments were turned down because, for some reason or another, a number of the areas in which they were located were not deemed to be appropriate for social or rented housing.</p><p> Irish history indicates that, for people on a good income, the rented housing model is not particularly sustainable.  It is a fantasy of the people writing the property pages that everybody should be happy to rent a house as they are in Germany and northern Italy.  If one rents a house in Germany or northern Italy, one can remain in it on an intergenerational basis.  Therefore, one is not turfed out if one's mother or father dies, and one can sustain the rent.  We really need to examine our models.  Could the Minister for Finance tell us a little about how the help-to-buy scheme has helped people other than those who were involved at the very beginning?</p><p>The initiatives the Government has taken are insufficient.  Many are very good, such as the allocation of funding, in which I was involved.  However, it is being spent far too slowly.  It is significant but I do not know what the Minister is going to do to speed up production.</p></speech>

The same types of calls were made prior to this budget and I said "No".  The members accusing me of having some kind of agenda to up the margin and profitability of developers at the expense of trying to help people buy a home are either not aware of or are choosing not to bring up the fact that when I was confronted with demands for the kind of policy choice that could realise that kind of agenda, I said I was not going to do it.  I did that because I will not bring in measures that artificially increase the profitability of some parts of our economy at the expense of genuine measures that can increase supply.  Colleagues who have centred their claims regarding what I am or am not doing on the anchor that I have some kind of agenda of trying to support parts of the construction sector at the expense of increasing supply should look at the decision I made in that instance when I said I would not do it.  The reason for that was because I had no guarantee or credible assurance that it was going to increase supply, nor had I any ability to withdraw the measure if it were to be put in place and to then deal with all the difficulties that would cause, as Deputy Burton touched on a moment ago.  I knew there was a risk that if I put such a measure in place there would be no certainty of an increase in supply and no way of telling what could happen at some point in the future at huge cost to the taxpayer.  Deputies Doherty and Murphy have made all kinds of assertions about my rationale behind this measure and what I am doing but they should go back to what I decided not to do in the face of the kind of claims and arguments that won at other points in our past when this type of issue was being dealt with.</p> <p>  I wish to address the report, what I am doing and the policy choice I have made, which is to maintain it.  I will deal with Deputy McGrath's question regarding how I will evaluate it in a moment.  The scheme is, as all members know, capped at or below just under &euro;500,000.  According to the figures published in the report I made available as part of the budget documentation, 53% of claims or draw down under the scheme are for properties priced at or below &euro;300,000.  A little more than 82% of claims are for properties valued at below &euro;375,000.  The draw down under the scheme is going towards properties we are trying to change the pricing of in order to make them more affordable for our citizens.  The figures I have shared with Deputies show that, for example, 36% of claims were for properties costing between &euro;226,000 and &euro;300,000.  That shows the scheme in its short history has been concentrated on the kind of pricing levels I want to influence and it could have the possibility to continue that in the future.</p> <p>  What is the central reason I have decided to maintain this scheme for another year?  I refer members to the words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said that he wanted to have a scheme in place to try to increase supply.  Given the nature of the market I am engaging with, all members know it would take longer than 12 months or, indeed, the eight to nine months the scheme has been in operation to know if a measure to increase the supply of a particular asset, in this case housing, with all the difficulties and requirements involved in the planning process, tendering and so on, is going to have a supply side effect.  It will take longer than that.  However, those are the price ranges against which claims have been made during the operation of the scheme.  As regards the assertion that the scheme has caused the kind of price inflation we are currently experiencing, 4,487 people, families or couples have accessed the scheme to date.  That is not enough for anybody to make the claim that the scheme is shifting the needle in terms of pricing levels.  What is more likely, as, in fairness, some members have acknowledged, is that the shortage in the supply of housing is affecting the pricing levels that I want to be moderated and move into line with people's ability to afford to buy a home.  Deputy Burton asked a question on that issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty made the point that I am complicit in trying to normalise issues he believes are unacceptable.  As I have said, I want to tackle and make progress in dealing with homelessness to a greater level than we are at the moment, and deal with social issues that are unacceptable.  I hope that one of these days when the Deputy is accusing me of normalising things that I also want to change, he might acknowledge the good things that are happening in the economy in terms of job growth, changes in living standards for some people and improved investment in public services and that I have played a role in those changes.  He is entitled to the view that there are issues with which I am not dealing correctly and I would never differ with his right to hold that opinion.  However, if he believes there are policy choices I am making that are contributing to difficulties, as he does, I hope he would at least have the ability to acknowledge that it is likely there are other policy choices I am making that are contributing to improvements in our economy and society.  There is a strong case for that but I acknowledge Deputy Doherty is not willing to concede that point.  He has accused me of being complicit with developers and in their back pocket.  I have pointed to a decision I refused to make as comprehensive evidence that I am not.  Just because I have a different view to the Deputy on a matter does not mean it is bluff and bluster.  I do not accuse him of that.  I have laid out my argument and the facts available to me to back up my case.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy made reference to a CIF report and the lobbying therein.  He might also acknowledge that I did not implement the main measure the CIF and others were looking for in the budget.  I have pointed to the effect of the scheme on particular price levels.  If this is a supply side measure it is going to take longer than six to nine months to evaluate whether it is having a supply side response.  That is the basis upon which I will evaluate the scheme in the run up to budget 2019.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett holds the view, and it is a legitimate and consistent one, that the State should be building nearly all the houses our citizens need.  His view is that the private sector is not capable of doing that at pricing levels he believes are affordable for the citizens we represent.  I take a different view.  I believe the State should play a significant role in respect of the supply and regulation of houses, which is why a policy shift to local authorities building homes as opposed to acquiring them is the right policy decision to make.</p><p>I also believe many of our citizens want to own the assets they are going to buy.  The private sector does have a role to play in regard to the supply of homes and the State and its institutions have a role to play in regulating that market and in ensuring it is not developed at the expense of the common good.  </p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath asked how I propose to deal with this issue in the run up to the next budget.  By the time I get to the next budget I will have more evidence to help me understand whether this scheme is leading to a supply side response.  This will be one of the key factors in regard to the retention of the scheme.  I refer the Deputies to table 71 of the Indecon report, which shows that 22% of the people surveyed in the context of this report, when asked whether this scheme was likely to incentivise more units over the next three years, responded No.  The remaining 78% responded Yes.  It is, therefore, reasonable for me to wait to see if a supply side response is forthcoming in advance of budget 2019.  </p><p> Deputy Burton asked for my views on housing ownership.  I want to have a housing market in which more of our citizens than is currently the case are able to afford to buy homes, where home ownership is a realisable objective for the majority of our citizens and where those who wish to rent, as is the case in other European markets, are able to rent in a more stable and diverse rental sector than is currently the case.  For those citizens who are not able to do either, the Government, through the local authorities, should be building homes.  We have increased the resources available to local authorities to enable them to do that.  The Deputy made an interesting point regarding whether local authorities are accessing that funding, which is a matter I am tracking.  My experience in the past has been that they have not not been doing so.  However, as indicated as recently as this week this year the local authorities will be drawing down the funding available to them in a way that we have not seen heretofore.  </p></speech>

He is wrong.  I have acknowledged them.  I have supported many of the measures brought forward by him in this Bill, some of which I referred to when I was addressing this issue, particularly the previous measure we discussed in terms of the write-off around returning vacant homes into stock.  It is unfair of the Minister to suggest that I have not acknowledged some of the positive measures he has introduced.  That said, as Minister for Finance and a member of the Cabinet he is responsible, collectively and personally, for the decisions he has taken that have created a homelessness and housing crisis and resulted in house prices escalating at a dramatic rate.  I am hearing nothing from the Minister in terms of plans to stop this worsening.</p> <p>  This time last year we heard from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that house prices had increased by 8% year-on-year.  Since then house prices year-on-year have increased by 12%, which is a 50% increase.  This equates to an increase of approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month in the value of the properties, which is putting the purchase of a home beyond the reach of many people.  Taking account of current trends property prices will reach peak point in the next two years.  This means that at that time house prices in Dublin will be the same as they were in February 2007.  How are we going to deal with that?  Even if house prices do not hit peak they will still be over-valued.  A four bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin costs &euro;440,000.  A 12% increase will put that house beyond the help-to-buy scheme because it will be close to or exceed the &euro;500,000 threshold.  This is where property prices are now.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the issue of the VAT reduction and I responded that it was a daft idea.  It was a daft idea.  I do not think the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is daft.  It knows exactly what it is doing.  Of course, it would have bagged the VAT reduction if it had been agreed.  What the CIF did in this regard was a lobbying ploy.  It raised the issue at a time when the Minister was reviewing the help-to-buy scheme.  When the CIF engaged with the Department of Finance last year the first item on its agenda was the help-to-buy scheme.  Because of public pressure and because every economist worth his or her salt is saying the help-to-buy scheme is not working and it is contributing to house price inflation there was speculation that it would be abolished or significantly changed.  The response of the CIF was to make an even bigger demand - a daft demand in my view - that it knew would never be realised and Fianna F&aacute;il rowed in behind it, as it has traditionally done in terms of the construction sector.  The CIF put a little political pressure on in relation to a demand it did not believe it would get to ensure the first item on its agenda, the help-to-buy scheme, was secure and lo and behold the Minister fell for it hook, line and sinker.  When it comes to negotiations one creates demands, all of which one does not expect to be met but help to secure one's main demand.  This is as old as day itself.  That is what happened.   Does the Minister genuinely believe we should be patting him on the back for not giving in to the CIF demand for a VAT rebate?  Does he not know he was played?  He mentioned he did not agree to it because he could not guarantee it would lead to an increase in supply.  He also cannot guarantee the help-to-buy scheme will lead to an increase in supply.  I am not the only one saying that: it is also stated in the report.  The Minister said that the withdrawal of the VAT scheme would cause problems.  The withdrawal of the help-to-buy scheme will also cause problems.  The Minister also said that he cannot measure the affect of increases in supply from the VAT rebate because of the lead-in period.  The same applies in respect of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is due to expire at the end of 2019.  </p> <p>  There is no reason this scheme continues.  The Minister stated that draw-down is in the region of &euro;300,000.  This scheme is available not only in Dublin but across the country.  House prices in the west are increasing at a higher rate than in they are in Dublin.  House prices in the north west are increasing at a lower rate but still above the 10% rate but those house prices are not at the &euro;400,000 mark.  Average house prices in many of those counties are &euro;180,000 or &euro;190,000.  The fact that houses eligible under the scheme are in the region of &euro;226,000 to &euro;300,000 means nothing unless the Minister can say that without the scheme house prices would have been cheaper.  He cannot say that.  It is not possible for him to do so.  The help-to-buy scheme does only one thing.  I am not saying that the Minister personally is putting money into the pockets of developers.  Rather than saying something behind the Minister's back I will say it to his face.  This scheme puts money into the pockets of developers.  We are supposed to scrutinise measures in terms of their effectiveness.  In terms of effectiveness and the help-to-buy scheme the State is transferring valuable resources that could be diverted elsewhere to persons who are purchasing houses but those properties, if in the capital city, are increasing at a rate of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month or &euro;30,000 per year, such that benefit of the scheme is lost to them and that money ends up in the property developer's back pocket.  The Minister's only argument for the continuation of this scheme is that he did not give in to the developers on the VAT reduction.  I thought that the Minister knew what was going on in that regard.  I probably believe that the Minister did know what the CIF was doing.  I encourage the Minister to talk to people becuase everybody knows what the game plan was in terms of the VAT reduction.</p><p>If the Minister for Finance thinks that they were the big guys standing up to the construction sector in this, I am sorry to inform him that he was played on it because the construction sector got exactly what it wanted.  The sector got the help-to-buy scheme continued for two years at a time when the Government was wobbling and, from the soundings coming out, it was possibly going to end the scheme or significantly restructure it.</p></speech>

It is recommended in the Indecon report that one be carried out after a period of time.  The consultants made the point that they were only able to make a very preliminary assessment.  The Minister has said that he will take into account the data and that he will be in a better position in advance of the next budget.  How will that happen and what will the Minister base it on?  Will the Minister commit to doing the detailed cost-benefit analysis that was requested?</p> <p>  Indecon made the point, and I agree with it strongly, that the key challenge for the housing market is to reduce the cost of housing, including house prices and the costs of construction.  I do not see any effort being made by the Government to tackle that issue to bring down the actual costs of delivering homes.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p> <p>  Goodbody forwarded an analysis by email just a few minutes ago.  The issue of the escalating prices is accelerating.  Goodbody makes the point that following the strong monthly growth seen in July and August, prices have risen at an annualised pace of 27% in the most recent three month period.  Goodbody is raising its outlook for growth in 2017, with an increase from a forecast of 12.5% up to 15% now looking a reasonable prospect.  It is actually getting worse and is accelerating.  I am not blaming the help-to-buy scheme for all of that, and nor is Goodbody in its assessment, but the key question is what the Government is doing to bring down the cost of delivering homes.  There is general agreement that supply is the main issue, but costs and prices are rising, and home ownership is going beyond the reach of more and more people as time goes on.  These are the key issues the Minister needs to focus on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.777" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#S00700"><p>Setting aside any questioning of the Minister's motives or agendas around builders, and I do not believe that he is in any way acting as a representative of those sectors, the measure is not working on its own terms.  That is the point.  Alternatively, the money could be put where it could contribute to resolving a disastrous situation.  This is the essence.  Any benefit to the buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular growth in property prices.  The beneficiary of those increases in prices are builders and developers.  There is absolutely no question that they are the beneficiaries and are making money out of this.</p> <p>  As prices go up, arguably an incentive such as this or assistance for the home buyer is also encouraging them to get into an unsustainable market.  Let us remember what happened the last time.  People are being encouraged to buy houses at unsustainable prices where mortgages are gargantuan and the burden they will carry will be disastrous if further done the line we have another crash.  From any point of view, it seems that this is not working.  Contrast this with where the funding could be diverted.  This situation is not just about this particular incentive.  The package of this scheme, involving the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, home building finance Ireland, HBFI, leasing, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, are all reliant on the private sector and the market to deliver.  I have just done a quick tot and of the &euro;1.83 billion in the budget, about &euro;1 billion is going to the market in various ways to try to get the market to solve the problem.  This is a disastrous strategy.</p> <p>  The Minister said that in putting an alternative, our proposal is that only the State should build public housing.  Deputy Burton implied that some of us are arguing for that, but that is not what we are arguing.  We do, however, argue that there needs to be seismic shift back in that direction.  The story of the past 25 or 30 years was that the proportion of housing built by the State has dropped to negligible levels.  If, as Deputy Burton has rightly said, some 30% of people cannot purchase housing at market prices through their own resources, what does this mean?  It means the State should provide 30% of the housing.  There is no plan for that in what the Minister is doing but it is what we should be aiming at.  This is what the State used to do back in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s.  The State built that proportion of the housing stock.  The vast majority of the moneys being allocated by the Minister to resolve the problem in one scheme or another are going to the market to try to encourage and incentivise it.  I accept that the Government in Rebuilding Ireland has somewhat and in a small way shifted, although mostly at the level of rhetoric, to saying that Ireland needs public housing.  Rebuilding Ireland is still relying overwhelmingly on the market and I do not believe it can deliver.  In so far as it may increase supply, it is going to do so at unaffordable prices.</p> <p>  We need a dramatic shift in where the State puts its resources.  Let the market look after the market.  People who want to purchase their own homes, and I accept that it is the majority, are not able to purchase now because the prices in the market have gone out of control.  They would also benefit.  I underline this point, particularly given the offensive rhetoric from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - not from the Minister for Finance in fairness - about "free housing".  The implication was that social housing is free.  Social housing is not free.  People pay rent according to their income.  The point is that a person can get a house and pay according to his or her ability.  The Taoiseach's comments about "free housing" suggest that those people who want council housing or who advocate for social housing are advocating free housing, as against people who pay for their housing.  That is absolutely offensive.  It indicates a certain mindset, which needs to shift.  I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe shares that mindset, but I believe that he shares the ideological blinkers that have been put on governments because of the shift towards neoliberal thinking that has dominated for the past 25 to 30 years.  I urge the Minister for Finance to take off those blinkers and recognise that the only way Ireland can provide affordable housing is to get back up to 30% of housing being built directly by the State.  This would also stabilise, or bring down, house prices in the private market.</p> <p>  If the Government wants to bring prices down for the ordinary home buyer, it should build more council houses.  That is how it could stabilise the market.  When we give more and more incentives to developers to solve the problem, they will just use them, manipulate them and profiteer from them.  They will land hoard and release supply only when it suits them and they can make money.  They will stop the supply when they think it does not suit and when they cannot make enough money.  This is our point.  The signs are on it when we consider the experience of the past ten years, or even what has happened in the past year or two.  This is what is happening.  The Minister should consider taking on board the points we are making.</p></speech>

The housing market is beginning to expand and a significant number of houses are being built, particularly in my constituency, but it is not enough.</p><p>They are nowhere near the numbers required.  That applies to councils which are building, organisations which are building houses for rent and the private sector.</p><p> Notwithstanding all of the money being pumped in which ought to be sufficient to address the crisis, there is a failure of market regulation.  I would be the first to acknowledge that regulating the building market is intensely difficult.  It means dealing with very diverse individuals and much of the market is still only recovering from the crash, particularly for smaller and medium-sized builders.  We are talking about the perfect storm.  The industry is not even bothering to train apprentices.  In three years we will be crying out to have people brought here from other countries to build the houses we will still need.  The actions taken are not near adequate.  In that context, the proposed amendment is extremely modest.  It would provide for ongoing reporting on effectiveness and value for money achieved and the manner in which they will be monitored.  The Minister for Finance has a key power when it comes to oversight and monitoring.  I draw his attention to one element of the market that is causing huge problems in Dublin.  Because of the extraordinary increase in the price of housing land, for those involved in the provision of finance capital through companies on the Stock Exchange, bank investment or other investment vehicles, it is highly profitable to sit on land and do nothing.  That is not acceptable.  We know that there are delays in providing road and bridge access and so on.  However, there are also people who are consciously sitting on land and because of this the pace of development is being slowed down.  The value of so many portfolios is being elevated by the surge in land values and house prices.  The Minister really does have to act.  I support the amendment-----</p></speech>

The Minister knows these sites as well as I do.  They include O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street.  What is to happen in the provision of affordable housing in O'Devaney Gardens?  The council may finally move to provide some social housing.  The site has now been idle for 12 years or more.  The position is the same in the case of the site on Dominick Street.  These are prime sites that it would be wonderful to have in any city.  It is really due to market failure if we cannot move on these sites.</p></speech>

Section 664 provides for the tax free receipt of rental income from certain long-term qualifying leases of farm land.  The previous anti-avoidance provisions were inserted to prevent the exploitation of the provision by persons entering into cross leases of land in order to both generate tax free income and an allowable deduction.  It has come to my attention that a drafting error was included in the Finance Act 2015, a measure which may render the anti-avoidance provision inoperable.  The purpose of this amendment is therefore to rectify this error.  The words &quot;lessor&quot; and &quot;Lessee&quot; in section 664(8)(a) and (b) were transposed.

It is an investor-based tax relief under which an investor can obtain tax relief for investing in certain early phase companies.  On advice from the Attorney General, I am proposing to make a number of amendments to the incentive.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that EII is compatible with the General Block Exemption Regulation, GBER.  Under GBER, countries cannot give aid to individuals to invest in a company of which they are already a shareholder.  The GBER requirement has applied since October 2015.</p><p>The amendments I am proposing provides that a person who has a shareholding in a company, or whose relative has a shareholding in a company, may, from 2 November 2017, no longer claim relief under EII for an investment in that company.  This restriction will not apply if an individual and his or her relatives make their investments in the company while it is still at very initial stages before it commences any of its activities.  I should also emphasise that this restriction will not apply where an individual is only connected with a company through a prior investment to which EII relief applied.  Some &euro;30 million in relief is provided to investors under the scheme each year.  The value of relief affected by this change was in the order of &euro;6 million to &euro;10 million per annum.  I commend this amendment.</p></speech>

This proposal will remove that five-year exemption.  This amendment provides that exemption will apply to the profits arising on land disposed of prior to 1 January 2019.  Distributions out of the profits of such deposit disposals after that will be subject to the normal Irish real estate fund, IREF, withholding tax rules.</p><p>Given the changes I am making elsewhere in the Finance Bill 2017 on capital gains tax and stamp duty, I felt it was important that these provisions were also amended for consistency.

Does the Minister of State now agree that the tax break for properties held for at least five years should not have been included in the Finance Bill 2016?  At the time it was objected to by ourselves, and possibly others, on the grounds that it encourages property hoarding as well as being a big tax break.  Is there an admission that that was a mistake - not a mistake accidentally made, not a drafting error, but a mistake of policy?</p></speech>

With the movements in capital gains tax and stamp duty, and the attempts to ensure that more land is made available for development for building, circumstances change.  Circumstances arise depending on what has happened in the previous 12 months.  We are not satisfied with the quantity of land that has been made available or the quantity of building that has happened in the last 12 months, and we feel this is a better system structure for the coming year.</p></speech>

I say that because it is important to get to the core of this.  This was the major argument in the Finance Bill last year.  The Minister of State should look over the transcripts.  We kept going back over this on Committee and Report Stages.  We argued with the Government at the time that the five-year exemption from dividend withholding tax was a loophole that it was deliberately putting into the Finance Bill.  I argued very strongly that people who bought properties not just last year, but four years from then, could have no dividend withholding tax from the capital gains tax, CGT, payable.  This was a major issue.</p> <p>  Following up on that through a freedom of information request, I found that officials were communicating the fact that this could lead to hoarding before this measure was introduced to the Finance Bill and signed off.  We were unaware that there were those concerns within the Department, but we were still making the argument that this would lead to an escape from huge amounts of tax and have an effect on the property market.</p> <p>  I put forward the idea in the first place for a dividend witholding tax and I have campaigned vigorously to end the five-year CGT exemption, which is an incentive that makes it more profitable for funds to hold onto vacant lands for a period of five years than to sell them off.  The reason it is more profitable is that the Government argued black and blue with me, and with others in this committee, that that was the right thing to do.</p> <p>  It is not about circumstances, CGT, stamp duty and all the rest.  The Government got this seriously wrong.  There was a bit of arrogance last year on this issue.  THe Government would not listen to members of the Opposition who were pointing out the problems there at that time.  I welcome the fact the five-year CGT exemption or the dividend witholding tax exemption is going to be gone.  However, there is a lesson here.  We can talk about new politics and all the rest.  It is not a case of saying that we were right and the Government was wrong; this has caused damage at this point.  There are properties that could have been sold in bloc format, the way properties were sold by NAMA to investors, that have not been sold.  This is because it was more beneficial for them to hold on and avail of the five-year CGT exemption.  Those properties are in this city.  This is something the Government was aware of during that time, but it continued to march on with this ill-conceived idea.</p> <p>  We are closing a loophole, but I am not sure who applied the pressure.  I am sure certain people lobbied.  I would like the Minister of State to put on record whether there was any lobbying of the Department of Finance on introducing the five-year CGT exemption on dividend withholding tax, or the dividend witholding tax exemption.  If there was lobbying at the time, can the Minister of State inform this committee who was lobbying the Department or the Minister?</p></speech>

However, let us deal with the amendment that is before us.  Can the Minister of State explain to us the significance of the disposal date, which is 1 January 2019, and also how that interrelates with the date of the taxable event occurring on or after 19 October 2017?</p></speech>

It would be very sudden to remove the measure just one year after its implementation.  Doing so would negatively affect Ireland's international messaging on the certainty of our tax system, which is crucially important to investment.</p><p>Signalling the change one year in advance will help to address any negative effect this change might have regarding confidence and certainty in the tax system.</p><p> The provision was put in place this time last year.  It is being removed this year and rather than have a very disruptive alteration as quickly as that, we think it is right to give an opportunity to others to assess the impact the provision will have on their investment. </p></speech>

This is why the provision is incentivising people to hoard instead of sell.  If an owner holds the property for four years then it is better to hold on to it for another 12 months in order to be exempt from the dividend withholding tax when one disposes of the property.  If one bought the property in 2014 then one will no longer be able to avail of the exemption because the new provision kicks in on 1 January 2019 and, therefore, the five years would not have elapsed.

By the end of December 2018, however, five years will have elapsed so one will get the exemption.  That means the provision incentivises the investor to sit on the vacant land, to do nothing with it even though we are in the middle of a housing crisis and hold it for another year because it is of major financial benefit to the owner and its shareholders, due to a 20% exemption on the dividend withholding tax on the gains that are realised on the property.  Let us remember this is property that was bought by investors in 2013.  Can the Minister of State tell me the uplift in property prices from 2013 to 2017?  There has been a dramatic increase in prices.  This is why there is now a huge incentive for these companies to stash land.</p> <p>  The provision, in terms of ending the CGT dividend withholding tax exemption, is the right thing to do and we argued for it last year.  By not allowing it to kick in for another year the Government is incentivising a cohort of investors who invested during the period 2013 to 2014 to continue to hoard residential properties and apartment blocks and units that were bought by NAMA.  I refer to the conversation that was in the reply to the freedom of information request.  </p></speech>

The properties are not being sold off because the companies will benefit from the CGT exemption after five years.  I am also referring to individuals who bought, from NAMA, land that is currently undeveloped.  The individuals will not develop or sell on the land because to hold on to it, at this point in time, is more financially beneficial to them.</p></speech>

He has discussed sections in isolation.  He mentioned a piece of land owned by a company or an investment stream and assumed that there is a gain on the purchase of a single parcel of land.  The provision will work, and we anticipate it will work, as follows.  If a company or an investor has a gain and reinvests it then there will not be a gain on that occasion.  What the Deputy has said is correct, potentially, if one takes a single parcel of land and it is operated in isolation of the entire business that is a company or an investment stream.  What he has said, in isolation, can be correct.  The point is property investment companies or individuals tend not to operate purely in isolation.  If they do move something, and benefit by not paying the 20% withholding tax and they have a capital gain, but they subsequently reinvest that then it is still not liable anyway.</p></speech>

The Government would not be closing down this loophole if that was the case.  The Government is closing down the loophole because it knows fine well that it engineered a loophole into the Finance Bill last year that incentivised people to hoard land and property.  I welcome the fact that the loophole is being closed but I am disappointed that it will continue for a year.</p> <p>  The Minister of State talked about certainty for investors and all of the rest.  What about certainty for the people who need homes?  The Government must get its priorities right.</p></speech>

There is no ifs, buts or maybes about that.  The Government can vote for that and Fianna F&aacute;il can abstain if it wants but the Government needs to understand the consequences of the provision.

A total of 85% is foreign investment.  They are structured in such a way as to benefit foreign investors - that is the point.  These are foreign investors.  This is why it is so important for the dividend withholding tax to be paid.  The rate is set at 20%.  We will come to this point later, but they do not actually pay 20% because of double tax treaties and other issues that we can discuss later.  The Government is facilitating for another year the vast gains paid out to the foreign investors and no tax will be paid.</p> <p>  These are the big boys who came in at the bottom of the market in 2013.  That is the year the legislation is specifically targeting.  It was when the market was almost at the bottom of the trough.  They snapped up properties for next to nothing.  The properties increased in value dramatically over the following five years.  Yet, the Minister of State is trying to convince us to support a measure that would allow them to continue not paying on the vast gains they will make.  As bad as that is and as much as it stinks, the policy is also about incentivising them.  If they were thinking about selling up now or developing, the policy is an incentive to hold on for another 12 months and then they can leave the State tax-free with their gains.  That is what the Minister of State is trying to convince us about.  It does not stack up.</p></speech>

I remind him that we needed foreign equity to come in to try to move the property market.  The Deputy should not ignore where we were back then.  He is simply taking the negative and suggesting that everything was perfect.  We needed foreign funds to come in to the Irish residential property sector and the commercial real estate sector.  Many of those companies have come in.  They are building all over this city and throughout the remainder of the country.  Deputy Pearse Doherty should not ignore that.</p></speech>

We have decided that, as a result of providing tax certainty, the measures will kick in 14 months from now.  We believe it is important for a jurisdiction to have tax certainty.  This means we should not change an aspect of the policy in one budget and then alter it subsequently.  We do not believe that is good tax business.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  The Irish property market has been chaotic.  We believe this is the right thing to do now.  We believe that January 2019 is the right period for this to kick in.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State at the Department of Finance explain why it would decide to dispose of that land now, when the Government is indicating, through the Finance Bill, that if it holds on to the land for another 12 months, it will not pay the 20% dividend withholding tax on the gains relating to it?  Does the Minister of State not understand that if I represented the fund and he were speaking to me, the policy is encouraging me, if I have the interests of my shareholders at heart, to hold on to this land for a further 12 months?  We hear all the words from Ministers and the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il when they are doing soundings and so on about the property crisis.  However, this is what it boils down to: the Government is engineering into the Finance Bill an incentive to hoard land.</p> <p>  The Government cannot have it both ways.  I want the Minister of State to acknowledge that he is doing this with his eyes wide open.  If the Government wants to push ahead with it, that is fair enough &ndash; I cannot stop him.  We are not strong enough or well represented enough in this committee to do so.  However, it is my responsibility to at least ensure that the Minister for Finance and the members of the committee who vote for, against or abstain in respect of this measure understand the exact consequences of it.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has rightly taken us back to when the market was bottomed out in 2013.  However, the strategy that the Government adopted at that point has turned out to be a disastrous folly.  The theory was that by giving vast tax breaks to these investors, we would do something positive for the market.  What we actually did was hand over vast wealth to these vulture funds.</p> <p>  It was obviously a concerted strategy.  In fact, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was straight-up about it.  We now know he was busy meeting representatives from all these funds and actively encouraging them to come in.  No doubt, he was telling them they would get favourable tax treatment and that they would walk away paying no tax on the capital gains, which, we now know, are absolutely astronomical.  Even then, it would not have taken a rocket scientist to know that when the market was bottomed out these people were going to gain in a major way.  There was only one way the market was going to go at that stage, namely, up.</p></speech>

Some of us at the time were saying that NAMA should have behaved differently.  This might indeed explain the mystery of a case I brought up with the Minister for Finance earlier.  It related to apartments in Sandyford.  In that case, NAMA was sitting on empty properties and then sold them to a vulture fund.  The vulture fund then sat on the empty properties while there were homeless people all around.  It is a mystery.  Why was this happening?  Perhaps it was for precisely this reason: the decision was to simply sit on the property and let the value go up.  Then, the owners would walk away with a vast capital gain and pay no tax on it.</p> <p>  The Government is not moving immediately to close that down and is allowing it to play out.  I suspect that is because the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, said it was guaranteed and that the Government would not do anything.  It is a little like what I suspect also happened with Apple &ndash; we will move on to that discussion later.  In those critical years of 2013 and 2014, a great deal of running around was done by the then Minister.  He was talking to big corporations and property investors and telling them that the Government would look after them on the tax front.  These funds moved in and the consequences have been disastrous.</p> <p>  The Government has somewhat belatedly acknowledged this by making some moves to close down the loophole.  However, it seems to be extending it for one year because of some sort of principle of honour or because we have to honour the deal with these vulture funds.  The Government should forget it.  We should close it down now, recognise that we made a big mistake and recover whatever ground and revenues we can.  We should close down the incentive for these people to continue immorally and obscenely hoarding land and property when thousands of our citizens need places to live.</p></speech>

That is my interpretation of what members are saying to the Minister of State.  It may be better to withdraw the amendment for the moment and come back to it.  If the Minister of State is referencing about vulture funds and we have had much discussion of how they purchase property and in view of their being managed by organisations such as Capita and so on and the type of disruption they are causing in people's lives, be that business or residential, I want to know far more about the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has mentioned he thinks four or five funds will benefit from the CGT exemption.  We should get as accurate information as possible on how many of those entities will benefit from the extension and factual detail on the quantum of assets in question, which the Minister of State has estimated.</p></speech>

Many members have a different experience.  We should remember that many of the vulture funds in question have no plans to reinvest here and are in it for the short term.  A well-known maxim is that when there is blood spilled on the floor, it is time to go in.  That is what happened here.  The quantum of money we would lose in tax is a scandal, as is the fact this is holding up potential housing development at a time of emergency in that area.  However, that should be considered in light of what the funds have been achieving over that period of time.  Funds that invested in the period around 2013 will now benefit from the CGT exemption.  In 2014, commercial property returns in the State were the highest in the world.  There was a return of 40.1% on commercial property in 2014 because in 2012 the economy started to pick up and in 2013, it was already back on a growth trajectory.  That is why I say it was close to the bottom of the trough.  The Minister of State has said we needed the funds and all the rest and nobody knew what way it was going to go.  He should read any academic analysis of the situation such as that of Morgan Kelly or the NAMA report that led to its establishment and which foresaw property prices getting back to a sustainable level within ten years.  That was all well signalled and the funds knew that.</p> <p>  We can argue about whether we needed them.  I am not sure what benefit they supplied.  They snapped up properties from NAMA at rock bottom prices and made massive profits running to billions of euro on them.  They paid no taxes on those profits and the Government is now going to facilitate them further in paying no tax on profits.  Can the Minister of State tell me or anybody listening to these proceedings why the State needed them?  What benefit did they give the State?  The only benefit is their shareholders became extremely rich.  The companies that serviced the funds' legal structures got quite wealthy.  However, the funds did not service the interests of the State.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain how Irish citizens benefitted from vulture funds coming in and buying from the State, through NAMA, at rock bottom prices, flipping those properties within a short period of time for, in some cases, double, triple or quadruple the price for which they bought them and in other cases holding the assets in order that they can leave Ireland without paying tax.  How did the State benefit from that?</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State could give us a detailed note on this issue.  To be honest, this information is extremely complex.  I heard him say that this is an amalgam of different types of funds.  The fact is that we do not have the analysis we need.  I would say we need a very detailed note on this matter.  Some of the explanations are making it more rather than less complicated.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the budget, he said he would bring forward amendments on Committee Stage relating to the five-year capital gains tax exemptions for the IREFs.  We have not heard an explanation of why that should be renewed.  For how long will it be renewed?  What is the context for its renewal?  What kinds of investments are we talking about?  I need to have some of that information.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said on budget day that he was going to introduce this measure, he flagged that we would be given explanations and details.  I think we need them now.</p></speech>

He indicated in his opening remarks on this amendment that the potential exists for other amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  I would like to know the thinking on those amendments because it is relevant to what we are discussing now.  Have the windows for first returns in respect of IREFs passed at this stage?  I think the relevant dates were in January and July.  IREFs have had a legal basis since January 2017.  Were there returns in July?  Do we have data on the withholding tax and so on?  If concerns regarding the hoarding of land have led to this policy change, can the Minister of State explain what purpose will be served by providing for a delay of a further year?</p></speech>

Before lunch I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the fact that increases in land values are giving people involved in funds a perverse incentive to sit on lands while such increases continue.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this problem, which is being discussed widely.  Regardless of whether we are ultimately talking about fund valuations or something like a limited company - I appreciate that different structures are involved - there continues to be a perverse incentive to make gains and see valuations rise by sitting on lands.  I have significant concerns about the current tendency of various entities to sit on land at a time of remarkable speculation in land prompted by substantial increases in property values.  At a time of severe housing shortages - I refer not only to affordable and social housing but also to houses for purchase - this country cannot afford to have people hoarding and sitting on land for the purpose of accumulating valuation increases.</p></speech>

The current approach offers an incentive to evict people.  These capital gains tax breaks incentivise funds to evict people and they are acting on those incentives.  When they evict people, the value of the property increases.  This is what the funds are doing.  I am dealing with a property in my area that has been bought by one of these funds - I am not sure of the exact year, but I am almost certain it would have been in the period in question - which is evicting people in order to drive up the value of the property.  To my mind, that is another outrageous consequence of these tax breaks.  We are incentivising these funds to increase their capital gains before walking away tax-free.</p> <p>  I have another question that I would like the Minister of State to answer, although I suspect that he cannot or will not do so.  Do we have figures for the tax that would be gained or forgone, depending on whether we extend this relief?  I see somebody shaking their head, so I suspect the answer is "No", which is fairly shocking in and of itself.</p></speech>

We have figures for them, so we know what are the tax expenditures.  We know how much tax is forgone in those categories.  As far as I know, although I would be happy to be enlightened, we do not know how much tax is going to be forgone as a result of this extension.  Do we have estimates?  We have just estimated how many firms or funds will benefit from it and what the quantum of assets will be.  Do we have estimates for how much tax will be forgone if we extend this or if we do not do so?  Do we have figures not just for the beneficiaries of this capital gains tax extension but also for the overall amount of tax forgone as a result of the extension?</p></speech>

The argument is that we need tax certainty, but there was no such need for tax certainty when it was introduced to the benefit of these vulture funds.  The Government was able to introduce it immediately, but now that it is being withdrawn it seems that a certain amount of time must be provided in the interests of having an environment of tax certainty.  The Government and the D&aacute;il are entitled to change legislation.  We are not talking about a retrospective measure here.  We have a right to change the tax code.  There seems to be a suggestion that the Government should be blackmailed because it has, in effect, promised these funds that they will not pay tax.  If the Government does not recognise that as a problem, that is fine.  It does not want to admit that the problem was evident a year ago.  The idea that they will still be able to benefit for reasons of tax certainty, even though it has been recognised that this is a problem, is a bit ridiculous.</p></speech>

There are approximately 100 IREFs, four or five of which are widely-held funds, or pension funds, in effect.  Four or five funds have had the benefit of not paying the 20% withholding tax.  The same funds will have that benefit over the next 12 months up to January 2019.  It is important to note that if they are pension funds, they are exempt in any event.  The funds in question are not vulture funds.  It is important that there is full understanding of what we are talking about and dealing with.</p></speech>

There is a long-standing practice whereby members of a committee ask for notes from which a Minister is visibly reading.  There is no reason members should not be given a copy.  That is a normal courtesy, if I may say so, which is extended by all Ministers.</p></speech>

However, there is an amendment before us.  Unless the Minister of State is going to withdraw the amendment to allow us to examine the note, there is a problem.  Perhaps we can go into private session, listen to the explanation from the officials, request the Minister of State or the officials to provide the note, if necessary, thereafter and request the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment until such time as the members can consider it.  That is open to members; it is for me to explain.</p></speech>

There is very significant income volatility and in recent years, there have been improvements in the taxation environment to deal with it.  In particular, the income averaging system was an important reform.  Last year, the opt-out provisions for one year were also a very significant help.</p><p>Problems persist, as the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will be aware.  Farmer organisations put forward a number of different options to provide for greater stabilisation in respect of income volatility.  I have looked at a number of them.  I am sure the Department engaged and considered them as well.  In that regard, the purpose of putting down this amendment is to call for a report examining the feasibility of introducing further provisions to deal with the issue of income volatility for farm enterprises.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1026" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#PP00100"><p>I think I am the only farmer in the room.  I may know a little bit more.  I fully recognise that farm income volatility can be a prevalent feature of the agricultural sector.  In response to this, a targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging regime.  This scheme has been in place since the introduction of farm taxation.  It provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out the income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  In effect, one fifth of the farmer&rsquo;s profits and losses for the five years is charged for a year.</p> <p>  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility, my Department sought to introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to reflect this new reality and to maximise the number of farmers who can level out volatile incomes through the averaging system.  In the Finance Act 2014, the availability of income averaging was extended to permit farmers in receipt of income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession to elect into the averaging regime.  The period of income averaging was also extended from three to five years, thereby providing a longer timeframe over which income volatility can be smoothed.  In the Finance Act 2016, an optional so-called step-out from the regime was introduced for farmers to ease financial pressures and improve cashflow for farmers in a year when they experience lower than expected incomes.</p> <p>  In addition, following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed, I have committed to continuing our engagement on exploring further taxation measures for income stabilisation and undertaking a review of agricultural tax incentives more generally in advance of budget 2019.  This will include an examination of existing schemes, including income volatility measures, as well as engagement with relevant stakeholders.  The aim of the review will be to ensure that these schemes are operating in an efficient and effective manner and meeting their policy objectives in this area.</p> <p>  Therefore, on the basis that there is already a targeted tax measure available to full-time farmers under the income averaging regime and considering that I have already committed to undertake a review of agricultural taxes more broadly prior to budget 2019, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Subsequently, in budgets 2015 and 2016, some of these were presented.  There will be a review of all reliefs in the agriculture tax review.  There will be an update and particular reference to income stabilisation.  As I said in a slightly glib way, I understand the pressures on farmers in respect of income volatility.  To put it into context, milk prices for November 2019 will be &euro;0.42 per litre.  Some 16 months ago they were between &euro;0.19 and &euro;0.21 per litre.  The volatility of milk prices internationally on the world market means the price for this product can be halved in a period of 12 to 14 months.  There are very few industries in which that is the case.  While the situation has improved a lot in the past 15 to 18 months, volatility is a serious factor in agriculture at the moment.  We are doing a full review next year.  Income stabilisation will form a substantial part of that review.</p></speech>

That amendment is no longer being pressed as a result of the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption for non-resident investors in Irish real estate funds, IREFs, now being dealt with in the previous section.</p><p>There are a number of amendments in this grouping.  To keep the debate focused, we should try to deal with them individually.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a report to be laid before the D&aacute;il within six months of the passing of the Act on the ability of certain investors in IREFs, including pension funds and other investment funds, to neutralise their tax liability in respect of either incomes or gains from Irish property held by such funds.  This leads on from the conversations we had earlier in public and private sessions of the committee in respect of the make-up of a certain number of IREFs.  Some would have a large involvement in pensions, both Irish and European institutional pension schemes and investors.  We know that, as a result, pension funds investing in IREFs are able to avail of not paying any tax.  We need to deal with that.  I am asking that a report be brought forward on the options in dealing with it.  Certain investors in IREFs, including pensions funds and international investors, can pay no income, corporation or capital gains tax on their income or gains from Irish property.  Many feel that this is simply wrong.</p><p>For example, the IPUT fund has Irish property assets of &euro;2.2 billion.  AIB recently signed a 20 year lease with this fund, which is moving in from Ballsbridge to AIB's corporate headquarters in the centre of Dublin in 2019.  The group's contracted annual rental return for 2017 is expected to be &euro;102 million.  However, 79% of this fund is owned by pension funds and institutional investors, meaning that the vast majority of its incomes and gains are not subject to taxation.  That is a major gap.  The fund has &euro;2.2 billion in Irish property assets and a rental book of &euro;102 million, yet 79% of its gains and income is not subject to Irish taxation.  This goes back to the point about taxing property and the rights here in terms of such taxation and the benefits that arise from property.</p><p>We can look at these funds and examine who really benefits.  Certain individuals benefit from them.  The lawyers obviously benefit from the structures that are put in place.  In terms of the number of staff this fund has, which one would think would be quite large given the turnover in annual rental income and assets of &euro;2.2 billion, it employed 19 people in 2016.  If we were to look at their pay bill, we would say it was large at &euro;5.3 million.  The average cost per employee is therefore about &euro;279,000 per year.  Certainly, they can afford to pay wages of that scale.  The vast majority of the income and profits they are recording is not taxable.  In respect of institutional investors, Irish institutional pension schemes make up 42% of the fund.  European institutional investors make up 37% of it.  Then we have Irish investment managers at 17% and Irish charities and universities at 4%.</p><p>I do not believe that is a healthy way to go forward.  We need to consider issuing a report on how and whether we can bring in measures that would see an appropriate level of taxation of some of these funds, which would have within them investments from pension schemes and other institutional investors that are not subject to tax.</p></speech>

The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property.  Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax Acts.  The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy&rsquo;s point in relation to pension funds and investment undertakings, I note that these entities are investment vehicles.  As such, they do not pay tax on the profits generated within the vehicle.  Tax is instead operated at the time that the investor, be it the pensioner or the unit holder, draws a benefit down from the pension fund or investment undertaking.  Pension funds and investment undertakings are, therefore, among a class of investors that can make a declaration that IREF withholding tax does not arise.  This is on the basis that the profits will ultimately be taxed at the investor level.  I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from Irish real estate funds will be filed in the middle of next year.  At that point, Revenue will examine the IREF taxable events in respect of which IREF withholding tax could have applied and identify reasons why such withholding tax was not operated.  If any areas of concern are identified, these will be addressed.</p> <p>  In relation to the IREF withholding tax exemption for gains on assets held in an IREF for more than five years, as we have discussed, I have brought forward an amendment such that it will not apply to disposals on or after 1 January 2019.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced by the Finance Act 2013.  The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property.  REITs must be widely held, as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a close company, that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer participators.  A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property.  No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT.  The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.</p> <p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible to share the information sought by the Deputy with the committee, or indeed with myself.  However, I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division has a dedicated team which looks after REITs.  As the REIT regime was introduced in Finance Act 2013 that team is, as part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies.  Should any issues arise from that review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials.</p> <p>  I cannot commend the amendments to the committee, but I assure the Deputies that both the IREFs and REITs are being kept under review.</p></speech>

How does the Minister stand over that?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that we have an issue with pensions in Ireland and we are proactively trying to encourage people to take out pensions and to invest for the future.  There are a number of reliefs available and, in 2013, with REITs and IREFs we were trying to get people to invest in Irish property.  Perhaps we could ask the tax strategy group to review it as they will report next summer, just a couple of months after the six months proposed in the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

We want to encourage people to take out pensions but less than half the country has a pension.  We should not forgo tax on billions in Irish property so that the other half can get a better pension.  This other half has larger incomes.  Some 37% of the IPUT portfolio is made up of European institutional investors, as opposed to Irish institutional pensions schemes, so a large section is going untaxed.  A fundamental principle is that property should be taxed in the country where it is situated.  There are other issues which we will deal with in the other amendments but I welcome the proposal that the tax strategy group deal with this and I will withdraw my amendment.  If the tax strategy group carries out a review of the tax structure within IREFs that allows individuals to neutralise or significantly reduce tax, and comes up with proposals to deal with this, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

I briefly discussed the effect of the help-to-buy scheme on property prices with the Minister for Finance.  It is clear from CSO figures that REITs and IREFs are hoovering up a huge amount of property across the State, particularly in Dublin.  The latest figures I have show that &euro;13 billion of property is in funds, though the Minister suggests it may be &euro;16 billion.</p></speech>

The total value of Irish property within these funds is between &euro;18 billion and &euro;19 billion.  The CSO has revealed that non-household buyers, a large proportion of which comprise REITs and IREFs, had purchased 42% of new homes in Dublin by the end of July 2017.  In the middle of this housing crisis, with people queuing up for houses and being outbid for them, non-household buyers are buying 42% of available properties in Dublin.  First-time buyers only make up 25% of the market and are competing with these multibillion euro funds.</p><p>It should be remembered that there are only 100 IREFs and three REITs.  As such, 103 companies have &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion worth of fire-power.  That is the level of assets they have in their structures and they are out there competing with Mary and John who are trying to get onto the property ladder but who are being outbid all the time.  There is a reason for that.  The tax code provides a very lucrative arrangement for these funds, which allows them to outbid others.</p><p> While most of the focus of these funds is in Dublin, we see nationally that non-household buyers purchased 13% of all homes in the State in 2016.  When one isolates local authorities and approved housing bodies from the figures, one finds that, within this category, 10% can be attributed predominantly to REITs and IREFs.  As such, 10% of all homes across the State were purchased by REITs or IREFs.  The 2017 figure nationally will be ahead of that.  It is a disgrace that these tax avoidance structures are pushing up prices through the demand of the funds for property.  They have the fire-power to buy up huge tranches of housing, which results in many ordinary people being unable to even dream of owning their own homes.  We have to change the tax structures within these funds.  Whatever the argument was about the need for vultures in 2013, it is no longer that point in time.</p><p> We have a huge problem with regard to housing supply and the last thing we should do as a Parliament is unleash these tax effective or avoiding structures onto first-time buyers in the market.  They do not have a clue what is happening.  Many of them are oblivious to what we are doing in this committee but we have passed the legislation to set up the tax structures which are now competing with ordinary Dubliners and people in Donegal for first-time houses.  That is why property prices are increasing by 12.8% nationally and by higher rates in certain categories in Dublin city in particular.  It is not all attributable to that but going back to the statistics, 42% of houses bought in Dublin to the end of July 2017 were bought by non-household buyers.  Non-household buyers include a number of cohorts, namely, REITs, IREFs, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  When we isolate the national figure of 13% and take away local authorities and approved housing bodies, 10% involves REITs and IREFs.</p><p> This proposal is looking for a report on the impact IREFs and REITs are having on residential property prices in the State.  This is required urgently.  I have suggested six months to be consistent with the timeframe in terms of the reports, but it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  What is going on in the Dublin market is crazy.  This is not just coming from the left.  Economists and big firms are calling for penalties on cash buyers and non-household buyers.  There is a time for intervention.  When these non-household buyers are buying up nearly twice as much of the Dublin property market in domestic homes as first-time buyers, the time for action is long past.</p></speech>

It is the CSO's intention to publish a breakdown of these figures into the three categories shortly.  However, it is likely to be March 2018 at the earliest before it has any actual figures.  At that stage, we will have the information to do the analysis.  There are three REITs operating in the Irish market, of which two are active in the residential market.  IRES has approximately 2,400 apartments, while Hibernia has just over 300 apartments.  The rationale behind the introduction of the REITs was their design specifically for long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to be a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  The REIT regime brought a new source of capital into the market, reducing dependence on banking finance and freeing up available banking finance for other uses.  By facilitating collective investment, REITs also provide risk diversification for investors of all sizes to promote the professionalisation of the Irish property market.  They are also key to the development of a build-to-rent market in Ireland.</p> <p>  I hear what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  We can all have our ideological debates but all parties across both Houses want to try to improve the housing situation for everyone.  We will not have the information back from Revenue until next July or thereabouts.  As such, we have an information vacuum at this moment in time.  To put this in context, there are 2 million homes in the country.  It is difficult to pluck a figure from the sky, but if we suggest an average price of &euro;250,000 per home, that is a residential value of &euro;500 billion, excluding commercial property.  If one adds commercial property, it is impossible for me to put a figure on it.  REITs and IREFs have assets of &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion.  They have given investors, including pension funds, the opportunity to make a tax-efficient investment.  There is a serious problem, as the Deputy well knows, for Irish pension funds into the future.  He mentioned one in particular.  For each one, there are many thousands of small investors who are trying hard to have a pot for when they retire.  It has not been easy.  Again, we can have an ideological debate about whether it should be allowed at the higher rate, but for the vast majority of people, these are tax-efficient methods for investing.  At &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion, it gives smaller investors the opportunity to be tax efficient.  They do not have to be at a scale which puts them into a very wealthy person's space.  In the scheme of a property sector worth perhaps &euro;500 billion for residential and whatever the value of commercial property is, &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion is not a huge amount.</p></speech>

What information is provided in the annual return?  On the policy rationale, Ireland was a very different place in 2013.  There were apartments available in Grand Canal Dock for what now appear to be very low prices.  I can understand the logic of seeking to professionalise and institutionalise the rental market or, at least, a certain part of it.  There is such a shortage of supply of stock now, however, that I ask the Minister of State to elaborate the Government's policy on this issue currently and the logic of it.  One must compare the tax treatment here with the taxation treatment of ordinary landlords, who pay at up to the 55% marginal rate, and of Irish companies which hold property but do not meet the test to form an IREF or a REIT.</p></speech>

Our friends, PwC, in their document Irish Real Estate Investment Structures, say:</p><blockquote>[There has been a] remarkable resurgence of interest in ... Irish real estate ... spearheaded by overseas investors [not little Irish pensioners trying to save up for their pension pots] and in particular by the hedge funds and private equity groups.  Such investors are using the array of available ... structures ranging from QIAIFs to REITs to SPVs to mitigate or eliminate taxes that would otherwise arise on their real estate investments.</blockquote><p>They go on to refer to REITs: &quot;[N]on-resident investors are not liable to CGT [this is them touting these things again] on the disposal of REIT shares.&quot;  The document states REITs are &quot;not chargeable to tax in respect of ... property rental business or chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of assets&quot;.  Regarding section 110 companies, it states, &quot;While such entities are taxable at a rate of 25%, the taxable profits tend to be modest because of the use of tax efficient profit ... mechanisms such as interest ... on profit participating loans.&quot;  It goes on and on.  What PwC is touting is the fact that this is an array of structures which allows the mitigation or complete elimination of the profits extracted from the Irish property sector, much of them courtesy of NAMA, which flogged this property - our property - to these buyers in order for them to extract profit and pay no tax.  This is the greatest scandal this State has seen in recent times.  As if everything that happened in 2007 and 2008 and the cost that people paid were not bad enough, that then became the prelude to the vast unloading of property assets to foreign investors, hedge funds and so on, which then extract an absolutely enormous profit from this and pay no tax.

I had to do that a while ago.  These stony-faced men in PwC are looking for, in one case, 90% rent increases on an apartment block in D&uacute;n Laoghaire - the whole block.  They wanted to kick the residents out on behalf of these lovely people.  We have this array of tax structures to minimise or mitigate their tax liability and they try to evict people.  I am glad to say that because the people resisted, PwC has been forced back so far.  There have been two separate attempts by PwC to evict the whole block on behalf of, in this particular case, Apollo Global Management, which presumably benefits from this array of tax structures.</p></speech>

I had a problem with the way in which the Department of Finance is implementing and addressing the Act in that what I understand now happens is that general letters are written, which are received by low-level officials, who are not designated officials.  The then Minister indicated to me - others might remember part of the discussion on the Finance Act - that he was minded to address any difficulties, but I am not aware of anything being done over the past year to address an obvious gap in the legislation.  Who at this point in time is a designated official in the Department or the Revenue Commissioners, and at what level are they in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, for the purposes of the Regulation of Lobbying Act?  The finance committee, knowing and having some general information about lobbying, would give us greater insight into how and why some changes come about.  In some cases there may be valid commercial strategies that really do stand up.  In other cases it is frankly very difficult to understand.</p></speech>

This is a Government policy and has nothing<i>per se</i>to do with any of the officials, but could the Minister of State enlighten us on that policy?  In New York, San Francisco and the City of London, similar vehicles result in the large-scale turnover of less well-off tenants in favour of &quot;yuppie&quot; apartments that are done up for wealthy people, often putting them out of reach of current locals.</p><p>I understand the Minister of State's point about the needs of the small investor and so on and that this may be an attractive vehicle but, in terms of the social consequences of this type of investment, has he any concern about how some of them have operated to date in certain circumstances?</p></speech>

I do not have a breakdown of how many properties are owned or rented, so I do not have an exact figure, but we would not be discussing the other 99.85% of properties.  REITs are an easy target and some may be doing things along the lines of what Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined.  I cannot stand over those things, nor can anyone else, but that is not a discussion on the 99.85% where people can be found treating their clients even more poorly than that.  There are 2,400 apartments with I-RES and 300 apartments with Hibernia REIT.  We will try to get the information but, in the grand scheme of things and to be frank with the committee, I would prefer to discuss the 99.85%, not the 0.15%.</p></speech>

This is not about my mum's house, my house or people who are living in their homes.  It is about properties that are coming onto the market for sale.  Those first-time buyers cannot knock on their neighbours' doors and ask whether there is any chance of them giving up their homes so that the first-timers can buy them.  They go to the market of houses for sale.</p> <p>  I will cite the figures in terms of non-household buyers.  In 2010, some 3% of properties across the State were bought by non-household buyers.  So far this year, that figure is 15%.  In Dublin, in 2010, the figure in respect of all homes was 5%.  It has increased to 23% so far in 2017.  The figure in respect of new homes in Dublin in 2010 was 15%.  In 2017 to date, it is 42%.  These are the figures.  That is the pool of houses that are available for people who are trying to get onto the property ladder.  There is no point in talking about the others who are already in their houses and will not leave them.  If they decided to leave their homes, they would fall into that category.</p> <p>  Let us get with this.  In Dublin, 42% of new homes are bought by non-household buyers.  I welcome the fact that Revenue will break down that information into more granular detail, but let us not pretend that there is no issue.</p></speech>

We can get this information, although it will not be as accurate as what Revenue will provide in March following its analysis.  We know what local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have bought.  If we strip them out, we find that the figure has not reduced substantially.  REITS and IREFs are hoovering up the market and, consequently, pushing up prices.  We want the Minister of State to understand the problem in the first place and to get with it.  We have unleashed these fund structures onto unassuming first-time buyers whom they are outbidding in the market.</p> <p>  This is not just coming from the left.</p><p>Merrion stockbrokers said the Government should consider penalising property investors to stop first-time buyers being priced out of the market.  In its latest quarterly economic outlook, the broker says those who want a house to live in should be given precedence over those who are in it for purely investment purposes and looking to make a quick buck.  Investors are the main drivers of cash sales in the Irish property market, which account for more than 50% of transactions.  In its report, Merrion stockbrokers warned there was now a shortage of every type of housing and that the crisis was likely to get worse unless urgent action was taken.  With regard to the REITs, the tax efficient structures the Minister of State talks about, one has set new record monthly rents of &euro;2,570 in its Maple scheme in Dublin despite the tax incentive structure that it has.  It is not right.  I could use stronger language.  The fund is not in it to provide houses; that is a by-product of what they are doing.  They are in it to ensure they maximise the returns for their investors.  Our focus needs to be on Irish citizens.  We have evidence, which will undoubtedly become clearer in a number of months, that we will still see these types of structures out-purchasing first-time buyers in Dublin when we strip everything else out of it.  That is an issue.  Even if the figures were reduced to 30% instead of 42%, it will still be an issue.  We have to stop this.  If there was plenty of supply, there would not be a problem.  I would like to see penalties; I support what Merrion stockbrokers said.  The amendment is very clear.  It asks for "a report on the impact that Irish Real Estate Funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts are having on residential property prices in the State".  It is to be done within six months.  Revenue will have figures for us in March.  If the Government wants to extend that to eight months, we will do it on Report Stage, but there should be a report done on this because it is a major issue.  </p></speech>

I have been looking at REITs and their accounts over the past while.  The level of tax they are paying is staggering.  I have a couple of questions seeking clarification.  The REIT regime provides tax exemption in respect of income and chargeable gains of a property rental business held within the company that satisfies a number of conditions.  We know that one of those has to be that it makes distributions of not less than 85% of its annual property income.  With regard to calculating that annual property income, can the Minister of State confirm if property tax is properly tax deductible for REITs when computing their annual property income?  </p></speech>

I am looking at I-RES's accounts.  The Minister of State has mentioned I-RES.  None of this is secret because these are publicly available.  It tells us about the revenue from investment properties of &euro;38 million.  It deducts property taxes of &euro;581,000, which is not a huge amount, but no other landlord in the State would be able to deduct their property tax before taxation.  Deputy McGrath has raised this on numerous occasions during different Finance Bills.  It deducts asset management fees of &euro;2.7 million.  This is on top of property operating costs of &euro;7.6 million.  There is a real suspicion that this asset management fee should not be deducted.  It is a way of reducing the amount of distribution that has to take place.  I know I am springing some of this on the Minister of State but I would welcome a note from Revenue before Report Stage on this.</p></speech>

We also know that in many cases that 20% does not apply because of tax treaties.  The Ireland-US tax treaty holds less than 10% of REITs and the dividend withholding tax goes down to 15% and so on.  I have looked at the three REITs in the State and their annual reports and accounts for 2016 and 2017.  Their annual reports for 2016 showed they had a combined value of &euro;2.637 billion.  That increased according to their 2017 accounts to over &euro;3 billion.  It showed that the profit within the three REITs - I can individualise them but there is no point in going through that - was &euro;329 million.  It showed that their rent profit, which is a part of their overall profit, was &euro;117 million.</p><p>We have been able to deduce that 85% of ownership of these real estate investment trusts, REITs, are foreign owners.  This was confirmed by the Department of Finance through a parliamentary question.  It was also confirmed that the dividend withholding tax for these three REITs in 2016 totalled &euro;8 million.  According to their own accounts, they recorded profits of &euro;329 million.  As 85% is attributable to foreign ownership, it means they only paid &euro;8 million in tax, an effective rate of 3%.  We know the reason is because most of the profit recorded in their accounts is actually gains and assets appreciation.  None of that is taxed within the fund, which is an issue.  Even if one strips the gains out, one would have &euro;117 million of rental income profit.  The dividend withholding tax paid against that was &euro;8 million, an 8% effective tax rate.</p><p> These are multi-million euro funds making, according to their own accounts, in one year &euro;329 million of profit.  Of that, 15% will be dealt with differently because it is residential but 85% of it is foreign owned.  On the foreign portion, they only paid &euro;8 million tax.</p></speech>

Of this, they paid &euro;8 million in dividend withholding tax.  That is wrong.  It is not that they have done anything wrong.  The Oireachtas has done something wrong by creating this structure.</p> <p>  Recalling the earlier conversation, these are the guys who are outbidding first-time buyers.  They are able to do that because, out of a profit on rental income of &euro;117 million, they only paid &euro;8 million in dividend withholding tax.  That gives them the firepower to outbid individuals and buy up whole blocks of accommodation.</p></speech>

There are however two more substantive amendments.  </p><p>The first substantive amendment relates to the taxation of transitional adjustments arising upon a change of accounting framework or the adoption of a new or amended accounting standard.  To ensure that the &quot;relevant amount&quot; is taxable or deductible, as the case may be, over a five year period following the transition, it is necessary to delete &ldquo;for the relevant period&rdquo; from paragraph (4)(c) and to substitute &ldquo;an accounting period&rdquo; for &ldquo;the relevant period&rdquo; in paragraphs (4)(d) and (4)(e). </p><p>The main substantive amendment is number 36, which concerns the tax treatment of accounting errors.  The legislation as currently drafted is inconsistent in that non-material or non-fundamental errors are subject to statutory interest and penalties whilst material or fundamental errors are not.  This amendment ensures that all accounting errors should be corrected by means of amended tax returns, subject to normal time limits.  Where this results in increased tax liabilities, statutory interest and penalties will apply.</p><p>In order to give effect to this amendment, the original subsections (5) and (6) have been deleted and replaced with a new subsection (5), which is based on an amalgamation of the original subsections (5) and (6).</p></speech>

It has meant that many private sector pension funds have gone out of existence.  I want to know if in the context of this change over the Minister or his Department has given any consideration to changing any of the accounting treatments in order to make provision for greater protection of defined benefit schemes in particular.  The system of accounting has inevitably led to the demise of a vast number of pension funds in private firms, in fact, there have been many different treatments.  In the case of Clerys, one thing that happened was the owners tried to rid themselves of pension liabilities.  In this context, does the Minister or anyone in his Department have any proposals to address this?  For people in the public sector or who are funded by the public sector, there is a system where people who are currently working are paying for the pensions of those who will retire in subsequent generations which means that the pensions are much more secure.  The same applies to the social insurance system where current contributors pay towards the State retirement pensions of people who have retired.  </p> <p>  Will any examination be carried out by the State of the implications particularly for pension funds which have caused enormous disruption in the way that they have been dealt with in the past.  Will there be a review from a public interest point of view of how pensions are accounted for?  </p></speech>

This is probably the most difficult and certainly one of the most contentious issues in the field of accounting nationally and internationally because what has happened is that the accounting treatments have meant that many companies approach development and possible consolidation and other issues by seeking to limit liabilities in respect of pensions and do away with them altogether.  The consequence is that not just in Ireland but in many other countries workers end up losing their pensions.  I accept there is to be a review, however, I think it is very important particularly in the context of European standards that the provisioning and the accounting treatments of pensions should be looked at.  Clearly from the narrow view of a company, it may be simply about the company getting rid of the pension fund liabilities and it may become much more profitable, but there are social and economic consequences to a society where people do not have pensions.  The supplementary pension system, which I was involved in designing, was to try to overcome what has happened as a consequence of some of the accounting standard developments which have decimated pension provision in private companies.</p></speech>

In this country we have had and have in process a great deal of correction of accounts because we have moved from a situation ten years ago of wholesale collapses which resulted in very significant losses to a lot of companies, including financial companies, in particular.  In some cases, we know subsequently - but we do not know the extent of it - that there were errors and misrepresentations and so on in accounts because some cases have come before the law in different adoptions of different treatments, for example how loans were treated in Anglo Irish Bank.  Consequent on that and into the future - I tabled a related amendment - there will be situations where financial companies such as banking companies will have large accumulated losses.</p><p>I raised this issue with the Minister's predecessor and I was given very detailed information.  The amount of the accumulated losses, some of which arise from errors committed some time ago, are very valuable to the banks concerned.  What is the position in respect of looking back?  In particular, are these companies to be allowed to carry these losses, some of which arose as a result of all types of accounting errors and so on, into the future indefinitely?  The amount at issue runs to many billions.  </p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware, because we have previously discussed this issue, that the ability to carry losses forward is a feature of our tax code.  In recognition of the quantity of losses that our banks are carrying forward I am committed to the retention of the bank levy.  It provides me with an alternative mechanism to generate needed tax income from the banks in recognition of the support made available to them by the Irish taxpayer.  I do not have any plans, including by way of amendment of this Bill, to change that provision.</p></speech>

I was involved in the discussions that resulted in increases in bank levies, which in my view are a relatively poor substitute for taxes.  These rules were devised when the banks were mired in massive losses and there was not an optimistic view as to how quickly they might return to profitability.  The banks are now returning to profitability and will possibly return to very significant profitability into the future.  It is interesting that this is being done.  It shows that there is flexibility in the Department of Finance to address issues but not in the context of the future significant profits of the banks that were bailed out in terms of the indefinite carrying forward of losses.  This means effectively means that the banks on a voluntary basis can decide whether, for ten or more years, they will pay corporation tax.  In terms of accounting standards and so on this may be policy but it is a wrong policy, notwithstanding the levy.</p></speech>

It is my desire to ensure that we do not lose any tax revenue as that happens.  The Deputy is raising a different matter, which she is entitled to do, in regard to how we treat losses within our banking system.  As I said, how we deal with the treatment of losses corporately is a consequence of our tax code.  The Deputy knows well that if I were to make a change as to how we account for the taxation of losses within our banks, it would have consequences for capital levels within the banks and the value of our shareholding in the banks.  One of the reasons for these changes was the change in respect of the capital requirements for the banking system across Europe.

Essentially, these schemes involve converting what should be taxable income payments into capital payments to avail of the lower capital gains tax rates.  The potential charge to capital gains tax is then often avoided by the use of CGT reliefs such as retirement relief and entrepreneurial relief, resulting in funds being extracted by shareholders entirely tax free or at a significantly reduced tax liability.  It is unfair that some individuals are engaging in these tax avoidance structures solely to take advantage of lower tax rates.  This leads to unfair outcomes and puts other taxpayers who do not engage in such avoidance arrangements at a competitive disadvantage.  I am, therefore, taking steps to counter these avoidance schemes.</p><p>I am amending the distribution rules in section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for determining whether an amount is to be treated as a distribution of income for tax purposes.  The first amendment deals with a scheme which has been exploited by taxpayers in order to generate new capital in a company, without investing any fresh capital, so as to enable income to be turned into capital on a subsequent repayment of the share capital.  The distribution rules are being amended to ensure that any artificially generated capital will be properly subject to income tax when it is subsequently distributed to shareholders. </p><p>The second amendment to section 135 deals with another scheme identified by Revenue, which seeks to avoid a liability to income tax where a company indirectly buys back shares from a shareholder.  The provisions are being amended to ensure that distribution treatment correctly applies.</p><p>I am also bringing forward proposals to amend the capital gains tax provisions in order to restrict the availability of CGT relief in respect of certain connected party transactions by individuals.  This follows the identification by Revenue of three specific avoidance schemes in operation involving the disposal of assets to connected parties by individuals, without any change in the underlying beneficial ownership of the asset, in order to extract cash from a business in a tax free manner.</p><p>I am therefore restricting the availability of retirement relief and the revised entrepreneur relief in respect of such connected party transactions.  In addition, an amendment is being introduced in relation to inter-family disposals of shares and securities to ensure that the maximum tax-free threshold, which is laid down in the legislation, cannot be circumvented.</p></speech>

The Minister introduced an initiative in budget 2017, which ended up bringing in &euro;79 million when the estimate was &euro;30 million, but has he had or will he have discussions with Revenue prior to the completion of the passage of this legislation on the question of extra powers, particularly around anti-avoidance, in order that the Revenue can intervene and strike down transactions or structures that are clearly designed to deprive the Exchequer of revenue?</p></speech>

I welcomed the pre-2014 position.  I will go into details in terms of the motivation for the changes at that time.  It is my view that this should apply from now, and to capital allowances that have been onshored in the past number of years.  The Minister is of the view that the cap applies to capital expenditure incurred by a company on or after 11 October 2017.  I understand it is a policy choice, that there is no legal reason the Minister has to do this.</p> <p>  It is only fair to acknowledge the sterling work that Mr. Seamus Coffey has done on this in his report on corporation tax that was commissioned by the Minister following last year's budget.  I am sure the Minister has read the report.  Mr. Coffey wrote a blog which detailed the amount of revenue that has been lost and that will be lost in this tax year as a result of the measure the Minister is introducing only applying from 11 October this year.  Mr. Coffey argues strongly that there is no reason for that to be the case.  He makes the point that if the Minister did not apply this grandfathering effect, the amount of revenue that could be collected in 2018 would be &euro;1 billion as opposed to the &euro;150 million the Government is expecting.  Mr. Coffey also draws attention to the fact that the onshoring of these assets, mostly intellectual property, has resulted in increasing our GNI, which, as a result, has increased our contribution to the European Union, and the portion of the increase resulting from the onshoring of these assets equates to &euro;200 million.  He makes the easy calculation that in ten years we will pay approximately &euro;2 billion more to the European Union as a result of the onshoring of these assets and the conclusion being drawn is that we will not be taxing these during this period.  I am sure the Minister will say that this is deferred tax etc., but that is not necessarily the case.  That is only the case if the companies still exist in their current tax structure form at the point when all of these capital allowances are used up.  There is no certainty whatsoever that many of these highly mobile companies will have the same structure at that point in time and, therefore, will pay an increased level of taxes.  There are a number of companies that we could look at which have left these shores in the past, and that is where the Minister could get seriously caught out.  I cannot understand why when the author of the report, although he has not called for that, has made it clear that he sees no reason.  He makes it clear that if there are other companies willing to come here and if the Department expects &euro;150 million to be recouped from this then obviously people are still willing to come and invest in us.</p> <p>  Second, I have deep suspicions, as I said on budget night, about how this happened.  Before the Paradise Papers were released, I had serious concerns about how this happened.  The Paradise Papers only strengthen my suspicions.  The history of it is that in 2013, in the Finance Bill, the Government decided to end the stateless status following huge international pressure.  I, myself, was pursuing the Minister's predecessor with regard to this issue about stateless companies.  He kept on denying that we had the ability to end it.  I wrote legislation and pointed out the provision in the Act that needed to be changed.  That is exactly what happened in the Finance Bill in 2013 but, crucially, the effect of this only came into effect over a year later, on 1 January 2015.  Then we had the double Irish, which was closed down in the Finance Bill of 2014.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, told us that this was a mismatch between two tax codes, which is technically true, that we did not have the ability to close it down unilaterally, and that the only problem with the double Irish was that it had "Irish" in its name - that was the phrase the former Minister used on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Lo and behold, as a result of pressure, international and domestic, we had the double Irish closed down.  As the Government closed down that loophole, however, it made a conscious decision to change how capital allowances could be written off against profits.  Up until then, a level of profits could not be written off as capital allowances - it was 20% and 80% was the threshold - but the Government decided to increase it to 100%.  The Government knew that as a result of changing the residency status within our tax codes there would be onshoring of intellectual property, IP.  We now know what happened.  We see, from the 26% growth rate and so-called leprechaun economics, that hundreds of billions of euro worth of intellectual property was onshored in the State.</p><p> We now know from the Paradise Papers that during that period when the Government was ending the stateless rule - when we questioned the Minister on this we were told that to his knowledge only three companies were stateless - that of the three Apple subsidiaries based in Cork that has no tax residency here or anywhere in the world, two ended up in Jersey and one became an Irish resident company.  One of the Jersey companies, Apple Sales International, ASI, which had the rights to the intellectual property of Apple which was worth about &euro;170 billion sold those rights to Apple Operations Europe, AOE, which is the Irish resident company, and as a result of that it is able to use its capital allowances to write off against any profits in this State for a long period.  </p><p> How does this affect us?  Apple confirmed yesterday that all sales outside of the Americas are being registered through an Irish company in Cork.  The value of those sales is &euro;119 billion.  Apple confirmed that.  That was the same position prior to 2015 when we ended the stateless designation of those companies.  In 2014 they were stateless and had no tax residency so even though all this money went through a company which recorded a turnover or sales of &euro;119 billion they did not have to pay tax because they were not tax resident here or anywhere else and that is subject to the European Commission's infringement proceedings.  When we made them stateless, and now Apple have confirmed that all those sales are still being recorded in this State, one would imagine that we would be in receipt of a massive windfall of corporation tax from Apple.  That has not happened.  Apple paid &euro;1.5 billion, it tells us, over the last three years in taxation.  Some of this is on the public record and we know that a certain part of the company paid &euro;430 million, but where is the tax from the new company that is no longer stateless that now has sales recorded of &euro;119 billion?  It does not exist because even though the company is no longer stateless, the loophole, a measure the Minister's predecessor introduced, allows it to write off all these capital allowances, the intellectual property that was taken onshore, against all its profits.  Things had come to a point where no one could accept that any company could have no tax residency anywhere in the world so the Government closed that door on Apple but it gave them 13 or 14 months to get its act in order, which it did.  It went to Appleby, got its structure in place, sent the two companies to Jersey, registered one in Ireland, took the intellectual property over and then it used the capital allowances to pay no taxes.  </p><p> That the Government did that at that particular time is deeply suspicious.  I want the Minister to put on the record all the engagements which he, his predecessor and their officials had with Apple during that period.  I want him to tell us the lobbying by any individuals regarding the onshoring of intellectual property.  For instance, the head of tax in Allergan, a company based in County Mayo - an individual who has been reported in the context of the Paradise Papers but is not himself involved in the Paradise Papers, he is mentioned in the side reporting of the papers - lobbied the Government and talked about how, with the changes to tax residency, there needed to be certainty as a result of onshoring of intellectual property.  That is the point that I made at the beginning.  There is no way that the Minister or the Department did not know that a change of tax residency rules would result in an onshoring of intellectual property and, as such, I seriously question the Government's motivations, or the motivations of its predecessor, for closing what was a stateless company which was frowned up internationally and then opening a loophole to effectively give the same company an ability to continue not paying tax on sales in excess of &euro;100 billion.</p></speech>

Because this measure was passed via a financial resolution on the night of the budget it is in effect from now.  The measure became available and applicable from 11 October 2017.  In relation to the various points Deputy Doherty has put to me, before I refer to them I will make the point that the opportunity that is ahead of this country at the moment is one that other countries are pursuing and are aware of, namely, to be in a position where we have a combination of commercial activity, manufacturing activity, research and development activity and the registration of IP assets, all from the same company located within Ireland.  We have the potential to realise that because of the number of employers we already have located in this country whose companies tend to be associated with and tend to have intellectual property assets that have a high value.  As I look out, with many of the different issues that we have to manage, I see the prospect of us being able to achieve that form of co-location, as something that would be very valuable for Ireland.  In terms of the decisions that I have made in relation to the Finance Bill and this particular amendment, I will outline the reason I have decided to make it applicable from 11 October - it is applicable on a forward-looking basis - the Deputy is correct that it was a policy choice.  The legal framework was there to do it.  My judgment is that at the core of our corporate tax framework is the concept and value of predictability, of being able to explain to people that if they locate jobs and investment in our country that we will tax them in a certain way going forward and that people are clear on that.</p><p>My view was that if I introduced a measure like this that was retrospective in the context of assets that had already been moved here, it would deal a massive blow to my ability to be able to argue that our corporate tax code and the policy relating thereto are predictable, clear and certain.  In essence, I would have been claiming that we would now change how we would tax the assets a company had moved in here in the past as well.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty touched upon this point.  We are talking about the timing of payment of tax; it is deferred tax.  The Deputy stated that this might not apply because we might get an income stream from a company now because of how we tax the intellectual property asset.  The company might not be around in a number of years, however, at which point the reliefs relating to the depreciation of the asset would be gone and we might not be able to claim revenue from that company.  That is not a way in which I can structure tax policy.  I cannot structure tax policy on the basis of my personal view or that of the Government as to whether a company will be around in the future.  If companies are located here, are employing here and have investments located here, we must assume they will be here for a period.  Many of the companies that have been at the heart of the recent debate have had operations located in Ireland for many years.  I will not get into the debate over the tax affairs of a particular company tonight because I must respect its confidentiality as I would for any other taxpayer.</p><p> On the timing of this decision and the previous one, I have not had contact with any individual on the matter.  Mr. Seamus Coffey gave me a report.  On the basis of that report, I made a decision, in consultation with my Department and other Departments, on what I believed was the right choice.  I no more went out and sought the opinion of individual companies on this matter than I did with any other measure in this Finance Bill.  I made what I felt was the overall right decision for the country.</p><p> Before the change was made, the threshold stood at 80% and then it went to 100%.  At the time it went to 100%, many of the peer countries to which we would have compared ourselves would have treated intellectual property assets in the same way.  It is the right decision to introduce a cap in respect of the depreciation of intellectual property assets and how this is dealt with because of the scale of assets on which we are focusing.  When the decision was made to move it back to 100%, that was the case in other countries to which we would have compared ourselves and countries against which it was important for us to be competitive.</p><p> Having said that, I believe this is the right stance for us to take.  It is also apparent to me and to all who debate and discuss these matters that the scale of the assets being moved around is bigger than in the past.  What has had a decisive effect on the attractiveness of Ireland as a place in which such assets could be located is the effect of the OECD work that has happened throughout the world, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months, and that means it is no longer possible to locate these assets in other locations in which they would have been located in the past.  As a result, companies want to find locations for the assets.  It will be of long-term value to Ireland to have the assets located here, taxed in the way I propose and co-located with commercial, manufacturing, and research and development activity.  I am making this decision in the Finance Bill in the context of that view.</p></speech>

I accept that the Apple company in Cork that employs more than 4,000 people has been here for a long time.  Hopefully, it will stay for an equally long time.  We are not talking about the company for which the employees work; we are talking about the other companies.  Two of them skedaddled to Jersey.  Apple Sales International is no longer based in Ireland.  Apple Operations International is no longer based in Ireland; it is now based in Jersey.  They left because Ireland decided to end the stateless company status they enjoyed.</p> <p>  The other company Apple Operations Europe, AOE, decided to register here for one reason only.  It was because there is no tax implication on the profits attributed to all the sales of products recorded by that company outside America, worth &euro;119 billion, because it is allowed to use its capital allowance against its taxes.  It is able to do that because the Government and the Minister's predecessor allowed that change to happen.</p> <p>  Was the Minister, his predecessor or the Department aware that as a result of the change to the residency rules there would be an increase in the onshoring of IP?  Was the Minister lobbied on giving certainty to these companies onshoring IP?  Was that factored into the judgment to change the threshold from 80% to 100%?  The consequence of that was that in the period from 2014 to 2015, the claims for capital allowances went up from &euro;2.8 billion to &euro;28 billion, a massive increase.  However, it does not end there because hundreds of billions worth of IP was taken onshore during that period.  I ask the Minister to answer first those questions on the lobbying of Department of Finance and the Minister over certainty of IP onshoring as a direct result the changes in residency the Government introduced in 2013 and 2014.  I know it happened.  Companies lobbied to have IP onshored.  The Paradise Papers inform us what Apple is doing.  Once all Apple's capital allowances are used up, AOE could move to Jersey or anywhere and then we will never see the taxation on the profits.</p> <p>  We need to remember what we are talking about here.  We have discussed a lot of stuff in respect of this Bill over the past two days.  The Minister is deciding to forgo &euro;850 million of tax.  To change that all we have to do is change four numbers in the Finance Bill - just the date of implication.  The Minister wants it only to apply going forward because he wants certainty for Apple that it will not have to pay a penny in tax for the next decade on the &euro;190 billion in transactions it is recording in an Irish company.  That is what the Minister is doing.</p> <p>  There are serious questions.  I have serious suspicions that a deal was done.  It may not have been done directly sitting across the table with Apple because people are smarter than this.  However, the Minister knew when the Government closed down the stateless companies that those stateless companies had to do something - either leave here for another jurisdiction, which two of them did, or register here.  Allowing them to take their IP onshore and increasing that to 100% gave them a massive windfall.  It is not just Apple, but Apple is the major beneficiary of it.</p><p>The Commission is now looking into its post-2015 structure.  This stinks to high heavens.  As the Minister has said, this is a policy choice.  It has been made by the Minister and not by his officials or legal advisers.  He has decided to let an annual sum of &euro;850 million go amiss.  He has decided to let Apple be able to write off its taxes and to settle for the &euro;150 million that will come in the future.  That is not sensible.  Is the Minister aware of the lobbying that went on regarding the proposal to move intellectual property onshore as a result of the changes in tax residency rules?  Did that factor into the decision made by the Minister at that time?  Will the Minister release all of the documents relating to lobbying directly to the Minister, the Minister of State or any officials within the Department over the period from 2013 to 2015, including any direct or indirect contact with Apple or any of its subsidiaries?</p></speech>

Frankly, it stretches credibility that this happened at a time when new political forces had come into this D&aacute;il.  In 2012 and 2013, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I raised at the then Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform the massive loopholes we could see in the corporate tax regime.  We suggested that the effective rate being paid by big corporations like Apple was a tiny fraction of 12.5%.  The double Irish arrangement was at the centre of that.  There are plenty of other examples of loopholes.  We will talk about some of them in a moment.  When the spotlight began to come on, the reaction of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and Fianna F&aacute;il was to close ranks immediately in order to protect Apple.  In July 2013, when this stuff was starting to be debated, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I proposed that representatives of Apple, Google and Facebook should be brought before the finance committee to face questions about the tax affairs of those companies.  The cameras were literally shut off as a result of a manoeuvre from the Chairman of the committee.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, along with Deputy Donnelly and a couple of others, voted to switch off the cameras while we debated whether Apple and the other companies might be brought in.  Not only did they not want those companies to come in, but they did not even want anyone to know we were discussing whether they should come in.</p> <p>  In 2013, the Government closed ranks to protect Apple and ensure it was not questioned about what it was up to.  At this time, international and domestic pressure was building with regard to the double Irish arrangement.  Right up to the last moment, the Government denied that this country was playing any role in that arrangement.  It was finally forced to announce that it would be closed, although it is worth noting that it is still not closed.  It is still operable up to 2020 for companies that have benefited from it.  Apple, and probably others, had to try to find a new way of evading tax.  In January 2014, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple.  I would love to know what happened at that meeting.  I do not know what happened.  The closeness of this Government's relationship with Apple is remarkable.  We know from the Paradise Papers, or, as I like to call them, the parasite papers, that in March 2014, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple began to search for new ways to avoid paying tax.  According to one of the leaks, Baker McKenzie, which was acting on behalf of Apple, contacted Appleby about its various tax haven locations and asked it to "confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction".  That is what Apple wanted to do.  It wanted to avoid paying any tax at all and, as we have now discovered, that is what it did.</p> <p>  Shortly afterwards, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, decided to change the allowances regime for intangible assets, such as Apple's intellectual property assets from which it derives its profits and around which much of its tax evasion activity centres.  I refer to the manner in which it sells ideas or intellectual property assets from one arm of the company to another, thereby turning profits into costs and consequently writing down its tax liabilities.  Oddly and strangely, we made this change at this time.  It is quite extraordinary.  Frankly, I do not even understand why it should get an 80% allowance, never mind a 100% allowance.  Why should it get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets?  I would like somebody to explain that to me.  When one arm of a company supposedly sells something to another arm of the company, which is a joke in and of itself, the company in question is allowed to claim massive allowances and gain enormous tax benefits that are worth hundreds of millions of euro to the company.  We used to give this company an 80% tax break, but in the year in question, that was increased to 100%.  Why did that happen?  Is it a coincidence that it happened in the same year that Apple had to start thinking about restructuring its tax avoidance strategies?  It moved one of its subsidiaries, which was previously based here, to the Channel Islands.  I presume that company now sells the asset to the Irish-registered company without having to pay any tax on the profit it gets.  It has discovered via Appleby that it pays no tax whatsoever there.  The 100% allowance that the Irish subsidiary gets allows it to write down all of its profits which derive from that intellectual property for the next decade or so.  It is quite extraordinary.  Can the Minister explain how it happened?  Why was that decision made in 2014?</p></speech>

On the question of contact between the Department of Finance and Apple, it is obvious that this was a number of years ago and predates my arrival in the Department.  I will consult my departmental officials on the matter to see how contact can be established.  The one principle I want to be absolutely clear on is that Ireland does not set its tax policy on the basis of any particular company, such as the company mentioned by the Deputy or any other company.  We base our corporate tax policy, like all tax policies that are relevant to parts of our economy, on what we think and judge to be the right thing for the economy and for the taxpayer overall.  We do not make tax policy on the basis of what any particular company wants or needs.</p></speech>

This is why the EU is very suspicious, yet again.  We have already been told we should have collected &euro;13 billion of tax that we did not collect.  The Government has still not taken that money and the interest off Apple and put it in an escrow account.  As soon as there was movement on that particular tax avoidance strategy, lo and behold, we made changes which ensure Apple does not pay a single cent more than it was paying previously.</p><p>Not a single cent.  It is perfect restructuring, almost to the euro.  It involves the Channel Islands and the changes in the intangible asset allowance.  It works out so perfectly that companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  Their spin is that they did not pay any less tax.  Brilliant.  They did not, however, pay any more tax; they paid exactly the same amount of tax.  With regard to their tax liability, the net effect of closing down the double Irish is zero as they do not pay any more tax.  This company is nakedly avoiding tax.  Was the Minister aware of this and will he acknowledge that this is what these companies were and are doing?  We might quibble about what the Minister did or did not do, but the reason there had to be movement against the double Irish is because these companies were just nakedly and rampantly seeking to avoid paying tax.  What they are doing is immoral; companies are looking around for tax jurisdictions and loopholes in our tax code so they pay no tax.  We say it is nothing to do with us, it is inconsistencies between tax codes and there is nothing we can do about it.  Yet, Ireland seems to facilitate these companies.  First with the double Irish and when a light is shone on the double Irish we then, coincidentally, facilitate them in a new way.  We may have done it inadvertently.  Is that the explanation?  Inadvertently, the change that was made in 2014 perfectly succeeds in doing exactly what Apple would want to do, given that there was a problem developing with the double Irish tax avoidance strategy.  This is too much of a coincidence.  Does the Minister believe that anybody who looks at this would not say it is too much of a coincidence?  The net result is that these companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  How convenient.  Does the Minister not believe that the European Union and Commissioner Vestager have some justification for being suspicious of this and that anybody looking on would say "Jesus, that stinks"?</p></speech>

Seamus Coffey's online blog makes for very insightful reading.  In 2014, when the 80% cap last applied, &euro;2.6 billion of capital allowances were claimed under that regime.  In 2015, when the cap was increased to 100%, &euro;28.9 billion was claimed for capital allowances under that regime.  This is a more than tenfold increase in the amount of capital allowances claimed in 2015 over 2014.  Presumably, this is directly linked to the change of the cap from 80% to 100%.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show there was a &euro;26 billion increase in intangible asset related gross trading profits in 2015.  There was a dramatic change in the onshoring and the claiming of capital allowances against intangible asset related income.  Does the Minister have data on how much intellectual property, IP, was actually onshored since the change came into effect in the Finance Act 2014?  We need to tease out what is there with regard to stock, IP and related capital allowances since that period of time.  A while ago the Minister said that the corporation tax system should be certain and predictable.  Up to 2014 he had the 80% cap then he removed that and it became 100%.  Now, less than three years later it is going back to 80%, but all the IP, which was onshored in the intervening period, will continue to benefit from the 100% set-off around the limit on income; they can be offset by the capital allowances and the IP.  Will the Minister give the committee the data he has on the IP that was onshored so we can tease out, from a tax point of view, the consequences of treating the capital allowances associated with those?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#NNN00300"><p>With regard to the different points that have been put to me, I reiterate what I said to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We set our tax policy, be it corporation tax or any other policy, on the basis of what we judge to be the right thing for the economy overall and the long-term interests of the Irish taxpayer.  Across the period in which we have made decisions like that, we have seen an increase in corporate tax receipts overall.  This point is missing in the analysis that is being offered here.  In 2014 corporation tax receipts were &euro;4.6 billion.  They grew to &euro;6.9 billion.  For this year we are currently expecting corporation tax receipts of &euro;8.3 billion.  We are collecting more corporation tax at the moment.  One of the factors in this is changes that have been made over the last number of years in how we structure our corporate tax policy.</p> <p>  I have been asked how we can handle IP that moved here in the past.  Again, I will emphasise two points.  We are talking about the timing in which depreciation reliefs are run down.  Overall this makes a big difference to the timing in which tax is collected.  It is a timing issue around when we actually collect tax from companies.  Alongside that, while much of the debate here is focused on a particular company, I have to consider that this is a tax policy I would have to set for every company located in Ireland.  I would have to say to every company that has an intellectual property asset, regardless of its form, that Ireland would change how it taxed the assets the company had moved here in the past.  It was my judgment, and my decision, that a policy such as that would undermine the predictability at the heart of our corporate tax offering, and which is essential to its competitiveness with all the change that is under way now.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath asked about figures and I have some of them.  I have the figures relating to the corporate tax reliefs that have been claimed but I believe the Deputy already has those.  The other figures that I have available to me from our national accounts relate to the purchase of patents, which is part of the movement of intellectual property assets.  Those figures are as follows: in 2014 it was &euro;1.9 billion; in 2015 it was &euro;8.3 billion; in 2016 it was &euro;35 billion; and in the first half of 2017 it was &euro;11 billion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#NNN00400"><p>When the Minister says that Ireland's corporate tax revenue has increased he forgets to mention the extraordinary rise in profits during that period.  The percentage increase in profits far outstrips any proportionate increase in tax revenue.  For example, 2012 pre-tax trading profits were &euro;76 billion.  By 2015 these had gone up to &euro;149 billion.  As we know, and we can surmise, a vast amount of that is attributable to these companies' enormous and spectacular increase in profits that are beyond belief.  A doubling of aggregate corporate tax profits is overwhelmingly attributable to a small number of companies.</p><p>Just as those profits go through the roof we give them extra tax allowances to ensure that there is not a commensurate increase in the proportion of tax that we will get from it.  I accept that there is some increase - how could there not be - when profits increase to that extent.  Proportionately, however, the effective rate is going down not up.  It is actually going down and it is already pitifully low.</p><p> In addition, the effective rate as against the total profits is actually falling for these companies because of measures that we are taking or our failures to close down these loopholes.  In doing that they are robbing this country of tax revenues that we should be getting.  They are also robbing people all around the world.  All of the tax and global justice groups say this kind of behaviour that Apple, Facebook and Google are engaging in is the major contributory factor to growing global inequality, poverty and deprivation.  These people are robbing us blind in a deliberate, naked and explicit drive to ensure that they pay no taxes whatsoever.  </p><p> The Minister has not really answered the question as to whether he finds that morally repugnant.  Is the Government bothered by that?  The signs are, given the behaviour of the Government, that it does not find it repugnant but in fact at best turns a blind eye to it and at worst is actively colluding with it.  Deputy Doherty and I have both set out the chain of events where very serious questions are now also being asked by the European Union about what happened and why it happened.  We also need to know about the lobbying and the interactions that this Government had with Apple and with any of these other companies.</p><p> The one aspect on which I will agree with the Minister is that this is not about one company, although there is definitely one favoured company that is leading the charge.  It concerns a few companies, a very small number.  It is maybe five to ten companies who accrue these massive tax benefits because of the regime that we have and the changes that we made in terms of window we created for them between 2014 and now.  The move to reintroduce the 80% rate is closing the door after the horse has bolted and followed the massive onshoring of these assets.  That allows those companies to pay no tax for a decade ahead against these enormous profits.  It looks like collusion.  Their behaviour is certainly immoral.  Does the Minister agree that it is immoral?  </p><p> If the Minister does agree that it is immoral, why do we not capture the additional tax benefit that these companies have accrued as a result of the change from the 100% to the 80% going back to when that change was made?  Why do we not do that if we think it is wrong?  I do not see how anybody could say what they are doing is not wrong.  Why do we not do it?  Is it because we made an agreement with them?  Is it that we gave assurances to Apple and a few others at the time that we are going to allow them to do that?  Otherwise, I do not see why we would not do it.  Many people, and not just the left and Sinn F&eacute;in, are saying that the window they were given should be closed and we should recover that 20% difference which resulted from the changes in 2014 and, in the process, get the &euro;800 million or so that would accrue if we did that.</p></speech>

We will have differing views regarding what that level of tax could be because of potentially differing views regarding those companies and the role they play.  However, I strongly believe that they should pay their fair share of tax.  That is the reason why I am committed to putting in place the different measures that form part of the OECD work that is underway and having them enacted in the Irish tax code.  It is important that we all move in a co-ordinated way across the world to make sure that opportunities do not exist for companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  I strongly believe that to be the case and that is one of the reasons why I am committed to the OECD process and one of the reasons why in the Finance Bill I am seeking to make progress in that area.</p> <p>  With regard to the point concerning an allegation of collusion, I want to state again very clearly that we do not make tax policy on the basis of the needs of any company.  We do it on the basis of what we judge and believe to be the right thing for the economy overall or for a sector within the economy.  That has been my guiding principle in making this decision to go back to 80% because I believe that it is the right thing for our economy.  I also believe it is the right thing in the context of the scale of these assets and their movement across the world that we have this form of taxing them.  </p> <p>  In regard to why I will not go back, in terms of the point the Deputy raises, it goes back to the earlier point I made here that I do not do tax policy on the basis of individual companies.  If I was to make a decision like this it would apply to all companies and all intellectual property assets.  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is my view that if I was to make a change like that if would affect the view that people have regarding what Ireland is offering now and in the future, including many companies that have not been mentioned here that have investments in the country.  It is because of that that I am making this decision and for this move that will have had effect since the night of the Budget Statement.  </p> <p>  On the question of the section the Deputy is putting to me, that is making clear that this relief will have to apply to all of a trade as opposed to part of a trade.  As currently defined, a relevant trade makes reference only to relevant activities which are carried out as part of a trade.  This is now shifting that definition to say that now it must take account of all of the trade.</p></speech>

The Minister has put on record the figures for the purchase of patents for the years 2014 to 2017, inclusive.  Let us call it the onshoring of intellectual property, IP, during the 100% window.  Do we know how many companies those figures represent?</p></speech>

The information that I gave came from the Central Statistics Office so I do not have that information.  The figures referred to the purchase of patents, as I said when I gave the information earlier.</p></speech>

Since then, in 2015 the figure was &euro;8.3 billion; in 2016 the figure was &euro;35 billion; and in the first half of 2017 the figure is &euro;11 billion.  I interpret that to mean a total of about &euro;55 billion of patent purchases was onshored.  All of that money is now in the system.  Therefore, a 100% corresponding amount of trading income can be offset by the capital allowances related to that IP.  If it was 80% then the sum would be &euro;44 billion.  The difference is &euro;11 billion in terms of the amount of related trading income that can be offset by the capital allowances associated with those intangible assets.  That is the net issue of what is involved in dropping the axe on budget night or making a retrospective change to take account of the IP that is already in the system since the Minister made the change in the 2014 Act.</p></speech>

As I said, I am looking to move the percentage back to 80% because I believe it is the right way in which these assets now need to be taxed.  I do not want to do this in any way that is backward looking because, as I have said on a number of occasions, I am very concerned about the effects it could have on how this tax policy is perceived.</p></speech>

So, at a point in time, when the depreciation reliefs that are available are gone, the Irish State will receive more tax.  What I am trying to do here is smooth out the tax in income that will be available to the State over a longer time period to make them more sustainable.  It is my assessment that moving to an 80% rate will allow that to happen.  As opposed to us receiving a large amount of additional taxation at a point in the future, granted this assumes that companies still exist, as opposed to us moving to that scenario where there is a big amount in the future and nothing in between, I am trying to get to a point where we can smooth out the tax revenues that are available and post some of that forward.  The provision is not going to affect the total amount of tax liability that is available to the State over the lifespan of the asset.</p></speech>

There is a lot of uncertainty concerning the question of it just being a timing difference.  If one assumes that everything continues as it is then one would be right that it is a matter of timing.  However, there are a lot more moving parts and this matter is moving so quickly.</p></speech>

It is my assessment that a further moving part, that we would move to, would be if we were to make a kind of change that looked backwards.  It is my view that such a move would have an effect on our ability to retain investment, jobs and all of those things in our country and, therefore, corporate tax policy, and the certainty of it, is so important.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's concerns about the presence and diversity of different companies in the future, I will reiterate the following.  Some of the companies that we have talked about have been based in Ireland for a very long period.  We are talking about a corporate tax stream that has grown.  I do not believe that it will continue to grow at this rate in the future though I cannot be certain.  Mr. Coffey, in his report on corporation tax, made the point that he believes our revenue streams, as projected at present, will be stable up to 2020, which is quite an horizon to have available to me in terms of making an assessment like this one.</p></speech>

How many years do capital allowances for IP last?</p><p><b>Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</b>It depends on two different factors.  It depends on how the company accounts for it and that, in turn, affects the length of the depreciation period.  I think there is also another standard accounting period available.  </p></speech>

The point is that section 21 of the Act has two subsections.  Subsection (1)(a) has been explained as an insignificant tidying-up exercise but it will nonetheless be applied from 8 May 2009.  The principle of retrospection, therefore, is included here.  The Minister's decision not to apply the capital expenditure for the intellectual property that was onshore up until now does not stand up to rigorous testing.  I understand that the Minister wants to give certainty and so forth but it is a certainty to companies like Apple that they will continue to be able to write down their tax liability for several more years.  We are only just starting to see the tip of the iceberg that is the Paradise Papers and I have no doubt but that we will see more of a spotlight being shone on tax structures.</p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of lobbying.  Are the Minister and his officials aware of the lobbying that took place when the Government changed the threshold from 80% to 100% in 2014?  Will the Minister inform the committee of this?  Will he give a commitment, if he does not have the information to hand, to inform us of all of the individuals, groups and representative bodies who lobbied the Department, the Minister and the Ministers of State on this issue, either directly or indirectly?  We already know, for example, that during this very period the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland was lobbying the Department for the threshold to be increased.  I do not know if Apple is a member of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland but I am sure that it has the interests of Apple and companies like it at heart.  That chamber lobbied as part of its pre-budget submission in 2015 for the threshold to be increased.  What is interesting is that it only asked for it to go up to 90%, whereas the Government went the whole hog of raising it to 100%.  We also know that the Department was lobbied on the onshoring of intellectual property as a result of the change to the tax residency rules.  We know that the Minister himself was lobbied by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland with regard to tax changes.  I would like him to inform the committee now if any of this concerned the threshold and the date from which it would apply.  Was there any discussion of that when he had a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland?  Will he also put on the record if he or his officials have had any other meetings with representative groups with regard to any aspect of this issue?  Did the Department notify, engage with or seek the opinion of any of these companies?  I do not mean directly with the companies themselves, of course, as we know how these things work and it is usually through legal representatives.  Did the Department seek advice from bodies outside of the Department with regard to the application of this section?</p></speech>

We had a wide-ranging discussion on a number of matters, but not on this particular issue.  I have not had meetings with any companies on the matter and I have not met any company or individual on this matter, outside of the standard work that I would carry out on this.  I obviously met Mr. Seamus Coffey, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, I had many meetings within my own Department on this matter, and I also sought the view of other Departments with regard to the Coffey report and what I was considering doing.  When it comes to the contacts that my officials have had both now and in the past, I am certainly not in a position to speak about what happened several years ago because, as the Deputy has acknowledged, I was not in the Department at the time.  I will ask my Department to see what records are available for the periods in question, though I am sure the Deputy may have got access to them through other means.  I will come back to the committee when I have an answer to this.</p></speech>

We have made the point.  To paraphrase the Minister, he said the Government does not gear its tax policy around any particular company.  That is probably true because I think it was more around a group of companies.  The Minister did refer to sectors of industry.  I think it was a group of companies who benefitted from this.  We are all familiar with names such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and a few others.  I believe that whether it was through direct lobbying or just the servile attitude that successive Governments, not just that of which Deputy Donohoe is a part, but previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, have shown towards those companies to the effect that they just want to do anything they can to please them and that means tailoring the tax code to suit their purposes.</p><p>We have had the discussion so there is no point in labouring it.  We clearly disagree on this issue.  However, I take issue with the argument the Minister made about what would happen were we to go back and close the window that was opened for them in 2014, which the Minister is only closing now after all the intangible assets have been onshored and where they will derive the tax benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years.</p><p>I do take issue with the argument the Minister makes that, were we to go back and close the window that was opened for these companies in 2014, and which he is only closing now after all these intangible assets have already been onshored, and where they will derive the enormous benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years, many other people might be affected where there might be a legitimate basis for their expectation to benefit from that change.</p><p> I do not know how the Minister does not draw a distinction between a company that might actually purchase an intellectual property asset, where it is a genuine cost on the company, and a company that is clearly doing this as an accountancy exercise, where it is not a cost on the company because it is buying the asset from itself and has set up a network of companies purely for the purposes of minimising its tax liability and benefitting from these kinds of allowances.  I just do not see how the Minister does not draw the distinction and why the tax code cannot so do.  Of course, if there are legitimate costs for a business, it is reasonable that it should get an allowance on those costs against its trading profits to reduce its tax liability.  However, this is a case of Apple, Google or Facebook moving around assets between its own subsidiaries in order to manipulate the tax code and reduce its tax liability.  Everyone knows that, the Minister know it, and we have known it since long before 2014 and the onshoring of these assets.  All of the tax avoidance that has been engaged in by these companies all centred around similar types of manoeuvres around intellectual property and payments of one subsidiary to another, whether from stateless subsidiaries that were incorporated here but not tax-liable here or subsidiaries that are no longer stateless but are located in Jersey, where they do not have to pay tax anyway, so it is the same difference.  It is the same type of tax avoidance strategy and it is one company doing it.  Therefore, I do not see how they can in any sense be deemed legitimate costs.  It is just a way for such companies to reduce their tax liabilities on their absolutely staggering profits, and they are literally writing their own tax bills.  They are deciding how much tax they will pay, not the Government, the tax code or the nominal tax rate.  None of that actually determines how much tax they pay; they decide how much tax they pay through a manipulative accountancy exercise.  I do not see how the Minister deems that to be legitimate and, as I said, why he cannot draw a distinction between companies that clearly are engaged in tax avoidance and companies that might actually have a legitimate claim on an allowance.</p></speech>

I will list the key ones, given the claims the Deputy has just made.  Relief is only available where a company is carrying out a bona fide trading activity in respect of the management, development or exploiting of intangible assets.  Relief is not available in respect of any expenditure incurred as part of a tax avoidance scheme.  Under the scheme, allowances can only be offset against income of development trade in which the intangible assets are used, not against any other profits.  An arm's-length rule applies, ensuring that the correct amount of income expenditure is attributed to the relevant trade and to prevent excessive relief being claimed.  Finally, provision is made for Revenue to engage an expert to assist in the determination of arm's-length values where necessary, and the Revenue Commissioners keep these measures under review all the time to make sure they are operated as intended.</p></speech>

It may be the case that the profits then derive, as the Minister says, from that piece of intellectual property, but the parent company is deciding how much one charges the other and is setting the cost at precisely the level that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax.  That is what these companies are doing, and we all know it, so it is a tax avoidance strategy.  As the Minister said, our tax code - I cannot remember the exact section - actually refers to not allowing, or prohibiting, things that are very obviously tax avoidance tactics.  This, to my mind, is very obviously just that, and everyone knows it is, but we allow it.  I do not see how the Minister can stand over it, frankly, but-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#UUU00900"><p>I move amendment No. 42:</p><blockquote>In page 39, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;22.</b>(1) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the potential to raise additional corporation tax revenue by closing down tax loopholes, examining the extended legitimacy and abuse of all corporate tax expenditures, exemptions, allowances and deductions, such as losses forward, R&amp;amp;D tax credits, the Knowledge Development Box, intra-group transactions, allowances on intangible assets and establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5 per cent on gross trading profits and incomes.<br /><br />(2) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a specific report and comparative study on the relative social and economic benefit of research and development tax credit expenditures, benefitting private corporations as against the investment of the equivalent funds into research and development in public universities.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>We dealt with a specific allowance and a particular set of circumstances around the changes made in 2014, but this amendment relates more to the bigger picture of the whole array of allowances, deductions and reliefs available to corporations.  It is worth saying the same groups we have just talked about are the major beneficiaries of this: the Apples, Googles and Facebooks and probably the pharmaceutical companies and so on.  A relatively small number of companies benefit from this vast array of allowances, deductions and reliefs.  What we seek in moving this amendment is a really detailed look at these, with a view to trying to close down all these loopholes that are being exploited to reduce the effective rate being paid by a small number of corporations.  I think the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country do pay in or around the 12.5% because they cannot for the most part utilise many of these reliefs.  It is the big players, the favoured, pampered few of these extraordinarily profitable corporations, that are the big beneficiaries and have the accountants, the consultants and the lawyers and so on to maximise the benefit they derive from all these reliefs.  The scale of the tax benefits they derive is quite extraordinary.  We have talked about the intangible assets.  Another one I came across looking at Revenue's list of these reliefs and allowances is the one entitled intra-group transactions.  I would not mind hearing a little more about this one, which was a relief that cost the Exchequer &euro;2.9 billion in 2015 and &euro;9 billion in 2016.  Again, it is one of these reliefs where we see a staggering increase over one year.</p><p>If the officials want the document to which I have referred it is the second page of a Revenue document titled Cost of Tax Allowances, Credits, Exemptions and Reliefs<b>.</b>It details the various reliefs.  Losses, including capital allowances brought forward from earlier years, were mentioned earlier, and account for &euro;2.7 billion; group relief costs &euro;254 million; research and development tax credit, &euro;700 million; and capital allowances totalling &euro;6 billion.  The total of these, when we add them all up and set them against profits, is extraordinary.  Mr. Seamus Coffey remarks on this in what is a very good paper.  As I have said before, I do not agree with his ultimate conclusions, as I do not think they are radical enough.  However, he comments on the enormous increase in these deductions and allowances.  He writes that they have increased from &euro;18.9 billion in 2003 to &euro;97 billion in 2015.  Those are all tax loopholes that a small number of corporations benefit from.  I repeat, the increase is from &euro;18.9 billion to &euro;97 billion, an extraordinary jump by any standards.<br/><br/>If the small and medium enterprises are for the most part actually paying the 12.5% rate, this explains how a small number of corporations benefitting from these reliefs have actual effective tax rates of 1%, 2%, or in some cases less than 1%.  At the same time, their total aggregate profits, as I mentioned earlier, have gone from &euro;76 billion in 2012 to &euro;149 billion, more than doubling.  There is no doubt that this doubling of profits is attributable to the same small group of companies.  Yet the tax that we get from it does not double.  If gross trading profits double over that period, then one would think our tax revenue would double.  Yet that is not the case.  The increase is from about &euro;4 billion to about &euro;6 billion.  That is a 50% increase in corporate tax revenue, roughly speaking, but there has been more than a 100% increase in profits in that period.  How does one explain that?  It is explained by the fact that we have had this dramatic increase in allowances, reliefs and deductions.  <br/><br/>Do the members not think we should do something about that, and move towards some sort of minimum effective rate so that these players would be forced to pay a fair contribution in tax, rather than doing what we are doing at the moment?  If I give the best interpretation of what the Government is doing, it is chasing them around, trying to catch up with them as their lawyers and accountants engineer ever more imaginative and innovative ways to get around and exploit the tax code, to open up loopholes and so on.  That is the most benign explanation of what is happening.<br/><br/>However, I believe it is worse than that.  I think there is collusion.  Even if I am wrong, surely the way to deal with it, to stop this behaviour, to stop this exploitation of loopholes and to make these people pay a fair proportion of their enormous profits in tax, is to introduce some sort of minimum effective rate.  I would go further.  I would do that and raise the nominal rate.  I know that would be unthinkable for the Minister but could we not at least introduce a minimum effective rate, so that they actually pay the 12.5%?  <br/><br/>These companies would still be making staggering levels of profit.  I do not believe they would leave the country if we did that, because even if they actually pay the 12.5% they would still be paying significantly less here than they are in most jurisdictions in Europe, at least in western Europe, which is where they want to be.  I am sure they want to be in English-speaking western Europe, so our real competition for a lot of this investment is probably only Britain and Scotland.<br/><br/>Would that not be a fair and reasonable thing to do?  Would it not be fair and reasonable, as this amendment suggests, to at least look at all of these allowances and deductions, examine how they are being exploited by these corporations, and look at ways of trying to increase the tax take from them?</p></speech>

My amendment is different, but it captures some of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  It focuses specifically on the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit.  I believe there is a value to the R&amp;D tax credit.  I am not arguing for it to be abolished but I am concerned about the way it is set.  I am concerned about the fact that it is out of control and that the cost of this tax credit is increasing dramatically.  We need to do something about it.  It needs to be reformed.  We see that the cost of the tax credit in 2010 was &euro;224 million, yet five years later it went up to &euro;708 million.  That is a huge increase in a tax credit.</p> <p>  We also see that the number of companies availing of the tax credit has actually decreased, particularly in the 2013-15 period, when the tax credit increased by &euro;300 million.  We know from the data provided by the Revenue and from the independent analysis that ten companies are currently claiming two thirds of the credit.  Some &euro;460 million of it is going to ten companies.  We also know that &euro;283 million of it is dead weight, that is, research and development worth &euro;283 million would have been carried out anyway.  In any type of tax credit there will be a portion of dead weight but 40% is on the high end.  </p> <p>  I know the Government is not there to please me but I do not think it is a good practice to release a lot of these reports on budget day.  A case in point was the help-to-buy report.  I do not think there was anything in that report that could have affected the market, and it could have been released a week before.  This review of the tax credits is another example because there is so much information surrounding it.  It is good that there is so much information in the budget documents but when reports like that are published online on that day they sometimes do not get the attention they deserve.  The evaluation was not a full evaluation or a cost-benefit analysis, and that is something that should be done on the R&amp;D tax credit.  It did recognise that the relief is reasonably successful but it notes that this must be immediately qualified by referring to the notable dead weight associated with this unrestricted fiscal incentive and it goes on to refer to the 40% dead weight. </p> <p>  One of the key things that jumped out at me is that when this report was done, the cost of the tax credit for 2015 was not known.  At the end of the conclusions it suggests, as another approach, lowering the tax reduction to firms that need a break.  The report notes that the value of outstanding credits in 2014 was &euro;592 million and given the size of this future liability to the Exchequer, it recommends considering how to prevent it from increasing even further in the future.  The authors go on to suggest a number of ways in which that can be done.  In 2014, the figure was &euro;553 million, yet within a year it jumped to &euro;708 million.  God knows where it was in 2016, and indeed 2017, but on this basis we could be looking at a billion-euro tax credit very soon.  The problem here is that two thirds of it is going to the top ten companies, so it does not reach small and medium enterprises.  Indeed, the report refers to the fact that younger companies are not benefitting from this and it refers to a wait-and-see approach.  That is not good for younger companies.</p> <p>  We have a scheme that is not working and is costing a lot of money.  The number of companies that it are availing of it shrinking, yet the cost of it is increasing and there is significant dead weight.</p><p>While 40% of dead weight might be acceptable in a lower-cost scheme, when the dead weight is at over &euro;250 million, we have to ask about the structure of the tax credit.  My amendment therefore calls for a report within six months setting out the specific actions to be taken to reform the research and development tax credit, reduce the cost of the credit, stop abuses relating to inflated claims and make the credit more appropriate for SMEs.  I refer to abuses because there appears to be a mismatch in the CSO data and the data provided by companies.  That could be the result of an inflation of research and development for the purposes of gaining the tax credit.  That is something that would need to be teased out.  I am not asking the Minister to amend this now as I do not really know how to do that.  There is a report already which has provided a number of suggestions.  We need to signal the fact that there will be changes to the research and development tax credit, in relation to which the Minister needs to carry out a proper and full cost-benefit analysis as suggested.  It is time to look at implementing some of the recommendations suggested.</p></speech>

This is specifically on the research and development tax credit.  I am asking the Minister to consider whether the amount of money which has been given in a tax allowance for research and development to a very small number of corporations, as has already said, would be better spent on public universities.  The debate is often framed as follows.  If one is against research and development credits, one is claimed to be against innovation and research and development.  I am very much in favour of research and development but there is an opportunity cost in giving the funding to private companies through tax expenditures because that money is not going to public universities. There would be a lot more benefit and advantage for the domestic economy if that happened.  I refer to the real Irish economy as against the economy that exists around a tiny number of multinational corporations which could be gone at any point and who get far more from us than we get from them.  We should look at which approach would provide a greater benefit to the Irish economy and society as a whole.  Is it to continue with this very large tax expenditure which benefits private corporations or is it to provide that money for research and development in our public universities?  I ask the Minister to address that point.</p></speech>

This will only take one moment to do.  First, I have been asked by the Revenue Commissioner to clarify a comment made during the earlier discussion on REITs.  REITs do not get a tax deduction for local property tax.  REITs pay a dividend out of the profits available for distribution and the shareholders are taxed on the amount received.  I think there was an exchange earlier that may not have given that point the certainty it needed.  On another matter relating to section 8 of the Bill, my officials have advised me that a technical amendment may be required to make the section work as intended.  I am signalling that I may need to bring such an amendment forward on Report Stage.</p> <p>  On the amendments proposed by Deputies Doherty and Boyd Barrett, I note that the Irish corporation tax regime contains a small number of specifically-targeted tax reliefs the focus of which is on the creation of additional employment, as is consistent with current Government policy on innovation, with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  In contrast, our approach to this tax is clear.  We have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  The amendments relate to a number of different areas which I will address individually.</p> <p>  Under existing loss-relief provisions in the Taxes Act, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for off-set against trading income of the same trade in a future accounting period.  Losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade are a normal fact of business life.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code as it is in all other OECD countries.  The carrying forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions.</p> <p>  The central purpose of the knowledge development box, or KDB, is to encourage companies to carry out their substantive activities in Ireland.  The KDB is based on the modified nexus approach which was designed by the OECD as part of the BEPS project and is not designed by tax planners seeking to design complex tax avoidance structures.  By adhering to the rules, the KDB is a positive measure for Ireland which is focused on incentivising substantive research and development and encouraging companies to bring in real operations and high quality jobs that have a positive impact on the Irish economy.  The research and development tax credit is also a very important feature of the Irish corporate tax structure.  The central purpose of the tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high value-added research and development activity in Ireland thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  Reflecting these considerations, the Government's innovation 2020 strategy aims to achieve the EU 2020 target of increasing overall, i.e. public and private, research and development expenditure in Ireland to 2.5% of GNP by 2020.</p> <p>  A review of the research and development credit was carried out by my Department ahead of budget 2017.  It concluded that the credit was responsible for 60% of the research and development being conducted in our country.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of additionality.  The bang-for-buck ratio is estimated to be 2.4.  That means for every &euro;1 in foregone tax revenue, &euro;2.40 in additional research and development is being conducted.  This is also considered a reasonable result.  Overall, the paper's findings suggest that the rationale for the research and development tax credit is not in question.  Firms have clearly responded to it by increasing their research and development.  My officials and I are conscious of the need to evaluate the research and development tax credit regularly, but it is important to recognise that while this is a significant credit, it is one of the few tax credits in our corporate tax code compared to other jurisdictions.  However, I am mindful of the need to monitor the cost of this tax credit and will continue to do so in line with the Department's tax expenditure guidelines.</p> <p>  In line with the established practice of carrying out periodic reviews of key areas of tax policy, a review of Ireland's corporate tax code has recently been undertaken.  The review made 18 substantial recommendations which we are now working to implement.  Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the review sets out a road map for the State to create certainty on the implementation of the recommended measures.  These include the launch of a consultation process which is now under way.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.</p> <p>  One of the points raised during the contributions of the Deputies related to the discrepancy between the Revenue Commissioner and CSO figures.  According to the CSO, total business expenditure and research and development, which is referred to as "BERD", was provisionally estimated at &euro;2.1 billion in 2014, of which &euro;200 million related to capital expenditure.  Initial Revenue tax returns indicated a 2014 figure of &euro;4.6 billion, with no capital expenditure subtotal given.</p><p>In 2014, at that point a broad definition of Research and Development was still in operation in the Revenue guidelines.  The Revenue Commissioners has now confirmed that the initial figures, including carry forward tax credits resulted in a double counting of the eligible expenditure.  Further data provided by Revenue, removing the influence of the carry forward credits indicate there is not a substantial difference between the Revenue's estimates for gross expenditure linked the Research and Development tax credit and the CSO's BERD.  In regard to the cost and why it keeps increasing, the costs of the scheme have continued to rise and the most up-to-date figure is &euro;708 million with 1,535 claims.  It has risen from &euro;282 million in 2012.  However, between 2012 and 2015, the base year threshold of the research and development tax credit was phased out and ultimately removed.  This entailed that all relevant expenditure could qualify for the tax credit, where previously qualified expenditure for research and development was only that in excess of the expenditure incurred in 2003.  In other words there was a change in the base year which in turn had effect in the cost which increased the following years.  </p><p> I am aware that this is one of the few credits we have in our corporate tax code and that is in contrast to other countries with whom we compete.  I am also aware of the fact that this is tax expenditure that is increasing and has increased significantly.  While I can point to plausible reasons as to why this has happened, it is reaching a very large and even larger figure and I will monitor further growth in that figure carefully across next year.</p></speech>

I think the Minister is ignoring some of the points made in the report.  The report states that it is pertinent  to ensure that this does not increase.  After the publication of the report we find out that it has already increased by another  &euro;150 million.  The Minister is also ignoring the recommendations in the report about multiple claims and the fact that it does not affect younger firms.</p> <p>  My amendment is very simple.  By the time we return next year to consider the finance Bill the research and development tax credit could be worth &euro;1,000 million.  In my amendment I  request the Minister to report on action to be taken to reform the tax credit.  It needs to be reformed as fewer companies  are availing of it and younger companies are not availing of it.  It completely out of control.  The rate of increase is &euro;150 million a year.  We argued the toss of &euro;10 million here and &euro;10 million there, but this is similar to the Minister spending this amount of money.</p> <p>  It is disappointing that the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I see the value in research and development tax credits.  It is important for companies to have that tax credit.  It is also important for the certainty of research and development but we have to do something about it.  The Minister has given no commitment to a review of the tax credit.  The report that he published on budget day last year called for further analysis on it.  There was no cross-benefit analysis and it referred to simpler ways for analysing it.  I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage but I encourage the Minister to look again at that report and come back with a substantial amendment.</p></speech>

It seems to amount to the privatisation of research and development.  The funding of our universities was hammered during the period of austerity.  They lost approximately 30% of their funding.  Would it not be better, rather than have this huge tax expenditure on research and development tax credits, to put more money back into our universities?  Should we not at least examine which would be more beneficial to our economy and our society and examine whether this is a good tax expenditure?</p></speech>

As Deputies know, I made an announcement that I am planning to increase the training levy by 0.1% per year for the next three years.  For next year alone that will bring in an additional &euro;36 million to &euro;37 million that would be available for higher and further education in our country.  I plan to increase that by two further moves afterwards.  I have also made a very significant increase in funding that is available to the Department of Education and Skills.  Granted, much of that funding is going into challenges that the Department must meet in primary and secondary education.  That is the reason I have decided to increase the training levy in employers' PRSI, to create a funding stream that will go directly to third, fourth level education.  I decided on a levy rather than a tax because if I introduced a tax I would not have the ability to divert it to that sector.</p> <p>  I largely agree with the Deputies on the value of research and development in our universities.  To end on a final point of agreement, the research and development that takes place under this tax credit clearly has to have a commercial value to the company, otherwise it would not be happening.  We link it into particular criteria.  One of the reasons that I want to increase funding to universities is that there is a great value and benefit in research and development that does not have a commercial value.  Our universities are the place where that should happen.</p></speech>
