I welcome the director of the facility, Mr. Pat Bergin, and the chairperson of the board of management, Professor Ursula Kilkelly.  I thank them for attending and for waiting out both our private session and the fire alarm.  Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members, and indeed witnesses, to please switch off their mobile phones or else switch them to flight mode.  Phones interfere with our sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters, and the media, to follow our meeting.  I further advise the witnesses that the submissions or opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I understand that the witnesses will make a short presentation here today, which will then be followed by questions from committee members.</p><p>I now call Mr. Bergin to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Oberstown children's detention campus is the national detention facility for the care of young people referred to us by the courts on remand or detention orders.  We provide a safe and secure environment for young people, help them address offending behaviour, and prepare for a positive return to their families and communities.  The campus is a modern facility with new buildings and services and our programmes are based on best practice in the care of young people who offend.</p> <p>  Young people who come to Oberstown have generally experienced significant adversity and disadvantage in their lives.  They are usually between 15 and 17 years of age, male, and have had many significant associations with the care system.  They have struggled with poor experiences in education, many suffer from mental health problems and addiction, and have often experienced trauma or loss.  Our young people have been through many of the state services and supports, often unsuccessfully, and present with challenging behaviour and complex unmet needs.  Our job in providing them with care, education and protection is challenged by these factors, but at Oberstown it is our mission to ensure that young people detained at the campus are supported to move away from offending behaviour to make a more positive contribution to society.  We do this having regard to our values of respect; learning and reflection; working together; honesty and integrity; and commitment to quality care and support. </p> <p>  I am pleased to be here today to report on progress at the Oberstown campus since my last appearance before this committee in October 2016.  My role as director is to manage Oberstown children's detention campus to ensure we provide the highest standards of care for young people in a safe environment for staff, fulfilling the requirements of the Children Act 2001.  I work under the guidance of a board of management, the chairperson of which, Professor Ursula Kilkelly, is also in attendance today, and the Irish Youth Justice Service in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p> <p>  Although licensed to accommodate 54 young people, Oberstown currently has a daily population of approximately 40 young people, with a third of these young people on remand orders.</p><p>We now accommodate young people on detention orders separately from those on remand, which has proven to be a very positive development in providing a safe environment for staff and young people.  Those young people who serve longer sentences also enjoy a care regime that is in line with their needs and circumstances.</p><p> Last March, Ireland reached a milestone in ending the placement of young people in adult prisons when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister for Justice and Equality commenced the relevant legislation.

Oberstown played a significant role in achieving this objective by creating the conditions to enable the campus to take these additional, older young people and we are pleased to have made our contribution to this historic development.</p> <p>  There have been many other positive developments on the campus in the past year that have been important steps in achieving the Oberstown vision statement.  These improvements have helped to consolidate the operation of Oberstown as a safe and secure campus for the detention of young people, operating to best practice.  Notwithstanding this progress, challenges remain and will to an extent always be part of a facility that is charged with detaining young people with a history of difficult behaviour.</p> <p>  Oberstown is inspected by the Health and Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on an annual basis.  In March, it completed an announced inspection of Oberstown over a four-day period with up to five inspectors involved in various aspects.  As part of the inspection, inspectors met children, staff and professionals from other agencies.  They observed practices and reviewed documentation such as children's placement plans, policies and procedures, minutes of staff meetings, management meetings and board meetings, children's files and staff files.</p> <p>  During this inspection, HIQA found that, of the ten standards assessed, there was compliance with two, moderate non-compliance with six and major non-compliance with two.  Immediate action plans were issued in respect of two issues: safeguarding a child in terms of the safe administration of a prescribed medicine; and ensuring that measures were in place to store medicines securely.  I provided a written assurance that appropriately addressed the inspectors' concerns.</p> <p>  Inspectors found that the context in which Oberstown operated continued to be one of major change and that many new structures had been put in place since the previous inspection.  These included new governance arrangements, the recruitment of new senior managers and the development of a human resources section.</p> <p>  Inspectors reported that there was a positive atmosphere in the residential units and observed warm interaction between children and staff.  Children received adequate emotional and psychological care.  They also noted that the approach to the management of behaviour was subject to review at the time of inspection, risk was well managed, policies and procedures were in the process of being reviewed, and the cohort of residential staff had been increased and was adequate.</p> <p>  A comprehensive action plan addressing the compliance issues noted by HIQA was developed by Oberstown following the inspection and is currently being implemented by the campus.  All of the issues highlighted by inspectors were already being addressed as part of ongoing work to improve and develop the campus.</p> <p>  One of the areas of concern that the report raised, and that has been a matter of particular attention and scrutiny, is the use of single separation.  At Oberstown, we continue to improve our record keeping, monitoring and, most importantly, use of single separation in line with national and Oberstown policy.  It is important to note that single separation is used upon admission, for behavioural concerns, contraband and individual programmes.  When used for behavioural concerns, there is a clear policy framework in place that staff and the organisation must follow.  Oberstown is closely tracking monitoring and evaluating the use of single separation.</p> <p>  In October, the board adopted a statement on restrictive practices to underscore the importance of using single separation and other restrictive practices as a measure of last resort.  The restrictive practices statement acknowledges that, from time to time, young people may display challenging behaviour that poses a risk to themselves, other young people, staff or the security of the campus.  In such exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to use restrictive practices to protect a young person or persons from harm, to prevent injury to staff, to prevent damage to property and to protect Oberstown security.  Importantly, the board's statement makes clear that it considers it essential to minimise the use of all restrictive practices and ensure that they are used only in line with policy and procedure and are closely monitored and reviewed.</p> <p>  Turning to other areas of progress, I have been working with the board of management on the development of a three-year strategic plan for the campus.  This was approved by the board in September and will be launched next month.  The plan has five key strategic goals: the care of young people; a skilled and supported workforce; high standards and continuous improvement; communication; and systems and accountability.  Each goal has a plan and progress is being made to implement a number of objectives under each.</p> <p>  In terms of ensuring a safe work environment for staff, the campus has a senior management team that focuses on positive care and security, management of risks and enhanced safety while leading the campus into a new period of development.  A new deputy director with responsibility for risk and safety has been appointed and the operations of the central hub have been reviewed, with particular focus across the campus on health and safety.  Dedicated staff on the campus are now tasked with developing an awareness of risk assessments, investigations and the individual's responsibility to keep everyone safe.  Steps have been taken to improve physical and dynamic security with the adoption of a health and safety roadmap and a facilities management company has been appointed to provide external support in this regard, with the effect of enhancing response times and completing timely and effective remedial building works.</p> <p>  Looking to the staff's well-being, a peer support initiative - the critical incident management system, CISM - is being implemented across the campus.  CISM is an on-site service providing support to staff involved in workplace critical incidents.  A team of trained peer supporters provides a confidential, easily accessible and highly responsive "psychological first aid" service for fellow staff who are experiencing emotional distress arising from a difficult event at work.  A critical incident stress management policy and a mental health and well-being guide have also been developed.</p> <p>  The board of management has approved a communication and engagement plan that aims to improve our internal and external communications with staff, young people and their families, and other external stakeholders.  The committee may also be aware that we are publishing research and other data.  Since April, we have been publishing monthly campus statistics regarding occupancy and providing an age breakdown.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, we published a more in-depth report on the characteristics of young people placed on the campus for the first three months of 2017.  As well as offering insights into offending and sentencing, the data collated from this snapshot study highlight the level of adversity and trauma young people in detention have experienced, including the loss of parents, neglect and abuse, and multiple care placements.  The data also demonstrate the multiple overlapping risks and needs that young people in detention have and the many professionals and services with which they have been involved.  By gathering these data, we hope to inform our services and ensure that there is an understanding by all stakeholders and the public of the service we are attempting to provide and the young people we care for in Oberstown.</p> <p>  A number of other initiatives include the introduction of a programme of embedding restorative practices into the culture of the campus.  The aim of restorative practice is to develop community and manage conflict and tensions by building relationships and repairing harm.  The programme of training is being delivered by the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative, TWCDI.  A feature of the programme is that training is provided to young people, equipping them with strategies for dealing with conflict and violence.</p> <p>  We also have a joint initiative with Le Ch&eacute;ile, which is providing mentoring for families of young people on the campus in preparation for their release.  This unique and innovative programme allows parents and young people who are involved with Oberstown the opportunity to avail of mentoring and family support services in the community.  A part-time worker is based on campus to support the project and this service will be in operation for two years.  Youth Advocate Programmes, YAP, Ireland continues to engage directly with young people on campus in preparation for them leaving the campus.  It has been on site for approximately two years.</p> <p>  The national reconfiguration of the Tusla assessment consultation therapy service, ACTS, on campus is a positive opportunity to develop further the inter-agency approach incorporating the HSE mental health services and the campus.  We plan to have a more integrated approach to the clinical services available to young people in place in early 2018.  This opportunity is a development welcomed by all agencies working at the campus.</p><p>We are also committed to ensuring that the views of young people are heard and taken into account in matters that affect them, both individually and as a group.  The board of management recently signed off on an Oberstown strategy for participation with young people.</p><p> In this regard, consultation with young people is ongoing with regular meetings of a campus council made up of young people.  The campus council provides a safe space where young people can actively express their views on issues that affect them.  Young people have the chance to influence and hear back from key decision-makers in areas of importance, chosen by them.  All of these achievements are building blocks to ensure that in time Oberstown becomes an international centre of excellence from both a youth justice and a children&rsquo;s rights perspective.</p><p> Committee members will be aware that in late 2016 and early 2017, a number of reviews of Oberstown were undertaken.  In light of the volume and complexity of the recommendations emanating from these reviews, in March 2017 the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs established a review implementation group chaired by Professor Ursula Kilkelly, chair of the board of management at Oberstown, with representation from Oberstown management, staff, trade unions, the Irish Youth Justice Service and an external expert in child development.</p><p> Since its establishment, the review group has considered the 120 recommendations emerging from all of the reviews, classifying them according to priority, required resources and owner.  Following a period of intense scrutiny and review, work in Oberstown is now focusing on the implementation of these recommendations.  Designed to enhance the level of care provided to young people and to ensure that Oberstown is a safe place to work, the implementation process is complex, costly and resource-intensive.  Aided by the work of the review implementation group and supported by the strategic planning process, it is important this work is co-ordinated and systematic, and brings to a close the expert input of all reviewers in order to ensure that the young people in Oberstown have the best possible care and education as part of their experience of the wider youth justice system.</p><p> I thank the committee members for the opportunity to update them on progress and developments at Oberstown.  I extend an invitation to them to visit the campus at any time to see the facility in operation.  Professor Kilkelly and I would be happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance as I will be leaving in about 15 minutes.  If the responses are not finished by then, I hope that my colleagues will follow up on some of the questions I will put.</p> <p>  While I thank Mr. Bergin for his statement, it is very typical of statements where it is about how wonderful it is that things have improved.  I have some concerns.  The child is not central to this statement.  Mr. Bergin spoke about how he is improving things for staff.  He spoke about putting different structures in place.  Mr. Bergin briefly mentioned restrictive practices usually when children are brought in at the beginning.  Two really serious concerns are not addressed in the opening statement.  It is all very well to put structures into the organisation, but if the child is not central to everything, then none of this is worthwhile.</p> <p>  Mr. Bergin referred to the nature of the children and that they have challenging behaviours and also about how the lack of resources may be impeding any major progress.  The reality is that Oberstown is for children with challenging behaviours.  The system should have been created around that.  The two basic things I want to discuss have nothing to do with resources.  First, I presume restrictive practice means single separation and restraints.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It also refers to use of handcuffs.</p></speech>

I was going to ask Mr. Bergin to list the types of restraints that are used in practice.  According to the Oberstown records, when restraints have been used, the type used has not been recorded.  I find that worrying.  Is it a deliberate act that the records do not show that or was it a mistake?</p> <p>  Mr. Bergin said that the practice of single separation is really for children on admission in the first place.  As we know, single separation has taken place with children who are detained there.  The records show that not only did some children spend long periods of time alone, but also it did not show that this was used as a last resort.  We have no idea if this was a quickie solution or if everything had taken place to ensure that the proper procedures were followed.  I will throw all these questions in and I appreciate Mr. Bergin listening.</p></speech>

I was deeply concerned to see that not all the Oberstown staff had been trained in Children First.  I ask for an update on that.</p> <p>  The first-aid training the staff received did not include basic elements such as the management of burns, broken bones, scalding or wounds that are bleeding.  These are everyday hazards that occur with children in this environment; they get broken bones, cuts and other wounds.  I again seek an update.  Has that improvement in training been implemented?</p> <p>  The next item is very close to my heart.  Research shows that children who are incarcerated usually engage in self-harming behaviours.  I would like Mr. Bergin to answer this question before the others.  What do the Oberstown staff do with children who self-harm?</p> <p>  Those are the three basic concerns I have.  This is not scrutinising or condemning the witnesses.  We can only improve if people make us aware of the areas in which we need to improve.  This is a wonderful opportunity for Mr. Bergin and his organisation to make valuable improvements in Oberstown.  He should not see this as me lashing out at him.  It is something that really concerns me.</p></speech>

We have designed bedrooms where the possibility of self-harm is reduced.  Ligature points are removed.  We look at linen, clothes and such matters.  From time to time young people may use their own clothes to wrap around their neck to try to choke themselves.  Some young people will try to bang their heads against the wall.  There is a range of different behaviours.  We engage with those young people and spend time with them.  We are minding them during the period of crisis they are having.  In one sense there is no point in taking them away; that is not what they require.</p></speech>

It is not used if they are harming themselves, unless they are using an implement to cut themselves and that may be taken off them.  Somebody may break a piece of cutlery or a cup and the intention is to try to remove that safely.  The risk is assessed according to whether they are just threatening themselves or inflicting pain on themselves.  If they are inflicting pain on themselves, consideration is given to the level of pain or damage.  Sometimes young people scratch themselves and then they say they have cut themselves and they look for attention.  There is a range of behaviours.  Each young person will behave differently.  Our staff are constantly monitoring young people.  For young people in particular, we have five minute observations, ten minute observations and half an hour observations depending on the associated level of risk.  There is a general default position in Oberstown, which is that there is a possibility that any child there will inflict harm on themselves.</p></speech>

Right throughout the night we have night staff monitoring children.  At 10 p.m. there is a review of everyone in the unit.  Two staff are on for the night looking after eight young people.  They get a hand-over from the day staff on how, for example, Tommy got on during the night and what are the issues.  There could be a five minute observation of that young person right up until they go to sleep and then after that it could be every ten or 15 minutes, but that will be determined by individual issues.  Some young people ask that we do not come in to check on them after they fall asleep because it wakes them up and that creates further distress for them.  Some young people have a very complicated history of self-harm.  We usually get the information very quickly when they arrive because they have been involved in other services.  The assessment, consultation and therapy service, ACTS, team links in with outside services and the GP is aware of it.  Particular plans are put in place.  We may have particular key workers that are aligned to a young person so as to have one or two staff engage with them.  One does not want a large number of different adults engaging with a young person over a week.  We tailor the approach.</p></speech>

It may help the committee if I describe particular scenarios and what happens with young people in Oberstown.</p> <p>  If we have a young person - for example, a 16 year old - who is in crisis, not managing well or demonstrating behaviour that is a concern, that behaviour will be evident in a number of different ways.  The young person may refuse to go to the kitchen, refuse to return from school, turn furniture upside down or be threatening to staff.  That might be the scenario.  The default position of all staff in Oberstown is to engage verbally with that young person.  What normally happens is that other young people are moved away from the environment in which the incident occurs, after which staff can start to engage.  One considers the staff team and who has the best relationship with this young person.  The staff member and the young person start talking at length.  More often than not, the scenarios last 40 minutes on the corridor and two or three staff members try to get an understanding with this young person of what is going on, what his or her way out is and how he or she will manage.  They will relate this back to scenarios that occurred the previous day or the day before that.</p> <p>  Young people on the campus have what we call individual crisis management plans.  We develop these with young people.  If they face crises, we try to establish what things work and do not work for them.  Everyone is different.  Some young people will say they want to ring home.  We will tell them they can do so when they have calmed down, and that will help them.  Other young people will say they want to be away from Mary or Tommy or Billy.  Each individual crisis management plan is known to the staff and they will draw on that plan.  However, if a young person in this situation continues to become more volatile, staff will make an assessment.  They will evaluate the risk.  The risks can vary.  The risk could be that an incident has been ongoing for an hour, by which time it is half nine at night, the young person is creating a challenge on a corridor and no other young people can go to bed because that person is there.  The decision is then made that we need to move that young person on.  The young person is made aware of the possibilities, which may involve what we call a physical intervention.  The physical intervention can be to walk him or her out of the corridor or to go into a full restraint.</p> <p>  All the staff are trained in what we call management of actual or potential aggression, MAPA, as part of our behaviour management programme.  This looks at how to physically hold someone in as safe a way as possible, for both the young person and any other young people there.  Staff are trained in this and the physical restraint involves two or three staff members.  It is neither an option that staff like nor an option in which people want to participate for many different reasons.  Staff are very mindful that once they get into a physical intervention with a young person, there is a possibility they will damage the relationship with that young person and that someone will get hurt, either the young person or the staff member.</p> <p>  A restraint may involve two or three staff members, or perhaps more, holding a young person on the corridor or the floor until he or she calms down.  There are very clear approaches going back years in this regard.  If one physically restrains someone, one keeps a hold of him or her there until he or she calms down, and in calming down one then regains control.  One then agrees a plan with that young person.  The plan may be to go to the young person's bedroom or the sitting room.  The young person may be asked what he or she wants or what is the issue.  A key focus of the physical intervention is to ensure that while that young person cannot manage, he or she is being helped to manage.  All the training we have done over the years is around not only maintaining the relationship, but also ensuring that people are safe.  This is another key focus of the approach.  We do not want people hurt or in pain.</p><p>The top part of the body is held on the floor, the legs are maintained in one position and one person talks.  It is a very scientific approach.  Only one person speaks at a time in case the young person gets confused.  There is one voice and one direction and that is about moving on.  If the young person is allowed to calm down then the situation can be moved along.  The number of physical restraints has substantially decreased in Oberstown because people are spending far more time talking.  That took a shift in culture.  Rather than going in and physically moving the child and putting him into a room, we are now spending time in the corridor or in the yard engaging with them.  That has become part of the norm.  </p><p> There was a reference earlier to self-harm.  The same approach is applied on that issue.  One spends time - as long as it takes - with the young person who is self-harming.  However, if it gets to a point where there is a serious risk that the young person is going to damage himself or herself, there must be physical intervention because one has a responsibility to keep that young person safe.  We have many options for that eventuality.  There are psychiatric services on site.  We have spent a long time working with the HSE and the assessment consultation therapy service, ACTS, team to ensure we have mental health services on site.  There is access to a GP.  We have a medical team.  We have nurses on site from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  We have a medical suite.  All of these services are available and are accessed as required.  If something occurs after 10 p.m., we call CareDoc or the medical emergency services.  We do whatever is required.  </p><p> The other restrictive practice relates to handcuffs, and it was referenced earlier.  Handcuffs are not routinely used on the campus.  There are exceptional circumstances where a staff member would use handcuffs to manage behaviour.  However, all young people - 99% of them - arrive on the campus in handcuffs.  They leave with garda&iacute; every day in handcuffs.  That is the nature of young people being in detention.  We have been attempting to introduce a policy where young people are not handcuffed when they are leaving the campus with a member of staff.  That is based on a risk assessment.  If we were to take a young person off campus today and were he to run away, the first question that would be asked is why was he not secured.  The young person would have become a risk and might offend out in the community.  </p><p> The three points to which reference was made earlier are covered by the term "restrictive practice".  I will speak about single separation in a moment.  We want to highlight that it is something that is very significant.  To restrict the movement of a young person and to take away his or her control is not routine.  We are attempting to highlight with all of our staff that this is outside of the norm and it is working.  There needs to be accountability when these restrictive practices are used.</p><p> There was a reference to records earlier.  Staff know how to restrain.  The focus then is to record it.  While what they have done is important and appropriate and has resulted in the safety of the young person, unless it is recorded, we do not know what has happened.  That has been a shift in culture and it is improving significantly.  Linked with that is the concept of single separation.  Single separation is used across the campus in many different forms.  There was reference to young people coming in on admissions.  If that happens they may be separated for a length of time, depending on the concerns around their behaviour.  This morning, like every morning, we check how many lads are on single separation.  There are 42 children on the campus this morning, two of whom are on what we call structured programmes.  Due to behaviour that has taken place over the last few days there is a clear structure in place outside of the norm for those two.  One young person is in single separation and has been for a number of days.  Staff have been going in and engaging with him, trying to establish a plan and to move this young person on.  He has very complex needs.  Every day we evaluate what is the approach, what is the individual crisis management plan, what is the staff relationship and how it can be moved on.  We have policies and procedures but we are focused on the practice and making sure it reflects what is best practice and that the young person is at the centre of it.  </p><p> The care, education, health, offending behaviour and preparing for release, CEHOP, framework, which was developed by me over the past few years, is based on the focus of young people.  Everything we do focuses on the care, education, health, well-being and offending behaviour of the young people and how we can prepare them for leaving.  The centre of all that we do is the young person and to support that, our placement planning is key.  We look at the young person's needs and decide how we can put a plan in place that is specific to that young person.  The plans are not generic or all in one, because the young people who come to Oberstown all have different experiences and challenges.  From that perspective, I make the point that everything that we do on the campus places the young person at the centre.</p></speech>

The HIQA report identifies that 86% of staff are now trained, which is a significant improvement for us compared with what had been there.  All staff have now received training in child protection.  Because of the change brought about by Children First, we need to update that again for 2018.  We have a social worker on site.  We have access to the social worker for all staff and young people.  While the training is important and necessary, the culture should be one of openness and willingness to understand child protection issues, how to report them and how to follow them through.  There have been significant improvements in the area of training.  My concern is that we may overtrain the staff.  While much needs to be done in respect of behavioural management, child protection and restorative practice, it should be spread over a period, rather than doing it all over six months, in which case our staff would be overtrained.</p></speech>

Now we have three nurses on site to cover throughout the day.  The idea is there will be proper medical provision on site.  We have a comprehensive GP system on site.  All of our staff are trained in basic first aid.  The question that arose concerned an enhanced first aid model.  My concern is that we have over 160 staff and if everybody was to be trained to that level, it would take a long time.  If there is a scald injury or a broken bone there needs to be an immediate response.  The focus should be on making sure the service is available to the young person rather than on everyone being trained.  I have structured that by making sure the appropriate medical ability is on site.  We have recently added a social care worker to our medical team to ensure that medication management over weekends is at the highest possible standard.  We are continuously reviewing how we can do that.</p></speech>

Members can indicate to me if they wish to come in, but before that I have a question.  During my recent visit to Oberstown I was very impressed with the school, and in particular the available curriculum, which is tailor-made for individuals with more practical subjects.  The only question arising from that which I did not ask during my visit concerns access to that school, in terms of a programme for all detainees, whether they are there on a temporary or more permanent basis.  This was subject to correspondence by a third party following my visit.  Can Mr. Bergin outline the sort of programmes, the educational requirements and the access pathways that are available in Oberstown, please?</p></speech>

Outside of the staff complement, there are approximately 28 teachers who provide education.  The school has been designed and built to accommodate up to 80 young people and the ratio of young people to teachers is approximately 3:1.  The school is based around the primary school year and runs until the end of June even though second-level classes and subjects are taught.</p> <p>  With regard to the campus, it is expected that all the young people attend school and they want to and are eager to attend school.  Generally, the young people would divide the subjects into two categories.  They would talk about the practical subjects such as metalwork and woodwork, which they all want to attend.   Then there are the more academic subjects such as English and Irish.  The school has a regime, which is that they do both.  That is the deal between the young people and the principal and teachers, and it works well. </p> <p>  The school day kicks off around 9.45 a.m. and finishes at 3.20 p.m.  The class times are longer now.  They used to be 40 minutes.  However, due to the challenge of moving young people between classes, they are now one hour long.  The school structures that by reference to the subjects and the mix of young people and their inclination.  If memory serves me correctly, in 2017 ten young people sat junior certificate exams.  In 2016, 17 young people sat junior certificate exams.  In 2016, 83 or 84 young people did QQI education modules and I believe that so far 53 young people have done them in 2017.  These modules are components of junior certificate exams which they will be in a position to use when they move on to other educational facilities.  If they go to school out in the community, they will be able to build up the capacity and say they have done certain exams or got certain accreditation. </p> <p>  Art, reading and writing is important to many of the young people and making stuff for their families is important to them.  They want to spend as much time as they can in school.  We are currently considering what the exact educational programme should be and the board has instigated a process to examine whether we need to have a better understanding of the educational needs of these young people rather than saying this is the model for young people to fit into.</p> <p>  There are two schools: one in the remand unit, which young people there attend, and one in the main campus, which the committal lads attend.  That helps because it means people are getting more time in school.  Dividing them, we can get people into school quickly and teachers can focus on the individual subjects.  Young people on remand will engage with some subjects.  Classroom numbers are even smaller again because of the way it is designed.  Therefore, there might be two young people in a classroom with a teacher.  In the main campus, it is usually three.  The lads are quite anxious to and want to attend.  When we consider the posters and all that is going on, we see that the lads are quite proud of what they do in the school.  The principal and the vice-principal tailor a lot of what they do to individual young people's needs.  They then work with us by identifying schools and options for young people who are moving on.  When young people come in, they contact the schools the young people had attended.  In our recent statistics, when we reviewed the figure in the first quarter of 2017, 45% or 46% of young people had not been attending school prior to their coming to us.  There had been a big drop out.  Therefore, to have young people come back into the school situation was quite a benefit and important for them.</p> <p>  I meet young people regularly and many speak about their options when they move on.  More often than not, they want to do an apprenticeship, get a Safe Pass to work on a building site or go onto Youthreach.  They want to continue what they started.  That is the challenge and the school helps to support us in terms of ensuring those options are available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017110800002#P00200"><p>I thank Mr. Bergin for his presentation.  I want to focus on the major areas of non-compliance found in the HIQA report.  I have several questions.  The discussion on control and restraint, as it was called in the past, is reminiscent of lots of discussions of psychiatric institutions and other jails and what is now accredited.  Mr. Bergin referred to the management of actual or potential aggression, MAPA, model.  The management of difficult behaviour is difficult.  The HIQA report states that the MAPA model of managing behaviour did not fully meet the needs of children or staff but it also states that not all staff adhere to the behaviour management policies.  Is MAPA sufficient in meeting the needs of children and staff?  Is it the only show in town?  Are staff not implementing MAPA?  It is quite traumatic for the individual and the staff to have to hold someone down and stay with them.  We know from the fatalities that have been caused due to obstruction of airways and interference with cardiac functions that many front-line staff have come across this and we need to reform it.  However, there is a contradiction in the two statements in the report in that it is not meeting needs yet the staff are not adhering to it.  Will Mr. Bergin comment on the training model and whether he believes it is the right one?</p> <p>  There is an insurance issue for staff if they do not use the MAPA model and are seen to be outside it.   As a practitioner, my insurance cover was compromised if I did not use the prescribed accredited method.  In situations of extreme violence, trauma or emotion, not everything can be followed to the tee.  This needs to be understood.  </p> <p>  On children being at the centre of their own care, are they involved from the outset?  Do they understand and agree to a treatment model?  Is this by way of signature?  This way there would be ownership on the part of the child, as much as it can possibly be understood.  They will not adhere to it all the time but it gives them a strength of ownership in following a treatment model and an understanding that it is best for them and not necessarily just there to continually punish.</p> <p>  The other quite concerning area of major non-compliance is the administration of medication.  There are three nursing staff.  Is it just the nursing staff who administer and dispense medication and sign off on the prescriptions or is it the general workers in the facility also?  The report notes incidents of treatment being delayed when this was recommended by nursing staff.  Will the witness comment on that statement?  I know there has been something akin to a Mexican stand-off in our prisons when nursing staff have told prison officers that someone needs treatment.  There is a sort of Mexican stand-off as to who has the authority.  That is another issue.</p> <p>  The report stated that the measures in place to ensure a robust chain of custody for medicines requiring additional controls were not adequate.  This refers to the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Dangerous Drugs Act, which have specific provisions on how drugs are stored, ordered, counted and how one double-signs and makes sure the chain of events can be followed.  Drugs are to be returned to the pharmacy or, if there is one, the pharmacy facility on-site.  Drugs are always accounted for and two professional people are responsible and account for them.</p><p>Mr. Bergin has said that he had addressed the matter with written assurance to the inspectors.  Can we have an explanation and copy of that?</p><p> Mentally ill people are increasingly incarcerated in prisons because of the closure of our big institutions and the lack of beds.  The same applies to children.  We know of the closure of Linn Dara and of other facilities for children that are not functional or at full capacity.  I gather there are 47 beds in the entire country.  Can the Oberstown representatives comment on whether child mental well-being or mental ill-health is becoming part of the criminal justice system?  Is Oberstown getting more people who would be more appropriately housed in secure child units?</p></speech>

I describe MAPA as a tool in the box of approaches that our staff can use.  Overall, we have a behaviour management approach.  Under the behaviour management approach on admissions we talk about how we gather information on young people.  We talk about young people understanding the routines and what is expected of them.  We look at the key worker allocated to the young person and the engagement the key worker will have.  We talk about what the expectation will be and contact with family etc.  A range of elements form our behaviour management approach.</p> <p>  Let us consider the scenario where the young person is not managing well.  We try to talk it through before a young person gets into a situation where there is a difficulty to ensure the person understands the rules and what is expected.  We talk of an individual crisis management plan.  In that way we are ahead of the posse in respect of being able to work through the possible challenges with the young person.  That is not always possible, but it is the focus.</p> <p>  We say 80% of the MAPA approach is around de-escalation.  We talks about looking at triggers, managing the environment and using minimum force and maximum care.  We consider who the triggers might be.  It might be me and I may need to move away and let someone else deal with the situation.  In that sense 80% of MAPA is around that engagement.  The remaining 20% of MAPA is around physical intervention.</p> <p>  Reference was made to how a staff member can be trained and can put his hand in a particular place and do this and that and so on.  Then, more often than not, some errors arise and the young person is not going to stand in a particular position.  That means it will not happen the way it should.  It is like any training.  We set out what we normally want people to do and we advise people to stick to that as best they can.  However, situations will arise when people will deviate from that, but they need to bring it back.  One relevant example is the question of moving young people when we restrain them.  The MAPA approach and all physical interventions talk about not moving people from such a situation.  Young people should not be picked up because of the physical impairment that may result.  Let us suppose someone deals with a situation, picks up a young person and carries him from A to B.  Then, there is a question of that staff member creating a level of risk.  The restraint applied in that case may not be exactly how MAPA is expected.  The staff member is safe in doing that and has not gone beyond some of the key principles that exist for any physical intervention.</p> <p>  Previously, there was a therapeutic crisis.  Reference was made to the Crisis Prevention Institute and the range available.  They all hold the same principles, that is to say, engage, provide options, use the relationship and risk-assess.  If a staff member is going to physically intervene, then he should ensure that it is safe to do so, that the right people accompany him and that they are working together.  The idea is that there is no broad scenario in which a person is caught up as a consequence of which people get hurt.</p></speech>

Two staff work continually with staff around MAPA and behaviour management.  Our review of behaviour management is ongoing and many of these factors are considered.  We hope to have a more comprehensive approach in 2018.  The principles are in place.  The key point is to ensure people do not get hurt.</p> <p>  Some specific points were raised on medication and major non-compliance.  The inspectors found keys in the medical safe.  That amounted to major non-compliance because of the potential risk.  The assurance was given that we would be checking regularly.  Staff would go to the safe and take out medication and they were not putting the key away.</p></speech>

Back in March not every hour of the day was covered.  There was a period when care staff were dispensing medication.  We found keys in the safe.  That was one issue.</p> <p>  Another issue involved a young person who was allergic to bee stings.  Some of the staff did not feel competent to use the EpiPen so they were trained up.  That was the second major non-compliance highlighted from a medical perspective.  I am confident that our nursing staff are rigorous in respect of prescribed medication and record management.  I have no concern on that point.  It was a question of the practice of the medicine cabinet and the training around the EpiPen.  They were the two key issues or specifics.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the delay.  We have challenges whereby a young person could be acting out and causing a challenge for themselves.  There may be a requirement for that person to go to hospital at midnight.  The question was how to balance the safety when taking the young person off campus and ensuring that he has access to treatment.  It has been clearly put out that if a person needs treatment, then the person needs to have access to treatment, but we can also bring treatment on-site, whether through Caredoc or the emergency medical services.  If someone requires treatment out-of-hours, the director or deputy director will be contacted to ensure the young person has access to the medical services required.</p> <p>  The concern previously was that people were making judgments.  Some may have decided to wait until the morning and go to hospital at that stage.  The difficulty with the arising unknown is an issue.  We have put in place measures to ensure that if someone needs medical attention, he or she will get it.  Access to that medical attention may take several forms depending on the issues, for example, when it involves a bang.  I was involved in a scenario when a person thought he had broken his arm.  He was willing and happy to go but we put more staff on to ensure that when the person went off campus the behaviour could be managed.</p></speech>

In many institutional settings the pressures of the job can be a factor in people not adhering to guidelines or the rules in place.  It applies in particular in this setting.  It is a very difficult job.  Sometimes staff might find themselves in an impossible situation.  Is counselling available for staff?  Are supports available?  Is there somewhere they can go to highlight difficulties or discuss how the guidelines are not working?  How can we assist in making things more workable?</p></speech>

We now have an organisational psychologist on site who provides direct support to staff.  She has developed infrastructural support mechanisms for staff.  I made reference in my statement to the critical incident management system, which is a peer-support structure.  A total of 23 staff were trained up on CISM.  They provide ongoing peer support to staff during times of crisis.  The programme has been put in for an award and is the first of its kind.  The benefits have been noticed.</p> <p>  We use the employee assistance programme for supports.  There may be issues for staff that are external to the campus, but they come to the fore within the campus because of the job.  Our on-site organisational psychologist will provide direct support for staff.  She meets them and uses signposts from different directions.  We try to use peer support and undertake debriefings.  We have put in place a range of measures.  After incidents, we look at debriefing staff to elicit the learning outcomes and how things can be better.  A comprehensive programme has been undertaken in the past ten or 12 months around any incident that has occurred.</p><p>That is where staff would have some input.  We have also been trying to develop a system of one manager for one staff team so that if a team works well together it will share, pull together and address issues together.  This is how this matter is best addressed.  This has been a key focus for us and over the past few months it has very much helped us to deal with some of the challenges we have faced as a staff team.  We continue to engage with staff on an ongoing basis and there is now quite a positive and open relationship between staff, staff representatives and ourselves when it comes to solving problems and moving things forward.</p></speech>

First of all, we absolutely recognise that young people are the priority.  We have to support staff, however, in order to make an environment safe and in order to operate to best practice.  There is a very clear commitment on our part to ensure that the priority is on young people but that a range of steps, measures and supports are necessary to make this a reality.  In creating an environment that allows for best practice we have to focus on what we can deliver and not just what we aspire towards.</p></speech>

I will not go back over questions that have already been asked; my own questions are mainly for Professor Kilkelly.  How often does the review group meet?  How many people are on it?

Okay.  Deputy Chambers has raised this, but I would also like to ask more about the morale of the staff.  How many of the staff are agency workers and how many are core staff based in the building?  Are there always nurses on duty on the campus, seven days a week and 24 hours a day?  Both the witnesses themselves and HIQA have stated that one of the key findings in the report is the care of the children that present to the facility.  This is complex, be it from the point of view of mental health or education.  Are there any girls currently on the campus?  Have there been any girls since the witnesses last addressed this committee?  The witnesses talk about remand as opposed to detention.  Something that struck me when I visited Oberstown was that the mixture between children on remand and children in detention was very unsettling when some were leaving.  Has the unit now been set up differently?  Could the witnesses explain how this has worked in a positive sense?  It was very unsettling that children were coming and going all the time.</p> <p>  The issue of GP cover has been raised.  Is this a matter of the GP coming in on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning for half an hour, for example, or is there broader access to a GP on campus?  I would also like to know what psychological supports are available on campus.  In the case where a child presents who poses a risk to his own life then the social care worker, even with the best will in the world, is not a trained psychologist nor is anyone on the management team.  I would like to know what level of training is available to support such a child.  </p> <p>  Something that worried me in the follow-up to the HIQA report, both in commentary on RT&Eacute; and with regard to the interview, was the fact that it was reported that a child was held for up to nine days in single separation without access to air.  I look forward to hearing the witnesses' commentary on this and I need to understand this because that, to me, is not humane.  We talk about separation and the like, but what came out in the report was that separation did not seem to be the last resort, though I would like to think that it is.  I can understand why separation takes place because of the need for adjusting and this is something that the witnesses have explained very well.  I am particularly focusing here, then, on one particular aspect of the report.  </p></speech>

In March of this year the Minister set up the review implementation group, which I chair and which includes representation from the Oberstown management, staff and board; from the trade union; from the Department; and also an external specialist on child development.  We have met nine times to date.  The task of this group is really to bring together the recommendations of all of the reviews that have been undertaken on the campus over the past year.  We are doing this with a view to carrying out out a number of things - to record and track the implementation of all of those recommendations, which is very significant; but prior to that to also analyse, synthesise and make sense of what all of this is telling us.  We have created a framework of five headings and 14 themes, and this framework was included in the summary of the review document that we published in August.  We are currently continuing that work and we are on track to complete it by the end of the year when a report will be made to the Minister.  This work will achieve two things.  First, it will allow us in the future to look back and identify what happened to the recommendations of all of those reports; and second, and as part of that, it will allow us to see what progress was made and what was the record of implementation.  It has, then, a double purpose.  This is a very important collaborative process that draws in many different perspectives from the people around the table.  It also fits in with the ongoing work of the board, including our planning and our constant examination of the extent to which all of these issues converge around the HIQA recommendations.  We do not see all of these as separate, disjointed processes but rather we are looking to bring all of this together into a single body of work.  By the end of our work we will produce a full action plan around the recommendations and this will of course be publicly available.  All of the recommendations have already been published in one form or other and we communicated those at our external engagement group and our stakeholder engagement session in May of this year.  Subsequently, of course, further analysis has been undertaken and all of that will be published by the end of the year.</p> <p>  I will let the director deal with the more operational matters but I am happy to come back in then to fill in any gaps or address any issues further.</p></speech>

This means that young people on remand are accommodated in units 1 and 2, which are in the old buildings in Trinity House, while committal children are maintained in the other part of the campus.  We have more or less separated them.  From time to time we may mix in individual circumstances because children might know each other or because there are historical factors but in the main the children are separated.  With regard to the GP service, we have one GP who comes on site on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.  That GP does some routine work and also looks at admissions and discharges, thus providing a medical service to any child on the campus at that stage.  The GP may link in with other GPs to look for or to pass on information.  They also work with the nurses on this.  Our nurses are not available 24 hours a day.  We have looked to develop access to a medical service on campus from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m., seven days a week.  If medical services are required in the meantime, we fall back on D-Doc, seek access to hospital services or whatever may be required.  It would not be appropriate for us to have nursing on site 24 hours a day: this would just not be practicable.  We originally looked and had posts for four nurses.  There are significant challenges, however, in getting four nurses so we currently have three full-time nurses along with a social care worker who can dispense medication, has advanced first aid training and is also involved with further medical bits and pieces.  This is so as to ensure that we have a robust service in place.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked for clarification over the morale of staff and I hope that morale is a lot better now than it was this time last year.</p><p>I am starting a round of town hall meetings with staff to get some feedback and to communicate.  Generally, my sense is that morale has improved.  There is still a long way to go but we are going in the right direction.  The engagement between staff, the young people and the management has improved substantially.  That is my general sense and hopefully I will not be corrected on that.</p><p> On the psychological services, I shall give the committee a sense of the services.  Today is Wednesday and this morning the full assessment consultation therapy service, ACTS, meeting started at 9.30 a.m. to review cases for all children on the campus.  At that meeting there is the ACTS team, the psychiatric services through Professor Harry Kennedy, our care staff and one of my deputy directors.  We review cases with regard to new admissions, who has arrived and what is the plan.  Assessments are then undertaken.  Professor Harry Kennedy's ACTS team will go on site to the units and engage directly with the young people.  If there is particular piece of work or advice they can give to care staff to continue some of the sessions outside the clinical sessions this is part and parcel of the approach.</p><p> Single separation is not acceptable.  Terminology, structure and sentences are important.  I do not know the case that HIQA referenced.  I do not know if it related to other cases that have been referenced in other forums that relate to last September.  The issue of single separation may be about someone in their bedroom.  The issue of no light may mean being out in the yard or being taken out of the unit.  The scenarios that would arise may have to do with fear and around removing someone; they may be a threat to staff or they may not be engaging.  The ongoing conversation that staff have with a young person may not have got the young person to the point where they can do A, B or C to return and the young person may not be willing to meet certain expectations.  This could be for a number of different reasons.  A young person may still have drugs on them and we cannot get the drugs off them.  They can hide drugs in many different places and they can continue to take drugs.  Until we are assured that there is some level of engagement, the scenario is that this young person would be maintained in a particular environment until it is safe to move them.  </p><p> This is probably one of our biggest challenges around risk.  It is one thing to engage with a young person who is reasonable and who can hear what we are saying.  If, however, we have a young person who is on a substance - and we do not know what it is - then it can be very difficult to get them to co-operate and engage.  If they were out of their bedroom, out in the corridor or the yard, and they refused to engage we would then have a situation where we may have to restrain them.  If we restrain a person who is on drugs we then have an issue over whether we could actually contribute to other physical concerns.  It is a judgment.  We have put in place a measure where there is a check undertaken every day for which lads are on single separation.  This is done by the deputy director and it looks at who is in single separation, what is the plan, how long have they been out, what is the next step.  It is now a daily audit rather than at the end of the week or the month.  We get the figures on that basis and this is how we manage and measure to ensure young people are not maintained in single separation for long periods of time.  We also look at alternative approaches.  Is there somebody else who can engage with that young person?  Is there a solicitor or family coming to visit and what can we do to actually move the goalposts?</p><p> We have a girl with us until tomorrow.  Girls come every so often for a week or two while they are remanded by the courts.  We have not had any girl on committal for a long time.  They are usually on remand for a week or two.  We get notice of two hours to let us know a court has decided that this young person who is a girl is to be remanded.  Girls have a unit on their own.  Our most recent girl was in the school with the lads and attending one of the classes with two or three boys.  The teachers managed that and it was appropriate.  That is the nature of the service we provide.  In one sense it is positive that we do not have lots of girls there but the law says that if a young girl is remanded we must take her and mind her appropriately.  I am aware of concerns expressed previously about this but I am very focused that the CEHOP framework - care, education, health, offending behaviour and preparing for release -  looks at individual young people's needs whether it is a boy or a girl and whether it is a vulnerable young person or not.  The plan we have in place has to be around that particular young person rather than the gender issue.  I would look at the needs of the girl who is coming in.  The campus has had some complicated situations with young people of various genders and the plan has to be based around their needs rather than a gender issue.</p></speech>

I feel a bit shell-shocked.  I find it alarming that when we talk of a child who was separated for nine days and who did not get fresh air, Mr. Bergin can say that he did not know of that case.  When HIQA produced the report this should have been one of the first things addressed by the directors.  People in charge should have found out the background to the case.  The HIQA report stated that in four out of six days of a child's period in single isolation there is no evidence of authorised reviews.  I find this quite alarming.  Who is reviewing these children? Who reviewed that child who was in there for nine days? What has Mr. Bergin done to rectify this?  Oberstown's own policy on separation states that it should only be used for as short a time as is necessary.  Will Mr. Bergin define what is a short time, what is the process, when is it used and for how long?</p> <p>  The HIQA report referred to cultural needs.  This point was raised by the staff.  Inspectors had viewed some of the files of children who were from minority groups and while the ethnic origin of the young people was recorded, staff felt that their cultural needs were not being addressed.  What has been done to rectify this?  It is important.</p> <p>  I do not want to dwell on the matter, but I wish to return to the issue of restraints and handcuffs.  I am upset that in his opening remarks Mr. Bergin said that as the young people arrive in these restraints then it is okay because they are used to it.  This did not sit right with me.  When are handcuffs used?  Are they used when these young people are going out to school?  Are they used when a person goes off on one in their cell?  Can Mr. Bergin please be more specific so I and my colleagues can feel a bit better about it?  I would appreciate it if he could go into it in a bit more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Bergin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017110800002#S00400"><p>I will start with the handcuff issue.  They are not used on the campus.  The children are not handcuffed when going to school.  There is free movement around the campus as the young people move around with staff, so there are no handcuffs.  I believe that in the last 12 months there have been four occasions when handcuffs have been approved for use by a deputy director or myself with regard to the movement of a young person.  This was because of the level of risk they posed.  I shall give an example rather than a specific incident.  If a staff member is moving a young person from one side of the campus to the other and there is a concern that he or she is going to act out, then we have an agreement with them.  My concern is that if a person is acting out we cannot really put handcuffs on them.  The capacity to put handcuffs on a person while they are acting out does not sit well with me.</p> <p>  I did not mean to come across as disingenuous with the comment around children arriving to the campus in handcuffs.  The point I was trying to allude to was that once they arrive, the majority of the young people are in handcuffs, the handcuffs are removed from them and they do not use handcuffs again.  The challenge arises when we do need to use handcuffs when we take the young person off campus.  Previously, all young people who went off campus had handcuffs.  We have changed that practice based on the assessment of risk.  If a young person is out on permitted absence - going out for the day with family and so on - and if he is due in court two weeks later I do not expect to see that young man going to court in handcuffs.</p><p>However, the challenge is the risks associated with that because if he runs away, I will be asked what I was doing to prevent him from running away.  Handcuffs are rarely used on campus and only in exceptional circumstances. </p><p> There is a significant challenge on the campus regarding records.  This is a historical issue and when I say we are nearly there, I mean there have been different practices around recording as people did not record or see the need to do so.  We try to explain to people that the more they record, the better, because records provide us with insight, information and accountability.  Record keeping is improving substantially. </p><p> On single separation, every morning one of my deputy directors visits each of the units and asks which young persons are in single separation, why they are there and what is being done.  They then check the position and records are also checked.  Rather than leaving this to managers in units and members of the staff team, we have brought this up a level.  We have decided to change practice and improve awareness of what is being done.  We challenge staff by asking why Tommy is still in his room and has not been moved on and what is the story with him.  This is challenging for everybody because if Tommy is moved on and something goes wrong an hour later, we will have moved him too soon and before he was ready to be independent or make decisions.  These are the risks and challenges we face daily.  Everybody is different and the important issue for me is that we look at the individual rather than a routine piece. </p><p> The issue of cultural needs was raised.  The number of young people on campus who come from a Traveller background is significant.  Many of the young people who come in do not want to be identified as being from a Traveller background.  When they get to the point of mobility and going off campus they are involved in projects outside the campus that are focused on their background.  There is a challenge around bringing people into the campus and how one designs particular programmes.  What we do in this regard is around placement planning.  Any professional and any link that is known to the young person in question becomes part of his planning process.  The young persons attends meetings to find out what they can do and deliver and, where he or she is moving home or into the community, what is the contact.  The work of Youth Advocate Programmes Ireland, YAP, and Le Ch&eacute;ile involves identifying and matching particular supports in the community with young people on the campus.  This considers ethnic background and links.  We want to try to maintain this.  We have looked at what mentors are best suited for families and children.  This is an ongoing piece of development.</p></speech>

If a young person is separated from his peer group all day, that is determined to be a period of ten hours.  The young person is on his own at night and starts again the following day.  We have changed this so that the young person will not automatically go into single separation the following day.  If he or she did not manage well the previous day and had a good night's sleep, it will not automatically mean he or she will be placed in single separation the following day.  We have been breaking this down and reducing it.  One could have a young person in single separation for eight or nine days.  That has been the history and we are trying to change that by asking how we can get the young person to go out to the yard to exercise and to do so safely.</p> <p>  To put this in context, some young people will not want to mix with Tommy because he is not managing well.  One is then in a scenario where Tommy, who is not managing well, needs to mix with the rest of the group.  This has been a challenge.  It has also been an interesting challenge for some young people who are managing well and decide they do not want to be tied up with a particular person.  That is our problem and one we must overcome. </p></speech>

We are starting the process of recruiting more care staff on the basis of our staff turnover, as people age or move on.  For every residential unit we will open, we will have the relevant number of staff.  We currently have a licence which means the numbers are capped at 48 boys and six girls.  We have not yet reached that cap and when we do I can refuse.  However, I want to be prepared for the possibility of an expansion.  We hope to start another recruitment campaign before Christmas or in early January.</p> <p>  We are also in a promotional process for staff whereby we will create a team leader post to allow staff to have a level of engagement in decision making.  We hope this will change the dynamics for staff in terms of how they contribute, do business and support managers.  It will give them the possibility of acquiring more experience.  We hope to roll this out in early January. </p></speech>

We are finally reaching the issues that really matter in Oberstown.  We have clearly had a very difficult couple of years.  This has been part of the change process and the amalgamation of the schools as well as the very tedious but also very important operational development.</p> <p>  Single separation has been on the board's agenda since I joined.  Over the years, we have had no data, poor data and data that nobody could make sense of or understand.  We are finally at the point where we can understand what is going on.  We finally have proper, effective and timely visibility of the data and what is happening to young people in the context of single separation in particular.  This has been greatly aided by two things.  Deputy Lisa Chamber referred to the first of these, namely, the confidence, competence and ability of staff to work within this framework and, aided by a new revised policy on single separation, separating out the procedure from the policy.  It is now very clear what procedure needs to be followed.  As the director stated, earlier this year, a new enhanced approval mechanism was introduced which interrogates and questions the use of separation all the time in a challenging and different way.  Coupled with this, an information technology system has been introduced which makes recording absolutely essential because it will send alerts and times.  These electronic methods of recording will not only give us better data but will also give us much better visibility and governance around what is, for everybody, an unacceptable practice that cannot and should not ever be used outside of our policies and procedures. </p> <p>  That is where the priority is in bringing visibility to the issue and driving down the numbers in the safest and most effective way possible in line with the rights and interests of young people.  What we do not want to see are other practices compensating for one that is now being accepted as restrictive.  The board's position earlier this year was to make very clear that it considers these three different types of intervention serious and last resort interventions and wants to see and track a fall in the number of times they are used.  This is to make clear to management, staff and everybody that this is our position, lest it is not clear.  However, we have to work within the framework. </p> <p>  If I may, I will make one further point on communication, which has been an Achilles heel or weak point within the campus and externally.  It is an issue we have invested in and worked hard on for the past year.  We have a new communications and engagement plan that is about better communication with staff as part of the whole process of building morale and providing the support staff need.</p><p>Part of the new strategy involves documenting the participation of young people in decisions about them.  It involves raising the profile of that issue, communicating externally and engaging with people in order to be accountable for what we do.  That is just to put the matter in a broader context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017110800002#U00200"><p>I was hoping that the witnesses would come before us today with a very clear, metric-driven response to each of the points which were raised in the HIQA report.  These points are addressed in quite general terms in the witnesses' statement, but I was hoping that we would be able to go through the six standards with which there was moderate non-compliance, for instance, and that the witnesses would lay out a very clear timeline as to what actions were being taken to address that non-compliance and when they would be completed.  I would also like the witnesses to address the two standards with which there was major non-compliance.  I am hopeful that the witnesses can come back to us with a very clear, definitive action plan as to when those actions will be completed.</p> <p>  I will start with something which is a little bit outside of what has gone before.  There was a major incident on the campus in August 2016.  There was a fire.  The dates of the announced inspections in the HIQA report range from 27 March to 30 March.  In that report it is stated that there was moderate non-compliance in respect of standard 9 - premises, safety and security.  For instance, "Staff were found to have inconsistent responses with regard to the procedure to be followed in the event of a fire."  The report identifies that doors were of varying sizes and, in respect of national standards, "Appropriate annual inspection and testing certificates were not available to demonstrate that the emergency lighting system was in compliance with the appropriate standard."  Notwithstanding the positivity of what the witnesses have presented to the committee regarding deconstruction of some of the cultural, staff and managerial practices and the fact that they are engaged in a process to try to rectify many of these issues, by any fair analysis there is a long way to go if there was a fire in August 2016 and in March 2017, a good number of months later, HIQA was still identifying deficiencies in respect of something as simple as fire safety.  That is the first point the witnesses might address.</p> <p>  The second point relates to the recent High Court judgment against Oberstown in which the judge clearly stated that there was a limited breach - and I emphasise the word "limited" - of constitutional rights in respect of deprivation of physical exercise; loss of contact with families; lack of procedural safeguards relating to the imposition of separate and associated deprivations, particularly the formal written recording of decisions; and regarding imposition of the separation regime.  As I understand it, and I would like the witnesses' perspective, this case was taken by four people.  It related to a specific incident or incidents which took place in August 2016.  Is Oberstown Children Detention Campus still breaching the constitutional rights of citizens - children and young adults - in respect of separation and associated deprivations, particularly in respect of the formal written recording of decisions?  Is it still breaching these rights or has it rectified the matter in the intervening period?  I am not a lawyer, but the HIQA report of March 2017 would clearly suggest that there was major non-compliance in respect of standard 2 and that "Some children spent long periods of time in single separation and the reasons for this were not always clearly recorded."  I suggest that, notwithstanding the positivity in the witnesses' embracing of cultural and managerial change in a real and meaningful way, the witnesses still have not dealt with these issues satisfactorily.  These are simple issues which can be dealt with without expenditure of major resources and within a short timeframe.  When will the witnesses satisfy the committee, the Minister, and the users and staff of this service that this will be rectified?</p></speech>

Obviously, as the Deputy has said, the case arose out of events subsequent to the fire and the other incident on campus in 2017.  In the judgment handed down by Ms Justice N&iacute; Raifeartaigh on Monday we saw a very careful consideration of all the circumstances which arose in the case taken by four young people.  It is very important for the record that there is that kind of accountability and that these people were able to access and take those proceedings.  That is very significant.  This is clearly one measure of accountability.  It will take us some time to go through the judgment and assess its implications as it is nearly 100 pages long.  Certainly, our preliminary reading of the judgment, which has been limited as we have been dealing with other matters in recent days, suggests that the learning contained within it coheres with the HIQA report.  The concerns are primarily that the usage of separation is, to a limited degree as the Deputy pointed out, a breach of rights in the very specific context of the judgment.  The issue of recording is also important in the judgment and is repeatedly mentioned in the HIQA report.  We have already addressed this to some extent in changing the practice around recording, we now record as much of the substantive issue as possible.</p></speech>

That was the essence of the statement which the board made in the last couple of months.  It made that very clear.  We will be going through the implications of the judgment in a very detailed way.  I can absolutely guarantee that every lesson to be learnt from it will be learnt.  If additional measures and steps need to be taken when we have considered the judgment in full, they will also be part of our process.  On a preliminary reading, my sense is that the judgment is highlighting issues which we already know about and which contributed to the conclusions of the HIQA report, particularly around recording.  Those conclusions have led to various steps which have been taken over the last six to nine months, on top of others.</p></speech>

That plan exists and has been published.  It is available to everybody.  On the inspection, while the inspection was in March, the report was issued to us in June and we reverted to HIQA with an action plan in July.</p><p>It accepted the action plan and all the works we intended to undertake.  It published the report in August.  In the past four weeks, it sought a follow-up to the action plan and we have provided that.  It wrote back to us on 7 November to seek clarification on one or two documents we had referenced.  That information will be provided to HIQA in the next week or two.  I expect that HIQA will come on site to inspect and monitor.  That is part of the inspection element of the matter.  The action plan will identify what has been completed and what the timelines are.  I suppose this is specific to the points the Deputy is making.  In each case, the action plan will map out what action is being undertaken and when it will be completed, if it has not already been completed.  I will bring that to the Deputy's attention.</p></speech>

I would say that by any operational standard, if five reviews were carried out internally or externally it would set off some kind of signal or alarm to the effect that action needs to be taken in a short timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Bergin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017110800002#V01100"><p>It is important to bear in mind that the five reviews cover specific elements.  They are not all reviews of Oberstown per se; they are reviews of elements of Oberstown.  For example, we had a health and safety review and a behaviour management review.  It is important to stress that the reviews were targeted to enable the experts who know best to advise us on them.  The Deputy also asked about issues relating to doors.  There are doors arriving today.  It has taken us a long time to get doors that meet the appropriate fire standards, etc.  It has been complicated because of the nature of the campus.  We need to make sure our doors are fire-compliant and fit for security purposes.  These are ongoing issues.  While it might seem simple to get a door for a room, it is not quite as simple when consideration is given to the complexities that are part and parcel of what we are doing.  Progress is being made with all of these matters.  Some of them have been closed off.  Some of them are still in motion.  My job is to make sure the facility is safe, its standards are high and everybody, including myself, is held to account in the context of what we are supposed to be doing.</p></speech>

Is the management structure flat or hierarchical?  Are there any comparable management structures in the public sector?  Does it mirror the structure in the Prison Service, the Civil Service or the public service?  Is it the case that there is a director and a deputy director with a management team underneath them?</p></speech>

I have four deputy directors - one on the residential side, one for care, one for risk and safety and one for general operations.  I have a human resources manager who looks after recruitment and a logistics manager who looks after day-to-day administration.</p></speech>

They usually leave for reasons of early retirement.  Some staff decide to finish up on the basis of age.  Some staff are now leaving to take up other opportunities.  The turnover would be low.</p></speech>

Each group has a manager who, in turn, has his or her own manager at deputy director level.  The capacity for people to raise issues within that structure is key.  Otherwise, I will have 265 staff ringing me and I cannot manage that.  However, I operate on the basis of an open door principle.  This applies to young people and staff.  If someone wants to speak to me, he or she can do so.</p></speech>

In addition, five people are appointed to the board through the Public Appointments Service process.  This is done with particular reference to expertise in governance, finance, risk and human resources matters.  There is a focus on young people as part of that.  While it is an unusual body, in some respects, it provides an interesting and diverse range of perspectives on issues.  Robust discussions take place within the board and when management personnel are being held to account on various issues.  During the great deal of work that has been done to date, it has been found that this structure is working really well.  At this point, it is enabling us to focus on the matters that are at the heart of what we are doing.  Our governance structure has made very good progress in that respect.  It is paying dividends.  Even though our board might be unusual in its composition, its diverse perspectives and voices are important because they facilitate communication with staff, the neighbouring community, the relevant Departments and other stakeholders.  I think that is an important point.</p></speech>

Does Oberstown have the funding it needs to get the building to a standard that means it is functional and workable for management, staff and children?  We have heard that the doors are now coming, over a year after the date on which they should have arrived.  What kind of progress is being made by those in charge of Oberstown as they contend with the challenges associated with the building that was left to them?</p></speech>

I do not believe that Renua falls into either of those categories.  Unless it is an issue I will move on.  I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  I want to note that the committee on the Future of Mental Health Care is meeting today, which is not satisfactory because this committee is a short-term committee and a clash between those is not ideal.  I note that two members, Deputy Browne and Deputy Rabbitte, will have to attend.  Hopefully, they can return when it is over but that is completely understood.  The clerk will speak to the powers that be about that not happening in future, especially with a committee that tends to change its meeting times.  They should avoid this time of the week.  </p> <p>  There is a letter from Dr. McCaffrey and from Both Lives Matter.  They will be published on our website.  </p> <p>  On the issue of witnesses generally, I want to reiterate the position of the committee.  I have said this a number of times but I wish to do so again today.  We agreed last July to hear from experts.  In that regard we decided to look at the availability of witnesses who attended the Citizens' Assembly and also that members would suggest individual experts or groups that they wish to hear from here.  I have asked that we hear all opinion and I have written to members asking for suggestions so as to strike a balance.  In the past week I have asked the clerk to make formal approaches to groups but the response has been along the lines of that contained in Dr. McCaffrey's letter and from the letter from Both Lives Matter.  Their response is that it is not worthwhile for those who advocate retention of the eighth amendment to come before the committee given the decision of the committee not to retain Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution in full.  Also, sorry I am not-----</p></speech>

That decision has not been made.  We need to be very clear about the fact that the only decision that this committee has made is that Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution will not be retained in full.  I do not accept that argument.  For the purpose of our deliberations it is a pity that we have not heard legal and medical argument that would be different to what we have heard to date.  That said, members have learned a huge amount from our interaction with witnesses and we will continue to do our work with a view to reporting to the Oireachtas by 20 December.  The opportunity is still there to suggest particular witnesses to come before us but there is a struggle in getting certain sides of the argument to attend.  That is regrettable.</p></speech>

We appear to lack a procedure to allow an intervention at a relevant point because I merely sought and wish to know and request that the Chairman would read the letters into the record, the letters from Dr. McCaffrey and the letter from Both Lives Matter.  I think it is as relevant to the work of this committee that people who were invited give their particular reason.  The Chairman has given her own personal opinion as to whether a vote to recommend that the eighth amendment not be retained in full constitutes a decision in the matter and only by the most tortured twist of logic could one say that it is not a clear expression of intent from the committee.  Given that is the Chairman's particular point, I think it is appropriate that she would read into the record, as she did with other letters from invited guests in the past, the explanations from Dr McCaffrey and Both Lives Matter.</p></speech>

This exact procedure was adopted in the case of Professor Patricia Casey.  Deputy McGrath wished for her letter to be read into the record.  I did not read it into the record because she did not attend here.</p><p>We could be reading letters into the record for expects for hours here in the committee but really they were invited to attend and should attend and I think that it proves that they should be here.</p></speech>

It is interesting that people outside of the jurisdiction have noted this very irregular approach taken by the committee.  It forms the basis for their refusal to come before the committee.  On that basis I believe it is in the public interest, and in the interests of the credibility of this committee, that the invited guests, and as I understand it they were invited very belatedly, be given the courtesy of putting their explanation on to the record as opposed to just saying, as the Chairman did, that they should come before the committee.</p></speech>

I understand Senator Mullen did propose this witness originally.  There was no backing documentation as to why the travel was required, which necessitated a delay in that witness being invited to the committee.  We have been making efforts for a number of weeks to assess if we could find a time that would suit him.  Only last night we heard that he did not want to come at all.  It is not as straightforward as the Senator has laid out.</p></speech>

I would submit that the explanation that the Chairman has just given is disingenuous.  The Chairman is now saying that when a name was suggested originally, that the Chairman did not take it on.  I have always stated at this committee that it is the Chairman's response, and the secretariat behind the Chairman, to propose a list that would test the issues fully.  I have always made that very clear.  The fact is that the Chairman did not do the necessary investigation and then after the event, after a decision has been made by the committee, an invitation was issued by the Chairman.  I would say that it is at the minimum a courtesy and I would argue more than that.  It is a matter of fair procedures that the Chairman would put the response on the record.  The Chairman's response just now was disingenuous.</p> <p>  With regard to the second organisation I referred to, the Chairman had already declined to bring it before the committee, as I understand it from correspondence with it.  Then the Chairman and the secretariat appear to have changed their minds.  It seems to me that different reasons are being offered for different courses of-----</p></speech>

Our job is to assess the recommendations of the Citizens' to double-check and test it as far as we can and to eventually prepare the situation whereby a referendum or referenda will be put to the people on the basis of which the people will be able to vote in the clear knowledge of what they are voting for.  I have done my best to raise questions and I have done interviews on this question as well, and I strongly believe that it is our job to test and verify and to try to ascertain where the opinions have come from in so far as we can.  I cannot do that unless witnesses present themselves before the committee.</p> <p>  I fully support the points made by Senator Mullen.  Please bring the witnesses in before the committee and we can ask questions.  Everyone is entitled to have their view heard.  It does not matter what votes are taken in this committee.  Ultimately, this is the people's decision.  It is not true to suggest, at all, that this is a foregone conclusion.  It is far from that.  What I strongly urge is this.  I want to hear logical submissions from witnesses who have different points of view.  I am not in favour of abortion but as I said before, I believe that we need to assess this situation in the light of various submissions that have been made.  Let us hear all the submissions.  To my mind it is a very serious flaw in what is happening if people do not come before the committee even though they have a strong view.  Let us hear that view and the detail behind it.</p></speech>

I too believe that Professor McCaffrey's letter should be read into the record.  I ask this in regard to Professor Casey as well and also Both Lives Matter.  I am proposing that they be read into the record.  I want to make that proposal to the committee here today.  I also take issue with the Chairman saying that it is a pity that we cannot get witnesses.  We have to ask ourselves why.  I have said the same privately and publically.  The secretariat should have secured the attendance of the witnesses.  We should not have been involved  or asked to get any witnesses, any of us in this room.  It is not up to us to get witnesses because we might be tainted one way or the other and everyone knows that.</p></speech>

I am making my point that I believe that it was the secretariat, with the Chairman, who should have secured the attendance of the witnesses.  We are in a situation now that the Chairman has described as a pity.  Why should we be surprised?  We took a premature vote here and we did change the intent.  I agree with Deputy Durkan.  It will be the electorate that will make the final decision on this and it will not matter what will happen in committee.  I describe it like a jury half way through a trial and the jury foreman approaches the chair and says we are going to give our opinion now,  we have found him guilty or not guilty half way through the evidence.  That is where we are.  That is why we have not got witnesses attending.  I believe that a person of that eminence that we have decided to invite should have his letter read into the record.  I am proposing that.</p></speech>

I want to make a point of order.  The Chairman said at the beginning that we have two letters from people who have declined to appear as witnesses having been invited and that those letters will be published and available on the website.  I believe that is sufficient instead of the Chairman being obliged to read a four and a half page reply into the record of this committee.  The Chairman has stated, and I fully endorse her announcement, that these letters are available for anybody anywhere in the world to read on the website.  We do not have to read every letter into the record of this committee.</p></speech>

Pulling out of giving statements at this committee is part of that wider strategy to undermine the work that has been happening and to undermine the Chairman.  Everyone was asked to submit recommended witnesses and if it was broken up proportionally, the people that are saying that it is biased submitted a certain number speakers.  If that was divvied up around the room everyone got the same amount of speakers.  It is a clear strategy every week and we are giving them time to rehearse it, which is eating into the time for the people who are here who are willing to give their time.  I will  be critical of the people who pulled out because there are people who agree with them who depended and wanted them here to hear their evidence.  They are failing to provide that side of the argument.  If they do not want to be here they should not be read into the record.</p></speech>

We will be holding three separate sessions this afternoon.  The first session will address international legal rights and services.  Our second session will consider a view of medical law and our third session will look at risks to mental health.  Before I introduce our first witnesses, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors in the Public Gallery are requested to turn off their telephones completely or put them in airplane mode.  That really is an issue.  The week before last there was an awful lot of interference, even on the RT&Eacute; coverage.  It is really important that mobile telephones are off, because it causes a lot of interference both for the staff working here and for the television studios.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the witnesses, Dr. Gilda Sedgh, principal research scientist with the Guttmacher Institute, Ms Leah Hocter, regional director for Europe, Center for Reproductive Rights, and Ms Katrine Thomasen, senior legal advisor for Europe, Center for Reproductive Rights.  You are all very welcome to this afternoon's meeting.  </p><p>Unfortunately, before we commence formal proceedings, I must advise witnesses on the matter of privilege.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now call on Dr. Sedgh to make her presentation.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here.  By way of introduction, and to add to the introduction the Chairman provided, I am a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute in New York.  We are a research and policy organisation and we conduct population-level research on reproductive health in the United States and globally.  The Guttmacher Institute advocates for evidence-based policies that promote reproductive and sexual health.  Our evidence is used by stakeholders on various sides of the discourse.  I have been asked to present evidence on abortion trends worldwide and on the characteristics of women who have abortions.</p><p>I will start by giving a global overview of abortion trends, which can provide some context for abortion incidents and trends in Europe.  This evidence was published in <i>The Lancet</i>last year, and it is based on work that we did in collaboration with our colleagues at the World Health Organization.<br/><br/>We estimate that worldwide approximately 56 million abortions took place each year between 2010 to 2014.  The annual number of abortions has increased slightly since the early 1990s.  It can be more useful to talk about how many abortions take place for every 1,000 women of child-bearing age.  This is because the absolute number of abortions can increase as the number of women in a population increases, but the number of abortions for every 1,000 women, also known as the abortion rate, is not influenced by the size of the population.  The 56 million abortions that take place each year translate to about 35 abortions for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.  Another way of saying this is that, roughly speaking, about 3.5% of women of child-bearing age have an abortion each year globally.  The global abortion rate has declined slightly over the past 25 years.<br/><br/>We have also estimated abortion incidence across the 17 major subregions of the world.  We were not able to estimate incidence for every individual country because we did not have enough data on which to base country estimates.  I refer the trends in the abortion rate in major parts of the developed world, that is, Europe and North America.  We can look at northern, western and southern Europe together because the abortion levels and trends in these three sub-regions are similar.  The abortion rate is much lower in North America and in Europe, outside of eastern Europe, than the global average of 35 per 1,000 women.  It is about 17 in North America and 21 in non-eastern Europe, and the rate has declined modestly in both of these regions in the past 25 years or so.<br/><br/>Eastern Europe is a different story.  As members are probably aware, the abortion rate was very high in eastern Europe during the Soviet era.  It declined dramatically in the past 25 years to less than half of what is was in the early 1990s.  The abortion rates in northern, western and southern Europe are the lowest sub-regional abortion rates in the world, and the decline in eastern Europe is by far the sharpest decline that we have seen in the world.<br/><br/>While we were not able to estimate abortion incidence for all countries, we compiled statistics from countries with good reporting systems for the most recent year for which such evidence was available at the time of our compilation.  I refer to the countries where it is recognised that at least 90% of all abortions are included in the official reports.  Across these 18 countries, almost all of which are all in Europe, the abortion rate varies from five per 1,000 in Switzerland to 18 per 1,000 in Sweden.  In eight of these 18 countries, the abortion rate is fewer than ten per 1,000.  Globally, when we grouped countries according to their abortion laws, we found that, on average, the abortion rate in countries where the procedure is prohibited altogether or allowed only to save a woman&rsquo;s life is not significantly different from the rate in countries where abortion is allowed without restriction as to reason.  The vertical lines around the points indicate the margins of error around these estimates and members can see they all overlap.  This is a bird&rsquo;s eye view of abortion rates in these groups of countries and it does not examine the various factors that could influence abortion rates in these countries.<br/><br/>We were also able to estimate the percent of all abortions that were obtained by married women and the percent obtained by unmarried women.  We used data from the United Nations, which defines married women to include women in cohabiting unions.  We estimate that about 73% of all abortions worldwide are obtained by married women, and 27% are obtained by unmarried women.  In the developed world, about 69% of all abortions are obtained by married women.  These are estimates across broad geographic areas, and there are variations across countries within each of these groups of countries.<br/><br/>I showed abortion rates in countries grouped by the legal status of abortion.  Last month we published estimates of the safety of abortions performed worldwide, and in groups of countries classified according to their abortion laws.  These estimates were also made with colleagues from the World Health Organization, and are also published in <i>The Lancet</i>.<br/><br/>As defined by the World Health Organization, safe abortions are those done by a trained provider or a trained person and using methods appropriate to the gestational age of the pregnancy.  Less safe abortions are those for which only one of these criteria is met, and least safe abortions are those for which neither of these two criteria are met.  About 31% of abortions are in the least safe category in countries where abortion is illegal on all grounds or only allowed to save a woman&rsquo;s life or preserve her physical health.  Less than 1% of abortions are in the least safe category in countries where abortion is permitted without restriction as to reason.  We also found that abortions are also more likely to be unsafe in low income countries than in high income countries, based on the World Bank classification of countries.  Countries with restrictive abortion laws tend to be low-income countries, and Ireland is anomalous as a high-income country with a restrictive abortion law, so it is not easy to assess the relationships of economic development and legal status with the safety of abortion.<br/><br/>We did not have enough information with which to estimate the ages of women obtaining abortions across the world&rsquo;s sub-regions.  Instead we compiled statistics from the countries with good quality reporting.  These are countries with liberal abortion laws where at least 90% of abortions are included in the reporting systems.  Across the countries with this information, about half of abortions are obtained by women in their 20s, and another third are obtained by women in their 30s.  Across all these countries, adolescents of 19 years old or younger, predominantly adolescents of 15 to 19 years old, account for a smaller share of abortions than their share of the population - that is, the abortion rate is lower among adolescents than among women in their 20s and 30s.  In almost all these countries, adolescents&rsquo; share of all abortions has decreased since the early 1990s.  In the countries that further break down the ages of women having abortions into smaller windows, the majority of adolescents&rsquo; abortions are obtained by 18 and 19 year olds.<br/><br/>According to the statistics we compiled from 15 countries, 48% to 74% of women who obtained an abortion already had at least one child.  In all but two of these countries, more than half of women obtaining an abortion already had at least one child.<br/><br/>We are currently preparing a report on the gestational ages of pregnancies when they are terminated across countries that have reliable statistics.  I refer to abortions done in the first trimester of pregnancy.  According to these preliminary findings, in all but three of these countries, 90% or more of abortions are obtained in the first trimester.<br/><br/>For four countries we have information from nationally representative surveys of women on the reasons for wanting an abortion, among those who have had an abortion.  Women obtain abortions for a wide variety of reasons.  In these surveys women were asked to give just their primary reason for having an abortion.  For example, in Belgium, about one fourth of women said they sought an abortion for socioeconomic reasons, and another one fourth had an abortion for partner-related reasons - for example, their partner did not want to have a child or their relationship was dissolving.  Approximately 18% wanted to space their children or postpone having a child, and another 13% already had as many children as they wanted or could manage.  Approximately 1% of women in Belgium said that they were having an abortion because of issues related to the health of the foetus.  In the other three countries, less than 1% of all abortions were for reasons related to foetal health.<br/><br/>In a survey in the United States, women who had an abortion were asked to indicate all their reasons for having the abortion.  An interesting take-away message from this survey is that many women gave more than one reason.  Financial issues, wanting to space or delay child-bearing and partner-related issues remained common.  Approximately 30% of women said they sought an abortion because they needed to focus on the children that they already had at home.<br/><br/>I will shift gears and wrap up by giving a broad overview of abortion laws of countries across the world.  Ms Leah Hoctor will go into more detail on this topic.  Of the 199 countries and major territories in the world, 75 allow abortion without restriction as to reason or for socioeconomic reasons; 58 countries and territories allow abortion to preserve a woman&rsquo;s physical or mental health; and 40 allow abortion to save a woman&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Ireland is one of these 40 countries.  In 26 countries, abortion is not allowed for any reason, although some of these make exceptions in cases of rape, incest or foetal anomaly.</p><p> Using the UN's classification of countries according to whether they are developed or developing, 41 of the 50 developed countries allow abortion without restriction as to reason or for socioeconomic reasons, five allow abortion to preserve a woman's physical or mental health, one &ndash; Ireland &ndash; allows abortion to save a woman's life, and three do not allow abortion on any ground.</p><p> I will end by summarising some of the key points from the review.  The sub-regions with the lowest abortion rates are those in which most countries are developed, where abortion is legal on broad grounds and there are strong reproductive health programmes.  Women obtaining abortions represent a broad spectrum of all women - young and old, single and married, childless and with children - and many who seek an abortion have multiple reasons for doing so.</p></speech>

Receiving this request was an honour.  My purpose will be to provide members with an overview of comparative European law on the termination of pregnancy.  To that end, I will describe the grounds and timeframes on which abortion is legal in 46 other European countries.  I hope that this information will assist the important and valuable deliberations that the committee is conducting on behalf of the citizens of Ireland, among whom I am proud to belong, in case my accent has not given it away.</p> <p>  Before I turn to the substance of European laws on abortion, it might be helpful to clarify certain matters regarding the Center for Reproductive Rights as it relates to Ireland.  As time is short, I will also refer members to the centre's website.  The mandate of the Center for Reproductive Rights is well known.  We work across the world, specifically in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US, to advance the legal protection of women's reproductive health and rights.  This means that the centre uses law to advance women's access to reproductive health care, including affordable contraception and family planning, safe and legal abortions and quality maternal health care.  We also work to prevent child marriage and forced sterilisation.</p> <p>  As many committee members will know, the centre's work in Ireland has focused on representing Ms Amanda Mellet and Ms Siobh&aacute;n Whelan in their complaints to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, OHCHR, and in all advocacy, governmental, media and political engagement related to those cases and the OHCHR's decisions on same.  Both decisions held that Ireland was obliged under international treaties to provide effective remedies to Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan.  The decisions specify that these remedies must entail compensation, psychological support services and reform of Irish abortion law in order to prevent similar violations in the future.</p> <p>  As the representative of Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan, the centre must call and advocate for Ireland's compliance with the OHCHR's decisions and the Government's provision of the specified remedies.  All advocacy, political or governmental engagement by the centre in Ireland has been undertaken in the context of these two cases.  The centre's general fundraising for its work in Europe includes Ireland in terms of support for its work on the OHCHR cases and its advocacy to ensure the required law reforms.  The centre is not providing any funding to Irish organisations for campaigning or political activities.  In addition to our work representing Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan, the centre has contributed modest amounts to the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, to support expert events for lawyers and medical practitioners regarding international human rights law and World Health Organization, WHO, guidelines on safe and legal abortion, as well as events to provide women and men a diversity of views and an opportunity to engage in non-directive discussions about abortion.</p> <p>  Turning to the substance of my presentation, my goal will be to provide members with a quick overview of the laws on abortion in 46 other European countries.  In particular, I will aim to outline the standard approach among most European countries to the legality of abortion.  To assist with this, I will take us through eight slides.  To supplement that information, we have provided a large chart to all members - there are hard copies in the room - illustrating the grounds and some of the timeframes on which abortion is legal in each of the 46.  All this information is taken from primary legal sources, which can be independently verified.  We have also submitted a booklet to members, containing copies of many or most of the relevant legal provisions.  We have brought some hard copies as well.</p> <p>  As members will see from the slides and supplementary materials, the Citizens' Assembly recommendations on the full set of reasons and timeframes within which abortion should be made lawful in Ireland align almost in their entirety with the laws on abortion in almost all other European countries.  As a result, if the recommendations on future legislation were adopted, it is safe to say that they would bring Irish law on abortion into line with the laws of almost all other European countries.</p> <p>  Regarding the standard legal approach to abortion across Europe, the first slide shows a map of Europe.  Almost every European country - 40 in total - is coloured either green or light yellow.  This means that they have made abortion legal either on a woman's request without restriction as to reason or for reasons of distress - those are the ones in green - or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  The countries in red or dark orange do not allow abortion on request or on broad socioeconomic grounds and only in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>  This map shows that 25 of 28 EU member states have made it lawful for women to access abortion on their request or on broad socioeconomic grounds, at least in early pregnancy.  It also shows that 40 of 47 Council of Europe member states have taken this approach.  As the committee members will know, all 28 EU member states are also members of the Council of Europe.  Only three EU member states do not allow abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  These are Ireland, Malta and Poland.  Within the 47 Council of Europe member states, these three EU countries are joined by only four micro-state jurisdictions - Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino.</p> <p>  The next few slides will focus on the approach of the countries in green and light yellow.  As we can see from the map, 36 countries have legalised access to abortion on a woman's request.  The following slide shows a quick recap of these countries.  In the majority, a woman does not need to give any reason when asking for an abortion.  In a small number, as shown in the next slide, a woman must explain that she is seeking an abortion because of social or family circumstances or because continuing the pregnancy would cause her distress.  The committee can see the breakdown across countries.</p> <p>  What about gestational limits?  All these European countries impose a time limit on the legality of an abortion on a woman's request.  We can see their time limits on this slide.  A time limit in or around early pregnancy is the norm, with a 12 week limit the most common.</p><p>In addition to the 36 countries that are green on the map and that have legalised access to abortion on a woman's request, four European countries are light yellow on the map and these four have taken a different approach.  They have not legalised abortion on a woman's request but on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds.  In these four countries, for abortion to be lawful doctors or sometimes social workers must certify the existence of the relevant socioeconomic or psychological reason.  The slide on display right now shows the four countries, the different reasons and the time limits involved.  </p><p> What happens in these 40 countries once the time period for abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds ends?  In almost all of them, after the time period ends, doctors can still legally perform abortions for one or more exceptional reasons.  The next slide shows the usual reasons that are allowed under the laws of almost all European countries.  Sexual assault and socioeconomic reasons are present in the laws of many countries as exceptional reasons but not always explicitly.  The terminology and the approach differs across countries.  In some of these countries, these exceptional reasons are each articulated as an explicit ground in the relevant law while in others, the grounds are implicitly included in other grounds.  We do not have time to go through all of these grounds now but will focus briefly on women's health and on sexual assault.  All of the grounds are listed in the chart that we submitted to all committee members, with a breakdown across the various countries.  </p><p> In terms of women's health, I wanted to capture for the committee the fact that although legal terminology differs across countries, in almost all of the 40 countries we have looked at the laws explicitly or implicitly allow abortion when a woman's health is at risk.  As members will see from the slide on display, the majority of these laws do not specify a time limit for this ground.</p><p> Finally, what is the approach across the 40 countries to the legality of abortion following situations of sexual assault?  First, it is important to note that in all of the 36 countries where abortion is legal on a woman's request, women who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest can always access abortion within the relevant time limit under the on-request ground.  In these countries, women who have survived sexual assault can follow a generally applicable process to obtain a lawful abortion and do not have to fulfil special procedures or report the rape.  For this reason, many of these countries do not include an explicit ground for abortion in their laws.  At the same time, about half of these countries do have an explicit ground for sexual assault in their abortion laws and this means that women who are pregnant as a result of rape can either access abortion in early pregnancy under the on-request ground or, often later in pregnancy, under an explicit, separate ground related to sexual assault.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  I hope this overview has been helpful and informative and I look forward to members' questions.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were very informative.  I have two questions for Ms Hoctor and one for Dr. Sedgh.</p> <p>  An issue of which we are aware is the difference between making abortion procedures nominally legal in State laws and ensuring practical and real access to abortion services for women.  What are the common challenges that emerge in this respect and what should Ireland do to ensure practical access to abortion if we decide to change our laws, based on the experience of other countries?  In our last meeting we heard detailed evidence on the issue of abortion in cases of rape and sexual assault, an issue that Ms Hoctor also touched on in her presentation.  In the 21 countries she mentioned that have an explicit sexual assault ground for abortion, what types of verification processes exist to determine if the ground is met?  What is her opinion of how they operate in practice and their impact on the women involved?  </p> <p> My next question is for Dr. Sedgh and I hope I am pronouncing her name correctly. </p></speech>

I am a little concerned that after a potentially divisive referendum campaign the stigma surrounding abortion could become a practical barrier to access.  Has this issue arisen in any other countries and what is its impact?</p></speech>

While I do not want to put witnesses under pressure to answer, I must point out that we are under quite tight time constraints.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#G00900"><p>In the brief time available we can identify three factors which explain why - in some cases - laws that have allowed abortion, either on broad grounds or on very limited grounds, may not enable access in practice.  Affordability and how abortion services are being covered by public health insurance or integrated into the subsidisation schemes of health systems is one factor that can impact access, even where abortion may be legal.  Often in countries that have not legalised abortion on request or on socioeconomic grounds, the certification processes that must be followed to obtain access on a health ground or in situations of foetal impairment or rape, for example, can be onerous.  These processes can often involve multiple levels that a woman must go through or multiple doctors and social workers being involved in certifying the existence of the reason.  We see other barriers in some countries which can relate to waiting periods, for example, or mandatory and sometimes biased counselling requirements.</p> <p>  In the European countries that were green and light yellow on the map, while it is not true to say that there are not sometimes problems for women in accessing a legal abortion, in general these countries have taken an approach in their laws which enables women to access services early in pregnancy at least.  That often means that some of these barriers create fewer problems.  In terms of sexual assault, which I tried to address in my presentation, all of the 36 countries in Europe that have legalised abortion on a woman's request, mainly in early pregnancy, thereby allow women who have survived an experience of sexual assault to access abortion in early pregnancy through that ground.  In that context, many women across Europe who have faced sexual assault and who then choose to have an abortion do so under the on-request ground.  Many of those countries in Europe that have explicit sexual assault grounds in their laws include a particular certification process.  The most common process is that a committee or a number of doctors and social workers must look at the case and agree that the reason exists and that there is evidence of a sexual assault.  Some countries require a prosecutor or police certificate and speak to the need for clear evidence or sometimes for a criminal legal procedure to be initiated.  Only one country refers to a process before a court in the case of sexual assault.  It is very important to understand that 40 countries out of 47 in Europe allow access, in a general sense, on request for socioeconomic grounds in early pregnancy.  It is probably in that way that women access abortion in situations of rape.</p></speech>

There are some countries where abortion is legal on broad grounds but still stigmatised, including Italy, for example.  In other countries, like South Africa for example, the grounds for legal abortion have been expanded but it is still stigmatised.</p><p>Stigma has prevented women from having access to abortion services where providers are allowed to invoke conscientious objection and mechanisms are not put in place to ensure women nevertheless have access to alternative sources of care.  A literature review has brought together 14 studies of the effects of stigma on women who have had an abortion, which is not to say it has prevented them from seeking an abortion.  Some of the summary findings of the review are that women who have abortions in these settings feel socially isolated, are afraid their loved ones will find out they had an abortion and suffer stress for these reasons.</p></speech>

Ms Hoctor referred to a number of countries in Europe.  Do these countries apply time limits in cases of fatal foetal impairment and, if so, how do these work in the context of diagnostic difficulties?  I ask Ms Hoctor to elaborate on that issue.</p> <p>  When one goes beyond Europe, I assume in countries such as Gabon terminations are not carried out in cases of fatal foetal impairment because anomaly scanning services and knowledge of the impairment of the foetus are poor.  I assume the absence of information on these matters, as opposed to cultural or other reasons, is the reason for not carrying out abortions.  I ask Ms Hoctor to clarify that matter.</p> <p>  On the issue of culture, is there any evidence of partners or fathers forcing women to have a termination against their wishes?  Has any research been done on that issue in the context of cultural differences across the globe to identify whether women are vulnerable to this potential threat of having a termination against their wishes?</p> <p>  I am interested in an issue on which the witnesses may have some observations to make.  While terminations are carried out in Finland for various reasons, in one particular area the father may be given an opportunity to present his views prior to the decision to terminate the pregnancy being made, albeit only if there are special reasons that warrant doing so.  I am not sure if the witnesses are aware of the specific circumstances but perhaps they could clarify or expand on what is meant by this aspect of Finnish law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#H00400"><p>On the Deputy's first question regarding timeframes and foetal impairments, specifically fatal foetal impairments, the basic point to make is that while some European countries impose time limits, the majority do not.  Some European countries do not distinguish in law between fatal and severe foetal impairments and will have a general ground for severe foetal impairment within which fatal foetal impairment would come.  Some countries distinguish between the two, however, and will have a specific reference to severe impairment and another reference to fatal impairment.  Some of these countries will impose a limit for severe foetal impairments but no limit for fatal impairments.  However, the majority of European countries do not impose limits in the case of a severe or fatal foetal impairment.  I believe the vast majority of them do not do so when the impairment is fatal.  In all of these countries, a detailed certification process is involved whereby doctors confirm the existence and nature of the impairment.  Where countries set out timeframes, these often fall at around 24 weeks, with some a little earlier, perhaps 20 or 22 weeks.  The most common practice, as I stated, is not to distinguish between severe and fatal, and where a distinction is made, there is often no limit for the fatal impairment.</p></speech>

It is still not one of the more common reasons, even where the necessary services are available.</p> <p>  With respect to men forcing their partners to have abortions, I am not aware of any kind of systematic or large-scale evidence to that effect.  I imagine that anecdotal evidence along those lines exists but I cannot speak to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#H00600"><p>On the issue of men - the father or partner - being involved in decision-making, I believe, although I could be wrong, that Turkey is the only country of the 47 Council of Europe member states which has a spousal consent requirement for a married woman.  No other European country has any kind of provision along those lines.  Finland has the provision to which the Deputy referred and a few other European countries also indicate in their laws that, if possible, the father - the woman's partner - should be involved in the decision-making process.  However, my understanding is that a degree of discretion applies and it is always considered appropriate that the woman's decision-making and her perspective be front and centre, while her partner or husband, if he is accompanying her, may be involved.  I believe Finland may be unique in specifying that a man may have a possibility of having his voice heard.  That provision is more unusual.  It is rare for the law of a country to include a reference to the views of the partner or husband being taken into account, where possible.  In some cases, the partner or husband may be asked to attend the consultation with the relevant physician or clinician, if possible.</p></speech>

From this side of the table, I expect this would be very complex for many different reasons.  For example, the male parent may not necessarily be the partner, which would give rise to complexities.  The whole issue of domestic violence also arises.  Does this happen in practice in certain countries?</p></speech>

I believe these laws are meant to deal with circumstances in which a woman wants her husband or partner to be involved with her in the decision-making process.  I do not believe these provisions are intended as a means of dealing with a conflict in views or surrounding decisions.  In almost all of the 40 European countries we examined, with the exception of Turkey, the laws which allow access on request or on socio-economic grounds prioritise the woman's wishes and decision-making and those of the doctor working with her.  There is also the right or ability of the woman to have her partner or husband involved in that process with her.</p></speech>

I wish to address a few questions to Dr. Sedgh in respect of slide 6.  Will she clarify whether she is saying that in countries where abortion is freely available, the abortion rate is similar to countries where it is very restricted or not available at all and will she expand on that?  I wish to ask Dr. Sedgh about her figures on the gestation duration of pregnancies where they are terminated.  She states that 90% of abortions are obtained in the first trimester; does she have any detail on the reasons for the other 10% of abortions?  Is there any reason to think that the reasons for women having abortions as outlined in slide 12, would be replicated here?  The figures show that roughly 25% of abortions were for socio-economic reasons; 25% for partner-related reasons; about 18% in order to space their children; 13% for reasons for having as many children as they wanted; and 1% related to health of the foetus.  Dr. Sedgh may not be able to give exact feedback but perhaps she has a viewpoint on it.</p> <p>  Would Ms Hoctor speak about her opinion on the so-called floodgates argument?  Should access to abortion be broadened after the referendum in this country?  Is there experience in other countries of a floodgate opening once abortion is allowed on demand?  Ms Hoctor responded to a colleague's question on this but where there are restrictions on abortion inserted in the Constitution in other countries, how did that affect the policy and practice in those countries and how it impacts on women and on the medical profession?</p></speech>

Let me make a couple of points.  Within each of these groups of countries there is a wide variation in the abortion rates and these figures are averages.  We do not see a strong relationship in an univariate correlation between laws and incidence.  We do see a strong relationship between contraceptive prevalence and the abortion rate.  We see it more clearly when we look at the proportion of women with an unmet need for contraception and the abortion rate.  One would then see a much stronger relationship, if that is what we were looking at in this slide, rather than the abortion laws.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughton asked about late term abortions.  Among the small proportion of women who do have late term abortions the reasons for late term abortions are where we will tend to see abortions for reasons that have to do with risks, to foetal health and to foetal life.  Adolescents comprise a larger share of late term abortion than early term abortions and it suggests that it is restrictions or barriers to accessing abortion that causes some women to obtain their abortions later.  Young women might not know they are pregnant, might be afraid to tell somebody they are pregnant and thereby also admit they have had sex, or they do not know where to go and who to ask.  In countries with restrictive abortion laws, some slightly larger proportion of abortions are done later in pregnancy compared to countries where abortion is allowed on broad grounds, so that is another indication that access to legal abortion that can drive the proportions of abortions that are done late.  </p> <p>  If it okay-----</p></speech>

They need options and choices so that they can choose and not just have one method made available to them.  They need counselling to help them navigate the side effects that accompany these methods.  They think they can avoid getting pregnant because they think they are not having sex as often as other couples so they are operating under this misconception that they are not at risk of getting pregnant.  These are some of the reasons that come up very often, both in developed and developing countries.</p></speech>

I may help Ms Hoctor answer a question that I think might be more in the Guttmacher Institute's area.  </p> <p>  Deputy Naughton asked about the floodgates.  We have tried to look at trends in abortion incidence before and after a large change.  That is one aspect of the question.  We are not able to do that very well because where abortion is illegal we often do not have a good fix on the number of abortions that are happening and then when abortion becomes legal, the number of abortions that are on the official record begin to increase, but we do not know to what extent that represents a shift from abortions that had been clandestine to abortions that are now not more common but more on the record.  That will be the case in Ireland where we have accounts of women having abortions in England, Wales and in the Netherlands and some obtaining from Women on Web, but we do not fully know how many abortions are happening now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#J02100"><p>Let me follow on from that point.  We saw from Dr. Sedgh's slides as well that some of the lowest rates of abortion in the world are in the western European countries that we looked at in our map that would have access to abortion on request.  I am living in Switzerland at present and that was the country with the lowest incidence of abortion on the slide.</p><p>What we can see from those data is that there is no correlation between the availability of abortion on request, in early pregnancy, for example, in the law, and a higher rate of abortion.  In fact, WHO evidence indicates that once the law is changed, unsafe abortions then become safe.  In the Irish context, this would mean women who are travelling outside the State for abortion care would, in most cases, no longer do so, and women who take an abortion pill in a clandestine manner would be within the law.  Abortions had by Irish women outside the State would happen here.</p><p> I was asked about constitutions.  The Irish approach, involving the regulation of abortion starting with a constitutional provision, is very rare across the world.  In Europe, there is, I believe, only one other country in this category, Andorra.  I do not have exact numbers but I believe Andorra has a complete ban on abortion.  That protects the right to life before birth.  It applies prenatally.  Beyond Ireland and Andorra, it is virtually unheard of in Europe to include abortion within a constitutional provision.  Some countries in Latin America, such as Chile and Honduras, and in Africa have constitutional provisions that address the right to life and whether it applies before birth.  It applies prenatally in those countries.  All these countries have highly restrictive abortion laws.  Since Ireland, being in western Europe, is a country whose socioeconomic status is higher than that of Chile, Irish women can leave to gain access to safe abortion services in another country.  In Latin America and Africa, however, we see, as a result of the very restrictive laws and constitutional provisions, there are very high rates of unsafe abortion.</p></speech>

They are on horse racing, testing, etc.  I apologise if I have to leg it before hearing an answer to my questions to the witnesses.</p> <p>  I was going to raise the floodgates issue.  I note my question has largely been answered.  On page 5 of Dr. Sedgh&rsquo;s report, she refers to varying rates across countries where abortion is broadly available.  The report touches on the point that it is not necessarily a question of legality or illegality in terms of abortion rates but a question of a range of other factors.  Could Dr. Sedgh expand on some of the points on the variance within the countries where abortion is broadly legal?</p> <p>  With regard to the Siobh&aacute;n Whelan case, it was stated in the media yesterday that she was awarded &euro;30,000.  While financial considerations are of far less consequence than the emotional damage being done to women, could Ms Hoctor outline the minimum criteria Ireland needs in its legislation to avoid this?  I presume there will now be many other cases coming on stream that will highlight not only the emotional impact but also the financial cost to the State.  What do we need to do in our law to prevent what occurred from happening again, making reference to the cases in which Ms Hoctor&rsquo;s organisation has represented people?</p> <p>  My other point is on the preamble to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It has been bandied around this committee a bit.  It refers to the protection of the child before birth.  Could the witnesses deal with that in the context of clarifying what has been alleged, namely, that this gives the foetus the right to life, as such, and, therefore, prohibits abortion?  Clearly, it does not considering that all the countries among which we stand out like a sore thumb are signatories to the convention.  A little more information on this would be very useful.</p></speech>

The slide with country-specific abortion rates shows that almost half of the countries have abortion rates lower than ten.  The countries with the lowest abortion rates on record are countries where abortion is allowed on broad grounds.  The countries where we see the sharpest declines in the abortion rate on record are countries that have allowed abortion on broad grounds throughout the period of the decline.  These findings indicate that a liberal abortion law does not necessarily represent the groundwork or setting for a high abortion rate.  I could elaborate but I will stop there because there is limited time and there are many questions in the Deputy's set of questions.</p></speech>

It stated it must make abortion services practically accessible in a timely and effective manner in Ireland.  What is really key here is the phrase &quot;similar violations&quot;.  The violations that the committee found in the decision were violations involving inhuman and degrading treatment, the right to privacy, and inequality before the law.  The facts of the cases of Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan concerned the circumstances of fatal foetal impairment and the really tragic circumstances the women were in.  The analysis of the committee, however, and the decision on why the suffering the women endured was inhuman and degrading focused a lot on the experience of travel and what it meant to have to leave the country to gain access to care in another country, in addition to the breach in the continuum of care that they endured and the fact that they could not obtain health care here from doctors and nurses they knew and trusted.  What is really key for Ireland, the committee and lawmakers as they move ahead is to understand that until Ireland changes its laws on abortion so women, whatever their circumstances, will not face inhuman and degrading treatment or violations of the right to privacy and equality before the law, it may happen that Ireland will continue to appear before the committee.  I am not aware of cases that are pending.<br/><br/>Under international human rights law, making abortion legal is one requirement in a broad range of circumstances.  Another requirement, however, is to make abortion that is legal under domestic law accessible and available in practice.  This is really critical.  Poland serves as an interesting example in Europe.  In that country, abortion has been legalised on many more grounds than it is currently legal in Ireland.  These grounds cover circumstances of severe foetal impairment, rape and the risk to a woman&rsquo;s health, but do not cover abortion on request or socioeconomic grounds.  Owing to the strictures and restrictive nature of the Polish law, however, it is very difficult for women to gain access to services in practice.  Therefore, Poland has been held accountable by the European Court of Human Rights three times.  We can see, therefore, that it is not simply a matter of the grounds on which abortion is legal in a country&rsquo;s law; it is also a matter of ensuring that it is available in practice when it is legal.<br/><br/>With regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the provision is preambular.  It does not in any way refer to the right to life prior to birth, or prenatally.  In fact, in the<i>travaux preparatoires</i>, which are the legal documents used to interpret the treaty, namely, the negotiations of the states that drafted it, it is very clear and specific that the inclusion of this preambular provision was not in any way meant to lead to the application of Article 1 of the convention, on the right to life, prior to birth or in a manner as to prevent the legalisation of abortion in countries that have ratified the treaty.  In fact, we have seen from the jurisprudence and recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is the monitoring and adjudicative body that oversees the convention, that the body has called on Ireland and many other countries with restrictive abortion laws to ensure abortion is decriminalised and that adolescents and girls can gain access to safe and legal abortion services.</p></speech>

It is useful to see how we compare with other countries, particularly countries in Europe, and the cause and effect when changes are made.  I have a question about the position in Malta and Poland.  As Ireland does not allow legal abortion, women travel.  Do the delegates have any information on what happens in Malta and Poland?  The system in Poland is less restrictive than in Ireland, but nonetheless it is very restrictive.</p> <p>  In countries where there is a legal framework in place, what role does the medical profession play within it?  Is there a general trend in that regard in the regulatory process?</p></speech>

My understanding is that many women in both countries also travel outside the country, in Poland's case potentially to neighbouring eastern European countries and in Malta's case often to the United Kingdom.  Although I do not have data, I also believe that, similar to the position in Ireland, women are accessing abortion pills and ordering them online.  In Poland there are reports from non-governmental organisations that there are quite high rates of clandestine abortions.  As the socioeconomic status of women in Ireland is obviously higher relative to that of women in Poland, travel might be easier for women in Ireland than for women in Poland.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

In most of the European countries where we examined their laws the reform processes moved from a highly restrictive law on abortion in the 1970s and 1980s to the laws in place today.  Medical professionals in these societies were very involved with legislators and law makers in crafting these laws and advising on what would be workable and bring about a solution in these countries.  Many of them were dealing with very high rates of unsafe abortion and often the law reform processes occurred because of calls from within the medical profession for change because its members were seeing such high rates of maternal deaths as a result of unsafe abortions.  Usually across Europe laws on abortion in legislation or primary legal sources are also accompanied by regulations, by-laws and often medical guidelines adopted by medical professional bodies.</p></speech>

Is there a big difference between, for example, ten and 14 weeks in terms of practicality?  Is there any noticeable change or movement in any of the countries that have these limits in terms of changing because something is not workable?</p></speech>

A country that has set a ten or 12-week limit on request or a later limit has not shifted.  Other requirements and facets of the law have changed and developed over time.  The most common limit is 12 weeks.  Although these countries' laws were adopted at a time when medical abortion, the abortion pill, was not available, it is interesting that the ten to 12-week period in place in their laws is the time period within which medical abortion is safe and now available.  Even though that was not the case at the time, it is interesting to see that the time period they set also lines up with the time period for medical abortion being safe, as stated by the WHO.</p></speech>

With regard to the Amanda Mellet and Siobhan Whelan cases, she said in her presentation that the Human Rights Committee's judgment detailed remedies which included reform of Irish abortion law and, if necessary, the Constitution.  In her analysis of the judgment does she consider that it would entail changing the Constitution?  In other words, within the current constitutional restrictions is it possible to implement the decision?</p></speech>

It has set out an obligation of result - law reform - and will not dictate the legal model of law reform that the state must adopt.  However, the Government in its response to the decision in both the Amanda Mellet and Siobhan Whelan case has specified clearly that in order for Irish law on abortion to be changed, the constitutional provision must change.  The State made this argument in its pleadings and written submissions as the case was being considered by the committee.  It is also the position it specified clearly in its responses to the committee.  In order for law and legislative reform to occur, the constitutional reform must first take place.  On that basis, it is our view that this is critical.  Without constitutional reform, it is clear that legislative reform cannot occur.</p></speech>

Clearly, it is a basic issue we must examine.  Both delegates have answered about the floodgates being opened and so forth.  I understand Dr. Sedgh's research is mainly on groups of countries and that it is hard to be specific about Ireland's case, but is there any other comparison in respect of women in one country who have easy access to abortion in another, as we do in Ireland, and to show how statistics might have changed when the law became more liberal such that women did not need to travel?</p> <p>  I do not know if the delegates have statistics for the use of the abortion pill bought online, but are there statistics in other countries?  Judge Laffoy said the Citizens' Assembly was unable to deal with the issue in great detail, but it is one of the issues that have arisen for the committee.</p></speech>

When the Deputy was asking her question, I thought about Zambia where women travel to South Africa for abortions, but we do not have the rest of the scenario described by the Deputy, where the abortion law or access to legal abortion changes, in Zambia.</p><p> I am hard-pressed to find a case where we know definitively what happens to the incidence of abortion before and after a change in the law because of the clandestine nature of abortions before that change.  We have seen countries, my own home country of the USA among them, where the abortion rate declines after abortion has been legal for some time and that shift from clandestine to recorded abortions has taken place.  It declines because women increasingly start to use contraceptive methods or else to shift from less effective to more effective methods.  If there is concern at some point over the numbers of Irish women obtaining abortions then, all of the evidence from other countries suggests that what needs to be looked at is whether or not something might be preventing these women from using contraception.  </p><p>Members asked about abortion pills accessed online and how prominent a role these might play as a proportion of total abortions being carried out.  When it comes to medical abortion in general, these pills play a large role.  The case-loads of online services like Women on Web, from which a woman can be sure she is getting proper pills, proper dosage and proper information, are not in fact very large.  In countries with more restrictive laws, however, which are often developing countries, we see large numbers of women obtaining Misoprostal through the black market.  Misoprostal is but one of the two drugs that make up that medication abortion regimen and women are obtaining it through a variety of means: from pharmacists; from what they call their "chemists"; and from open-air markets.  The drug is often obtained in various doses and thus not necessarily the optimal dose or regimen, and without any guidance or counselling.  I do not know if that speaks to Irish concerns in particular but my overall point is that medication abortion in general can play a major role where abortion is clandestine.</p></speech>

One of our previous sessions here indicated that because Irish women who travel to Britain for abortions do not get the follow-on counselling, they do not always get information on contraception either.  Would that be the case in general?</p></speech>

We can see that some of the lowest rates of abortion are in countries where the family planning and comprehensive sexuality education are quite strong.  With regard to the regulation of medical abortion, many European countries have now developed health service protocols.  These are not based in legislation but rather are practice guidelines set by medical professional bodies on how medical abortion be provided; how it be rolled out; what requirements there might be for women to have prior consultations with doctors; and whether women would take the pill at the facility itself or perhaps take some of it at home.  This matter is properly regulated in most European countries, but within health practice guidelines rather than within legislation.</p></speech>

She has six minutes.</p></speech>

It concerns the word "risk".  We know from the Citizens' Assembly what it is that we are asked to consider here.  The assembly has a gradation of risk or "serious risk" to use its own term.  There are various definitions of what does or does not constitute risk.  In Dr. Sedgh's experience, is it possible or even desirable to try to grade risk in legislation?  Is it simply a matter of "risk" as determined by medical professionals?  Or can or should we consider including a definition of what does or does not constitute sufficient risk?  We are being asked to consider the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations here and risk is listed as one of the grounds.</p> <p>  The assembly also listed sexual assault among its recommendations, so this too forms part of our deliberations here.  Ms Hoctor mentioned that there are some countries which operate through possible prosecution certificates or indeed legal processes.  That sounds quite shocking to me.  Are these measures on the statute books of those countries without necessarily applying in everyday use?  In other words, do these countries have other ways around the matter?  Or is it actually the case that such certification has to be obtained?  I would like to ask Ms Hoctor to talk us through the process of how a woman might go about obtaining this as it sound to me like a very tough thing to do.  Without wishing to stray outside of Ms Hoctor's area of expertise, I wonder if she could talk to us briefly about the potential impact that having to obtain such certification might have on a woman who has been the victim of a sexual assault.  Finally, what possible implications might that have on time?  Legal processes can be long and drawn out - is this a quick process?  What are the mechanics of it?</p></speech>

Some countries do impose such a limit.  Some countries do, as the Citizens' Assembly did, and differentiate between a health risk and a serious health risk.  The most common practice, however, is to have a health ground and not to impose any time limit.</p> <p>  I have put together a quick run-down of the terminology involved: "health is at risk"; "damage to women's health"; "continuation of pregnancy endangers women's health"; "medical reasons" is also a common terminology; and "necessary to prevent".  Of the 40 European countries we looked at, given that I focused mostly on the green and light yellow countries that also have socio-economic access and access on request, there is no qualification on the risk.  Some countries use the language of "serious", "severe" or "grave" health risk but most, approximately 25 or more of the 40, have no such qualification.  That is because, as Deputy O'Reilly mentioned herself, there is a view that best practice in law-making is to treat women's mental or physical health as a clinical matter for the relevant doctors and physicians and for the woman herself.  That is the best practice approach.  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Reilly's other question about sexual assault, it is critical to understand that the 40 countries we looked at by and large allow access to abortion in early pregnancy on a woman's request or for socio-economic reasons.  Where these countries have an explicit assault ground in their law, then, it co-exists as a separate ground side by side with the on request ground.  As we saw, only 19 or 20 countries have that explicit ground in their law.  I was not around in the 1970s when these countries were in the process of reforming their abortion laws and in the 1980s I was too young to be aware of such matters.  I would not be surprised, however, if part of the reason why many European countries have a request ground but no explicit sexual assault ground is because they were concerned about the situations of survivors of sexual assault and thus did not want to set up and then put these women through an onerous certification process.  They knew that legalising abortion in early pregnancy would mean that victims of sexual assault could get access to services within that timeframe.  Someone would have to actually go back to look at the legislative records in the relevant parliaments, however, to understand whether or not that was a consideration.</p><p>Also, it is important to understand that where these countries would have a sexual assault explicit ground in co-existence with a non-request ground or a socioeconomic ground, they would have a later term limit usually associated with that.  It is quite few that would.  In the majority of these countries, the process would involve medical professionals, and sometimes social workers.  It would be a similar process to that applied in the situation of a health risk.  I cannot give the committee information about how the few that refer to prosecutors or police authorities - these are in the minority - operate in practice.  In one country in Europe, Poland, which has legalised access to abortion on grounds of sexual assault but has not legalised access to abortion on request, we see evidence that it is difficult for survivors of sexual assault to access abortion in practice under that rape ground.  I would refer the committee to a case that came before the European Court of Human Rights, called P. and S. <i>v</i>. Poland.  That case illustrates, as was mentioned, some of the severe impacts of these kind of certification schemes.  Poland is one of the countries that requires a certification from a prosecutor.  That case concerned a minor, an adolescent girl who had been raped and who faced very severe impacts and barriers in attempting to gain access to what was a legal service.</p></speech>

Ireland has a number of interesting peers in Europe that have changed their abortion laws and moved from an orange situation or even a red situation to now becoming green.  These would be Switzerland, Portugal and Spain.  In Switzerland and Portugal, those processes involved a public referendum.  I live in Switzerland and I am aware that they vote on everything there - they vote on what side of the road they will drive on.  They liberalised, or changed and reformed, their abortion law through a public referendum process.  There would have been a legislative proposal put forward to the people of Switzerland by the legislature in 2002.</p> <p>  Spain and Portugal are the most recent.  They legalised in 2010 and 2008, respectively.  In Portugal, there was a public referendum.  It may be also of interest to the committee to look at that process.  Then Spain also moved from a restrictive model, from being orange on the map, to now being green.  Those are the most recent.</p></speech>

She stated that there are very few unsafe abortions in countries where there is a reasonably open and liberal abortion regime and there is almost a 30-fold increase in unsafe abortions in countries where legislation is very tight.  I wonder how does that apply <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Ireland where we have the right to travel and where we are in such close proximity to the UK.  Do those figures hold up for Ireland?</p><p>Dr. Sedgh also stated, which surprised me when I saw these figures previously, that 73% of abortions are performed on married women as opposed to 27% on single girls.  That would surprise people and raise a lot of eyebrows around the country because the narrative, especially, by those who are very much against abortion, is always centred on helpless young women who are probably confused, etc., whereas, in fact, the vast majority of abortions would seem to involve women who, because they are married, I assume, are older, more settled and more mature.  I would like to check that figure with Dr. Sedgh to determine am I right.</p><p>Finally, there is one statement Dr. Sedgh made that surprises me and that I cannot rationalise.  Russia jumps out on the map as being all green and, therefore, would be, I imagine, very liberal, yet Dr. Sedgh stated there was a reduction of 50% in abortions in Russia since the war or Stalinist period.  It does not add up how they are still in the green box.  What happened to cause such a reduction?</p></speech>

We do not know all of the women who are having abortions and we do not know all of the conditions in which they are having abortions but it appears to be anomalous.</p> <p>  Senator Ned O'Sullivan's next question was on the marital status of women having abortions.  There is variation across these countries.  Across developed countries, it may not be that in all of them the majority of women having an abortion are married but on average it definitely pans out that way.  One should bear in mind that married women includes cohabiting women.</p> <p>  It is interesting to me also that the unmarried women are the ones who get so much of the attention.</p><p>As they get the attention, it gives the impression that they account for the majority of abortions.  It makes some sense because it could be argued that the consequences of an unintended pregnancy are greater for a young, unmarried woman who has not yet finished her education and for whom the opportunity costs of having a child might be higher.  It could be argued that the stigma of having both an unintended pregnancy and an abortion - having had sex before that - are all compounded.  It is useful to be reminded of that statistic because it is surprising.</p><p> In Russia and eastern European countries, although I hope life has got better in Russia, abortion rates have decreased because access to family planning services has increased dramatically with the ending of the Cold War and because of increases in trade, exposure to the West and the presence of non-governmental organisations providing services.  The number of women using a contraceptive method has increased substantially from 1990 to the present.  The prevalence is still not as high as in western and northern Europe and women are not as likely to be using effective methods as women in northern Europe or using them well because of the variability in the quality of service.  We still see higher abortion rates in eastern Europe than in the rest of Europe and these are some of the reasons from the evidence we have seen.  It comes back again to contraceptive use; it is why rates decline or remain high.</p></speech>

In Ireland's case we are in the area where the purpose of an abortion is to save the woman's life.  It is also true, of course, that it does not necessarily have to be an abortion.  My definition of abortion is to terminate the life of the child still to be born to achieve a result.  As we know, it is possible to intervene to save a woman's life without killing the child.  Will Dr. Sedgh comment on this?</p> <p>  I am a little confused about the statistics for Germany as compared with those for the United Kingdom, for example.  There are liberal or readily available abortion services on socioeconomic grounds, but there are considerable restrictions in Germany related to the provision of counselling and advice.  There is a thorough examination of the person presenting, whether she is single, married or whatever the case may be.  There seems to be a heavy reliance on counselling and the provision of support services that do not seem to be a feature in the United Kingdom, for example, and certainly are not a feature for Irish women availing of abortions in the United Kingdom.  With regard to abortion rates across various countries in which abortion is legal on broad grounds, we can compare the likes of Sweden with Switzerland.  There is a dramatic difference in the level of abortions in the two countries.  Is that for some reason we have not spotted?  There seems to be something bvious that is not jumping up to hit me.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned about the suggestion the European Union is watching us and might be on our case again.  There are a number of matters on which we are watching it also.  I am a little uneasy about that slant.  This is an independent state and we observe EU law in almost every case.  In some recent times there has been a tendency for us to feel we must reiterate our right to exercise our own options.  Will the delegates comment on these matters?</p></speech>

I am aware of research within some countries which indicates that the rate of unintended pregnancies and abortion is higher among minority and disadvantaged women, or women whose access to contraceptive, family planning and reproductive health services might be compromised.  It is possible these inequities are more pronounced in some countries than in others.  It is also possible the proportion of women who face these barriers or who are disadvantaged in some way is higher in some of these countries than in others.  I am uncomfortable in even going there because I am speaking a little beyond the evidence.  I am starting with evidence and speculating based on it.  Otherwise, I do not know that I can explain well or find evidence to explain the differentials.</p> <p>  I take the point about Germany.  These are broad categories with respect to abortion laws in various countries.  On the whole, Germany is classified as allowing abortion on broad grounds, as is the United States.  In some countries, including these two, restrictions are enacted, including counselling requirements, waiting periods, etc., which allow for cause degradation across countries in which abortion is allowed on broad grounds with respect to ease of access to legal abortion.  However, I take the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

There is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, for example, which makes a comment in that regard.  The EU Charter on Fundamental Rights also makes a comment.  Does Ms Hoctor wish to comment on either of these?  If we are to be even-handed in our debate, we must ask about the human rights of the woman and those of the child.</p></speech>

They do not apply before birth and only begin once a person is born.  That is the starting point for international human rights law.  It is very clear from the jurisprudence of all of the adjudicative bodies that oversee implementation of the treaties that they are of the view that women's human rights are violated or undermined when they are not able to access abortion care safely and legally.  That is the legal approach to human rights in this matter.</p> <p>  I will also address the Deputy's original point about abortion to save the life of a woman.  It is very important to understand almost all abortions - perhaps 90% or more - in European countries occur in the first trimester of pregnancy.  That is a critical fact to keep in mind.  There may be cases later in pregnancy in which women face difficult situations and may need to access abortion care and it is very important that they can do so legally.  In Europe the vast majority of abortions take place within the first trimester.</p></speech>

I was a member of the convention on the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.  We spoke for a long time about a reference before coming to the conclusion that everybody had the right to be born.  That is from memory.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also states everybody has the right to be born.  To be absolutely sure, I would like a comment on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Leah Hoctor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#O00700"><p>I believe I addressed this issue earlier as Deputy Clare Daly asked a similar question.  The wording in question in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is in a preambular paragraph.  It is not in an article or a provision.  It states the child "by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care ... before as well as after birth".  It is very clear from the drafting negotiations on the treaty that it was agreed by states that this provision did not mean that there was a right to life that would apply prenatally.</p><p>It was agreed that Article 1 of the treaty, enshrining the right to life, would apply from the time of birth and that is in line with the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It may be in a state's interests to take measures to protect prenatal life but human rights standards and jurisprudence have made it very clear that doing so cannot undermine the human rights of women.  It is critical that states take an approach to law and policy around reproductive health care that places women's health and rights at the centre and works out from there.</p><p> I will have to check this but I believe that even the Holy See, in the negotiations of the convention on the rights of the child, understood that the language in the preamble did not prevent states from liberalising and legalising access to abortion care.</p></speech>

They were two women who had obtained diagnoses of fatal foetal impairment and were told by doctors and nurses here that they could not legally end their pregnancies here because of Irish law on abortion, so they travelled to the UK where they were able to access medical terminations.  These women were of the view that they had suffered grievously in different ways and they wanted to work to ensure that other women would not suffer in the same way.  Accordingly, they wanted to take their complaints to the human rights committee and they claimed violations of their human rights, which the committee found.</p></speech>

The United Nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities stated that legalising abortion on disability grounds was a violation of the human rights of people with disabilities under the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.  I travelled with some people to the UN in 2015 and attended the committee.  What comment does Ms Hoctor have to make on that point?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the committee on the rights of people with disabilities has never said that women who received diagnoses of severe fatal foetal impairments should not be allowed legally to access abortion care in their countries, or that a state should prohibit women's access on these grounds.</p> <p>  The committee raised concerns regarding the legislative modality through which a state does that and gave its view that states should not include explicit legal terms in their laws regarding foetal impairment.  The committee has never expressed any concern about a woman being legally allowed to access abortion care and services.  Some countries in Europe, such as Switzerland and Sweden, have a health ground in their law but no explicit ground for access to abortion for foetal impairment.  Germany also has such a ground but in all these countries women obtain legal abortion services when they receive a diagnosis of fatal foetal impairment and the committee on the rights of people with disabilities has never expressed any concern with the laws of these countries.  In fact, along with all the other human rights mechanisms, the committee has stressed how important it is that women can access sexual reproductive health care, including access to abortion care.  The committee's concern is around the legislative modality, as opposed to whether women who are suffering due to diagnoses of fatal foetal impairment should be allowed legally to access care.</p></speech>

The committee made a statement on this quite recently, though the presentation was made in 2015.  Two weeks ago, a UN committee also stated that "fatal" and "incompatible with life" were terms that should not be used.</p></speech>

The committee on the rights of disabilities did not state that women should not be allowed to access services when they receive a diagnosis of fatal foetal impairment - it simply raised the question of how the law does that and how the law should enable women to make decisions in the course of a pregnancy with a fatal foetal impairment.  It also discussed whether or not the law should include an explicit term around foetal impairment.</p></speech>

The HSE has issued new guidelines in recent times, discontinuing the use of the terms "fatal foetal" and "incompatible with life" and using softer terminology.  I have brought forward a Private Members' Bill on the issue but the HSE has acquiesced already, with more compassionate and sensitive language on pregnant mothers or couples presented with such diagnoses.  There is a clear conflict with what the committee has stated and the quotations Ms Hoctor has given from the United Nations.  I do not accept her answers and I totally discount her answer to Deputy Durkan's questions to the effect that no life exists before birth.</p></speech>

They included the statistic that the majority of abortions are requested by married women, that more than half of women are between 20 and 29 years old, that most women who have abortions have at least one other child and that most abortions happen by the ninth week.  These are very important scientific statistics that show that there is a lot of myth from those who oppose people's right to abortion in this country.  We stick out like a sore thumb on the map, as an island isolated from the rest of Europe in this area.</p> <p>  Dr. Sedgh said we had no way of knowing exactly what the statistics are for Irish women seeking abortions abroad.  Many Irish women go to Britain but many of them do not give Irish addresses and this is probably also true of Irish women who go to Holland.  We have no way of gathering real statistics around women, abortion and this country.  Dr. Sedgh is not a health professional but she informs health professionals.  Does she, as a scientist, believe that not having absolutely correct and full statistical knowledge of how abortion impacts on Irish women is not a good thing for the health of Irish women?  Does she believe that it is not good from the point of view of getting a full picture of the full reproductive health of Irish women or for informing ourselves as legislators?</p><p>As a scientist, does Dr. Sedgh believe it is unhealthy not to have knowledge of the full statistics?</p><p> I have questions for Ms Hoctor about the availability of abortion services.  She talked about the stress and distress caused in having to leave one's country to have an abortion elsewhere, regardless of the reasons involved.  As the doctor showed, there is a huge variety of reasons women seek to terminate a pregnancy.  Having to leave one's country and suffer distress is a big issue when it comes to where Ireland falls down in protecting women's rights and, therefore, compensating them.  Can Ms Hoctor add to that aspect?  Importantly, statistics here prove that socioeconomic reasons are another huge factor for women.  In other words, if one is poor or does not have the financial resources required, one will often, as the doctor said, be subject to procuring an abortion much later rather than as early as possible in the pregnancy.  One is also put under much more stress and strain by having to get onto an aeroplane or a ferry and stay overnight in accommodation.  On top of this, one cannot take one's partner or pal along because that would cause further stress and financial strain.  Does Ms Hoctor think the socioeconomic reasons we are considering in women seeking to have an abortion are a big element in terms of the countries that allow women to access abortion services?</p></speech>

Before I discuss what we do not know and how useful it would be to know more, I acknowledge that for the women who travel to Britain for an abortion and admit that they are from Ireland, we have statistics for their ages and the gestational age at which they have an abortion.  A very small share are obtained by adolescents and they are mostly performed within the first 13 weeks.  I work in an organisation the mission of which is to conduct policy-relevant research and to support evidence-based policies.  From that perspective, yes, it is unfortunate that we do not have direct evidence within Ireland on the reasons Irish women have an abortion, the numbers of Irish women who have an abortion and the circumstances in which they have them. </p> <p>  I have mentioned that Ireland seems to be an anomaly with respect to the proportion of abortions that are unsafe.  We do not know how many of the clandestine abortions are performed by a trained person.  Even among those who have an abortion that is medically safe, we do not know what proportion of women who have an abortion experience stress related to the stigma they experience having had an abortion or the stigma they are afraid they will experience.  I have mentioned a review of 14 papers that comment on the pervasiveness of that experience among women who have had an abortion.  In the absence of this evidence directly from Ireland, I hope evidence from other countries in the region and the developed world can help us to get a sense of the circumstances experienced in Ireland.  To the extent that the Deputy's question is also a comment, I appreciate her comment that we need evidence to inform policies both here and throughout the world.</p></speech>

It was a component part of the cruel and inhuman treatment the committee found she had suffered.  It was also a component part of the finding of the committee of inequality before the law that she faced discrimination because of her socioeconomic status.</p> <p>  I refer the committee - I do not have the exact page number - to the World Health Organization's guidelines on safe and legal abortion.

I do not expect Ms Hoctor to comment on specifics, but she may be aware, for example, that in recent weeks the Care Quality Commission in the United Kingdom brought to light information that Marie Stopes International gave bonuses to its staff members for convincing women to go through with an abortion, even in situations where they had decided not to go through with it.  That is appalling behaviour in the name of choice.  I assume that Ms Hoctor is aware of some horrifying stories from the United States, but I will not go into graphic detail.  As a multi-million dollar organisation that campaigns on the issue, has the center ever commented on cases such as the one I have cited involving Marie Stopes International or is the abortion industry always given a free pass?</p></speech>

It is important for me to clarify that it is a legal advocacy organisation which uses the law to advance women's reproductive health and rights which include access to safe and legal abortion care, quality maternal care for women who are in labour and access to affordable contraception services.

It is critical to understand all western European countries have highly effective regulatory bodies in place that oversee and monitor the provision of health care, including reproductive health care and abortion services.  Also, if there are allegations of or concerns about malpractice or inappropriate service provision, the relevant regulatory body should investigate.  That is what the regulatory body in the United Kingdom is engaged in, which is an appropriate response.  That is why there are such bodies.</p></speech>

The centre must criticise such a practice.  It cannot stand for it for one moment.  To me, such a practice is totally and utterly wrong.  Committee members have said women leave Ireland and spend a lot of money in travelling to the United Kingdom.  However, staff members have been paid bonuses to encourage women to have an abortion.</p></speech>

Today again validates the process we are going through.  We are here to listen to facts and evidence.  I do not think anyone can question that we are receiving an awful lot of good information, hard evidence and facts here today.  I welcome that.  Frankly, all my questions have been answered apart from one, which I will highlight.  With regard to the sixth slide of Dr. Sedgh's presentation, some people will find it fascinating, although I was not surprised, that in the countries where abortion is prohibited, 37 out of 1,000 women have abortions while in the countries where abortion is available on request, that number is 34.  In other words, there is a lower level of abortion where it is legally available.  That might come as a surprise to some members of the committee.  I know Dr. Sedgh has touched on this point already, but will she elucidate why abortion rates are lower in countries where it is available as against countries where it is prohibited?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gilda Sedgh" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#R00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  The statisticians on our team would say that I was remiss if I did not point out that there is no statistically significant difference in the abortion rate of countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with liberal abortion laws because of the margins of error.  Having said that, the Senator is correct.  The point estimate is such that the abortion rate is actually lower on average in countries in which it is allowed on request.  It is probably worth reinforcing what seems to be behind what we are seeing.  First of all, in countries in which abortion is allowed without restriction as to reason we see some of the lowest abortion rates on record and also some of the highest rates on record.  Those are the countries in eastern Europe and the average rate comes out to approximately 34.  What differentiates the countries with high abortion rates from those with low abortion rates is not the legal status of abortion in those countries, but the level of unmet need for contraception or the proportion of women who wish to avoid getting pregnant and are not using a method of contraception.  We would see a completely different chart if, along the bottom axis, one was looking at the level of unmet need for contraception.  One would see very different abortion rates in those groups of countries.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

One other point occurred to me.  Dr. Sedgh or Ms Hoctor pointed out, rightly, earlier that there was quite an unusual situation in the Soviet Union and the other eastern countries, and that is why we have seen this dramatic reduction in the abortion rates.  Allowing for that and assuming the rate continues to drop, the differential between lower rates of abortion will actually be larger between countries with freely available abortion and those where it is prohibited.  Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>

I apologise if I am repeating anything which was asked recently, I was in the Chamber for another matter.  Is there any other country in Europe where there is this constant argument or discussion about the life of the live mother, who is walking around pregnant, being given equal weighting to the life of the unborn child?  It seems to be a constant discussion in this country.  Have other countries dealt with the same issue and, if so, how did they get through it?</p> <p>  On the ninth week of pregnancy, is Dr. Sedgh counting from conception, implantation or date of last period?  Will she clarify that?  When we look at the hard copy of Ms Hoctor's presentation, particularly the slide on time limits for unrestricted access, do all these countries use the same standard?  Do they use either conception point or date of last period?  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that.  I have noted from some of the documentation that perhaps we are comparing apples and oranges in some cases.  For this chart to be truly, factually correct for the committee, the starting point needs to be the same.  We do not want the committee to fall out over the number of weeks.  If we are doing this, we want to do it correctly.</p></speech>

It would be possible to check which countries have the ten week limit, for example, and to assess where the starting point for that limit is.  The practice across Europe differs significantly in respect of the starting point.</p></speech>

Does Ms Hoctor understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

Therefore it might be that a ten week limit is actually an eight week limit.  It is more likely that abortions are happening at an even earlier gestation than is shown in these charts.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to the committee to know if one country's limit is 12 weeks, but that it is actually ten.  Will the witnesses comment on the balancing of the rights of the woman walking around pregnant and the unborn child?  How have other countries dealt with that?</p></speech>

Andorra, Malta and San Marino, which are very small countries on the map, have highly restrictive abortion laws and do not allow abortion at all or only to protect a woman's life.  Of those, I believe only Andorra has any form of constitutional provision on the question but it does not equate the right to life of a woman with the right to life prior to birth.  It just speaks about recognising the right to life and protecting it in its different phases.  There is no equation of the rights.  My understanding is that the Phillipines may be the only country in the world to have a similar provision to the Irish Constitution.  Again, we would have to check this and come back to the Deputy.  I believe that provision was adopted after the provision in the Irish Constitution was.</p></speech>

I will ask the question anyway.  There has been a lot of talk around equating the right to life of the mother to that of the unborn child.  I think we sometimes get away from what is in the best interests of women's health.  That is what the committee should be looking at in my opinion.  If we were to start with what is in the best interests of women's health and women's health care, in Ms Hoctor's expert opinion would it be fair to say that standards of women's health care are better in countries where there is a more liberal regime in respect of terminations than in countries where there is a very restrictive regime?  Would that be a fair assessment in Ms Hoctor's expert opinion?</p></speech>

As a general rule, countries that allow abortion on a woman's request or on broad socioeconomic grounds, which are mainly countries in Europe or other OECD countries, do not see high rates of unsafe abortion or of maternal mortality.  In countries where there are highly restrictive laws and which do not take a women-centred approach to law-making around reproductive health and abortion, which are largely countries outside of Europe, there are often much higher rates of unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity.</p></speech>

I know that in recent years she has severed her links officially with the International Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF, but I think I am right in saying she has a long historical link with that group, which is one of the largest abortion providers in the world.  I note that, in her presentation, she talks a lot of facts and figures but she does not talk about how many people have been saved by the eighth amendment.  My question to her is this: does she think anyone has been saved by the eighth amendment?</p></speech>

That is on our website, the information is available and I am happy to make it available here.  When the institute was founded in 1968, we were housed in the corporate structure of PPFA.  In 1977 we became an independent organisation with an independent board of directors and our affiliation with PPFA was eventually dissolved.</p> <p>  I am familiar with estimates or assumptions about how many abortions have been averted by virtue of restrictive abortion law in Ireland.  I think the assumptions on which those numbers are based are dubious.  I could get into that if one wanted me to.</p></speech>

The position of the institute is that there are a lot of perspectives on when life begins and that women's reproductive health is best ensured when women are able to make decisions regarding their reproductive lives and reproductive health in consultation with their partners, with their faith leaders and with their health care providers.  That is the position of the institute and I think that is what the Deputy is asking me.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the committee for the invitation.  It is a great pleasure to be able to draw on the research and teaching I have been doing in the area of medical law to think practically about how we might build on the insights of the Citizens' Assembly and how we can practically translate that into legislation.</p> <p>  I thought in this presentation I would select some key points from the submission I made.  Before I get to focusing on how we might translate the Citizens' Assembly recommendations in regard to both on-request models and criteria for access in the later stages of pregnancy, there are two framing issues on which I wish to focus.</p> <p>  The first is in regard to the trend towards decriminalisation and the significance of decriminalisation.  That that is an option open to the committee members in order to progress the framework within which the Citizens' Assembly recommendations might take effect.  Basically, as I am sure the committee will be aware, decriminalisation of abortion is part of an international trend.  Even though there are significant criminal prohibitions in many different countries, we are seeing a trend towards taking the criminal law out of the regulation of reproductive health care, in particular, abortion, partly because it is about having the right tool for the job.  In a sense, criminal law is not the right regulatory tool for regulating reproductive health care and the main argument around decriminalisation of abortion health care at present is about taking the punitive aspect of law out of the regulatory tool box that is available for different kinds of abortion care.</p> <p>  One key reason people find it persuasive to take that punishment element out of the regulation of abortion care is because it is having a chilling effect on professionals providing quality abortion care and health care, and because it stigmatise this kind of reproductive health care and because it has an impact in the sense that we have seen individual prosecutions and there is fear and stigma then attached to that for individual users of abortion care.  However, it is important to remember that taking the criminal law out of the regulation of abortion care and reproductive health care, that is decriminalising, is not about deregulation or full legalisation.  Decriminalisation is about, as I say, removing the punitive element but there are still many other legal tools available to ensure that good practice is promoted and that poor practice is held to account.  That would be the function of the civil law, for example, in regard to the tort of negligence, and it would also be the function of professional regulation.  In medical law, we have other legal tools available to hold good practice to account and to promote that good practice.  Criminal law does not need to do it.</p> <p>  The second key point is that decriminalising does not necessarily mean one is fully legalising something.  One can still adopt criteria that make certain kinds of abortion care lawful and unlawful.  It is merely that one might use other sorts of public tools, such as incentive measures and funding measures, and even information, in order to monitor that boundary between what is lawful and what is unlawful.  That is the first key framing issue that we might want to think about a bit more that might help implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  The second is the guarantee of access that I have proposed in the third part of provisions that might implement the Citizens' Assembly objectives.  That is about making clear that there is a public responsibility to provide abortion care to the highest attainable standards.  One has two framing measures with regard to the statutory provisions in a possible Bill that would implement the Citizens' Assembly, namely, decriminalisation, and a positive guarantee of access to make sure that it is the Minister for Health - the public system - which is responsible for ensuring access and for implementing principles around non-discrimination.</p><p>Not only does it seek to make sure there is a level of public responsibility for delivery of a quality service but it also attempts to redress the previous situation in the sense that we know that the negative effect of abortion restriction has been most keenly felt by those who are most disadvantaged, so we can address that by making a guarantee of access as clear as possible.  Those are the two framing points on which I would be delighted to take questions and comments.</p><p> I will now focus on what I am recommending in terms of the actual grounds themselves and what might be the best and clearest way to implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  The first is on language that might implement the on-request model.  There are three main reasons parliaments and people have found on-request models persuasive.  Two of them are related to women-centred arguments but one is related to a more foetal life-centred argument.  On-request models have received public support because they take women's wishes seriously and that is one of the key reasons.  A second key reason is because they make it easier.  By that I mean there is less obstruction or less harm for the particularly vulnerable cases.  Making abortion available on request means that the barriers and scrutiny that might come with particular pathways for rape victims or women who have serious health conditions are reduced in terms of facilitating access for that vulnerable group of women seeking abortion.</p><p> The third reason is because on-request models, as committee members have heard, tend to have the impact that abortions are more likely to be availed of at an earlier stage.  There is a way, therefore, in which, in effect, if one takes the view that foetal life develops more value in a gradual way over time and if one does not have an absolutist value on foetal life, and many people think foetal life deserves some respect but just does not deserve the same kind of legal recognition women's lives do, there are ways in which many different legal regimes have recognised that foetal, prenatal, life deserves some sort of respect.  On-request models can deliver on that to some extent in the sense that they make it more likely that abortion would be earlier rather than later.  The effect of them is also to speak to people's concerns that prenatal life should have some respect but just not in the same way that women's lives would have.</p><p> The other issues to think about in relation to abortion on request, and I have recommended that we follow the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, is by providing that a person who is not more than 12 weeks pregnant may access abortion on request and without the need to demonstrate indications other than her own wishes.  Again, the woman's wishes would be the main criteria for accessing an abortion on an on-request ground.  One thing to think about in relation to that is that it might be possible, given what the Citizens' Assembly recommended, and given the recommendations based on the World Health Organization guidelines and the kind of variety the committee has been looking at in the earlier sessions, to extend that period from 12 weeks up until something more like 22 weeks, which 44% of the Citizens' Assembly recommended.</p><p> The final point is in relation to how to translate the types of recommendations that speak to making access available later in a pregnancy for especially vulnerable groups.  What I have recommended in relation to that is that we have a ground which would allow a person who is between 12 and 22 weeks pregnant, for example, to access an abortion where an appropriately qualified medical practitioner determines that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances and then in making that determination the practitioner shall have regard to the pregnant person's own wishes, feelings and thoughts on her current and future circumstances.  There is a way of making sure that the pregnant woman's concerns are part of that process but where one still has an approval process for later terminations.  An appropriately qualified medical practitioner could include nurses and midwives, for example.  We could expand the provision and enhance a local service in that regard.</p><p> For pregnancies that are of longer duration than 22 weeks, where the Citizens' Assembly wanted access at that point to be still available where there was risk to the person's life or a risk to health or in cases of fatal foetal anomaly, the idea would be that the appropriately qualified medical practitioner could consult a second appropriately qualified practitioner but that one would make it available on the legal pathway of a risk to a pregnant person's life or health.  There is a difference between the reasons people have, in particular in vulnerable situations, in terms of serious risks to health, rape or carrying a pregnancy with a serious anomaly.  Those are the reasons particularly vulnerable people might have for wanting access to abortion later in pregnancy but we do not necessarily have to use that language in the law.  The language we use in the law can be a more open ground such as risk to health or life.  In that way one removes the ways in which criteria such as rape grounds, anomaly grounds or a finding of serious risk can be an obstruction and instead one puts the details around what circumstances might qualify into the code of practice or into guidelines.  Those are really the main points I wanted to emphasise in relation to the submission.  I look forward to discussing them in more detail.</p></speech>

Therefore, yes, I do think it has value but I do not think we need to translate that value into positive rights in the same way-----</p></speech>

I was struck by her rationale when speaking about on-request abortion.  I do not know whether this is her view but she appeared to cite the view with approval.  It struck me that there was something Sir Humphrey-like about the idea that an on-request basis for abortion in some way offers some respect to the unborn because it might be argued in certain cases, but I do not think the difference is that stark, that people might have abortions earlier if it is available on request.  Given that the death of the child is what results, it does not seem like an awful lot of respect for the unborn.  It is a fairly tortured sop to the unborn.  Is Dr. Fletcher not engaging in a kind of strategic argument that there is something here that she can call in some way pro-life by making abortion on demand?</p></speech>

Dr. Rhona Mahony said at the time that obstetricians are not in the business of killing foetuses and so on.  Is it not the case that Dr. Fletcher and others with whom she works within a legal group, through her activism and the production of draft legislation, are proposing a radical departure from any notion that there could ever be a reason for delaying an abortion?</p></speech>

Decriminalisation is one good tool that would take the punishment element away, but there would need to be some clarity about the terms on which an abortion service is provided.  Given the history of having outsourced provision, there is not an institutional history of developing the service.  The transition from a situation in this country where abortion care has not been integrated into the provision will require positive legislation to guide the terms on which the service would be provided.  Decriminalisation is an important tool that would help to deliver that service, but not the only necessary tool.</p></speech>

That type of language is meant to work in tandem with scientific developments and allow for a review of public regulation of the service in order that it can accommodate scientific developments such as the development of the abortion Bill, for instance, but also low-tech developments.  A particular trend we are seeing internationally in medicine and science technology, one which the committee does not seem to have picked up on in a significant way, is the increasing involvement of nurses and midwives in the delivery of care, because such involvement helps to deliver a quality local service.  There are both low-tech and high-tech ways in which the guarantee of access can seek to maximise the capacity of the law and regulation to respond well to scientific developments.</p></speech>

What is the legal position of prenatal life, if any, under medical law?</p></speech>

As I am not a comparative lawyer, I am somewhat straining my expertise in responding to this question.  Certainly in medical law we do see different ways employed by which a kind of constitutional value of prenatal life is devised which is not, however, equivalent to the value accorded to persons eligible for full rights-bearing protection.  In Spain, for example, the statutory language refers to the desire to respect prenatal life but states that the best way to achieve that is by providing quality reproductive health care and positive guarantees around maternity.  The respect for foetal life is channelled in particular ways.  We see these attempts at characterising a value in prenatal life because, as I said, people invest in and care for that life and because it is seen as having a symbolic and potential value for the future.  Those ethical concerns get translated into this type of category of a legal or constitutional value that is lesser in weight than that of a full rights-bearing person.</p></speech>

It could be very helpful to the Department of Health, which is currently looking at drafting legislation.</p> <p>  The point regarding objective value versus societal value is a very interesting one.  Will Dr. Fletcher expand on it?  There is a great deal of confusion as to how societal value lines up against the human rights of an actual individual in the world, experiencing life, with family, friends and a job.  The societal value placed on foetal life is very different from that and it is a distinction worth examining.</p> <p>  Dr. Fletcher noted that our work presents a good opportunity to learn from the implementation and operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  From a medical law perspective, what does she consider the most important lessons to be learned from that legislation?</p> <p>  The witness mentioned that accommodation will have to be made for conscientious objection in abortion services provision.  How best can we create a legislative model that includes such accommodation, and is there a country we might look to in so doing?</p> <p>  Dr. Fletcher made an interesting point around abortion access on foetal anomaly grounds and rape grounds and including them under a different category or classification, which would be risk to health.  Why does she consider that classification superior to creating one or more specific grounds or categories in themselves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#V01800"><p>On the question of societal value versus objective value in respect of foetal life, we must bear in mind that law is a complex toolbox and there are different ways in which we can respond to the fact there are pluralities in society and people have very different views, but those views are not black and white.  The law can work in a way that is layered and complicated in attempting to respond to the different interests people have.</p><p> This development of a recognising of a value in foetal life is an effort to respond to that plurality but also to say that there are things we want to do such as provide good maternity care, miscarriage care and education around reproductive health and sexual health.  There are things we can do which have an impact on the value of reproduction and the contribution which reproduction makes.  It is a kind of public value and societal value in the reproductive contributions that are made.  Within that model, prenatal life has some weight.  However, as it does not meet the same criteria or have the same social history or social relationships as born, living, feeling, thinking women, it is not the same weight and would always be subject to the protection of the full human rights of pregnant people.  However, there is still a way we can try to promote that public interest in doing the best we can in terms of the provision of reproductive health care.  That is one of the reasons on-request models have found support not just among pro-choice constituencies in other jurisdictions but among constituencies where people are perhaps not against abortion entirely but they have concerns about it.  Those concerns can be addressed by saying that the effect of an on-request model will make it easier for pregnant people to access abortion at earlier stages, and the views of those who adopt a kind of gradualist model of pregnancy can be accommodated in that way.</p><p> The point about learning from the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is an important one.  Medical law would normally have audit, research and reflection into legal processes and it would be a good idea to build that into our statutory processes in this area, as in any area of law.  In some areas it happens more than others.  We have seen with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act some non-delivery of abortion care that seemed to meet legal grounds, for instance, the cases of Ms Y and the woman who was detained under the Mental Health Act.  There is definitely lessons to be learned there.  Even though formal legal grounds can be created for accessing abortion and making it lawful, the interpretation of those grounds needs to be guided by professional regulation and perhaps a code of practice to ensure that they are implemented fully.  Those are the main areas.  We can learn from what did not work as well as was expected with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  Life exceptionalism - the right to life-saving abortion - can be interpreted in a more positive and human rights-respecting way to enhance the dignity of the woman whose life is threatened, for example.  We see that in some Latin American countries but it does not seem to have happened in this case.  That is therefore an interesting lesson to learn.</p><p> In terms of conscientious objection, my recommendation would be to recognise conscientious refusal to provide abortion care.  That is out of an interest in recognising plural opinions and wanting to build a system in which there is public trust.  It is not good for pregnant people accessing services if they are coming up against people who do not want to provide the care to them.  There are good reasons to have a protection of conscientious refusal to provide abortion care but it has to be implemented in a way that respects the rights of the pregnant woman.  There has to be a referral, for example, and it has to come under the guarantee of access in the sense that she has to get a safe and timely service, even though there is that particular conscientious refusal.  It also has to be clear that it does not apply to institutions, for example, as that would be contradictory.  It is supposed to protect individuals.  If an institution is protected, individuals in an institution do not get their right to differentiate from the institution.</p><p> In terms of thinking about different ways in which we could implement access when pregnant women need it at later stages of pregnancy on grounds of rape or foetal anomaly, if we use the term "rape" or a diagnosis of "foetal anomaly" in the law specifically as the reason, it generates problems, as the committee has been hearing.  Let me tackle the rape one first.  We do not need to have the rape ground specifically in the legislation.  It can be the set of circumstances which generate the risk to the woman's health.  It is a set of circumstances that generate the qualification on the legal ground.  That is a typical way of addressing the issue.  Then we do not have the sort of problems around requiring women to engage with the criminal justice system when they are not ready to or the proof problems the committee has been hearing about.</p><p> On foetal anomaly, we are trying to think about what is the best way of achieving legal criteria to implement the Citizens' Assembly's objectives.  In a sense, often we have conflicting objectives.  Here we are trying to avoid a stigmatisation around disability or vulnerability, for example.  People have concerns that we stigmatise disability or vulnerability if we specify "foetal anomaly" in legislation .  The idea is to avoid the legal stigmatisation by recognising that those are circumstances which can generate a risk to health and the ground is one that is focused on the woman or pregnant person rather than one that is focused on the anomaly of the foetus.  Again, a code of practice would be used to make that clear.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Naughton's line of questioning, if nothing else but decriminalisation happens, how does Dr. Fletcher see the situation developing?  Would it be legislation to protect the medical sector?  Alternatively, would it be left entirely to the medical sector?  Would that be wise given the litigious nature of our society nowadays?</p> <p>  Abortion on-request with space for ongoing counselling has been raised and provision appears to be urgently needed in respect of counselling.  Some countries have it and some countries do not.  One of the things adduced at this committee in the past couple of weeks was that in some situations the pregnant woman changes her mind during the course of the pregnancy.  How does one determine at which stage in the pregnancy it is correct to proceed in a particular fashion and to go for termination or not to go for termination given her natural tendency to change her mind in the course of the pregnancy?</p></speech>

As with any medical procedure, people often need a chance to deliberate and think about their options.  The question does not point to any concerns that apply specifically to abortion care.  I guess it is a question around consent and when a decision has been made about a particular health care treatment.  If the person has not had the treatment, he or she can withdraw the consent or change his or her mind at any point.</p><p>That is a normal part of engaging in health care options.  The whole point of consent in health care is that one has the right to change one's mind.  It is part of the deliberation counselling process and this deliberative process is supported by counselling and good information.  Once the pregnant person comes to the point of making a decision and going ahead with the treatment, that is the key point at which the consent operates.</p></speech>

I emphasise the need for counselling and professional support for women who have a crisis pregnancy.  A considerable percentage - 46% - of people who had an abortion had concerns afterwards, ranging from feelings of being alone to being isolated, feeling lost and sad, etc.</p></speech>

The responses include feeling relieved, satisfied, happy, pleased, guilty and sad.  A total of 10% said they felt confident and almost 10% were empowered but there were also feelings of loss.

This means we need good quality counselling services and support measures and there is, through the HSE, public funding of counselling and support, both pre and post abortion care.  This can be built on as the abortion care service develops.  There are different regulatory tools for different purposes and public funding of counselling and information would address the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

I read his document on prenatal counselling but we have been deprived of the opportunity to ask questions of people who have a different view and it is extremely unfortunate, particularly in the context of what Dr. Fletcher said.</p> <p>  I reiterate what Senator Ruane said as to the usefulness of giving us advice on how the State might proceed if there was a referendum, either to amend or repeal the eighth amendment, because we do not yet know what the wording is going to be.  Dr. Fletcher suggested we should proceed on the basis of a new piece of legislation rather than trying to amend previous legislation.  Can she expand a little on that?</p></speech>

It might be simpler to repeal it in its entirety and replace it with a new Act and this would satisfy the basic objective of simplifying the statutory structure.  A second reason is that the transition from a legal regime which has taken an exceptional approach to abortion care - in that it is only available when the life of a woman is at risk - to a system which allows abortion on request, to some extent, is a major one.  They are two very different regimes so the transition would be better marked by adopting an Act that did not have limitations relating to life-saving exceptionalism as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act has.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

Decriminalisation came with the striking down of the criminal provisions by the Supreme Court.

There were two elements to it.  Undoubtedly, a change to the Constitution was envisaged by the assembly.  I hope that it will be a straightforward repeal, although that decision has yet to be made, even by this committee.  The second phase related to legislation and it cannot predate the referendum.  The assembly identified a number of issues, for example, rape and incest, which we have discussed in the committee, that are incredibly difficult to incorporate into law.  The on-request provision would take care of some of that up to the first trimester, for example.  However, incorporating it afterwards means it could be provided for if there are other sets of circumstances.  What are the other circumstances one would have to provide for specifically to cater for that?</p></speech>

The circumstances where somebody is pregnant through rape and is distressed and vulnerable and does not want to continue that pregnancy clearly can constitute a risk to her psychological health.  It is to continue the pregnancy against her will in circumstances where she is pregnant through a violation in that way.  There are different circumstances.  That set of circumstances relating to her experience of pregnancy through rape can constitute the risk to health.  That would be the legal ground specified in the legislation.  The rape circumstance is the risk to health legal ground in statute.  Then there would be a code of practice or regulation to join the pathway between the two.</p></speech>

We have a history of the term "real and substantial" operating as a barrier.  To the same point, if one adds something such as "serious" into a ground like risk to health, that could potentially become an obstruction or barrier in respect of what counts as serious.  The empirical research on pregnant people's reasons for abortion at later stages tells us that they have very serious reasons, by and large.  We do not have an evidence base that would suggest a need for requiring that seriousness in statutory language.  It is there already in the practice of abortion seeking.  That is one reason we do not need it.  The more negative reason is that it can operate as a restriction or barrier in some instances.  If we want to move towards a policy and practice which is led by removal of barriers which might have an impact on the health and human rights of pregnant people we should avoid qualifying language such as "serious".</p></speech>

A number of questions have been asked already but I wish to raise a few matters.  The witness has given a good insight into how some or all of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations might be recommended.  We can probably take it as a given that even if we did not implement some of them, new legislation will require that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act will have to go.  I wish to explore the decriminalisation issue.  That is the only legislation on the Statute Book at present that criminalises abortion outside the narrow circumstances where there is a danger to a woman's life.  It would be necessary to remove that legislation, therefore it is not legal or illegal.  It is just there.  The regulation of the abortion pill would be through normal health regulation of products in a pharmacy or how all of that is regulated for and administered by one's pharmacist, nurse, midwife or whatever.  It is a little like the morning after pill.  It would be part of the health service, not with conditions laid down in law.  It is just a medical product that is licensed in Ireland.  Could that be done in the context of getting rid of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act post-repeal?</p></speech>

One of the options would be to repeal the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and to integrate abortion care into existing regulation.  There is much to be said for that.  Given that it is a big transition and that it will have an impact on the professional delivery of care, a statute would lay out things such as the guarantee of access.  We are used to thinking of legislation as being restrictive but we could switch and think about legislation that can be promotional of good practice.  That would be the reason a statute might be a good thing to replace that Act, to make it clear that it is a reproductive health statute, to decriminalise and to promote public provision.</p></speech>

We have a great deal of evidence, and we know ourselves, that nobody wants women or practitioners being criminalised for this.  Access is a key issue.  It has been a thread today.  Even for people who might have reservations and who would say they are not in favour of unlimited access to abortion, the best way of guaranteeing access is through early availability for the first trimester.  Perhaps the witness would elaborate on that point.  I believe Senator Mullen was a little unfair to her earlier in the comments about her point, which was, in effect, that this would respect the view of some citizens on prenatal life.  My interpretation of what the witness meant, although I might be wrong, was that people would view access to abortion on request up to 12 weeks as dealing with what at that stage, as anybody who has had a miscarriage knows, is like a heavy period.  It is a little blood clotting and perhaps a little cramping.  It is not the same as a fully grown woman.  People recognise that there is a difference between that up to the first trimester and a foetus on the point of viability.  By distinguishing in that way and making abortion available on request in the early term one is accommodating that.  Perhaps the witness would expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#Y01300"><p>Absolutely.  There are probably two key points in respect of thinking about how on request models can accommodate different people's beliefs around the value of prenatal life.  One would be where people have a type of gradualist approach, that in the early stages it is not as significant in value as it might be in the later stages.  Adopting an on request model because it makes it more likely that people would access abortion at earlier stages means, in effect, one is achieving that goal of gradualist protection.  Another point is that the lack of access in the prohibition does not have the effect of stopping abortions, so one is not achieving protection of prenatal life when one prohibits it in that way.</p><p>The two work as either side of a coin.  People who do not take a gradualist perspective, whose perspective may be about the symbolic or potential value of foetal life and it would not necessarily vary for them but again it would have less weight than the sentient woman, will be accommodated by a system which balances the different interests at issue by allowing earlier access and fewer obstacles to access in the earlier stages.  I would encourage the committee to think about whether they want to stick with the 12 week limitation, given the variety that is available in other jurisdictions and given the size of the vote in the Citizens' Assembly, which was 44% in favour versus 48% against.  If the Citizens' Assembly got to the point of thinking about how to remove barriers to access and thinking about how to apply an on-request model in various ways, with 44% supporting abortion until 22 weeks, that is a lesson for us in terms of the impact of evidence and public education on support for those models.</p></speech>

I hope to be able to answer any questions which members might like to ask by bringing the benefit of my experience and expertise, and my knowledge of the research in the field of pregnancy and mental health and illness.  I have worked as a consultant perinatal psychiatrist at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street for the past 21 years where more than 500 women attend the clinic each year.  Women are seen who are pregnant or who are in the first six months post pregnancy, which includes pregnancy loss, and where a significant mental health issue is involved.  Women attending may have a previous mental health history or a significant new crisis may develop during or after the pregnancy.  Among those who attend will be many who have suffered a miscarriage.  Others may have had a stillbirth or may have a baby diagnosed with a significant abnormality of varying levels of severity, may have had a previous termination or may be considering a termination.<br/><br/>I have previously spoken as an expert witness at the two Oireachtas hearings which led to the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  I was also invited to speak as an expert witness to the Citizens' Assembly.  I am also an expert assessor for the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK and Ireland.  This involves detailed study of the records of women who have died during pregnancy or in the first year afterwards, as a result of suicide or other mental health causes.<br/><br/>What I can say now after all of these years of working in this area, and from my understanding of relevant research and of history, is that while having a baby is, hopefully, and fortunately for many, one of the most joyful, rewarding and meaningful experiences of their lives, as the committee members all will be aware, it is also unfortunately so often not like this.  The committee members will know this from their own lives, those of their families and friends, and of course, also from listening to many of the stories told here to this committee and to the Citizens' Assembly.  Most of the committee members will have heard of, or personally witnessed, stories of depression or distress, of unwanted pregnancies, of rape, or the discovery of major foetal abnormalities, or of the termination of pregnancies in the UK and here in Ireland.  These are stories heard so regularly in my clinic in Holles Street.<br/><br/>In an ideal world, abortion would never be needed or requested, but even if we exclude medical emergencies and severe life threatening indications, we cannot wish abortion away.  It has been a part of the history of every country, including Ireland, and before it became legally available in the UK 50 years ago, and therefore available for thousands of Irish women every year since, it was illegally available here in Ireland for those who could pay.  Of course, there was infanticide, too, which was such a widespread practice.  I would urge anyone who is unaware of the nature and extent of this to read Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Rattigan's seminal history, <i>What Else Could I Do?</i>, a detailed study of hundreds of cases of infanticide in Ireland between 1900 and 1950, or the work of Dr. Elaine Farrell, who studied 4,645 infanticides in Ireland between 1850 and 1900 and published her work, entitled <i>A Most Diabolical Deed</i>.  Dr. Rattigan quoted a judge in County Clare in the 1930s who described the &quot;epidemic of infanticide cases&quot; he had to hear.  Both studies emphasise that these numbers were an underestimate of the true scale of infanticide in Ireland at that time.  We do not want to go back to an era of illegal back street abortions and infanticide.<br/><br/>In my clinical work, of course, most of the women who I see for whom a termination of pregnancy is an issue are seeing me because of their or their partner's concern about their mental health.  Sometimes that termination could potentially be very damaging for them.  For example, a woman who has a planned and much wanted pregnancy, but who develops severe depression which is clearly clouding her judgment about everything in her life, and not just the pregnancy, keeps thinking she should terminate because she would be a bad or evil mother.  She needs expert help for her depression.  A termination is almost certainly not what she wants and could be very damaging to her mental health long term.  For another, however, she is clear that she cannot continue the pregnancy, she cannot cope and continuing the pregnancy would destroy her life.</p><p>She is in no way mentally unwell but she may be terrified of becoming unwell.</p><p> How any woman responds to a pregnancy is personal to her and how she visualises and imagines what is or is not growing inside her is unique.  For example, one woman who has an early miscarriage will say that what she lost was a just pregnancy for her, not a baby, that she knows it happens in 20% of all pregnancies, and it is just nature&rsquo;s way.  It was just like a heavy period.  For another, she may have a huge sense of loss of a baby, name it and grieve for it, even if the scan actually showed a so-called empty sac, or even if she has had a rare molar pregnancy where there was only ever placental tissue and no foetus but her pregnancy tests were repeatedly positive and she may grieve as though it was a baby.</p><p> These sorts of inner perceptions and beliefs and imaginings that determine so much, and often more so than any biological reality.  It is part of what makes us human.  One woman with a baby with a fatal foetal abnormality may decide that she or they want to continue the pregnancy because she wants to hold on to that baby inside her as long as possible, and she hopes that the baby will die inside her and not shortly after, as it is safe and warm inside of her.  Another will feel she cannot bear to think of the baby suffocating inside her or being in pain, or the distress of it dying inside her.  She loves that baby but she will want a termination and she will love it afterwards.  Another woman will say she wants the baby delivered early and hopefully alive still so that she or they will be able to hold the baby for a few minutes before it dies, and may bring the pregnancy on early for that reason.  As doctors we must be aware of the complexities involved for everyone, and listen and not prejudge.</p><p> I now turn to mental health outcomes after induced abortion and the research evidence in this area.  It has been mentioned by members of the committee and some speakers in earlier sessions.  It is important to note that no significant research on this subject has been completed in Ireland.  Research from the UK, the USA and Australia, for instance, may not be applicable here or may only be in a very limited way because it is different here.  There are many other limitations to most of the research in this area, which include researcher bias, inadequate control for confounding variables and inappropriate control groups, and the failure to control for previous mental health problems.  My advice, particularly for those unused to reading medical papers, is to read any such research in a critical, informed and objective way.</p><p> The best overall publication in this area was by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK which published a systematic review of the mental health outcomes of induced abortion in which they reviewed all of the research evidence available and critically analysed all published research which reached basic scientific standards.  The key findings of this overview of all studies were as follows.  An unwanted pregnancy in itself is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems.  The rates of mental health problems in unwanted pregnancies were the same after termination or after giving birth.  The most reliable predictor of post-abortion mental health problems was having mental health problems before the pregnancy or abortion.  Women who were pressurised to have a termination and women who were exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general and to her personal experience were likely to have long-term mental health problems.</p><p> For any and every woman who might seek mental health advice in this situation, it will be the specifics of her individual situation - her distress, history, and personal beliefs and wishes - and often that of her partner which must be listened to and understood. The research evidence is helpful in general but never specific to any individual life situation.  The dilemmas for women in such difficult situations will always be painful and distressing.  I consider it my responsibility as a psychiatrist in Holles Street not to add to their pain and distress.  I hope the committee will be of the same view.</p></speech>

I will start by drawing his attention to his remarks regarding his not wanting to return to an era of illegal back street abortions and infanticide.  Any reasonable person would shudder at the thought of living in such an era.  Would Dr. McCarthy say that a scenario that is as horrific is that in modern Britain where there is an abortion rate which we estimate is four times that of the Irish rate, if we judge by the numbers of Irish women who go abroad?  In that case there is no protection in law for unborn babies up to 24 weeks and no protection where there is any kind of disability, including mild disability.  Does Dr. McCarthy agree that also presents an horrific scenario to a fair-minded, reasonable, caring doctor if they had two patients in mind?</p></speech>

I am also aware, particularly as a psychiatrist, of the history of psychiatry, women who were pregnant, and the control and often the severe things that psychiatry was involved in and responsible for during their pregnancies.  I do not want to go back to anything in history.  In my practice in Holles Street, my responsibility to anyone who comes to me is to make the best decision for them.  When someone comes to see me, I am certainly not there to encourage them to have a termination if, in helping them to come to a decision, that is the worst thing to do.  Those circumstances would have a very negative outcome.  I am equally not there to bring any personal view to her decision.  From my work in the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths, it was evident that so often, when women kill themselves, they do so while pregnant, sometimes with one baby or two, or there is infanticide afterwards.  There is a hierarchy of ideals.  An ideal is where everyone is happy with pregnancy and everything is wonderful.  If I must have a choice between infanticide, back street abortion and abortion in an everyday way, my hierarchy is to go for the least damaging option.  That is a personal view.  My professional responsibility is to deal with the individual woman before me, and maybe her partner, to help her or them come to the decision that is right for her or them.</p></speech>

They may have a previous mental health illness and want to know if the medication they take is likely to damage the pregnancy.  I have to take considerable time on this.  Sometimes I have to look at medication, the women may not be taking it or they might be drinking or smoking and they are damaging their baby.  I have to spend considerable time thinking about the damage that maybe done to babies in pregnancy.  I have seen women who have taken abortion pills -----</p></speech>

We will move on as we are stuck for time.  That really is the big problem with our work.  Dr. McCarthy referred to research.  We all agree that good quality research is necessary for normal functioning of the law and we cannot ignore it.  I draw Dr. McCarthy's attention to the work of Professor David Fergusson.  I am sure we agree that he is one of the most highly published mental health professionals globally and that he would not have skin in the game when it comes to coming down on either ideological side.  Professor Fergusson has published a piece in 2013 in the <i>Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry </i>in which he reviewed the four best studies from the place which Dr. McCarthy correctly said is the place to go.  Its conclusion was that there is no available evidence to suggest that abortion has therapeutic effects in reducing mental health risks of unwanted or intended pregnancy.  There is suggestive evidence that abortion may be associated with small to moderate increases in risks of some mental health problems, and there are particular circumstances in which that might arise, such as previous mental health history.  That being the case, does Dr. McCarthy agree that it would be unconscionable that any jurisdiction providing abortion would not be in the business of checking if a woman has a prior mental health history, that it would be under a duty to advise of the potential risks if there was any evidence of mental history, and that should be mandatory practice across the board?</p></speech>

It agrees with the basic assessment point I made, namely, that the mental health outcomes after termination or pregnancy are similar.  In both cases, the risk is increased.  Pregnancy itself is a risk to mental health.  The reason I have a very busy service in the National Maternity Hospital is because of the mental health problems associated with the complications of pregnancy.</p> <p>  If a woman has a termination, she is equally likely to have mental health problems and no less or no more than a woman who does not have a termination and goes on to have a baby.  Both are vulnerable.  It is the single most vulnerable time in a woman's life.  A woman is 19 times more likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the first six weeks after the birth of a baby than in any other six-week period in her life.</p> <p>  There are certain circumstances, in particular in the case of women who have previous serious mental health problems, where women are more vulnerable to having problems whether they have a termination or go on to have a baby.</p></speech>

One of the major challenges in my clinic is that many women come to my service who do not want to have any counselling whatsoever.  First, what is a mental health problem?  Is it stress after an exam when I was 15?  Is it somebody who had anorexia?  Is it somebody who had a major depression after bereavement?  Something may have happened ten or 15 years ago.  Are we going to insist that a person has to talk to a counsellor or expert or psychiatrist in some form?  That would be absolutely impossible.  We know from our work that if somebody wants to have counselling, he or she will get counselling.</p></speech>

Counselling is one thing.  Given that there is at least one life at stake, and potentially two, the gravity involved, the culture of informed consent which applies in other areas of medicine and the duty of care involved, surely it is not excessive to expect a basic investigation to see what type of person is before one?</p> <p>  I refer to a study from Professor Ferguson.  The ground has moved.  In 1994, the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that the risk to psychological health from termination of pregnancy in the first trimester was much less than the risks associated with proceeding with a pregnancy which is clearly harming the mother's mental health.  Professor Ferguson described a big shift from that ground of seeing potential benefits to a situation where nobody is now talking about the mental health benefits of abortion.  Rather, it is case equal.  The only question is whether it causes mental health problems in certain cases.  He is very cautious in his studies.  In 2008, he noted that the specific issue of whether induced abortion has harmful effects on women's mental health remains to be fully resolved.  There is a movement away from seeing any kind of benefit on mental health grounds.</p> <p>  Dr. Ruth Fletcher argued that the concept of health should be used to encompass situations like the claim for abortion on the grounds of foetal anomaly or cases of rape, and that health could be used as a grounds to avoid legal stigmatisation.  She stated such circumstances could contribute to a risk to health.  I presume she was talking about mental health.</p> <p>  The work of Professor Ferguson, which has analysed other work, seems to suggest that one does not go there on mental health grounds.  Would Dr. McCarthy agree?</p></speech>

Men go to prison with their violence.  There is almost an attitude nowadays that no matter what happens in people's lives they need counselling.  It is rubbish to suggest that someone who has been bereaved needs counselling.  Most people, following bereavement, want to be silent or talk to their partner, spouse, mother or friend.  They do not need counselling.  After major trauma there is a notion that people need to be debriefed in some way.  The reality is that often a debriefing does more harm than good.  People who want counselling will seek out a counsellor and talk.  People who do not, but are forced to, will tell a counsellor nothing.  The session will be empty and useless and the person will resent it.  In fact, one may do people more harm by forcing them into a process which demeans them.</p> <p>  The women who come to see me in Holles Street for advice want that advice and, therefore, are very open and tend to bring up all of the key questions.  As the committee knows, it will be a very long time before we have enough psychiatrists in Ireland to see everyone.  I currently have 1.5 days a week in Holles Street and have two colleagues in the other Dublin maternity hospitals.  There are no such specialists anywhere outside of Dublin.  The idea that women would have to undergo counselling is impractical.  More truthfully, the idea that every woman who ever had a mental health problem should have that assessed by a psychiatrist before she can have a termination is an insult to women.</p></speech>

Professor Ferguson said his conclusions have important, if uncomfortable, implications for clinical practice and the law in its interpretation in jurisdictions which require abortion to be authorised on medical grounds.  He went on to state his view was that the growing evidence suggesting that abortion does not have therapeutic benefits cannot be ignored indefinitely and it is unacceptable for clinicians to authorise large numbers of abortions on grounds for which there is currently no scientific evidence.  Does Professor McCarthy agree that there has been a shift away from invoking mental health?</p></speech>

I found it fascinating when I read it yesterday.  I was particularly struck by the history of infanticide in our country.  I was not aware of it and it is another indicator of what a dark place this country was for women for so long.  It is to be hoped we are involved in a process which will move us all to a better place.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I am tempted to repeat one line from his presentation, namely, "We cannot wish abortion away".  Some of us may need to think about that.  He said that fears about the enactment of the 2013 Act would lead to significant numbers of pregnant women trying to fool clinicians into granting abortions by threatening suicide have not been borne out in real life and were never going to be.  Could he speak a little more about that, as a professional in the area?</p></speech>

When I spoke before the Seanad in the sessions that led to the development of that Act, I know people were saying there would be bus loads of such people.  I remember being asked if buses of psychiatrists would be coming in from elsewhere or women would be queuing to come to psychiatrists and lie to us or fool us by saying they are suicidal, etc.  I put it on the line and said it was ludicrous and it would never happen.  In the years since the Act was established, I have seen one woman in Holles Street in that circumstance.</p> <p>  There was the idea that women would somehow invent these stories but the women I see are genuinely distressed, whether they have a termination or keep the baby.  It is a genuine and real problem.  They are in desperation by the time they come to see somebody like me.  There is the phrase, "Sometimes the world is more full of weeping than you can understand", and it might be over my office door because of some of the stories I hear.  The idea that pregnant women would come in to see psychiatrists to fool them into thinking they are suicidal is not how it works in the real world.  It was somebody's fantasy that this would happen.</p></speech>

Is that a good thing?</p></speech>

I see women who come back afterwards as well, and they have a level of distress.  The committee has heard the stories and I do not need to repeat them.  How could any human being react listening to women describing taking the boat rather than the plane and bringing the foetus in a bag?  I will sometimes have seen them before the termination.  They will show love for the foetus and have a photograph of it.  It is a baby they loved but this was the only way for them to deal with the matter.  They are hurt, outraged or upset that they had to go to the UK.</p></speech>

How is the 2013 Act working?  I know this was not part of Dr. McCarthy's presentation but it is relevant for decisions we must make on legislation.  Do the current procedures under the Act provide dignity to patients?  Are they workable across the country?  Do they ensure pregnant women and girls who may need an abortion due to risk of suicide would be able to access the service?  Are they necessitated and could another pathway be considered?</p></speech>

My views on abortion, to a certain extent, do not matter as the women I see who are going to have an abortion are having them anyway.  It is such an irrelevant question for me in my practice.  The women will have it here, buying their tablets on the Internet, or they will travel.  I do not even think about what is happening in the UK except that people have to travel there.  They are losing their babies anyway.  It is happening.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, as he knows there have been very few such cases.  A woman has to see two psychiatrists, who have to agree, and one obstetrician.  If everybody agrees on the case, that is it.  It is a problem and I know cases have been highlighted where things went very poorly.  Some of the psychiatrists who saw patients in those circumstances had never previously dealt with a mental health problem in a pregnant women or seen women in those circumstances.  Some of the decisions made led to court orders and various other processes because those who did the assessment never did the work in a daily way before.  Of course, there is no adequate provision of psychiatry services around the country.</p> <p>  Fortunately, there is a perinatal mental health strategy that is about to come out and it recommends that there should be full-time psychiatrists in every large maternity unit in the country.  It argues there should liaison psychiatry at least part-time in every maternity hospital around the country.  It is coming.  Fortunately, I was right in that the demand was never going to be there; it has amounted to a trickle.  Some of those women have had very faulty assessments as those who saw them had no training in the field.</p></speech>

When I read it I could tell how person-centred it was and I appreciated how human it was as well.  I am sure that translates into how the witness treats women when they come to him.  I got some solace from that in reading the presentation.  Senator Gavan posed the questions I wanted to ask so I will some comments instead.</p> <p>  Senator Mullen upset me when he used the words, "what type of person is before one".  I am not really sure what that meant.  The Senator said in reference to someone arriving and having mental health issues, and whether the person would have had mental health issues before arriving.  The phrase used was "what type of person is before  one".  I do not know the Senator's intent.  I took it to mean that if a person has a mental health issue before coming pregnant, somehow this would undermine the woman's capacity, as a person, to have autonomy and view of life and who she is.  I did not appreciate it.  As a woman and mother who sought help during my second pregnancy from the witness's counterpart in the Rotunda, I found the comment very distressing.  I will stand corrected if the intent was not there but I suggest that the Senator read the debate.  He referred to "what type of person is before one".  She would be the same person and the continuity remains the same.</p> <p>  If caring about women entering an office and women's health in general is ideological, I thank the witness for his ideology.</p></speech>

I thought I was being reasonably clear.  Senator Ruane has responded in a personal way and implied some kind of motivation or attitude in me that certainly is not there.  How can we have a fair process here if, once one has finished trying to respectfully elicit information and answers, one is attacked in a frontal and emotional way by a colleague?  It is making a farce of this procedure.  Anybody listening would know of my bona fides in my line of questioning.  It would be a great regret to me if Senator Ruane was upset but I cannot remember anything I said that would have been objectionable.  I was trying to deal with complex mental health grounds for abortion and people with a history of mental health issues being particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>  First, I clarify there was certainly nothing of bad intent in what I say.  Second, I should not need to make such a clarification.  To be taken on in this way by a colleague with no chance other than by seeking a point of order to respond does not auger well for this process.  We have had problems of this kind on countless other occasions.</p></speech>

I found the content of some of what was said quite disrespectful.  I do not intend to get into a row with anybody about it.  In fact, the more people who see it, the more the disrespect is evident.</p><p> With regard to the perinatal mental health strategy, we appreciate that it is to be introduced.  That will require a significant amount of investment and upskilling of personnel.  It is also going to require access right across the country.  We would welcome the fact that it is on its way but what we are discussing is the grounds as laid down by the Citizens' Assembly.  One of those is the mental health of the pregnant woman.  As things stand we are clearly struggling in that area.  It is true to say there is a huge amount of compassion and it is radiating from the evidence we have heard.  That is very much to be welcomed.</p><p> Does Dr. McCarthy agree with me that the added stress and trauma for a pregnant woman in terms of what the 2013 Act places on her is compounded by the lack of resources?  While we are considering the issue around access to termination on the grounds of mental health, we must also consider the resources and the implications for that.  That is going to be important for us.</p><p> We are considering risk.  I have asked this question of every single witness.  I appreciate that I usually get the same answer but it is important that we have it on the record.  My understanding is that it is quite tough for us as legislators using legalistic terminology to hand the medical professionals a piece of paperwork and ask them to make medical decisions based on it.  We use terms such as "grave risk" and "serious risk".  Will Dr. McCarthy indicate whether such terms are in use in the medical profession or is it more likely that there is just risk, that there are not categories such as "grave" and "serious"?  What kind of terminology is used?  I am conscious that what we are doing is trying to devise a legalistic framework, but when that is finished, we hand it to the medical profession.  How easy will it be to translate that?  I am conscious of the 2013 Act and the necessary complications that arise out of that, and the fact that all of the available evidence suggests, as was pointed out by a lot of people in advance of it, that it is fairly unworkable for most people.  We know the result of that.  We use legalistic terms in listing the gradation of the risk.  Is there anything we can do to help to translate that for practical use?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#HH00200"><p>First, I will make a brief response to the first part of what Deputy O'Reilly said, which echoed what Senator Ruane said.  Just because a woman has had a mental health problem in the vast majority of cases, it does not in any way affect her capacity to make decisions for herself.  That is the response to the question on capacity.  In the vast majority of women it is not a question of capacity whatsoever.  I wish to make that point.</p> <p>  As regards the 2013 Act, as I said at the outset, before the legislation was enacted, the reality is that for the vast majority of women who are depressed and suicidal in pregnancy, they do not want a termination.  However, the vast majority of women who want a termination are not depressed.  They do not need to see a psychiatrist.  For the majority of those women who are depressed in pregnancy and want a termination, they are not going to go through an Irish process.  Why would they?  They are going to go to the UK anyway or they are going to order pills over the Internet.  Even if there were psychiatrists all over the country, most of them do not feel they need to see a psychiatrist.  Most of them do not think they need to see one psychiatrist let alone two psychiatrists.  That ill was the result of saying that, whatever about general medical illnesses, in terms of psychiatry it was not going to be about serious risk or moderate risk but about one issue only, and that was the question of suicide, the probability that a woman was going to commit suicide, and if termination was the only possible solution for that, then it followed.  Therefore, it is no wonder that for the vast majority of women in this country it is an irrelevancy.</p> <p>  Suicide at least was at the extreme end.  On the idea that psychiatrists or anybody - psychologists, counsellors or parliamentarians - would discuss the gradations of a woman's mental health, that would be an impossible one for clinicians.  When we are talking about mental health, we can accept a clinician trying to make the best estimate possible over a suicide risk, but bringing it down to an assessment of a woman's mental health, bar excluding the very small group of women who may not have capacity, for the vast majority of women the idea that we could have some system where they all had to go to see a psychiatrist to have a score on their mental health is not going to work.</p></speech>

I am aware of a number of stories where abortion turned out to be a bad decision for the woman involved and where it carried long-term psychological after-effects.  Many personal stories have been told to that effect.  One well-known public story is that of Miss C who was brought to England as a minor for an abortion and then spoke publicly about how much she regretted the abortion.  Sometimes a person thinks they know what is best for the vulnerable person in question but the decision turns out to be wrong.</p> <p>  Does Dr. McCarthy think women considering abortion, in particular those predisposed to mental health issues, should be told about the possible negative consequences of abortion before the procedure takes place?  Am I correct in saying that does not happen at present?</p></speech>

I have seen women who have had long-term mental health problems following abortions.  Every time I think about that, I think of particular individuals.  I have seen huge numbers of women who have had abortions and that has not been the case.</p> <p>  The vast majority of women are aware that an abortion could be negative to their mental health.  The vast majority of women struggle with that and they are ambivalent.  Those who have mental health problems already are the ones who are most aware.  They are also aware that if they go on to have a baby, there is a risk to their mental health.</p> <p>  I was perhaps being slightly mischievous with Senator Mullen in asking whether we should get women to see a psychiatrist before they ever get pregnant.  To a certain extent it is the same question.  There are women who regret not having had a termination.  There are women who regret the failure of the morning-after pill.  There are women who regret both.  Most people have the knowledge that an abortion may be damaging to their mental health.  That is often the reason for their ambivalence.  In terms of the idea that there is a message out there that abortion is good for one's mental health always, with happy smiling faces, that is not how it is on the ground.  There will always be people who will regret serious decisions.  Becoming pregnant is a very emotional time.  A straight answer as to whether women should be aware there are potential mental health difficulties following abortion is, yes, of course, as there are after pregnancy.</p></speech>

I do not do that.  The women who come to me are aware from the beginning.  They are seeing me because of concerns about their mental health or because they have a mental health issue already or they are incredibly distressed because they have just discovered they have a baby with a fatal foetal abnormality or whatever the circumstances might be.  They are very distressed already, so I am there helping them to weigh it up, but those who are seeing me know that already.  I cannot say what happens in every single pregnancy advice centre but there certainly should be a general awareness that an abortion presents a risk for the woman.</p></speech>

Dr. Ferguson clarified the position on his research on our national broadcaster four years ago.  The man who is continually quoting him says the interpretation of Dr. Ferguson's data is that abortion is bad for mental health.  Dr. Ferguson stated that he had completed a review of the evidence and his view was that there was no evidence that abortion mitigated any mental health risks of unwanted pregnancy.  That was based upon a review of the limited research and he said that the first point was that the research was not particularly good and any conclusion drawn should be made cautiously.  That was his major conclusion; he could not find any evidence of benefits.  He went on to say that abortion does not improve mental health of women and, has no mental health benefits and poses more risks for unwanted pregnancy.  That is on the record.  Dr. Ferguson also said that research has found that abortion has no therapeutic value in reducing the mental health risk.  Instead, the evidence suggests that abortion may be associated with an increased risk of some mental health problems.  Dr. Ferguson said that statement was true.  He found that he compared women who had an abortion with equivalent groups of women who had unwanted pregnancies or intended pregnancies, the women having abortions had slightly higher rates of mental health.  Basically, what he said about his study was that there are limitations in it.  My take is that Dr. Ferguson is not happy about the conclusions that have been continually drawn by certain groups on his work to be drawn on his work.  It is important that when someone is being quoted as saying X, but is actually saying Y, then it has to be called out.  Anyway, I thank the professor for coming in to us.  It has been helpful and in particular his statement has been helpful to me.</p> <p>  The Child Care Law Reporting Project published known facts recently in the case of a pregnant girl who sought an abortion under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act on the suicide ground.  Instead, she was briefly detained under the Mental Health Act.  Ultimately, she was denied the abortion she requested.  It appears that, instead, her pregnancy was terminated via early induction or delivery.  This is being claimed by some groups as a good outcome.  These are people who want to retain the eighth amendment, even though it was determined that it was indeed her informed decision to end her pregnancy.  Does this raise any concerns for Professor McCarthy?  As a psychiatrist, is he concerned that medical professionals might err on the side of caution and end up detaining women under the Mental Health Act if a health ground were placed in law?  Does Professor McCarthy think that forcibly detaining and interring women is a good solution for health professionals and women?  How could we mitigate that risk?</p></speech>

It is a pretty good study but it has major limitations.  As I highlighted, almost every study has serious limitations.  That is why the meta-analysis or systematic review done by putting everything together came out with the conclusions.  The conclusion of that study and the first part of what Senator Mullen said is that abortion is not good for women's mental health - but neither pregnancy nor marriage are good for women's mental health either, as we know.  We have to know these things.</p> <p>  I heard the same interview with Dr. Ferguson on "Morning Ireland" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 when he said that his study was being selectively quoted.  There was nothing actually that I could hear from what Senator Mullen said that he was selectively misquoting.  Dr. Ferguson said we should not take too much out of the study.  He said there were major doubts and gaps.</p> <p>  In my opening statement I referred to the notion of control groups.  This is the single biggest flaw.  I am unsure how many of the scientists here do research.  Anyway, what do we mean by control groups?  I was trying to think of an analogy.  Let us suppose I did a study on people who get lung cancer and I examined whether they got stressed and whether that caused the lung cancer.  Let us suppose I asked all of them whether they got stressed before they got lung cancer.  I would find that 80% said they were stressed before they got lung cancer.  We might think in consequence that stress equals lung cancer.  However, if we have not compared those who smoke to those who do not smoke, we completely miss the key fact.  Many of these studies are not looking at comparing only women with unplanned pregnancy or women who have been pressurised to have a termination.  In other words, it is not comparing the key or important variables at all.  It is altogether selective.  It does not even examine the gestation of the pregnancy.  Many other factors are involved that are missed in the vast majority of studies.  Dr. Ferguson was honest.  He pleaded for people not to quote him suggesting the conclusions were absolute fact.  He was being misquoted.  The actual words Senator Mullen used today are in his study, but there are major flaws to it.</p> <p>  Deputy McConnell asked about a particular case.  Obviously, I cannot talk about specific cases, but a woman cannot have a termination of pregnancy past 24 weeks.  There is a responsibility for all doctors to consider the health of the foetus.  Of the few cases that have arisen, I am aware of one case where a woman was actively seeking a termination and was detained.  Actually, she could not have a termination anyway, because she was past that term.</p> <p>  We only detain a woman if she has lost her capacity or if she has a mental illness.  I was not involved in that case but, as far as I understand it, if the woman did not have a mental illness, then it was absolutely wrong to detain her.  First, I have no doubt that those involved in the circumstances almost certainly do not work in this area.  Second, they were highly anxious.  If a woman is hitting her stomach with her hands, literally pounding into her stomach, and saying that she wants a termination of pregnancy, then people will sometimes not be able to stand back.  They may panic and take the view that they must do something and then decide to use the Mental Health Act.  Psychiatry has a dangerous history in that regard, one I am acutely aware of.  Anyway, that is a major error.  If a woman does not have a psychiatric illness &ndash; this girl clearly did not and that is why the court lifted the order shortly afterwards - then it was a major mistake to detain her in the first place.</p></speech>

That was being quoted here but we do not actually know the official rate.  It is important to clarify that point on the figure.  Technically, we do not know the rate here.  It is being bandied around here.</p></speech>

I too found it interesting.  I could see the humanity in it as well, something I appreciate.</p> <p>  Professor McCarthy quoted from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK.  He noted cases of women who are exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general and whose personal experiences are likely to have worse outcomes.  I have said before at this committee and elsewhere that I accompanied a group.  It was around the time of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  I went to Liverpool Women's Hospital with Doctors for Choice Ireland.  It was specifically around the area of fatal abnormalities.  I got some indication of the way women were treated in that hospital and environment.  They were treated with great humanity and care.  That made me feel very ashamed because they did not get that here.  One person who was on that visit asked whether there was a difference between Irish women and women from the UK in how they were treated or how they felt.  The instant response from the people who took care of those women was that what differentiated Irish women was that they felt judged.  I suspect that is exactly the same whether it is a fatal abnormality or a requirement to leave the jurisdiction.  They feel different by virtue of the fact that they were forced to leave the country.</p><p>Those strongly negative attitudes and presumably the very fact that people have to leave the jurisdiction would feed into those poorer outcomes.  Would that be a fair assumption and does the witness see people when they come back who would express views like that afterwards?</p></speech>

We have to be careful about what we might think as human beings and what research evidence states.  The research evidence that is based on tends to be from the United States where people are going into clinics where there might be crowds outside abusing them as they go in and where there may be threats as they go in.  The research evidence is in that.  That is the general attitude coming across.  In terms of the individual ones it is very clear that particularly pressure from a spouse to have a termination can be a problem if an individual does not want one.  Equally, a very strong family opposition to it, when a person still goes ahead, can be damaging.  That is at a very personal level.  I am not aware of any study that has been done specifically looking at the Irish question.  Do I hear people in my office saying that?  I do not see that many coming back.  One woman said it was bizarre, it was dreadful, here she was terminating her much wanted baby and she thought it was going to be the worst day of my life but compared to the many weeks beforehand it was an extraordinarily kind occasion.  She said it was almost lovely the way she was cared for and looked after, and people were so non-judgmental.  She was comparing it specifically to how her family had responded to it.  Yes, at human level I can say that.  I do hear those stories but the research evidence is from America.</p></speech>

With the small size of my team it would be impossible beyond that.  We also sometimes see women even before pregnancy particularly if they have a major mental health problem or mental illness and are concerned about pregnancy and concerned about the medication they are going to have.  We do see women even before pregnancy or maybe they have had some particularly difficult stillbirth before or a sudden infant death.  Breaking it down, there are so many different categories that I would not give the figures here.  We will see people for up to six months afterwards including if it has been a miscarriage or a termination or a stillbirth.  We will be compassionate about that as well.  It does not necessarily stop exactly at six months.</p></speech>

I am not sure how important numbers are in all of this in terms of the reality of the work that I do.  The reality of the work is that the women I am seeing who decide to have a termination of pregnancy - and many as I say do not - are going to the UK to have it.  I have not yet met a woman who has not had a termination because she had to stay in Ireland.  I have not had that experience.

I was making a flippant comment.  When we look at what is good for people in their lives - some are looking into it - we note that pregnancy in general is not good for women's mental health.  Termination is not good for women's mental health, but it is no worse and no better than pregnancy.  I was flippantly adding that if we were to have women assessed for their capacity before consenting to decisions in their lives, be it to have a termination, get pregnant in the first place or even get married, all of which have negative consequences for them, the psychiatrists would be very busy.  The research does show that the mental health of women in general - not in the case of the Deputy, obviously - is best when they are single and worst when they are married.  Men's mental health is best if they are married and worst if they are single.  That is the research evidence.</p></speech>

It was amazing to compare the lives of women and what it was like to live in Ireland with an unwanted pregnancy before the 1967 Act with what it was like afterwards.  Dr. McCarthy rightly referred in his presentation to the 1967 Act as the Irish abortion Act.  Without it, we would never have had abortions in this country.  It was illustrated that this was an island on which there was no access to abortion services.  There is a limited number of abortions.  There are variations on a theme across Europe.  If one were in Poland and needed help, one could get on a train and travel to Germany or Austria.  In Ireland, being an isolated island that was poor for a long time and which is now quite wealthy, we are still in the Dark Ages.  I will definitely read the studies and thank Dr. McCarthy for pointing me in their direction.</p> <p>  Anecdotally, I believe there have been more ways than one to skin a cat in the history of this country.  I was on a walking holiday in County Donegal learning the names of plants in the Irish language when I noted there was a lovely little plant that traditionally had been picked to make a tea in order to abort an unwanted pregnancy.  This has been occurring for hundreds of years.  The plant had a beautiful old Irish name and I brought home lots of it if anybody wants to have a cup of tea.  I am letting anybody who needs help know about it.</p> <p>  I want to quiz Dr. McCarthy about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and the barrier of two psychiatrists and an obstetrician a woman has to get through if she needs an abortion because she is suicidal.  Dr. McCarthy has mentioned that most psychiatrists, or some of them, had never done this kind of work.  By that, I believe he meant they had not seen pregnant women with mental health issues.  That is the professor's job and he has been doing this work in Holles Street with hundreds of women every year.  The psychiatrists who are now doing this work under the Act would not have been used to it.  Is the Act fit for purpose if practitioners such as psychiatrists are doing a job they never did before in very serious circumstances involving women whose lives are at risk?  Obviously, if one does a job for a long time, one gets used to it, but if one is starting from a position in which one is not used to dealing with pregnant women with mental health issues who request an abortion because they feel suicidal, it is a different matter.  Does Dr. McCarthy believe the Act is fit for purpose if the two psychiatrists whom a woman must see are not used to the work, given the stretched resources available in the country?  Do the psychiatrists have a choice in doing that work?  Are they forced to do it?  Are they told on the day by the HSE that they must interview two women who are suicidal because they are employed by it?  Can they opt out if they do not want to do that work?</p> <p>  Rather than going to two psychiatrists and an obstetrician and having to go through the hoops and over the jumps the ridiculous Act has forced on women with mental health issues, would it be easier for a woman to travel to Britain to have an abortion?  Who, in the main, has to go through all of this?  Is it girls?  Is it women who are below the age of independence or women who are not capable of having financial independence?  Is it very poor women?  Is it refugee women, in particular, or women in direct provision accommodation who cannot leave the country?  Does this reflect badly on the country?  As well as penalising all women by not giving them a choice in respect of their own reproductive systems, we further penalise a cohort of women, particularly those who cannot leave the country because of their immigration or refugee status.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.684" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017110800002#LL01900"><p>There were a few questions, but I will start by talking about having a sense of humour.  I am sorry that Deputy Mattie McGrath has left.  Having a sense of humour is very important in my job.  After talking about a very distressing matter, being able to share a joke and a laugh is sometimes one of the best things we can do.  Even laughing and joking after some painful losses, including pregnancy loss, is part of the process.  It is a little like being at a funeral; people will laugh and joke.  That is part of the human response in situations such as this.  It is healthy rather than something about which to be offended, I hope.<br/><br/>Obviously, the legislation was enacted at the time with the best of intentions to try to deal with all of the results of the directions of the European Court of Justice.  It was trying to address some of the issues involved.  Mental health issues had to be involved and, in those circumstances, suicide was the most controversial aspect of the legislation, as the Deputy knows.  I remember being on radio at one stage when there was a suggestion there should be 12 professionals involved.  One of my children says it was a relatively proud moment to see my name on an <i>Evening Herald</i>poster on Pearse Street.  It read: &quot;Psychiatrist calls this idea a joke.&quot;  I believed originally that the figure of 12 was a joke.  The number was eventually reduced to three.  All along I said there were simply not enough people available to do the work.  I questioned how it would work and how it would be appropriate.<br/><br/>There is an acknowledgement that there are not enough psychiatrists in the country.  Of course, there are psychiatrists.  The three Dublin maternity hospitals have part-time psychiatrists.  The major unit in Cork has a liaison psychiatrist who does a lot of work in this area.  Throughout the country, however, there are very few.  The requirement is that a psychiatrist must have treated a woman with mental health problems in pregnancy to be allowed to do this work.  He or she has to be a consultant and to have treated a woman.  That is the pragmatism of the legislation based on the problem of having enough people.  Of course, there are not enough people available with the required training.  A requirement was included afterwards that they be trained.  One of the key issues is the nature of the training provided.  There is none working in maternity hospitals.  I might see a woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy but who will have no idea of gestation or the difference between an emergency caesarean section at 24 weeks and the scar that will be on her body and a different procedure altogether if she waits a few more weeks.  She will have no idea of various things.  Equally, the assessing doctor will not either.  The amount of experience and time it takes to deal with that issue is considerable.  There is simply not enough training provided and not enough people used to doing this work.  For all of the theoretical training, it is actually a matter of practice.  I learn every day from the patients I am seeing.  That is how we learn.  Unequivocally, the system really does not work.  Since it is so clumsy, the vast majority of women will come nowhere near us, appropriately so.  It is just an unnecessary and unhelpful procedure.  Therefore, women have to travel.<br/><br/>I do not have a breakdown of the very small number of women who find themseles in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred.

He said that over the past 21 years more than 500 women attended the clinic each year.  That goes back quite a long way.  Would societal changes and attitudes to abortion have affected how women can talk about it?  Has it changed how they feel about asking for or considering a termination?  We know from opinion polls that attitudes have changed.  A few of us here campaigned back in 1983 and we have seen a difference in public attitudes.  Would that be reflected in Professor McCarthy's experience?</p></speech>

They would come into the hospital and say they had one child or no children.  On the second or third time I would see them, they would then tell me about a termination they had.  Now, I am much more likely to hear such information at the very beginning.  Of course there are changes.  When I first came back, women with fatal foetal abnormalities got no information and got no support from my obstetric colleagues.  Now there is a completely different culture and attitude towards that.</p></speech>

I presume the research was carried out in countries with very liberal regimes.  We heard evidence today that Ireland, Andorra and, I understand, Malta are the only countries in the vicinity which have very restrictive regimes.</p> <p>  Professor McCarthy, quoting women's personal experiences, said women who were exposed to strongly negative attitudes towards abortion in general were likely to have worse outcomes.  My question may be unfair, but I will ask it.  Would it be fair to say a very restrictive abortion regime, where there are constitutional provisions almost preventing women from having choice, would portray a very negative attitude towards women who wish to choose whether to have a termination?  </p> <p>  Would it be fair to say that in very restrictive countries where abortion is almost impossible to obtain that would have a more detrimental effect on a woman's mental health if she then chose to have an abortion?  If somebody had to travel or obtained pills on the Internet and had an abortion, would a restrictive regime be a factor in somebody's mental health?</p></speech>

I would not want to generalise, but it is for the individual person and whether she is really thinking in that way.  What is really likely to matter is the views of those who are close to them or if there was some really publicly severe opinion.  What comes out in research is that if her partner or a family member is really critical of them, that can be very difficult.  If there is an argument, and sometimes I will witness argument and a lot of conflict from a parent or from a partner, that is likely to add to the emotional distress that is involved.  This research has never been conducted in Ireland, but we have American research looking at those going to abortion clinics in the US, where there is very public protest with people outside these clinics protesting and trying to stop abortions.  For the person who is desperate or wants a termination, that sort of protest will not help them, or help their mental health.  We know that if women have a mental health problem as a result of that experience, even in any future pregnancy, that mental health issue may become relevant again.</p></speech>

One of his comments was why would any woman want to put herself through the process of having to go before a panel and almost have their mental health questioned.  If we were to get to a position where we had a more liberal regime for terminations, where mental health was one of the grounds for it, I presume that analysis would stand no matter whether we had terminations in all circumstances.  If somebody had to go before a panel of psychiatrists and almost prove that she had mental health issues, does it make a difference whether it is a very restrictive or a very relaxed liberal regime?  I do not know how one would deal with having to put a woman through a process that is obviously going to be distressing for her.  From the evidence we have heard today, would it be correct to presume that one of the ways one would deal with it is by on-request terminations up to a certain period?  What would Dr. McCarthy's opinion be in terms of women's mental health?  I presume Dr. McCarthy would say that it would never be good to have a woman almost have to prove her mental health status before she could access a termination, regardless of whether the regime is very restrictive or very liberal.</p></speech>

When someone comes to see me or any psychiatrist, the first and most important element will be the relationship in the room.  Can that person talk to me?  Does she feel heard and listened to?  That is the key starting point.</p> <p>  I attended a lecture some years ago given by Professor Aidan Halligan, who was an Irish paediatrician and the deputy head of the NHS in England.  Speaking about medicine, surgery or any specialty, he said that the first thing any patient attending any doctor wanted to know was whether the doctor cared.  If the doctor cared, then it was likely that the patient would be heard.  Even where there was a cardiac complaint, the patient would know that the doctor was listening.  The doctor would take a proper history and hear the person's story.  If a doctor is not interested, he or she will miss things and, often, the patient will not tell him or her things.  This is particularly the case in mental health.  For someone to tell me personal, difficult things about herself, her history, her feelings and her previous experiences requires a sense of trust.  If that appointment is imposed on her or I approach the matter in some judgmental way or bring my personal attitudes or history to it in either direction, it will be a failure of an appointment.  Insisting that a woman go through a particular process where she must see a series of psychiatrists, or even just one, when she is clear on the situation in her own mind will be a waste of an appointment and abusive of her and she will be unlikely to talk about what matters because she is being forced into a situation that is not helpful.  It would waste her time and my time and be damaging.</p></speech>

It has been most helpful.  I apologise for missing some of it, but I had to speak in the Chamber.  Since some of my questions may have been answered, I will try to move through them quickly.</p> <p>  What percentage of women suffer from perinatal mental health issues during or post pregnancy?  Is there any indication of that figure?</p></speech>

In general, 11% of women get what is called postnatal depression.  It is not a thing, but a label to highlight that after the birth of the baby is an extremely vulnerable time for a woman's mental health.  It is a peak time for many reasons.  I could spend an hour telling the Deputy about why it is such a poignant and vulnerable time for women with mental health problems.</p> <p>  According to some research, if women are asked to fill in a questionnaire during pregnancy, a higher percentage, perhaps 20%, will say that they are struggling.  The most important message is that there is no decrease in mental health difficulties during pregnancy.  In general, between 5% and 7% of women will have a significant mental health problem at that time.  That does not lessen or increase overall.  It may get much worse for an individual woman but much better for another.  After the birth of the baby, the figure increases to approximately 11%.  They have what is called postnatal depression, but for 3.5%, it is a serious problem.</p></speech>

If we do not intervene, then the mother is badly depressed or anxious and not getting help, which can have a negative effect on children.

She may have had a major mental health problem previously, for example, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD, anxiety, depression, etc.  For others, something new might emerge during pregnancy, for example, anxiety or depression.  It could be any mental health difficulty.  Some women will start drinking in pregnancy.  Some will cope in unhealthy ways.  For example, I have had patients tell me that they stopped taking their antidepressants because they were fearful of damaging their babies, but because they could not sleep at night, they were drinking four glasses of wine.  Women who may have controlled their eating disorders suddenly become pregnant.  The challenges to their bodies, such as the challenge of having something inside them, can trigger a relapse of a serious problem.  Women who have managed or controlled their obsessive concerns may become completely obsessed and suffer a relapse of OCD during pregnancy that affects their anxiety and checking behaviour, perhaps because of reducing their medication or the responsibility of something being inside them.  They are checking movements multiple times.  They cannot sleep at night because they are double-checking, triple-checking and worrying about it.  Maybe they have had a foetal loss before and cannot relax during pregnancy because of that.  Maybe they are depressed.  There are a range of issues.</p></speech>

I could be here all day discussing this.  It will be attached to the national maternity strategy.  If its recommendations come true, we will have mother and baby units around the country.  We will have psychiatric services, not just involving psychiatrists, but also psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.  We will have teams in maternity hospitals, which would be good.</p></speech>

I am unsure as to when they would attend.  If they anticipate a pregnancy, would they have access to perinatal psychiatry at that stage to plan the medication aspect?  It is a major concern for some women who have an ongoing mental illness.  How is that managed?  At what point do they move over to perinatal psychiatry?  Do they need to be pregnant?  What is involved in the planning?  I would be interested in Dr. McCarthy's comments.  For people with existing conditions, for example, bipolar illness, which is manageable in many cases, anxiety about reducing or going off their medications during pregnancy can cause their illnesses to return, etc.</p></speech>

In the mental health area, particularly in complex medical regimes and specifically when there are complicating obstetric issues, women very often want to get specialists' advice.  Some of my colleagues will sometimes want me to give specialist advice.  To answer the Chairman's question, we see a small number of women before pregnancy specifically to provide this advice.  Some women may already have obtained this information when they became pregnant by googling it or looking it up on a website.  They may be perfectly happy with the local services available and may not feel a need to see me.  Others will definitely want to see me, particularly those who have a bipolar illness and are on lithium.  These women need very careful change monitoring.  The change dynamics of pregnancy and the change in renal function - all sorts of issue in pregnancy - make the situation much more complicated.  It is very much individual to the woman who will make up her mind, with the advice of her doctor, etc., on whether she should come to see us.</p></speech>

I return to an issue which was raised with me earlier.  Letters may be read into the record in limited circumstances only, as, for example, in the case of Ms Cora Sherlock where clarification was necessary.  I am reliably informed that it is a matter for the Chair, rather than individual members, to decide how correspondence is handled.  I have proposed that the correspondence in question be placed on the committee's website.  That is my decision and it is one on which I will not be challenged.  Individual members may not demand a decision or question the decision of the Chair.  This applies to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and all committees.  If any member wishes to table a substantive motion in respect of a ruling of the Chair, he or she is free to do so, provided he or she gives adequate notice to the committee.  That is the position.  My sincerely held view is that if someone is scheduled to attend and subsequently decides not to do so, it is not appropriate to read statements from him or her into the record.  If we were to allow this, many people would not attend meetings.  I have made my final decision on the matter.</p></speech>

Section 10 inserts a new section after section 128E to provide for the introduction of a new share-option based relief for employees of SME companies, namely the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  It is designed to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises in the recruitment and retention of key employees.  It provides for a more advantageous tax treatment of gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options acquired in SME companies.  Where the KEEP applies any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying share options granted during the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023 will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will however be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.</p> <p>  There are a number of conditions.  For example, the share option must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant; the share option must be held for a minimum period of one year before exercise, with limited exceptions; and the option must be exercised within ten years of grant to avail of this programme.  Monetary limits apply at both company and employee level.  The commencement of the programme is subject to EU State Aid approval, which I expect to issue shortly.  Recent developments with regard to the employment and investment incentive programme make it even more important that the KEEP programme is effective in meeting its policy objective.  With this in mind, the scope for further adjustments to this programme is being examined.  Last night I flagged that I may bring further amendments to this on Report Stage.</p><p>However, I should emphasise that any such adjustments would require State aid approval, and I need to strike a balance between what is desirable and what I can make happen.</p></speech>

We do not expect that cost to be realised next year.  We expect that the setup period for many companies will be, perhaps not prolonged, but into next year.  Beyond that, when the scheme is ongoing, the cost will be approximately &euro;10 million.</p></speech>

Regarding the size of the companies, this programme applies to employees of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as defined by the European Commission.  Medium-sized companies, according to the European Commission, are relatively big in an Irish context.  They can have up to 250 employees.  Therefore, there could be a relatively big company employing, say, 249 staff, with a turnover of &euro;200,000 per employee.  That would be at the upper limit of employees who could qualify for KEEP.</p></speech>

The two main criteria in this regard are that the enterprise must employ fewer than 250 persons, as the Deputy has just said, and that it must have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million or an annual balance sheet in total not exceeding &euro;43 million.  In addition, we have laid down a number of trading activities which will be excluded from the KEEP incentive.  This relates to transactions that would be speculative, dealing in commodities, some professional services, dealing in development of land and a few other areas.</p></speech>

I have seen an example provided by Mazars which shows that someone getting &euro;10,000 in share options at &euro;1 per share, exercising that option when they are worth &euro;3 per share and selling them when they are worth &euro;4 would save &euro;3,150 in tax.  The maximum share option per year under the scheme is &euro;100,000, with a maximum of &euro;250,000 over the course of three years.  That means that the maximum an individual could benefit in tax on a yearly basis through this programme is &euro;30,150.</p></speech>

It is a tax expenditure, so there is a cost to us for doing it, but much of the engagement we have had with small and medium-sized companies that are active in particular sectors within our economy point to the fact that companies far larger than them have share option schemes that they are able to fund by their scale.  They have indicated to us that a scheme such as this would be very helpful in supporting the retention and development of staff within smaller companies, in particular within Irish indigenous companies.  This is why we think this scheme has value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.808" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01000"><p>Does the Minister accept that the impact of the scheme is likely to be regressive?  One could, in theory, be a low-paid employee and get share options, but it is not very likely.  Those who avail of share options are more likely to be middle to higher income earners and, therefore, the effect would be regressive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.809" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#C01100"><p>My experience, having dealt with this issue in recent months, is that the availability of share option schemes has changed within our economy.  It rarely includes, to be fair to the Deputy's point, people on low incomes - I acknowledge that - but one of the developments that has occurred is that it now includes more and more middle-income employees, depending on the kind of industry they are in.  I think we saw share option schemes in the past as being forms of compensation for senior executives, but it is now the case, particularly within companies that are active in the digital economy, that they are being used, for example, to incentivise engineers and software designers, people who would very much be seen as middle-income earners and who are operationally vital to companies.  Those companies then use these schemes to try to retain those employees for the long run.  We have a growing amount of feedback to the effect that it is difficult to do this if one is below a certain level.  Companies that are below a certain level in scale tend to be more likely than not indigenous.  Again, that is why we are doing this.  However, the Deputy is correct in what he has said, that is, that this scheme will more than likely apply to people on middle incomes and above.  The only exception I can think of is if someone were to join on perhaps some form of graduate recruitment scheme.  Such schemes could include programmes such as this.</p></speech>

A qualifying share option is defined in the section.  They are new, ordinary, fully paid up shares.  Preferential shares are excluded.  These shares constitute a share in the equity, a share in the ownership of the company.</p></speech>

When we discuss the relevant section, I will get more information for the Deputy on this point, but I would have thought that in the vast majority of cases, this would be granted to companies that are quoted in some way because, of course, this is a share-based scheme, and in order to have a share the company needs to be quoted in some way.  I will get information for the Deputy on this matter as we go through the section.  I have been informed that it can also apply to companies that are on the junior market.</p></speech>

The full amount of the allowance can therefore be deducted in the first year rather than over the standard eight years.  The scheme is designed to improve energy efficiency among Irish companies and sole traders and assist Ireland in meeting our national targets and both binding and non-binding EU targets and energy savings.  The scheme was due to expire at the end of this year, and I am simply extending this scheme to 31 December 2020.</p></speech>

I am not opposed to its extension but I want to look at how he is making this judgment.  It is provided for in the Finance Bill that a scheme will be introduced with a deadline; the deadline approaches; lo and behold, the deadline is extended.  I cannot recall when a scheme in the Finance Bill that was supposed to end actually ended.  Deadlines are more or less always extended.</p><p>What was the rationale there?  What was the rationale originally for ending the scheme at a certain point and now continuing it?  As we approach December 2020 we all know that it will, more than likely, be extended again.</p></speech>

When I reviewed all of these allowances with my officials in advance of the Finance Bill, I received advice that this scheme was of help in delivering energy efficiency goals for Irish companies and the continuation of the scheme would support the delivery of that policy objective.  That is why I made the judgment and the decision.</p></speech>

As schemes are extended over and over again, we send a message to companies that while there is a deadline and a scheme, for example, will not be available after 1 January 2018, in reality history shows that these schemes will continue on.</p></speech>

By putting it down for the end of 2020, I recognise that the end date of the scheme is still quite a bit away.  The experience I have of such schemes is that at times, there can be changes in technology and in how the allowances are used.  It is helpful to have a point at which the scheme could end, to facilitate a review of it.  That is the thinking behind this.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked earlier about the cost of the scheme.  The annual rebate for this scheme in 2015 was &euro;1.1 million for 65 claimants.  That was the cost of the scheme at that point. </p></speech>

We have had a lot of conversation around the housing crisis and the emergency the State has gone through in recent years, despite the fact that the Government fails to admit that it is an emergency.  There is a huge number of vacant homes across the State in areas where there is high pressure for housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has, for quite a considerable period, called for a vacant home tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, is leading the charge on this, among many other issues.  It baffles me that we have not seen any progress on a vacant home tax during budget 2018.  I am not arguing that every vacant property be taxed as a vacant home but at a time of huge crisis in the State and in areas of high housing pressure, it is immoral that there are vacant homes while 3,000 children and 5,000 adults are living in emergency accommodation.  In the past few months, Irish citizens have died on our streets.  People who are homeless are being forced to survive in the elements.  We need incentives to get vacant homes back into operation.</p><p>The previous section, which we discussed, contains minor incentives such as allowing pre-letting expenditure to be written off against rental income.  This is welcome and we support that amendment but it does not go far enough.  We need to take out the big stick in respect of the properties lying vacant in inner city Dublin.  The State needs to send a message to investors that if they leave their properties vacant at a time when there is massive pressure on the housing market and on supply, the State will tax them.  This amendment proposes that within six months of the passing of the Act, a report would be prepared and laid before the D&aacute;il on the subject of the introduction of a vacant homes tax.  The amendment takes this form because the Opposition is not allowed to table an amendment to immediately introduce a vacant homes tax.  If we had that ability I would have tabled an amendment to that effect.  It is important the Minister and the Government move on this without delay as we have had enough announcements.  We need serious action and I cannot understand why we are not considering a vacant home tax at this point in time.</p></speech>

In response, a key objective, identified in the fifth pillar of the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is to ensure that existing housing stock is used to the optimum degree and it focuses on measures to use existing vacant stock to renew urban and rural areas and meet housing needs.  While building new homes is a key action, another effective way to meet our housing needs is to bring vacant and under-utilised properties back into full use.  Vacant properties are an important source of potential accommodation supply as they are typically already served by existing infrastructure.  Their reuse has the potential to reduce the number of additional new homes required and to renew both the urban and rural areas of which they form an intrinsic part.</p> <p>  As regards specific measures taken by Government to tackle vacancies, action 5.1 commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy, the publication of which is expected shortly.  Action 5.9 commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas of ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  A multidisciplinary working group, led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be working to bring greater clarity to the regulatory requirements that apply and to advise both industry and local authorities on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of under-utilised older vacant buildings in the context of the regulatory requirements.  At local authority level, it is considered that there is scope for some early actions and in August 2017, all local authorities were required to designate vacant home offices and to draw up vacant home action plans to identify the real scale of vacancy in their areas, to set an ambitious but realistic target for which vacant homes could ultimately be brought back into use, whether for private sale, rent or social housing purposes, and to engage with owners to this end.  The first of these action plans were submitted to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last week.</p> <p>  Other initiatives include the repair and leasing scheme; buy and renew scheme; and the Housing Agency acquisition fund.  Many other approaches have been considered by Government in tackling vacancy issues.  On the possibility of introducing a new vacant homes tax, a strong rationale would be needed.  It would also need to be demonstrated how exactly such a tax would achieve and deliver the desired outcome.  Proof would be needed as to how its public benefit would, for example, outweigh rights contained within the Constitution.  The fairness and proportionality of such a tax would need to be carefully considered, as would necessary exemptions, lead-in times, collection and many other issues.  Bearing in mind such complexities and the consequences of tax impositions, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government sought legal advice from the Attorney General and that advice is currently under consideration.  Consideration is also required as to the involvement and co-operation of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and the implementation costs.</p> <p>  As there are multiple aspects to a vacant homes tax, I therefore oppose this amendment, which commits to laying a report on the matter within six months.</p></speech>

This was supposed to have been done months ago.  The Finance Bill is going through and there is no mention of a vacant homes strategy.  The three initiatives the Government has set in train for vacant homes are all welcome but they are minor.  They target some 6,500 vacant homes over a period of six years, which is 3% of vacant houses in the State.  It is not an adequate response to the crisis we are facing.  I urge the Minister, his Department and the Government to wake up to the realities that are out there.  Other actions need to be taken to deal with this issue.  There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State and 35,293 in Dublin alone.  However, there are 3,000 children and 5,000 adults in emergency accommodation.  When will we take out the stick to incentivise people to put their homes back into use?</p> <p>  The Minister said we needed to look at the constitutional rights of property but there is no bar to us applying a tax on a category of homes, and I do not need to be the Attorney General to say this.  We have a tax on the majority of homes in the form of the property tax, and prior to that we defined a certain category of homes, which were non-principal private residences, and applied a tax to them for a number of years.  It is completely lawful to tax houses not occupied by the owner just as it was lawful to tax houses which nobody occupied.</p> <p>  There needs to be an incentive for individuals to put their vacant stock back into use and a number of schemes can assist them in this but as it is not happening fast enough, we need a vacant home tax.  It should apply to houses vacant for six months or more within local electoral areas, LEAs, in which there is a high level of housing need and a high level of vacancy.  It would have to include exemptions for holiday homes, homes in probate, fair deal homes and so forth but it is not beyond our ability to design a scheme.  The rate would need to increase year on year.  The site tax is a similar idea to get vacant sites into use.  We are critical of the site tax the Government introduced as it left it too long, the lead-in period was too long and the rates were too low but it does increase, thereby giving an incentive to people.  Getting sites into use would be very welcome but the turnaround time would be long.  Even if an owner sold a site to a developer today, there would be a two-year lead-in period before somebody turned the key in the door.</p> <p>  We accept that a cohort of the 35,000 vacant properties in Dublin will not be suitable to be brought back into public or private use but a large proportion are suitable.  We need to introduce measures now as this is an emergency.  The Minister said he would come up with a report but he has already failed to meet his own targets.  Considering these matters without any clear commitments is not good enough.  I stay in a hotel in Dublin while I am here and every day I come into work I pass people who stay in the same hotel.  Every day, they get their kids ready for school, put their uniforms on and take two or three buses to get to their primary or secondary school.  What we have done to people in this State is horrible.</p><p>We cannot fix that overnight but this finance committee can bring in measures that would provide some light and comfort for those families.  We were elected to have the power to introduce a vacant homes tax and to encourage the 183,000 owners of those homes to bring them back into use.  Why are we not doing it?  I cannot, for the life of me, understand that.  The Minister needs to give me a good reason for not introducing a vacant home tax now.  This is not day one of the crisis - it has been going on for years.  The Minister has not given me a reason for it.  All the amendment seeks is a report.  It states: "The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a vacant home tax."  It does not even commit the Minister to introducing a vacant home tax but it tries to force the Government to bring forward a report on the vacant tax for Members to have an informed discussion on the subject.</p><p> I would prefer the Minister of Finance to go further and say he will not tolerate 8,000 of our citizens being in emergency accommodation, or people dying on the steps of this building.  He needs to send a clear message to landlords who are hoarding empty properties that, if they do so any longer, we will tax them.  This tax should increase if they do not bring their properties into use within one year and there should be another increase after two years.  This is an emergency and it requires emergency measures but nothing of this type is coming from the Minister.  The Minister should send this message not just for the benefit of landlords, but for those who find themselves homeless in this State.</p></speech>

We had a report on a specific area of corporation tax which was carried out by the academic, Seamus Coffey, and I suggest something along those lines.  The data need to be collected and identified.  There is a particular problem with commercial premises across the country, where the ground floors have not reopened and the upper floors are empty.  There are complex issues with banks which are pursuing the owners of such premises but I am sure that, in many towns and cities, a significant percentage of upper floors can be utilised.  There is not much of chance of it, however, in the context of what we know of the complications with the banks.  I support the idea of a report but I do not see where the resources are to get a meaningful report that will set out the actions that could be taken to address some of the issues.</p> <p> In the RT&Eacute; programme earlier this week, it was very clear that, in two or three of the worst cases where there were large numbers of people, the ground floors and rears of the premises in question had been commercial premises.  Rackrenting landlords had cleared out the bottom floors and crammed in bunk beds, resulting in incredible abuse.  I ask the Minister to come back with proposals and additional staff, or to set up a commission overseen by somebody like Seamus Coffey.  The statistics from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment show that there are vacant, boarded-up premises in towns all over the country where people might want to rent them and it would be useful to do something along these lines.</p> <p>  I make door-to-door calls around my constituency in Dublin and I am not sure the figures reflect what is available in my constituency.  There are serious problems for many families as regards the HSE where a relative is in hospital but intends to come home again.  Often this is not realistic and these are sensitive situations but something can be done to address them, despite the complex legal, technical, personal and family issues.</p></speech>

There are delays in the probate process.  I am dealing with individual cases and currently they are taking months.  A report during the summer stated that it was taking 16 months for probate to come through, but the properties in question remain vacant in the meantime.  We need a breakdown of the 183,000 properties regarding those that are in the fair deal scheme and those that are in probate or caught up in legal disputes, of which there are many.  Receivers are in control and we need the data urgently.  Deputy Burton is right to identify the issue of upper floors.  Within a ten or 15-minute walk of this place one will find hundreds of properties on upper floors and over offices which are vacant and not being brought into use because of ridiculous planning rules.  These are under our noses in Dublin city centre and they need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I live in and represent a constituency which is afflicted by this and I represent families who are dealing with the trauma of not having a home.  I see it with my own eyes, and represent the people affected by the tragedy of not having a home or a stable roof over their heads from which they can send their children to school, in which they can cook dinner or help with the homework and where they can do all the other things families do who have their own homes.  I am well aware of the incredible distress families are facing in this regard.</p> <p>  Last week, I said that I take the figures for the number of children at risk from poverty in our country as seriously as the economic indicators on what is happening with bond yields or unemployment rates.  I am well aware of the challenges this poses to our economy and the unacceptable cost it imposes on society, families and on mums and dads and their children.  I am doing, and will continue to do, what I can do as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the issue and this is why, next year, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, led by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will receive an increase in resources.  It is in recognition of the fact that we have to address the issue that, in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, the Department to receive the largest increase in its share of capital funding is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  I have said that we should move away from the State acquiring homes in the private market to building them via our local authorities and through other means.  I also want this issue to be dealt with and it is not accurate to say no action is taking place.  It is also unfair and inaccurate to say nothing is being done in relation to vacant homes.</p><p>I have already told the committee that by the month just gone, all local authorities in the Dublin area had to come back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with a vacant homes action plan to deal with this issue in local authorities with the powers that are available to them.  As part of that, if there were additional measures we need to consider with regard to the issues and difficulties we have on all of this, that will also be done.  </p><p> I will return to the amendment the Deputy has tabled.  Let me talk about the statistics that are available to us and some of the challenges those statistics generate.  For example, if we look at where we were between census 2011 and 2016, the stock of residential properties across that five-year period increased from 1.994 million to just over 2 million, which is an increase of 0.4%.  The number of vacant properties fell in that period.  It is at 183,312 units at the moment.  The number of holiday homes went up and most of the reduction in vacant properties has been in urban areas where we saw a decrease of 35,000 units.  The information available to us at the moment, which is information from the CSO, indicates that there are lower vacancy rates in the larger urban areas.  If I look at who owns those vacant properties - this moves into the issue Deputy McGrath just raised - the information we have is hard to come by but it indicates that over one third of vacant properties are owned by citizens over 60 years of age.  Potentially, the largest owner of this stock is our elderly and there are all kinds of reasons that property might not be in use.  If we look at the change I have referred to, over 105,000 of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now occupied.  Of those, more than half are now rented out.  Close to 40% are owner-occupied.  In the urban areas that I referred to a moment ago, up to 70% of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now rented and over half of those are by families with children.  There has been a change in the number of vacant properties between then and now.  Action is being taken by Government to deal with this issue such as the action plans I referred to by county.  That information has been shared with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the past week.  </p><p> I will address the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy is not asking me to consider the introduction of a vacant home tax.  He is asking us to introduce a report within six months of the passing of the Bill on the introduction of such a tax.  We have many challenges in terms of understanding how many homes are vacant, why they are vacant, who owns them and for how long they have been vacant.  The challenge for me is that to give an indication that this tax will be brought in without answering all of those questions first will yield further issues and questions that would have me back before the committee pretty promptly.  I will not commit to that principle until I am clear about how I can handle those matters.</p><p> Deputy Burton made a fair point.  There is information, most of it from the CSO, trying to help us to understand this issue.  More work needs to be done on this by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with which I will help it.  I want to bring this work to a conclusion as soon as possible.  There are policy issues that need to be conclusively addressed to allow me to make a final assessment on whether there is a role for a vacant home tax.  Until those questions are finally answered, I cannot commit to that principle.  Where I will not yield any territory is on the commitment to ensuring the trauma of children and families in hotel rooms and those who are homeless is dealt with conclusively.  That is what I want to see happen and I will see it happen.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot commit to the principle of the introduction of this tax because there is work under way already on how the issue could be dealt with at local authority level.  There are too many matters I want to resolve before I can commit to that principle.  I want to resolve those matters.  I want to be in a position where I can come back to the Oireachtas or committee and answer conclusively the different questions being put to me regarding the information that is available. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.861" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#G00200"><p>The Minister pointed out to me and the committee that he is fully aware of the homelessness crisis.  I accept that, although ignorance would not be a defence anyway.  Being fully aware of it and then taking no action or not taking the appropriate action makes it even worse.  The Minister gave us figures about how many vacant homes came into use between 2011 and 2016.  During the Minister's time in Cabinet, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and now as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the homelessness and housing crisis has gone out of control.  More children and adults are in emergency accommodation and more people are homeless and dying on our streets under the Minister's watch.  The Minister and his Government, through the decisions of Cabinet, have tolerated the homelessness crisis.  This is not an act of natural disaster.  We do not have a homelessness crisis as a result of a tsunami, an earthquake or an act of God.  We have it because of Government policies which stopped the building of social housing or did not adequately funding social housing.</p> <p>  The Minister will talk about the package that was given in this year's budget.  Not one single social house above the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney's targets of this time last year will be built as a result of the money the Minister has provided.  The Minister tells us he understands and I am sure he does; I believe he is a compassionate person but compassion needs to go a bit further.  The Minister needs to act because there is a crisis.  The Minister says he does not need to be lectured about it.  We do not have the luxury of waiting for another year so the Government can get its act together and start to consider the introduction of a vacant property tax.  The arguments the Minister has put before the committee border on the ridiculous.  He talks about one third of the owners of the 183,000 vacant properties being over the age of 65.  He says that might explain why they are vacant homes.  Even if we disregarded all of those owned by over-65s, we would still have 120,000 vacant properties in the State.  I am not assuming that all of those can be brought into use.  What I am saying is that if a portion of those in Dublin could be brought into use, we would resolve the housing and homelessness crisis at a greater speed.</p> <p>  This is not the Minister's first day in office.  How long has he been in Cabinet?  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, he has been approving decisions by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the previous Minister for Finance that have not gotten to grips with this issue.  Not only have Government decisions not got to grips with the issue, but they have made it worse.  The Minister might not like to hear that because I am sure he has empathy for every person who finds themselves homeless but when he decides on budget day to put a particular amount into tax cuts as opposed to putting it into building new houses, the automatic result is that the family in room 401 is going to be in room 401 this time next month and for months after.  The Minister is unwilling to bring forward a report which looks at the introduction of a vacant home tax.  The Minister talks about considering it.  Although I would disagree, the report could say there is no merit in bringing forward a vacant home tax.  As a member of the Opposition, I am trying to challenge the Government years into a crisis of homelessness and housing.</p><p>I am trying to do so in the only way possible, namely, through the Finance Bill, because Opposition Members are not able to table amendments that would give rise to a cost on the Exchequer.  This is an attempt to force the Minister to take some action by providing certainty that within six months of the passing of the Bill, a report would be produced on the introduction of a vacant house tax.  Such a report would capture all of the issues Members have raised, whether it be the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to apply a vacant homes tax or the data to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred for probate and the different categories of individuals who own the 183,000 vacant homes.  What the Minister is telling us, however, is that it will be business as usual and that no action will be taken in the Finance Bill to introduce a vacant home tax on the 183,000 empty properties.  That is not good enough.</p><p> I make no apologies for telling the personal stories of homeless families, the children involved and what these families are experiencing in terms of their mental health.  I will continue to do so because I still believe the Minister simply does not get it.  We have to ask ourselves what this country has become and who we are as a nation and people.  Why do we tolerate having 8,000 homeless persons and hundreds of patients left on hospital trolleys every day?  Why do we tolerate tax avoidance on a massive scale by major corporations?  While that is the country it has become, it is not what citizens want.  They want the Government to take serious action to address the housing and homelessness crisis.  There are approximately 20 people homeless in County Donegal where the level of homelessness is nowhere near as bad as the crisis level in Dublin.  However, even people in my county who are not touched by homelessness want the problem in Dublin to be sorted.  They have empathy and sympathy and want the Government to act. </p><p> The measure we are seeking is not radical but a small matter of introducing a vacant home tax.  For God's sake, given that we introduced a second home tax in 2010, why can we not introduce a vacant home tax at a time when there is a housing and homelessness emergency?  The Government's refusal to do so makes no sense.</p></speech>

The urgency of a vacant unit or vacant home tax simply cannot be overstated.  Let me put a human face on this matter because often, when we debate financial matters, one only hears dry figures, statistics and so on.</p> <p>  I have a long litany of cases that people in dire circumstances bring to my office every single week.  This week, a young woman in her early 20s came to my office.  She has been homeless with her young child for two and half years.  Her child is now five and half years old.  They have been housed in eight different emergency accommodations, including the Clondalkin Sonas homeless accommodation where there was a fire.  As the Minister will know, one mother and three babies were killed due to the fire.  The young woman who came to my office had been in that hostel and she was very close friends with the woman who died.  She is completely traumatised, as is her son.  She is still in emergency accommodation.  Her son is now in his third school in two and half years.  They are utterly traumatised and they have no idea when they will be housed.  The signs are, given the state of the list operated by the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it could be years.  The woman broke down several times in my office.  She is completely unable to cope.  She blames herself, she thinks she is a terrible mother for putting her child in this situation and pleaded for a secure roof over their heads.  </p> <p>  Side by side with that, close to the emergency accommodation that she is in now, and I highlighted this case before but I suspect that it is the tip of the iceberg, I highlighted recently a block of apartments in Sandyford.  I refer to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally.  The apartments have been owned by NAMA since it was set up.  NAMA has sat on between 15 to 20 empty units since it took them over the loan of the developer.  Recently, NAMA sold the properties to a vulture fund that tried to evict the rest of the tenants.  All the while, between 15 and 20 apartments have been left empty while people like the young woman and her child I referred to and so many others go through a housing trauma.  Could there be anything more urgent than putting human beings, like that young mother and her child, into those empty apartments?  For ordinary people, it is as simple as that.  It is obscene that NAMA sat on those empty apartments.  It is worth saying that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approached NAMA and asked for the apartments but NAMA said no.  The apartments are still empty while there are people like the young woman I mentioned going through hell.</p> <p>  It seems to me that we should set aside the very interesting debates on whether there are 180,000 empty units, as the CSO suggests, or a percentage of that figure.  I do not know whether the percentage is 10%, 20% or 30%.  We have to find out the correct figure, as a matter of urgency.  There are no debates about probate or anything like that but there may be a debate about what conditionality should have been put on the off-loading of NAMA assets or whether NAMA assets should ever have been off-loaded in the teeth of a housing crisis like this one.  Either way it is simply unconscionable that there are perfectly habitable empty units that people like the young woman and her child that I mentioned could live in.  Instead, she is breaking down as a human being.  The damage that has been done to her child is impossible to fathom or calculate.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried to inject urgency into this question, which I echo.  I wish to add that it is just not good enough if the Government does not move, as a matter of absolute urgency, to ensure that not a single unit that could be inhabited by people who are at the sharp end of this appalling housing emergency.  I urge that any obstacles to getting people housed in these empty units are removed, as a matter of urgency.  Whatever measures that have to be taken and whatever taxes or penalties that have to be imposed in order to get those properties for the people who need them must be taken, and they must be taken now, because we have talked about this matter for years.</p> <p>  The amendment is a very modest effort.  It must operate within the constraints of the Finance Bill and what we are allowed to propose.  We cannot propose things that result in a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment seeks to compel the Government to do something about the obscenity of empty units sitting side by side with human misery and human tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister to take the amendment on board and do something about this matter.  </p></speech>

What my track record, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, looks like is an increase in the amount of resources available to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to deal with an issue that is unacceptable to me.  I want to see us, as a society, respond to the crises that have been identified by both speakers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.873" nospeaker="true" time="10:00:00" ><p>I want to make progress and comprehensively address the trauma of families with children being relocated in hotels.</p><p>Deputy Doherty spoke about the human face of homelessness and Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the human face of a case he had dealt with.  I have met families in similar circumstances and seen the anguish this has caused.  I have also heard the human stories but I am also aware of the prospects offered to people when new social accommodation is opened, for example, on the North Strand.  I am aware of the response of local communities to the opening of new sheltered housing units in Broombridge Lodge, Cabra.  I have experienced the response of people to the progress we are trying to make in O'Devanny Gardens, which includes social housing.</p><p>Alongside the human anguish to which Deputies referred and which I have also witnessed first-hand, I have seen the human consequences of housing solutions.  During my tenure as a member of Cabinet, we have delivered 80 housing solutions on each working day thus far in 2017 and we are aiming to increase this figure to 100.  I have provided funding to deliver our social housing targets, including the delivery by local authorities of more than 2,000 new homes, the acquisition of 1,250 homes, the delivery of 380 units through Part V acquisitions and the return to use of 1,400 vacant social homes.  This is being done as a result of the Government's commitment to address the housing issue and my commitment, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the best possible contribution to doing so.</p><p>In 2018, more than 3,800 social housing units will be built directly by the State and a further 4,100 social housing units will be delivered through vacant homes, acquisitions and long-term leasing arrangements.  This is part of the Government's response to the housing issue must be viewed in the context of our expectation that general housing completions will reach 24,000 next year versus 19,000 in 2017.</p><p>These measures are being delivered through Government and market action to increase housing supply and respond to many different challenges, including the crises to which a number of Deputies referred.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of some of the difficulties we are experiencing and the scale of the challenges we face.  He indicated he did not know the answers to some of these problems.  This is because we need to interrogate some of the figures further.  In some cases we do not have figures and we need to fix that.  The Deputy know this but his assessment is that we should proceed with the tax and make a principled commitment to introducing it, as is his right.  As Minister for Finance, however, I cannot make such a commitment until I know how much we will tax, what will be the scope of the tax and what derogations and exemptions we would need to introduce.  If we were to introduce such a tax without first addressing these issues, the Deputy would lambaste me and accuse of incompetence for not addressing them in advance.  That is how this would play out.  Introducing a tax without doing the necessary preliminary work would have consequences and I would face questions from the Deputies asking me to explain my failure to act competently, in the same way as I had to deal with issues in the previous D&aacute;il concerning the implementation of the local property tax.  Deputy Doherty raised issues with me at that time on the local property tax, which it is Sinn F&eacute;in policy to abolish.  Before making such a commitment in principle, I must first ensure certain policy matters are resolved.  A significant amount of work is being done in parallel at local authority level to convert vacant properties to use.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I have set out.  However, I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to rectify and address the different policy issues the Deputies have raised, for example, the issue of data collection which I genuinely need to address.  It is only when I have dealt with these matters that I will be in a position to evaluate whether this tax can be introduced.  As I stated, without doing such work, I will have to deal with the consequences of my failure to do address these issues before the tax was implemented.  Members of the Opposition would raise these consequences with me.  While I cannot accept the amendment, I will table an amendment on Report Stage outlining how the collection of data and policy matters will be crystallised.</p></speech>

I would have expected that the Minister would have seen sense over the summer period and would have ended the help-to-buy scheme.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Instead, despite the fact that the scheme is costing in the region of &euro;40 million per year, the Minister has extended its use.  It is a supply-side problem and this scheme does nothing to deal with the supply-side pressures.  Before I go into any further detail on this, I ask the Minister to outline why he believes it is appropriate to continue with the help-to-buy scheme given that there is no evidence to suggest that it is meeting the intended rationale proposed by the Minister on its introduction that it was an effort to help individuals to gather the deposits required to meet the Central Bank and that it would lead to increased supply.</p><p>This amendment calls for the Minister, within one month of the passing of this Act, to provide a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is my party's view that the help-to-scheme should not continue.  We have opposed it from day one.  It was a scheme that should never have been introduced.  It was done on the insistence of the Minister but with the support, through its policy of abstentionism, of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has literally put money into the pockets of developers and has led in no small way to the increase that we see, year-on-year, in house prices.</p></speech>

The scheme is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new build or self-build properties.</p> <p>  Following its introduction in budget 2017, and as a result of debate on the issue on this Stage of the Finance Bill last year, Deputies will be aware that Indecon Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake an assessment of the scheme.  The terms of reference for this review included an examination of whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.</p> <p>  The review was published as part of the budget documentation on 10 October.  It found that, to date, the incentive has not had a measurable effect on house prices, while it is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.</p><p>The report found that the supply of new homes was increasing modestly.  While the help-to-buy initiative does not appear to have had a direct impact on these supply levels to date, the report also noted it may be too early for this to have become apparent.  On the basis of these findings, and considering that the incentive has only been in operation for less than a year, I decided to allow the measure to continue in its current form for the coming year, subject to it being closely monitored and with a view to taking stock again prior to budget 2019.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of the help-to-buy scheme.  Its reports include the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio, and property type.  It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county.</p><p> My Department reviews taxation measures on regularly as part of the budgetary process.  Given the extensive nature of the Indecon report into the scheme, as well as the detailed statistics on the scheme published by Revenue on a monthly basis and the analyses undertaken by my own officials, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#N00200"><p>First of all, the Minister did not prepare a report before introducing this scheme.  The Indecon report makes reference to that fact and says that it should not happen again.  No evaluation was carried out.  We had a big talk earlier about how homeless families could benefit, but the Minister said that he could not introduce a vacant property tax as he would need all the statistics and so on.  When it comes to putting money into developers' pockets however, the Minister just announces the measure and then carries out an evaluation a year later, an evaluation which basically says that it cannot tell whether the scheme has contributed to supply.  What it says is that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  That is the key issue.</p> <p>  What is happening out there while the Minister is messing about with this scheme and putting &euro;40 million of taxpayers money into developers' pockets?  Let us look at the figures.  There has been a 12.8% increase in property prices over the last 12 months.  Does the Minister know where we are going?  At this point, in November of this year, we have now exceeded the property prices of 2005.  Within two years, 24 months, at the current trajectory property prices in Dublin will exceed the peak of the boom.</p> <p>  Let me tell the Minister what the report said again.  It said that "[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability."  This is a con job.  People feel good when they get this money into their pockets but when the house they are trying to buy, in Dublin for example, at &euro;300,000 has gone up 12.8% in the last 12 months, any benefits are outstripped.  These people's mortgages will now have increased by &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000.  To draw down &euro;34,000 over a 30-year mortgage means one has to pay back &euro;65,000.  It is a complete and utter con job.</p> <p>  This is not leading to supply.  The other thing which the report says is that "[t]he HTB measure does not appear to have had any significant overall impact to date on the level of supply."  It has failed.  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us that this scheme was about supply.  He then told us that it was about helping people to get deposits together.  Lo and behold, a couple of weeks later the Central Bank changed the rules.  What does the report say?  It says that "[t]here is however likely to be some purchasers who did not need the incentive suggesting an element of deadweight and particular affordability issues remain for those on lower incomes."  The report tells us this.  It does not give the Minister comfort to continue with this scheme.  There is no evidence that this scheme is leading to supply.  </p> <p>  As the report says, there is legitimate concern that it is causing inflationary pressures on property prices.  We all know, because the statistics are there in black and white, that there is what is called deadweight in the scheme.  That is to say that the vast majority of people who are availing of the help-to-buy scheme are not those who require the scheme to meet the Central Bank's deposit requirements.  Why the hell is the Minister continuing with a &euro;40 million incentive?  This money goes directly into the pockets of developers.  At a time when there are constraints on supply, additional money provided into the system increases pressures.  Those pressures result in house prices increasing.  That is why we are seeing the type of increases in house prices we have seen in recent months.  </p> <p>  In the last year house prices in Dublin city have gone up by 13.9%.  They are approximately 103% or 104% above the 2005 baseline.  They are 24% off the peak prices.  The Minister should remember that we are on course to return to peak property prices within two years.  This is happening.  What can we do to stop it?  There are many things which we can do, but we can focus on this scheme for now.  As the report says, "there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices".  There is no reason in the world to continue this scheme.  The Minister can bluff and bluster all he wants but, as the report says, there is legitimate concern that the scheme is contributing to that 12.8% increase.  Once these increases happen, it will be very difficult to reduce them again, even when supply increases.  </p> <p>  The Minister is pricing many people in the Dublin market out of house ownership.  People of my generation and younger, people in their mid-20s, are telling me that they will never aspire to own a home.  It is simply beyond their reach.  These are people who are living and working in Dublin.  The opportunities which their parents had are no longer there.  They just cannot see a way forward because of current property prices.  We know where we are going.  House prices are increasing more rapidly now than ever before.  The help-to-buy scheme triggered some of that.  The Minister is continuing with a demand-side measure while there is a serious supply issue.  This does not make any sense on any level and there is nothing in the report which should tell the Minister that it does make sense at a time when house prices are increasing at the current rate and when there is inadequate supply.</p> <p>  I will point to one more issue, which I will come to again later as it relates to other things we must deal with in the Finance Bill.  In Dublin 50% of homes are being purchased by institutions, the Irish Real Estate Fund and so on.  They are outbidding first-time bidders.  These homes are not being bought by first-time bidders.  That is happening because in previous finance Bills the Minister incentivised those funds to snap up the very few houses which are available in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am strongly arguing that the help-to-buy scheme has no merit, that it should be immediately discontinued and, at the very least, it should be monitored in respect of its effectiveness and value for money.  I am putting the Minister on notice.  Just as the Minister is complicit in accepting and normalising homelessness because of his failure to act on a vacant house tax and to provide sufficient resources to build social housing, he is also facilitating the dramatic increase in house prices which will prevent a generation acquiring homes in areas of this city and elsewhere throughout the country.  </p> <p>  There is no point crying about this in a years' or in two years' time when we will all be asking how the hell we got back to peak property prices.  This is what will lead us there.  It will be because the Minister introduced a measure which was not thought out.  He commissioned a report which is inconclusive but which says that there are legitimate concerns that the scheme is a demand-side measure which is having no impact on supply and which also says there is deadweight in the scheme.  The Minister thinks that it is appropriate to continue giving &euro;40 million away on this measure.  It does not make any sense.</p></speech>

The difference in the Government's approach to the idea of vacant sites and the help-to-buy scheme indicates that is not accurate.  Ideology has much to do with it.  The resources will be found for developers but will not be found for building homes directly, which is what is needed.</p><p> Where did the help-to-buy scheme come from?  Who was calling for it in advance of last year's budget?  It was the Construction Industry Federation, which had it in its manifesto.  It did not do so because it thought it would resolve the housing crisis but because it would benefit its members, namely, developers, who will end up with the bulk of this &euro;40 million of public funds every year.  There is no evidence to suggest this is having a positive impact in allowing people to access homes, but the Government proposes to continue to give developers &euro;40 million a year.</p><p> Last year, when the scheme was first presented, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued it would increase supply.  The only way it was ever going to increase supply was by increasing prices.  Accordingly, it has created a rat race for people trying to get on the housing ladder, a race they can simply never win.  They can have the illusion of having access to money but house prices are going up beyond them, still remaining out of access.  Then the money just gets transferred to the developers.  That is what has been happening over the course of the past year.  The sum of &euro;40 million is not a small amount of money, yet the Government proposes to continue without an evidential basis.  There was no evidential basis to start it in the first place, but the Construction Industry Federation called for it and the Government did it.  A report was commissioned but there is still no evidential basis for it and the Government intends to continue with it.  It is quite incredible and it gives lie to the fact there is not an ideology behind what the Government is engaged in.  There is precisely an ideology.  It is about incentivising the private sector to deliver homes by increasing prices.  The consequences of this are more problems for ordinary people and an overheating of the property market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.884" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#O00200"><p>I add my support to this amendment.  The Minister said in his initial contribution that the judgment on the help-to-buy scheme would be the extent to which it did or did not contribute to a rise in house prices.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, brought out a report today which stated house prices have gone up by 12.8% in the past year.  In Dublin, in the past three months, the average house price has gone up by &euro;17,000.  Clearly, any value that the Minister might even ascribe to this measure from the point of view of the home buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular rises in house prices.  The only beneficiaries of this scheme are developers and builders.</p> <p>  In the early phases of the debate about the housing crisis, the cry of developers as to why they could not deliver the supply everybody said we needed was because it was not profitable for them.  There was no doubt they wanted a dramatic rise in house prices and the Government obliged.  The Government is contributing enormous sums of money through this scheme as well as through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to subsidise those who are hoarding land, manipulating prices and lobbying the Government to boost their bottom line and ensure they can make a lot of money out of the housing crisis.  The Government is being dragged by the nose by these people.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity cost to this.  Every cent the Government gives to them is money that does not go into building public housing.  It is not just a debate about whether it is effective, although clearly in its own terms it is contributing to or failing to stop the spectacular rise in house prices.  The other side of the coin is it is money that could be going into public housing.  However, the Government continues, or in the case of HBFI and LIHAF, expand corporate welfare to the very people, the builders and developers, who landed us in this mess in the first place and who, even in the teeth of this extraordinary crisis, are still manipulating it to their own advantage.  It is extraordinary.</p> <p>  I heard an interesting contribution at the Right2Change conference last weekend from the head of the plasterers' union about the cost of housing.  Much of what we hear about the cost of building housing is actually the propaganda coming from the builders and developers.  He helpfully pointed out that when one breaks down the cost of building a house, it is between soft costs and hard costs.  The hard cost of building a house comes in under &euro;200,000.  To physically build a house one needs bricklayers, labourers, electricians, carpenters and the other associated trades.  The other costs are the profit-taking of the developers, the estate agents, the architects, the surveyors and so on.  As he simply pointed out, those costs would not exist if the local authorities were building houses because they already employ all of these people.  Half of the cost of building a house goes to people in the private sector, whereas if they were built by local authorities we would only have the hard costs with most of the soft costs covered by existing local authority architects, surveyors and so forth.  Accordingly, much of the profit-taking would not be necessary at all.</p> <p>  That is the opportunity cost of the Government's approach and its ideologically dogmatic approach of believing the market will solve it when clearly the market is the problem.  Worse, the market is manipulating the situation, and yet the Government continues to feed the monster.  It is inexplicable.</p></speech>

Given the limited time since the measure was introduced, a report inevitably can only represent a preliminary assessment and, in short, the assessment is inconclusive and it is too early to say.  The Government, to use the Taoiseach's words, is admonished for not doing an assessment in advance of introducing the scheme.</p> <p>  The scheme was announced in July 2016, the details were provided in the 2016 budget and it was enacted in last year's Finance Bill.  Indecon only had a short window of actual data on which to base its analysis.  What will the Minister do in a formal sense to ensure there is a proper assessment of the cost-benefit analysis of this scheme?  The measure of success for this scheme is whether it will boost supply.  Is it the Minister's view that the scheme is essential for viability to be achieved and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, for it to be profitable for builders to build houses in a commercial market, or is it already viable in the market, given the way prices have risen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.886" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#O00400"><p>I support this amendment.</p><p>It is important that we receive a detailed report on this matter.  I opposed the scheme when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, introduced it because it did what I forecast it would do.  There is no doubt that it generated interest in the housing market, particularly among younger people who wanted to buy houses before prices started to escalate and who had, perhaps, already accumulated significant savings.  In the Dublin West constituency, there are, as the Minister knows well, many houses being built.  The fact is, however, that the window through which someone in the process of buying could make a gain was less than six weeks because the builders just increased the prices dramatically when the scheme was confirmed.  Prices have been increasing ever since.</p><p> I appreciate that the Minister is now really caught in the cross-hairs in that it is almost impossible and extraordinarily difficult to withdraw a subsidy, particularly one relating to builders, once it is in place.  The Minister should take a deep breath, however, and determine the value of the scheme at this time.</p><p> A more fundamental question arises.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance is significant in this regard.  Does Fine Gael envisage that this country should be one in which it is legitimate to aspire to own one's own home?  There are those who spoke earlier who clearly believe that only local authorities should build houses.  That is a reasonable point of view but the local authorities do not want to build and several Ministers responsible for housing, including the current one, have been trying desperately to persuade them that this is the right thing to do.  For a variety of reasons, local authorities are not really engaged in building, other than in relatively small numbers and through housing associations.  Bearing in mind that we all know Dublin's inner city very well, the problem with the housing association model is that the scale of activity is too small to meet the demand.  The associations' activities are very good.  The associations can be excellent and extremely supportive, particularly of people whose personal experience or problems affect their ability to obtain a home.  If one comes through a period of homelessness, it takes time to recuperate.  It can be absolutely awful for many people.</p><p> I wish to focus on affordability, which is critical in the kind of democracy and society we have.  Let me use the example of a couple, perhaps in the Minister's Department, who have been working for ten to 12 years since graduating from college and who are now earning a reasonable amount of money and trying to save or, in the case of a select few, have access to the bank of mum and dad, thus allowing them to obtain some parental support.  The latter is particularly the case if one is from a middle-class family.  Parents may have valuable property, perhaps on the south side of Dublin.  How can the couple in my example afford to buy a house, particularly if they are married and have children, or want to have children, or if they are in a long-term relationship?  It is an existential question.  It may also be the case for the Minister, but I am constantly involved in conversations with people who spend entire weekends looking at new and second-hand houses in the hope they can beat the escalator that is operating at present.  The new home buyer's grant has driven this to an extent.  The Minister's predecessor wanted to send a signal to the market, and the market got its signal.  Prices were ramped up, but with no thought as to the wider social consequences.</p><p> Figures published recently show that the level of home ownership in Ireland is on a downward curve.  Traditionally, most people in secure employment over a long period, be they working for the council, the Government or a private company, could aspire to buying their own homes.  This trend is really under attack and the figures are sliding.  My question is a fundamental one for Fine Gael, notwithstanding all its rhetoric about ownership.  That figures are sliding is a dreadful comment on a Fine Gael-dominated and Fine Gael-led Government, and there is no sign that the slide has started to abate.</p><p> It is obvious, particularly in Dublin West, which is one of the largest development areas in the State and where approximately 1,000 houses are to be built at several different stages over the next three years, that land values are galloping once again.  This is where there is a problem with structure and in respect of which one must  consider actions one may be able to take and that certainly do not feature in the legislation.  There are a number of quoted property companies.  It is well worth their while, in terms of their stock market valuation, to sit on land because they are making money as they do so.  The young people we all know are locked out of being able to buy, not necessarily at a cheap price but at a favourable one that would allow them to start family life and have the security of having a home.  They will have very big mortgages but we know many families who, with two incomes, can actually manage in this regard.</p><p> Alongside this, there is an enormous need for social housing.  I feel very sorry for the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What capacity does he have to persuade the councils, on their own or together with housing associations, to scale up their activities in order to meet demand?  At any given time in Irish society, approximately 30% of people do not have the capacity to fund the purchase of houses, either because they are in precarious or occasional employment or as a result of the fact that they simply cannot buy a site at a reasonable price if they are in a rural area and have some capacity to self-build, perhaps with family support.</p><p> I have described the model that has been in place.  It was heavily ruptured by the crash and the collapse of the construction industry.  I am really interested in knowing what the Minister intends to do to restart the model.  There are many reports indicating that when NAMA offered apartments to local authorities, particularly South Dublin County Council and the others on the south side, they turned them down.  I include the councillors in this.  The apartments were turned down because, for some reason or another, a number of the areas in which they were located were not deemed to be appropriate for social or rented housing.</p><p> Irish history indicates that, for people on a good income, the rented housing model is not particularly sustainable.  It is a fantasy of the people writing the property pages that everybody should be happy to rent a house as they are in Germany and northern Italy.  If one rents a house in Germany or northern Italy, one can remain in it on an intergenerational basis.  Therefore, one is not turfed out if one's mother or father dies, and one can sustain the rent.  We really need to examine our models.  Could the Minister for Finance tell us a little about how the help-to-buy scheme has helped people other than those who were involved at the very beginning?</p><p>The initiatives the Government has taken are insufficient.  Many are very good, such as the allocation of funding, in which I was involved.  However, it is being spent far too slowly.  It is significant but I do not know what the Minister is going to do to speed up production.</p></speech>

The same types of calls were made prior to this budget and I said "No".  The members accusing me of having some kind of agenda to up the margin and profitability of developers at the expense of trying to help people buy a home are either not aware of or are choosing not to bring up the fact that when I was confronted with demands for the kind of policy choice that could realise that kind of agenda, I said I was not going to do it.  I did that because I will not bring in measures that artificially increase the profitability of some parts of our economy at the expense of genuine measures that can increase supply.  Colleagues who have centred their claims regarding what I am or am not doing on the anchor that I have some kind of agenda of trying to support parts of the construction sector at the expense of increasing supply should look at the decision I made in that instance when I said I would not do it.  The reason for that was because I had no guarantee or credible assurance that it was going to increase supply, nor had I any ability to withdraw the measure if it were to be put in place and to then deal with all the difficulties that would cause, as Deputy Burton touched on a moment ago.  I knew there was a risk that if I put such a measure in place there would be no certainty of an increase in supply and no way of telling what could happen at some point in the future at huge cost to the taxpayer.  Deputies Doherty and Murphy have made all kinds of assertions about my rationale behind this measure and what I am doing but they should go back to what I decided not to do in the face of the kind of claims and arguments that won at other points in our past when this type of issue was being dealt with.</p> <p>  I wish to address the report, what I am doing and the policy choice I have made, which is to maintain it.  I will deal with Deputy McGrath's question regarding how I will evaluate it in a moment.  The scheme is, as all members know, capped at or below just under &euro;500,000.  According to the figures published in the report I made available as part of the budget documentation, 53% of claims or draw down under the scheme are for properties priced at or below &euro;300,000.  A little more than 82% of claims are for properties valued at below &euro;375,000.  The draw down under the scheme is going towards properties we are trying to change the pricing of in order to make them more affordable for our citizens.  The figures I have shared with Deputies show that, for example, 36% of claims were for properties costing between &euro;226,000 and &euro;300,000.  That shows the scheme in its short history has been concentrated on the kind of pricing levels I want to influence and it could have the possibility to continue that in the future.</p> <p>  What is the central reason I have decided to maintain this scheme for another year?  I refer members to the words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said that he wanted to have a scheme in place to try to increase supply.  Given the nature of the market I am engaging with, all members know it would take longer than 12 months or, indeed, the eight to nine months the scheme has been in operation to know if a measure to increase the supply of a particular asset, in this case housing, with all the difficulties and requirements involved in the planning process, tendering and so on, is going to have a supply side effect.  It will take longer than that.  However, those are the price ranges against which claims have been made during the operation of the scheme.  As regards the assertion that the scheme has caused the kind of price inflation we are currently experiencing, 4,487 people, families or couples have accessed the scheme to date.  That is not enough for anybody to make the claim that the scheme is shifting the needle in terms of pricing levels.  What is more likely, as, in fairness, some members have acknowledged, is that the shortage in the supply of housing is affecting the pricing levels that I want to be moderated and move into line with people's ability to afford to buy a home.  Deputy Burton asked a question on that issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty made the point that I am complicit in trying to normalise issues he believes are unacceptable.  As I have said, I want to tackle and make progress in dealing with homelessness to a greater level than we are at the moment, and deal with social issues that are unacceptable.  I hope that one of these days when the Deputy is accusing me of normalising things that I also want to change, he might acknowledge the good things that are happening in the economy in terms of job growth, changes in living standards for some people and improved investment in public services and that I have played a role in those changes.  He is entitled to the view that there are issues with which I am not dealing correctly and I would never differ with his right to hold that opinion.  However, if he believes there are policy choices I am making that are contributing to difficulties, as he does, I hope he would at least have the ability to acknowledge that it is likely there are other policy choices I am making that are contributing to improvements in our economy and society.  There is a strong case for that but I acknowledge Deputy Doherty is not willing to concede that point.  He has accused me of being complicit with developers and in their back pocket.  I have pointed to a decision I refused to make as comprehensive evidence that I am not.  Just because I have a different view to the Deputy on a matter does not mean it is bluff and bluster.  I do not accuse him of that.  I have laid out my argument and the facts available to me to back up my case.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy made reference to a CIF report and the lobbying therein.  He might also acknowledge that I did not implement the main measure the CIF and others were looking for in the budget.  I have pointed to the effect of the scheme on particular price levels.  If this is a supply side measure it is going to take longer than six to nine months to evaluate whether it is having a supply side response.  That is the basis upon which I will evaluate the scheme in the run up to budget 2019.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett holds the view, and it is a legitimate and consistent one, that the State should be building nearly all the houses our citizens need.  His view is that the private sector is not capable of doing that at pricing levels he believes are affordable for the citizens we represent.  I take a different view.  I believe the State should play a significant role in respect of the supply and regulation of houses, which is why a policy shift to local authorities building homes as opposed to acquiring them is the right policy decision to make.</p><p>I also believe many of our citizens want to own the assets they are going to buy.  The private sector does have a role to play in regard to the supply of homes and the State and its institutions have a role to play in regulating that market and in ensuring it is not developed at the expense of the common good.  </p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath asked how I propose to deal with this issue in the run up to the next budget.  By the time I get to the next budget I will have more evidence to help me understand whether this scheme is leading to a supply side response.  This will be one of the key factors in regard to the retention of the scheme.  I refer the Deputies to table 71 of the Indecon report, which shows that 22% of the people surveyed in the context of this report, when asked whether this scheme was likely to incentivise more units over the next three years, responded No.  The remaining 78% responded Yes.  It is, therefore, reasonable for me to wait to see if a supply side response is forthcoming in advance of budget 2019.  </p><p> Deputy Burton asked for my views on housing ownership.  I want to have a housing market in which more of our citizens than is currently the case are able to afford to buy homes, where home ownership is a realisable objective for the majority of our citizens and where those who wish to rent, as is the case in other European markets, are able to rent in a more stable and diverse rental sector than is currently the case.  For those citizens who are not able to do either, the Government, through the local authorities, should be building homes.  We have increased the resources available to local authorities to enable them to do that.  The Deputy made an interesting point regarding whether local authorities are accessing that funding, which is a matter I am tracking.  My experience in the past has been that they have not not been doing so.  However, as indicated as recently as this week this year the local authorities will be drawing down the funding available to them in a way that we have not seen heretofore.  </p></speech>

He is wrong.  I have acknowledged them.  I have supported many of the measures brought forward by him in this Bill, some of which I referred to when I was addressing this issue, particularly the previous measure we discussed in terms of the write-off around returning vacant homes into stock.  It is unfair of the Minister to suggest that I have not acknowledged some of the positive measures he has introduced.  That said, as Minister for Finance and a member of the Cabinet he is responsible, collectively and personally, for the decisions he has taken that have created a homelessness and housing crisis and resulted in house prices escalating at a dramatic rate.  I am hearing nothing from the Minister in terms of plans to stop this worsening.</p> <p>  This time last year we heard from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that house prices had increased by 8% year-on-year.  Since then house prices year-on-year have increased by 12%, which is a 50% increase.  This equates to an increase of approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month in the value of the properties, which is putting the purchase of a home beyond the reach of many people.  Taking account of current trends property prices will reach peak point in the next two years.  This means that at that time house prices in Dublin will be the same as they were in February 2007.  How are we going to deal with that?  Even if house prices do not hit peak they will still be over-valued.  A four bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin costs &euro;440,000.  A 12% increase will put that house beyond the help-to-buy scheme because it will be close to or exceed the &euro;500,000 threshold.  This is where property prices are now.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the issue of the VAT reduction and I responded that it was a daft idea.  It was a daft idea.  I do not think the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is daft.  It knows exactly what it is doing.  Of course, it would have bagged the VAT reduction if it had been agreed.  What the CIF did in this regard was a lobbying ploy.  It raised the issue at a time when the Minister was reviewing the help-to-buy scheme.  When the CIF engaged with the Department of Finance last year the first item on its agenda was the help-to-buy scheme.  Because of public pressure and because every economist worth his or her salt is saying the help-to-buy scheme is not working and it is contributing to house price inflation there was speculation that it would be abolished or significantly changed.  The response of the CIF was to make an even bigger demand - a daft demand in my view - that it knew would never be realised and Fianna F&aacute;il rowed in behind it, as it has traditionally done in terms of the construction sector.  The CIF put a little political pressure on in relation to a demand it did not believe it would get to ensure the first item on its agenda, the help-to-buy scheme, was secure and lo and behold the Minister fell for it hook, line and sinker.  When it comes to negotiations one creates demands, all of which one does not expect to be met but help to secure one's main demand.  This is as old as day itself.  That is what happened.   Does the Minister genuinely believe we should be patting him on the back for not giving in to the CIF demand for a VAT rebate?  Does he not know he was played?  He mentioned he did not agree to it because he could not guarantee it would lead to an increase in supply.  He also cannot guarantee the help-to-buy scheme will lead to an increase in supply.  I am not the only one saying that: it is also stated in the report.  The Minister said that the withdrawal of the VAT scheme would cause problems.  The withdrawal of the help-to-buy scheme will also cause problems.  The Minister also said that he cannot measure the affect of increases in supply from the VAT rebate because of the lead-in period.  The same applies in respect of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is due to expire at the end of 2019.  </p> <p>  There is no reason this scheme continues.  The Minister stated that draw-down is in the region of &euro;300,000.  This scheme is available not only in Dublin but across the country.  House prices in the west are increasing at a higher rate than in they are in Dublin.  House prices in the north west are increasing at a lower rate but still above the 10% rate but those house prices are not at the &euro;400,000 mark.  Average house prices in many of those counties are &euro;180,000 or &euro;190,000.  The fact that houses eligible under the scheme are in the region of &euro;226,000 to &euro;300,000 means nothing unless the Minister can say that without the scheme house prices would have been cheaper.  He cannot say that.  It is not possible for him to do so.  The help-to-buy scheme does only one thing.  I am not saying that the Minister personally is putting money into the pockets of developers.  Rather than saying something behind the Minister's back I will say it to his face.  This scheme puts money into the pockets of developers.  We are supposed to scrutinise measures in terms of their effectiveness.  In terms of effectiveness and the help-to-buy scheme the State is transferring valuable resources that could be diverted elsewhere to persons who are purchasing houses but those properties, if in the capital city, are increasing at a rate of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month or &euro;30,000 per year, such that benefit of the scheme is lost to them and that money ends up in the property developer's back pocket.  The Minister's only argument for the continuation of this scheme is that he did not give in to the developers on the VAT reduction.  I thought that the Minister knew what was going on in that regard.  I probably believe that the Minister did know what the CIF was doing.  I encourage the Minister to talk to people becuase everybody knows what the game plan was in terms of the VAT reduction.</p><p>If the Minister for Finance thinks that they were the big guys standing up to the construction sector in this, I am sorry to inform him that he was played on it because the construction sector got exactly what it wanted.  The sector got the help-to-buy scheme continued for two years at a time when the Government was wobbling and, from the soundings coming out, it was possibly going to end the scheme or significantly restructure it.</p></speech>

It is recommended in the Indecon report that one be carried out after a period of time.  The consultants made the point that they were only able to make a very preliminary assessment.  The Minister has said that he will take into account the data and that he will be in a better position in advance of the next budget.  How will that happen and what will the Minister base it on?  Will the Minister commit to doing the detailed cost-benefit analysis that was requested?</p> <p>  Indecon made the point, and I agree with it strongly, that the key challenge for the housing market is to reduce the cost of housing, including house prices and the costs of construction.  I do not see any effort being made by the Government to tackle that issue to bring down the actual costs of delivering homes.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p> <p>  Goodbody forwarded an analysis by email just a few minutes ago.  The issue of the escalating prices is accelerating.  Goodbody makes the point that following the strong monthly growth seen in July and August, prices have risen at an annualised pace of 27% in the most recent three month period.  Goodbody is raising its outlook for growth in 2017, with an increase from a forecast of 12.5% up to 15% now looking a reasonable prospect.  It is actually getting worse and is accelerating.  I am not blaming the help-to-buy scheme for all of that, and nor is Goodbody in its assessment, but the key question is what the Government is doing to bring down the cost of delivering homes.  There is general agreement that supply is the main issue, but costs and prices are rising, and home ownership is going beyond the reach of more and more people as time goes on.  These are the key issues the Minister needs to focus on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.900" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#S00700"><p>Setting aside any questioning of the Minister's motives or agendas around builders, and I do not believe that he is in any way acting as a representative of those sectors, the measure is not working on its own terms.  That is the point.  Alternatively, the money could be put where it could contribute to resolving a disastrous situation.  This is the essence.  Any benefit to the buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular growth in property prices.  The beneficiary of those increases in prices are builders and developers.  There is absolutely no question that they are the beneficiaries and are making money out of this.</p> <p>  As prices go up, arguably an incentive such as this or assistance for the home buyer is also encouraging them to get into an unsustainable market.  Let us remember what happened the last time.  People are being encouraged to buy houses at unsustainable prices where mortgages are gargantuan and the burden they will carry will be disastrous if further done the line we have another crash.  From any point of view, it seems that this is not working.  Contrast this with where the funding could be diverted.  This situation is not just about this particular incentive.  The package of this scheme, involving the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, home building finance Ireland, HBFI, leasing, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, are all reliant on the private sector and the market to deliver.  I have just done a quick tot and of the &euro;1.83 billion in the budget, about &euro;1 billion is going to the market in various ways to try to get the market to solve the problem.  This is a disastrous strategy.</p> <p>  The Minister said that in putting an alternative, our proposal is that only the State should build public housing.  Deputy Burton implied that some of us are arguing for that, but that is not what we are arguing.  We do, however, argue that there needs to be seismic shift back in that direction.  The story of the past 25 or 30 years was that the proportion of housing built by the State has dropped to negligible levels.  If, as Deputy Burton has rightly said, some 30% of people cannot purchase housing at market prices through their own resources, what does this mean?  It means the State should provide 30% of the housing.  There is no plan for that in what the Minister is doing but it is what we should be aiming at.  This is what the State used to do back in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s.  The State built that proportion of the housing stock.  The vast majority of the moneys being allocated by the Minister to resolve the problem in one scheme or another are going to the market to try to encourage and incentivise it.  I accept that the Government in Rebuilding Ireland has somewhat and in a small way shifted, although mostly at the level of rhetoric, to saying that Ireland needs public housing.  Rebuilding Ireland is still relying overwhelmingly on the market and I do not believe it can deliver.  In so far as it may increase supply, it is going to do so at unaffordable prices.</p> <p>  We need a dramatic shift in where the State puts its resources.  Let the market look after the market.  People who want to purchase their own homes, and I accept that it is the majority, are not able to purchase now because the prices in the market have gone out of control.  They would also benefit.  I underline this point, particularly given the offensive rhetoric from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - not from the Minister for Finance in fairness - about "free housing".  The implication was that social housing is free.  Social housing is not free.  People pay rent according to their income.  The point is that a person can get a house and pay according to his or her ability.  The Taoiseach's comments about "free housing" suggest that those people who want council housing or who advocate for social housing are advocating free housing, as against people who pay for their housing.  That is absolutely offensive.  It indicates a certain mindset, which needs to shift.  I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe shares that mindset, but I believe that he shares the ideological blinkers that have been put on governments because of the shift towards neoliberal thinking that has dominated for the past 25 to 30 years.  I urge the Minister for Finance to take off those blinkers and recognise that the only way Ireland can provide affordable housing is to get back up to 30% of housing being built directly by the State.  This would also stabilise, or bring down, house prices in the private market.</p> <p>  If the Government wants to bring prices down for the ordinary home buyer, it should build more council houses.  That is how it could stabilise the market.  When we give more and more incentives to developers to solve the problem, they will just use them, manipulate them and profiteer from them.  They will land hoard and release supply only when it suits them and they can make money.  They will stop the supply when they think it does not suit and when they cannot make enough money.  This is our point.  The signs are on it when we consider the experience of the past ten years, or even what has happened in the past year or two.  This is what is happening.  The Minister should consider taking on board the points we are making.</p></speech>

The housing market is beginning to expand and a significant number of houses are being built, particularly in my constituency, but it is not enough.</p><p>They are nowhere near the numbers required.  That applies to councils which are building, organisations which are building houses for rent and the private sector.</p><p> Notwithstanding all of the money being pumped in which ought to be sufficient to address the crisis, there is a failure of market regulation.  I would be the first to acknowledge that regulating the building market is intensely difficult.  It means dealing with very diverse individuals and much of the market is still only recovering from the crash, particularly for smaller and medium-sized builders.  We are talking about the perfect storm.  The industry is not even bothering to train apprentices.  In three years we will be crying out to have people brought here from other countries to build the houses we will still need.  The actions taken are not near adequate.  In that context, the proposed amendment is extremely modest.  It would provide for ongoing reporting on effectiveness and value for money achieved and the manner in which they will be monitored.  The Minister for Finance has a key power when it comes to oversight and monitoring.  I draw his attention to one element of the market that is causing huge problems in Dublin.  Because of the extraordinary increase in the price of housing land, for those involved in the provision of finance capital through companies on the Stock Exchange, bank investment or other investment vehicles, it is highly profitable to sit on land and do nothing.  That is not acceptable.  We know that there are delays in providing road and bridge access and so on.  However, there are also people who are consciously sitting on land and because of this the pace of development is being slowed down.  The value of so many portfolios is being elevated by the surge in land values and house prices.  The Minister really does have to act.  I support the amendment-----</p></speech>

The Minister knows these sites as well as I do.  They include O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street.  What is to happen in the provision of affordable housing in O'Devaney Gardens?  The council may finally move to provide some social housing.  The site has now been idle for 12 years or more.  The position is the same in the case of the site on Dominick Street.  These are prime sites that it would be wonderful to have in any city.  It is really due to market failure if we cannot move on these sites.</p></speech>

Section 664 provides for the tax free receipt of rental income from certain long-term qualifying leases of farm land.  The previous anti-avoidance provisions were inserted to prevent the exploitation of the provision by persons entering into cross leases of land in order to both generate tax free income and an allowable deduction.  It has come to my attention that a drafting error was included in the Finance Act 2015, a measure which may render the anti-avoidance provision inoperable.  The purpose of this amendment is therefore to rectify this error.  The words &quot;lessor&quot; and &quot;Lessee&quot; in section 664(8)(a) and (b) were transposed.  This amendment swaps them back to where they should be.</p><p>An additional technical amendment is also included to update terminology used in section 664 to reflect the EU basic payment scheme, which has replaced the EU single payment scheme since the start of 2015.</p></speech>

It is an investor-based tax relief under which an investor can obtain tax relief for investing in certain early phase companies.  On advice from the Attorney General, I am proposing to make a number of amendments to the incentive.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that EII is compatible with the General Block Exemption Regulation, GBER.  Under GBER, countries cannot give aid to individuals to invest in a company of which they are already a shareholder.  The GBER requirement has applied since October 2015.</p><p>The amendments I am proposing provides that a person who has a shareholding in a company, or whose relative has a shareholding in a company, may, from 2 November 2017, no longer claim relief under EII for an investment in that company.  This restriction will not apply if an individual and his or her relatives make their investments in the company while it is still at very initial stages before it commences any of its activities.  I should also emphasise that this restriction will not apply where an individual is only connected with a company through a prior investment to which EII relief applied.  Some &euro;30 million in relief is provided to investors under the scheme each year.  The value of relief affected by this change was in the order of &euro;6 million to &euro;10 million per annum.  I commend this amendment.</p></speech>

Is the review linked to this issue being identified?  In the interim period, will the scheme continue as normal, with the changes that are being made?  Is there a connection between what has been discovered and the need for an overall review?</p></speech>

This proposal will remove that five-year exemption.  This amendment provides that exemption will apply to the profits arising on land disposed of prior to 1 January 2019.  Distributions out of the profits of such deposit disposals after that will be subject to the normal Irish real estate fund, IREF, withholding tax rules.</p><p>Given the changes I am making elsewhere in the Finance Bill 2017 on capital gains tax and stamp duty, I felt it was important that these provisions were also amended for consistency.  In applying this provision from the start of 2019, I am ensuring that this change is introduced in a timely way while avoiding any undue disruption.  I commend the amendment to the committee.  I would also like to flag the possibility of a further amendment on the IREF provisions on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State now agree that the tax break for properties held for at least five years should not have been included in the Finance Bill 2016?  At the time it was objected to by ourselves, and possibly others, on the grounds that it encourages property hoarding as well as being a big tax break.  Is there an admission that that was a mistake - not a mistake accidentally made, not a drafting error, but a mistake of policy?</p></speech>

With the movements in capital gains tax and stamp duty, and the attempts to ensure that more land is made available for development for building, circumstances change.  Circumstances arise depending on what has happened in the previous 12 months.  We are not satisfied with the quantity of land that has been made available or the quantity of building that has happened in the last 12 months, and we feel this is a better system structure for the coming year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.953" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#DD01500"><p>In the last 12 months there have been no major changes to the fact that land is not being released.  I say that because it is important to get to the core of this.  This was the major argument in the Finance Bill last year.  The Minister of State should look over the transcripts.  We kept going back over this on Committee and Report Stages.  We argued with the Government at the time that the five-year exemption from dividend withholding tax was a loophole that it was deliberately putting into the Finance Bill.  I argued very strongly that people who bought properties not just last year, but four years from then, could have no dividend withholding tax from the capital gains tax, CGT, payable.  This was a major issue.</p> <p>  Following up on that through a freedom of information request, I found that officials were communicating the fact that this could lead to hoarding before this measure was introduced to the Finance Bill and signed off.  We were unaware that there were those concerns within the Department, but we were still making the argument that this would lead to an escape from huge amounts of tax and have an effect on the property market.</p> <p>  I put forward the idea in the first place for a dividend witholding tax and I have campaigned vigorously to end the five-year CGT exemption, which is an incentive that makes it more profitable for funds to hold onto vacant lands for a period of five years than to sell them off.  The reason it is more profitable is that the Government argued black and blue with me, and with others in this committee, that that was the right thing to do.</p> <p>  It is not about circumstances, CGT, stamp duty and all the rest.  The Government got this seriously wrong.  There was a bit of arrogance last year on this issue.  THe Government would not listen to members of the Opposition who were pointing out the problems there at that time.  I welcome the fact the five-year CGT exemption or the dividend witholding tax exemption is going to be gone.  However, there is a lesson here.  We can talk about new politics and all the rest.  It is not a case of saying that we were right and the Government was wrong; this has caused damage at this point.  There are properties that could have been sold in bloc format, the way properties were sold by NAMA to investors, that have not been sold.  This is because it was more beneficial for them to hold on and avail of the five-year CGT exemption.  Those properties are in this city.  This is something the Government was aware of during that time, but it continued to march on with this ill-conceived idea.</p> <p>  We are closing a loophole, but I am not sure who applied the pressure.  I am sure certain people lobbied.  I would like the Minister of State to put on record whether there was any lobbying of the Department of Finance on introducing the five-year CGT exemption on dividend withholding tax, or the dividend witholding tax exemption.  If there was lobbying at the time, can the Minister of State inform this committee who was lobbying the Department or the Minister?</p></speech>

This is why the provision is incentivising people to hoard instead of sell.  If an owner holds the property for four years then it is better to hold on to it for another 12 months in order to be exempt from the dividend withholding tax when one disposes of the property.  If one bought the property in 2014 then one will no longer be able to avail of the exemption because the new provision kicks in on 1 January 2019 and, therefore, the five years would not have elapsed.

By the end of December 2018, however, five years will have elapsed so one will get the exemption.  That means the provision incentivises the investor to sit on the vacant land, to do nothing with it even though we are in the middle of a housing crisis and hold it for another year because it is of major financial benefit to the owner and its shareholders, due to a 20% exemption on the dividend withholding tax on the gains that are realised on the property.  Let us remember this is property that was bought by investors in 2013.  Can the Minister of State tell me the uplift in property prices from 2013 to 2017?  There has been a dramatic increase in prices.  This is why there is now a huge incentive for these companies to stash land.</p> <p>  The provision, in terms of ending the CGT dividend withholding tax exemption, is the right thing to do and we argued for it last year.  By not allowing it to kick in for another year the Government is incentivising a cohort of investors who invested during the period 2013 to 2014 to continue to hoard residential properties and apartment blocks and units that were bought by NAMA.  I refer to the conversation that was in the reply to the freedom of information request.  </p></speech>

The properties are not being sold off because the companies will benefit from the CGT exemption after five years.

The individuals will not develop or sell on the land because to hold on to it, at this point in time, is more financially beneficial to them.</p></speech>

He has discussed sections in isolation.  He mentioned a piece of land owned by a company or an investment stream and assumed that there is a gain on the purchase of a single parcel of land.  The provision will work, and we anticipate it will work, as follows.  If a company or an investor has a gain and reinvests it then there will not be a gain on that occasion.  What the Deputy has said is correct, potentially, if one takes a single parcel of land and it is operated in isolation of the entire business that is a company or an investment stream.  What he has said, in isolation, can be correct.  The point is property investment companies or individuals tend not to operate purely in isolation.  If they do move something, and benefit by not paying the 20% withholding tax and they have a capital gain, but they subsequently reinvest that then it is still not liable anyway.</p></speech>

The Government would not be closing down this loophole if that was the case.  The Government is closing down the loophole because it knows fine well that it engineered a loophole into the Finance Bill last year that incentivised people to hoard land and property.  I welcome the fact that the loophole is being closed but I am disappointed that it will continue for a year.</p> <p>  The Minister of State talked about certainty for investors and all of the rest.

A total of 85% is foreign investment.  They are structured in such a way as to benefit foreign investors - that is the point.  These are foreign investors.  This is why it is so important for the dividend withholding tax to be paid.  The rate is set at 20%.  We will come to this point later, but they do not actually pay 20% because of double tax treaties and other issues that we can discuss later.  The Government is facilitating for another year the vast gains paid out to the foreign investors and no tax will be paid.</p> <p>  These are the big boys who came in at the bottom of the market in 2013.  That is the year the legislation is specifically targeting.  It was when the market was almost at the bottom of the trough.  They snapped up properties for next to nothing.  The properties increased in value dramatically over the following five years.  Yet, the Minister of State is trying to convince us to support a measure that would allow them to continue not paying on the vast gains they will make.  As bad as that is and as much as it stinks, the policy is also about incentivising them.  If they were thinking about selling up now or developing, the policy is an incentive to hold on for another 12 months and then they can leave the State tax-free with their gains.  That is what the Minister of State is trying to convince us about.  It does not stack up.</p></speech>

I remind him that we needed foreign equity to come in to try to move the property market.  The Deputy should not ignore where we were back then.  He is simply taking the negative and suggesting that everything was perfect.  We needed foreign funds to come in to the Irish residential property sector and the commercial real estate sector.  Many of those companies have come in.  They are building all over this city and throughout the remainder of the country.  Deputy Pearse Doherty should not ignore that.</p></speech>

We have decided that, as a result of providing tax certainty, the measures will kick in 14 months from now.  We believe it is important for a jurisdiction to have tax certainty.  This means we should not change an aspect of the policy in one budget and then alter it subsequently.  We do not believe that is good tax business.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  The Irish property market has been chaotic.  We believe this is the right thing to do now.  We believe that January 2019 is the right period for this to kick in.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State at the Department of Finance explain why it would decide to dispose of that land now, when the Government is indicating, through the Finance Bill, that if it holds on to the land for another 12 months, it will not pay the 20% dividend withholding tax on the gains relating to it?  Does the Minister of State not understand that if I represented the fund and he were speaking to me, the policy is encouraging me, if I have the interests of my shareholders at heart, to hold on to this land for a further 12 months?  We hear all the words from Ministers and the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il when they are doing soundings and so on about the property crisis.  However, this is what it boils down to: the Government is engineering into the Finance Bill an incentive to hoard land.</p> <p>  The Government cannot have it both ways.  I want the Minister of State to acknowledge that he is doing this with his eyes wide open.  If the Government wants to push ahead with it, that is fair enough &ndash; I cannot stop him.  We are not strong enough or well represented enough in this committee to do so.  However, it is my responsibility to at least ensure that the Minister for Finance and the members of the committee who vote for, against or abstain in respect of this measure understand the exact consequences of it.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has rightly taken us back to when the market was bottomed out in 2013.  However, the strategy that the Government adopted at that point has turned out to be a disastrous folly.  The theory was that by giving vast tax breaks to these investors, we would do something positive for the market.  What we actually did was hand over vast wealth to these vulture funds.</p> <p>  It was obviously a concerted strategy.  In fact, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was straight-up about it.  We now know he was busy meeting representatives from all these funds and actively encouraging them to come in.  No doubt, he was telling them they would get favourable tax treatment and that they would walk away paying no tax on the capital gains, which, we now know, are absolutely astronomical.  Even then, it would not have taken a rocket scientist to know that when the market was bottomed out these people were going to gain in a major way.  There was only one way the market was going to go at that stage, namely, up.</p></speech>

Some of us at the time were saying that NAMA should have behaved differently.  This might indeed explain the mystery of a case I brought up with the Minister for Finance earlier.  It related to apartments in Sandyford.  In that case, NAMA was sitting on empty properties and then sold them to a vulture fund.  The vulture fund then sat on the empty properties while there were homeless people all around.  It is a mystery.  Why was this happening?  Perhaps it was for precisely this reason: the decision was to simply sit on the property and let the value go up.  Then, the owners would walk away with a vast capital gain and pay no tax on it.</p> <p>  The Government is not moving immediately to close that down and is allowing it to play out.  I suspect that is because the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, said it was guaranteed and that the Government would not do anything.  It is a little like what I suspect also happened with Apple &ndash; we will move on to that discussion later.  In those critical years of 2013 and 2014, a great deal of running around was done by the then Minister.  He was talking to big corporations and property investors and telling them that the Government would look after them on the tax front.  These funds moved in and the consequences have been disastrous.</p> <p>  The Government has somewhat belatedly acknowledged this by making some moves to close down the loophole.  However, it seems to be extending it for one year because of some sort of principle of honour or because we have to honour the deal with these vulture funds.  The Government should forget it.  We should close it down now, recognise that we made a big mistake and recover whatever ground and revenues we can.  We should close down the incentive for these people to continue immorally and obscenely hoarding land and property when thousands of our citizens need places to live.</p></speech>

Many members have a different experience.  We should remember that many of the vulture funds in question have no plans to reinvest here and are in it for the short term.  A well-known maxim is that when there is blood spilled on the floor, it is time to go in.  That is what happened here.  The quantum of money we would lose in tax is a scandal, as is the fact this is holding up potential housing development at a time of emergency in that area.  However, that should be considered in light of what the funds have been achieving over that period of time.  Funds that invested in the period around 2013 will now benefit from the CGT exemption.  In 2014, commercial property returns in the State were the highest in the world.  There was a return of 40.1% on commercial property in 2014 because in 2012 the economy started to pick up and in 2013, it was already back on a growth trajectory.  That is why I say it was close to the bottom of the trough.  The Minister of State has said we needed the funds and all the rest and nobody knew what way it was going to go.  He should read any academic analysis of the situation such as that of Morgan Kelly or the NAMA report that led to its establishment and which foresaw property prices getting back to a sustainable level within ten years.  That was all well signalled and the funds knew that.</p> <p>  We can argue about whether we needed them.  I am not sure what benefit they supplied.  They snapped up properties from NAMA at rock bottom prices and made massive profits running to billions of euro on them.  They paid no taxes on those profits and the Government is now going to facilitate them further in paying no tax on profits.  Can the Minister of State tell me or anybody listening to these proceedings why the State needed them?  What benefit did they give the State?  The only benefit is their shareholders became extremely rich.  The companies that serviced the funds' legal structures got quite wealthy.  However, the funds did not service the interests of the State.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain how Irish citizens benefitted from vulture funds coming in and buying from the State, through NAMA, at rock bottom prices, flipping those properties within a short period of time for, in some cases, double, triple or quadruple the price for which they bought them and in other cases holding the assets in order that they can leave Ireland without paying tax.  How did the State benefit from that?</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State could give us a detailed note on this issue.  To be honest, this information is extremely complex.  I heard him say that this is an amalgam of different types of funds.  The fact is that we do not have the analysis we need.  I would say we need a very detailed note on this matter.  Some of the explanations are making it more rather than less complicated.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the budget, he said he would bring forward amendments on Committee Stage relating to the five-year capital gains tax exemptions for the IREFs.  We have not heard an explanation of why that should be renewed.  For how long will it be renewed?  What is the context for its renewal?  What kinds of investments are we talking about?  I need to have some of that information.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said on budget day that he was going to introduce this measure, he flagged that we would be given explanations and details.  I think we need them now.</p></speech>

He indicated in his opening remarks on this amendment that the potential exists for other amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  I would like to know the thinking on those amendments because it is relevant to what we are discussing now.  Have the windows for first returns in respect of IREFs passed at this stage?  I think the relevant dates were in January and July.  IREFs have had a legal basis since January 2017.  Were there returns in July?  Do we have data on the withholding tax and so on?  If concerns regarding the hoarding of land have led to this policy change, can the Minister of State explain what purpose will be served by providing for a delay of a further year?</p></speech>

Before lunch I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the fact that increases in land values are giving people involved in funds a perverse incentive to sit on lands while such increases continue.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this problem, which is being discussed widely.  Regardless of whether we are ultimately talking about fund valuations or something like a limited company - I appreciate that different structures are involved - there continues to be a perverse incentive to make gains and see valuations rise by sitting on lands.  I have significant concerns about the current tendency of various entities to sit on land at a time of remarkable speculation in land prompted by substantial increases in property values.  At a time of severe housing shortages - I refer not only to affordable and social housing but also to houses for purchase - this country cannot afford to have people hoarding and sitting on land for the purpose of accumulating valuation increases.</p></speech>

The current approach offers an incentive to evict people.  These capital gains tax breaks incentivise funds to evict people and they are acting on those incentives.  When they evict people, the value of the property increases.  This is what the funds are doing.  I am dealing with a property in my area that has been bought by one of these funds - I am not sure of the exact year, but I am almost certain it would have been in the period in question - which is evicting people in order to drive up the value of the property.  To my mind, that is another outrageous consequence of these tax breaks.  We are incentivising these funds to increase their capital gains before walking away tax-free.</p> <p>  I have another question that I would like the Minister of State to answer, although I suspect that he cannot or will not do so.  Do we have figures for the tax that would be gained or forgone, depending on whether we extend this relief?  I see somebody shaking their head, so I suspect the answer is "No", which is fairly shocking in and of itself.</p></speech>

As far as I know, although I would be happy to be enlightened, we do not know how much tax is going to be forgone as a result of this extension.  Do we have estimates?  We have just estimated how many firms or funds will benefit from it and what the quantum of assets will be.  Do we have estimates for how much tax will be forgone if we extend this or if we do not do so?  Do we have figures not just for the beneficiaries of this capital gains tax extension but also for the overall amount of tax forgone as a result of the extension?</p></speech>

The argument is that we need tax certainty, but there was no such need for tax certainty when it was introduced to the benefit of these vulture funds.  The Government was able to introduce it immediately, but now that it is being withdrawn it seems that a certain amount of time must be provided in the interests of having an environment of tax certainty.  The Government and the D&aacute;il are entitled to change legislation.  We are not talking about a retrospective measure here.  We have a right to change the tax code.  There seems to be a suggestion that the Government should be blackmailed because it has, in effect, promised these funds that they will not pay tax.  If the Government does not recognise that as a problem, that is fine.  It does not want to admit that the problem was evident a year ago.  The idea that they will still be able to benefit for reasons of tax certainty, even though it has been recognised that this is a problem, is a bit ridiculous.</p></speech>

There are approximately 100 IREFs, four or five of which are widely-held funds, or pension funds, in effect.  Four or five funds have had the benefit of not paying the 20% withholding tax.  The same funds will have that benefit over the next 12 months up to January 2019.  It is important to note that if they are pension funds, they are exempt in any event.  The funds in question are not vulture funds.  It is important that there is full understanding of what we are talking about and dealing with.</p></speech>

There is very significant income volatility and in recent years, there have been improvements in the taxation environment to deal with it.  In particular, the income averaging system was an important reform.  Last year, the opt-out provisions for one year were also a very significant help.</p><p>Problems persist, as the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will be aware.  Farmer organisations put forward a number of different options to provide for greater stabilisation in respect of income volatility.  I have looked at a number of them.  I am sure the Department engaged and considered them as well.  In that regard, the purpose of putting down this amendment is to call for a report examining the feasibility of introducing further provisions to deal with the issue of income volatility for farm enterprises.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#PP00100"><p>I think I am the only farmer in the room.  I may know a little bit more.  I fully recognise that farm income volatility can be a prevalent feature of the agricultural sector.  In response to this, a targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging regime.  This scheme has been in place since the introduction of farm taxation.  It provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out the income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  In effect, one fifth of the farmer&rsquo;s profits and losses for the five years is charged for a year.</p> <p>  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility, my Department sought to introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to reflect this new reality and to maximise the number of farmers who can level out volatile incomes through the averaging system.  In the Finance Act 2014, the availability of income averaging was extended to permit farmers in receipt of income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession to elect into the averaging regime.  The period of income averaging was also extended from three to five years, thereby providing a longer timeframe over which income volatility can be smoothed.  In the Finance Act 2016, an optional so-called step-out from the regime was introduced for farmers to ease financial pressures and improve cashflow for farmers in a year when they experience lower than expected incomes.</p> <p>  In addition, following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed, I have committed to continuing our engagement on exploring further taxation measures for income stabilisation and undertaking a review of agricultural tax incentives more generally in advance of budget 2019.  This will include an examination of existing schemes, including income volatility measures, as well as engagement with relevant stakeholders.  The aim of the review will be to ensure that these schemes are operating in an efficient and effective manner and meeting their policy objectives in this area.</p> <p>  Therefore, on the basis that there is already a targeted tax measure available to full-time farmers under the income averaging regime and considering that I have already committed to undertake a review of agricultural taxes more broadly prior to budget 2019, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Subsequently, in budgets 2015 and 2016, some of these were presented.  There will be a review of all reliefs in the agriculture tax review.  There will be an update and particular reference to income stabilisation.  As I said in a slightly glib way, I understand the pressures on farmers in respect of income volatility.  To put it into context, milk prices for November 2019 will be &euro;0.42 per litre.  Some 16 months ago they were between &euro;0.19 and &euro;0.21 per litre.  The volatility of milk prices internationally on the world market means the price for this product can be halved in a period of 12 to 14 months.  There are very few industries in which that is the case.  While the situation has improved a lot in the past 15 to 18 months, volatility is a serious factor in agriculture at the moment.  We are doing a full review next year.  Income stabilisation will form a substantial part of that review.</p></speech>

That amendment is no longer being pressed as a result of the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption for non-resident investors in Irish real estate funds, IREFs, now being dealt with in the previous section.</p><p>There are a number of amendments in this grouping.  To keep the debate focused, we should try to deal with them individually.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a report to be laid before the D&aacute;il within six months of the passing of the Act on the ability of certain investors in IREFs, including pension funds and other investment funds, to neutralise their tax liability in respect of either incomes or gains from Irish property held by such funds.  This leads on from the conversations we had earlier in public and private sessions of the committee in respect of the make-up of a certain number of IREFs.  Some would have a large involvement in pensions, both Irish and European institutional pension schemes and investors.  We know that, as a result, pension funds investing in IREFs are able to avail of not paying any tax.  We need to deal with that.  I am asking that a report be brought forward on the options in dealing with it.  Certain investors in IREFs, including pensions funds and international investors, can pay no income, corporation or capital gains tax on their income or gains from Irish property.  Many feel that this is simply wrong.</p><p>For example, the IPUT fund has Irish property assets of &euro;2.2 billion.  AIB recently signed a 20 year lease with this fund, which is moving in from Ballsbridge to AIB's corporate headquarters in the centre of Dublin in 2019.  The group's contracted annual rental return for 2017 is expected to be &euro;102 million.  However, 79% of this fund is owned by pension funds and institutional investors, meaning that the vast majority of its incomes and gains are not subject to taxation.  That is a major gap.  The fund has &euro;2.2 billion in Irish property assets and a rental book of &euro;102 million, yet 79% of its gains and income is not subject to Irish taxation.  This goes back to the point about taxing property and the rights here in terms of such taxation and the benefits that arise from property.</p><p>We can look at these funds and examine who really benefits.  Certain individuals benefit from them.  The lawyers obviously benefit from the structures that are put in place.  In terms of the number of staff this fund has, which one would think would be quite large given the turnover in annual rental income and assets of &euro;2.2 billion, it employed 19 people in 2016.  If we were to look at their pay bill, we would say it was large at &euro;5.3 million.  The average cost per employee is therefore about &euro;279,000 per year.  Certainly, they can afford to pay wages of that scale.  The vast majority of the income and profits they are recording is not taxable.  In respect of institutional investors, Irish institutional pension schemes make up 42% of the fund.  European institutional investors make up 37% of it.  Then we have Irish investment managers at 17% and Irish charities and universities at 4%.</p><p>I do not believe that is a healthy way to go forward.  We need to consider issuing a report on how and whether we can bring in measures that would see an appropriate level of taxation of some of these funds, which would have within them investments from pension schemes and other institutional investors that are not subject to tax.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#QQ00100"><p>Section 23 of the Finance Act 2016 introduced a new tax regime for funds that hold Irish real estate, to be known as Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property.  Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax Acts.  The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy&rsquo;s point in relation to pension funds and investment undertakings, I note that these entities are investment vehicles.  As such, they do not pay tax on the profits generated within the vehicle.  Tax is instead operated at the time that the investor, be it the pensioner or the unit holder, draws a benefit down from the pension fund or investment undertaking.  Pension funds and investment undertakings are, therefore, among a class of investors that can make a declaration that IREF withholding tax does not arise.  This is on the basis that the profits will ultimately be taxed at the investor level.  I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from Irish real estate funds will be filed in the middle of next year.  At that point, Revenue will examine the IREF taxable events in respect of which IREF withholding tax could have applied and identify reasons why such withholding tax was not operated.  If any areas of concern are identified, these will be addressed.</p> <p>  In relation to the IREF withholding tax exemption for gains on assets held in an IREF for more than five years, as we have discussed, I have brought forward an amendment such that it will not apply to disposals on or after 1 January 2019.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced by the Finance Act 2013.  The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property.  REITs must be widely held, as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a close company, that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer participators.  A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property.  No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT.  The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.</p> <p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible to share the information sought by the Deputy with the committee, or indeed with myself.  However, I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division has a dedicated team which looks after REITs.  As the REIT regime was introduced in Finance Act 2013 that team is, as part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies.  Should any issues arise from that review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials.</p> <p>  I cannot commend the amendments to the committee, but I assure the Deputies that both the IREFs and REITs are being kept under review.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that we have an issue with pensions in Ireland and we are proactively trying to encourage people to take out pensions and to invest for the future.  There are a number of reliefs available and, in 2013, with REITs and IREFs we were trying to get people to invest in Irish property.  Perhaps we could ask the tax strategy group to review it as they will report next summer, just a couple of months after the six months proposed in the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

We want to encourage people to take out pensions but less than half the country has a pension.  We should not forgo tax on billions in Irish property so that the other half can get a better pension.  This other half has larger incomes.  Some 37% of the IPUT portfolio is made up of European institutional investors, as opposed to Irish institutional pensions schemes, so a large section is going untaxed.  A fundamental principle is that property should be taxed in the country where it is situated.  There are other issues which we will deal with in the other amendments but I welcome the proposal that the tax strategy group deal with this and I will withdraw my amendment.  If the tax strategy group carries out a review of the tax structure within IREFs that allows individuals to neutralise or significantly reduce tax, and comes up with proposals to deal with this, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

The total value of Irish property within these funds is between &euro;18 billion and &euro;19 billion.  The CSO has revealed that non-household buyers, a large proportion of which comprise REITs and IREFs, had purchased 42% of new homes in Dublin by the end of July 2017.  In the middle of this housing crisis, with people queuing up for houses and being outbid for them, non-household buyers are buying 42% of available properties in Dublin.  First-time buyers only make up 25% of the market and are competing with these multibillion euro funds.</p><p>It should be remembered that there are only 100 IREFs and three REITs.  As such, 103 companies have &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion worth of fire-power.  That is the level of assets they have in their structures and they are out there competing with Mary and John who are trying to get onto the property ladder but who are being outbid all the time.  There is a reason for that.  The tax code provides a very lucrative arrangement for these funds, which allows them to outbid others.</p><p> While most of the focus of these funds is in Dublin, we see nationally that non-household buyers purchased 13% of all homes in the State in 2016.  When one isolates local authorities and approved housing bodies from the figures, one finds that, within this category, 10% can be attributed predominantly to REITs and IREFs.  As such, 10% of all homes across the State were purchased by REITs or IREFs.  The 2017 figure nationally will be ahead of that.  It is a disgrace that these tax avoidance structures are pushing up prices through the demand of the funds for property.  They have the fire-power to buy up huge tranches of housing, which results in many ordinary people being unable to even dream of owning their own homes.  We have to change the tax structures within these funds.  Whatever the argument was about the need for vultures in 2013, it is no longer that point in time.</p><p> We have a huge problem with regard to housing supply and the last thing we should do as a Parliament is unleash these tax effective or avoiding structures onto first-time buyers in the market.  They do not have a clue what is happening.  Many of them are oblivious to what we are doing in this committee but we have passed the legislation to set up the tax structures which are now competing with ordinary Dubliners and people in Donegal for first-time houses.  That is why property prices are increasing by 12.8% nationally and by higher rates in certain categories in Dublin city in particular.  It is not all attributable to that but going back to the statistics, 42% of houses bought in Dublin to the end of July 2017 were bought by non-household buyers.  Non-household buyers include a number of cohorts, namely, REITs, IREFs, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  When we isolate the national figure of 13% and take away local authorities and approved housing bodies, 10% involves REITs and IREFs.</p><p> This proposal is looking for a report on the impact IREFs and REITs are having on residential property prices in the State.  This is required urgently.  I have suggested six months to be consistent with the timeframe in terms of the reports, but it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  What is going on in the Dublin market is crazy.  This is not just coming from the left.  Economists and big firms are calling for penalties on cash buyers and non-household buyers.  There is a time for intervention.  When these non-household buyers are buying up nearly twice as much of the Dublin property market in domestic homes as first-time buyers, the time for action is long past.</p></speech>

It is the CSO's intention to publish a breakdown of these figures into the three categories shortly.  However, it is likely to be March 2018 at the earliest before it has any actual figures.  At that stage, we will have the information to do the analysis.  There are three REITs operating in the Irish market, of which two are active in the residential market.  IRES has approximately 2,400 apartments, while Hibernia has just over 300 apartments.  The rationale behind the introduction of the REITs was their design specifically for long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to be a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  The REIT regime brought a new source of capital into the market, reducing dependence on banking finance and freeing up available banking finance for other uses.  By facilitating collective investment, REITs also provide risk diversification for investors of all sizes to promote the professionalisation of the Irish property market.  They are also key to the development of a build-to-rent market in Ireland.</p> <p>  I hear what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  We can all have our ideological debates but all parties across both Houses want to try to improve the housing situation for everyone.  We will not have the information back from Revenue until next July or thereabouts.  As such, we have an information vacuum at this moment in time.  To put this in context, there are 2 million homes in the country.  It is difficult to pluck a figure from the sky, but if we suggest an average price of &euro;250,000 per home, that is a residential value of &euro;500 billion, excluding commercial property.  If one adds commercial property, it is impossible for me to put a figure on it.  REITs and IREFs have assets of &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion.  They have given investors, including pension funds, the opportunity to make a tax-efficient investment.  There is a serious problem, as the Deputy well knows, for Irish pension funds into the future.  He mentioned one in particular.  For each one, there are many thousands of small investors who are trying hard to have a pot for when they retire.  It has not been easy.  Again, we can have an ideological debate about whether it should be allowed at the higher rate, but for the vast majority of people, these are tax-efficient methods for investing.  At &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion, it gives smaller investors the opportunity to be tax efficient.  They do not have to be at a scale which puts them into a very wealthy person's space.  In the scheme of a property sector worth perhaps &euro;500 billion for residential and whatever the value of commercial property is, &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion is not a huge amount.</p></speech>

What information is provided in the annual return?  On the policy rationale, Ireland was a very different place in 2013.  There were apartments available in Grand Canal Dock for what now appear to be very low prices.  I can understand the logic of seeking to professionalise and institutionalise the rental market or, at least, a certain part of it.  There is such a shortage of supply of stock now, however, that I ask the Minister of State to elaborate the Government's policy on this issue currently and the logic of it.  One must compare the tax treatment here with the taxation treatment of ordinary landlords, who pay at up to the 55% marginal rate, and of Irish companies which hold property but do not meet the test to form an IREF or a REIT.</p></speech>

Our friends, PwC, in their document Irish Real Estate Investment Structures, say:</p><blockquote>[There has been a] remarkable resurgence of interest in ... Irish real estate ... spearheaded by overseas investors [not little Irish pensioners trying to save up for their pension pots] and in particular by the hedge funds and private equity groups.  Such investors are using the array of available ... structures ranging from QIAIFs to REITs to SPVs to mitigate or eliminate taxes that would otherwise arise on their real estate investments.</blockquote><p>They go on to refer to REITs: &quot;[N]on-resident investors are not liable to CGT [this is them touting these things again] on the disposal of REIT shares.&quot;  The document states REITs are &quot;not chargeable to tax in respect of ... property rental business or chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of assets&quot;.  Regarding section 110 companies, it states, &quot;While such entities are taxable at a rate of 25%, the taxable profits tend to be modest because of the use of tax efficient profit ... mechanisms such as interest ... on profit participating loans.&quot;  It goes on and on.  What PwC is touting is the fact that this is an array of structures which allows the mitigation or complete elimination of the profits extracted from the Irish property sector, much of them courtesy of NAMA, which flogged this property - our property - to these buyers in order for them to extract profit and pay no tax.  This is the greatest scandal this State has seen in recent times.  As if everything that happened in 2007 and 2008 and the cost that people paid were not bad enough, that then became the prelude to the vast unloading of property assets to foreign investors, hedge funds and so on, which then extract an absolutely enormous profit from this and pay no tax.

We should look at that too.  It is shocking, when one considers what is happening in the property market and the enormous appreciation of the value of these properties, that such buyers are walking away and paying no tax.  The other side of the coin is that I then have to traipse into PwC on behalf of residents or tenants in properties managed by PwC on behalf of these funds and plead with PwC not to evict them.  I had to do that a while ago.  These stony-faced men in PwC are looking for, in one case, 90% rent increases on an apartment block in D&uacute;n Laoghaire - the whole block.  They wanted to kick the residents out on behalf of these lovely people.  We have this array of tax structures to minimise or mitigate their tax liability and they try to evict people.  I am glad to say that because the people resisted, PwC has been forced back so far.  There have been two separate attempts by PwC to evict the whole block on behalf of, in this particular case, Apollo Global Management, which presumably benefits from this array of tax structures.</p></speech>

I had a problem with the way in which the Department of Finance is implementing and addressing the Act in that what I understand now happens is that general letters are written, which are received by low-level officials, who are not designated officials.  The then Minister indicated to me - others might remember part of the discussion on the Finance Act - that he was minded to address any difficulties, but I am not aware of anything being done over the past year to address an obvious gap in the legislation.  Who at this point in time is a designated official in the Department or the Revenue Commissioners, and at what level are they in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, for the purposes of the Regulation of Lobbying Act?  The finance committee, knowing and having some general information about lobbying, would give us greater insight into how and why some changes come about.  In some cases there may be valid commercial strategies that really do stand up.  In other cases it is frankly very difficult to understand.</p></speech>

This is a Government policy and has nothing<i>per se</i>to do with any of the officials, but could the Minister of State enlighten us on that policy?  In New York, San Francisco and the City of London, similar vehicles result in the large-scale turnover of less well-off tenants in favour of &quot;yuppie&quot; apartments that are done up for wealthy people, often putting them out of reach of current locals.</p><p>I understand the Minister of State's point about the needs of the small investor and so on and that this may be an attractive vehicle but, in terms of the social consequences of this type of investment, has he any concern about how some of them have operated to date in certain circumstances?</p></speech>

The 2,700 owned by or in the possession of REITs account for less than 0.15% of that amount.  I do not have a breakdown of how many properties are owned or rented, so I do not have an exact figure, but we would not be discussing the other 99.85% of properties.  REITs are an easy target and some may be doing things along the lines of what Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined.  I cannot stand over those things, nor can anyone else, but that is not a discussion on the 99.85% where people can be found treating their clients even more poorly than that.  There are 2,400 apartments with I-RES and 300 apartments with Hibernia REIT.  We will try to get the information but, in the grand scheme of things and to be frank with the committee, I would prefer to discuss the 99.85%, not the 0.15%.</p></speech>

If that contributes to someone building up a pension fund in a fair and sustainable way, I am all for it, as I am sure is every Deputy present.  However, the issue is that, in some cases, existing tenants are being turfed out and new, better off tenants are brought in at much higher rents.  Our concern is about how rents are increasing on a rolling basis.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to CSO data that will give us more information on this matter.  I support the call for more information, as it will allow us to explore what needs to be addressed on the policy side.  What undertakings will the Minister of State give?  Is he willing to explore this or is it something for which Fine Gael does not allow?</p></speech>

This is not about my mum's house, my house or people who are living in their homes.  It is about properties that are coming onto the market for sale.  Those first-time buyers cannot knock on their neighbours' doors and ask whether there is any chance of them giving up their homes so that the first-timers can buy them.  They go to the market of houses for sale.</p> <p>  I will cite the figures in terms of non-household buyers.  In 2010, some 3% of properties across the State were bought by non-household buyers.  So far this year, that figure is 15%.  In Dublin, in 2010, the figure in respect of all homes was 5%.  It has increased to 23% so far in 2017.  The figure in respect of new homes in Dublin in 2010 was 15%.  In 2017 to date, it is 42%.  These are the figures.  That is the pool of houses that are available for people who are trying to get onto the property ladder.  There is no point in talking about the others who are already in their houses and will not leave them.  If they decided to leave their homes, they would fall into that category.</p> <p>  Let us get with this.  In Dublin, 42% of new homes are bought by non-household buyers.  I welcome the fact that Revenue will break down that information into more granular detail, but let us not pretend that there is no issue.</p></speech>

We can get this information, although it will not be as accurate as what Revenue will provide in March following its analysis.  We know what local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have bought.  If we strip them out, we find that the figure has not reduced substantially.  REITS and IREFs are hoovering up the market and, consequently, pushing up prices.  We want the Minister of State to understand the problem in the first place and to get with it.  We have unleashed these fund structures onto unassuming first-time buyers whom they are outbidding in the market.</p> <p>  This is not just coming from the left.</p><p>Merrion stockbrokers said the Government should consider penalising property investors to stop first-time buyers being priced out of the market.  In its latest quarterly economic outlook, the broker says those who want a house to live in should be given precedence over those who are in it for purely investment purposes and looking to make a quick buck.  Investors are the main drivers of cash sales in the Irish property market, which account for more than 50% of transactions.  In its report, Merrion stockbrokers warned there was now a shortage of every type of housing and that the crisis was likely to get worse unless urgent action was taken.  With regard to the REITs, the tax efficient structures the Minister of State talks about, one has set new record monthly rents of &euro;2,570 in its Maple scheme in Dublin despite the tax incentive structure that it has.  It is not right.  I could use stronger language.  The fund is not in it to provide houses; that is a by-product of what they are doing.  They are in it to ensure they maximise the returns for their investors.  Our focus needs to be on Irish citizens.  We have evidence, which will undoubtedly become clearer in a number of months, that we will still see these types of structures out-purchasing first-time buyers in Dublin when we strip everything else out of it.  That is an issue.  Even if the figures were reduced to 30% instead of 42%, it will still be an issue.  We have to stop this.  If there was plenty of supply, there would not be a problem.  I would like to see penalties; I support what Merrion stockbrokers said.  The amendment is very clear.  It asks for "a report on the impact that Irish Real Estate Funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts are having on residential property prices in the State".  It is to be done within six months.  Revenue will have figures for us in March.  If the Government wants to extend that to eight months, we will do it on Report Stage, but there should be a report done on this because it is a major issue.  </p></speech>

I have been looking at REITs and their accounts over the past while.  The level of tax they are paying is staggering.  I have a couple of questions seeking clarification.  The REIT regime provides tax exemption in respect of income and chargeable gains of a property rental business held within the company that satisfies a number of conditions.  We know that one of those has to be that it makes distributions of not less than 85% of its annual property income.  With regard to calculating that annual property income, can the Minister of State confirm if property tax is properly tax deductible for REITs when computing their annual property income?  </p></speech>

I am looking at I-RES's accounts.  The Minister of State has mentioned I-RES.  None of this is secret because these are publicly available.  It tells us about the revenue from investment properties of &euro;38 million.  It deducts property taxes of &euro;581,000, which is not a huge amount, but no other landlord in the State would be able to deduct their property tax before taxation.  Deputy McGrath has raised this on numerous occasions during different Finance Bills.  It deducts asset management fees of &euro;2.7 million.  This is on top of property operating costs of &euro;7.6 million.  There is a real suspicion that this asset management fee should not be deducted.  It is a way of reducing the amount of distribution that has to take place.  I know I am springing some of this on the Minister of State but I would welcome a note from Revenue before Report Stage on this.</p></speech>

We also know that in many cases that 20% does not apply because of tax treaties.  The Ireland-US tax treaty holds less than 10% of REITs and the dividend withholding tax goes down to 15% and so on.  I have looked at the three REITs in the State and their annual reports and accounts for 2016 and 2017.  Their annual reports for 2016 showed they had a combined value of &euro;2.637 billion.  That increased according to their 2017 accounts to over &euro;3 billion.  It showed that the profit within the three REITs - I can individualise them but there is no point in going through that - was &euro;329 million.  It showed that their rent profit, which is a part of their overall profit, was &euro;117 million.</p><p>We have been able to deduce that 85% of ownership of these real estate investment trusts, REITs, are foreign owners.  This was confirmed by the Department of Finance through a parliamentary question.  It was also confirmed that the dividend withholding tax for these three REITs in 2016 totalled &euro;8 million.  According to their own accounts, they recorded profits of &euro;329 million.  As 85% is attributable to foreign ownership, it means they only paid &euro;8 million in tax, an effective rate of 3%.  We know the reason is because most of the profit recorded in their accounts is actually gains and assets appreciation.  None of that is taxed within the fund, which is an issue.  Even if one strips the gains out, one would have &euro;117 million of rental income profit.  The dividend withholding tax paid against that was &euro;8 million, an 8% effective tax rate.</p><p> These are multi-million euro funds making, according to their own accounts, in one year &euro;329 million of profit.  Of that, 15% will be dealt with differently because it is residential but 85% of it is foreign owned.  On the foreign portion, they only paid &euro;8 million tax.</p></speech>

Of this, they paid &euro;8 million in dividend withholding tax.  That is wrong.  It is not that they have done anything wrong.  The Oireachtas has done something wrong by creating this structure.</p> <p>  Recalling the earlier conversation, these are the guys who are outbidding first-time buyers.

There are however two more substantive amendments.  </p><p>The first substantive amendment relates to the taxation of transitional adjustments arising upon a change of accounting framework or the adoption of a new or amended accounting standard.  To ensure that the &quot;relevant amount&quot; is taxable or deductible, as the case may be, over a five year period following the transition, it is necessary to delete &ldquo;for the relevant period&rdquo; from paragraph (4)(c) and to substitute &ldquo;an accounting period&rdquo; for &ldquo;the relevant period&rdquo; in paragraphs (4)(d) and (4)(e). </p><p>The main substantive amendment is number 36, which concerns the tax treatment of accounting errors.  The legislation as currently drafted is inconsistent in that non-material or non-fundamental errors are subject to statutory interest and penalties whilst material or fundamental errors are not.  This amendment ensures that all accounting errors should be corrected by means of amended tax returns, subject to normal time limits.  Where this results in increased tax liabilities, statutory interest and penalties will apply.</p><p>In order to give effect to this amendment, the original subsections (5) and (6) have been deleted and replaced with a new subsection (5), which is based on an amalgamation of the original subsections (5) and (6).</p></speech>

It has meant that many private sector pension funds have gone out of existence.  I want to know if in the context of this change over the Minister or his Department has given any consideration to changing any of the accounting treatments in order to make provision for greater protection of defined benefit schemes in particular.  The system of accounting has inevitably led to the demise of a vast number of pension funds in private firms, in fact, there have been many different treatments.  In the case of Clerys, one thing that happened was the owners tried to rid themselves of pension liabilities.  In this context, does the Minister or anyone in his Department have any proposals to address this?  For people in the public sector or who are funded by the public sector, there is a system where people who are currently working are paying for the pensions of those who will retire in subsequent generations which means that the pensions are much more secure.  The same applies to the social insurance system where current contributors pay towards the State retirement pensions of people who have retired.  </p> <p>  Will any examination be carried out by the State of the implications particularly for pension funds which have caused enormous disruption in the way that they have been dealt with in the past.  Will there be a review from a public interest point of view of how pensions are accounted for?  </p></speech>

Pensions have not been raised with me as an issue in this context.  I have not given this matter consideration to date.  I am informed that this is an issue for the accounting code as opposed to it being a tax issue, but if the Deputy wishes to share information with me, I will engage with her.</p></speech>

This is probably the most difficult and certainly one of the most contentious issues in the field of accounting nationally and internationally because what has happened is that the accounting treatments have meant that many companies approach development and possible consolidation and other issues by seeking to limit liabilities in respect of pensions and do away with them altogether.  The consequence is that not just in Ireland but in many other countries workers end up losing their pensions.  I accept there is to be a review, however, I think it is very important particularly in the context of European standards that the provisioning and the accounting treatments of pensions should be looked at.  Clearly from the narrow view of a company, it may be simply about the company getting rid of the pension fund liabilities and it may become much more profitable, but there are social and economic consequences to a society where people do not have pensions.  The supplementary pension system, which I was involved in designing, was to try to overcome what has happened as a consequence of some of the accounting standard developments which have decimated pension provision in private companies.</p></speech>

I would be happy at a later point when the Finance Bill is enacted to come back to the Deputy to give her more information and a view on the matter, but the amendments to section 19 deal with a variety of different issues which are more technical in nature than the substantive issue the Deputy is raising.</p></speech>

In the Bill we are changing what is happening and moving from one set of standards to another, the fact is that because of the devastation that these changes have wrought to lots of people's jobs and pensions in this and other countries, I am simply asking if it possible to get a sense of the Minister's policy point of view, and where he stands on the retention of private pensions systems.</p></speech>

These substantive amendments are looking to ensure that when a company moves from one accounting standard to another that we do not lose any tax as a result.

Any adjustments which need to be made in order to compute taxable profits on a valid basis must be done by changing the tax computations for those periods.  However, the tax computations may only be amended subject to the normal statutory time limit for the correction of errors.</p> <p>  The Finance Bill 2017, as initiated, distinguishes between material or fundamental errors and non-material and non-fundamental errors which are recognised in the current year profit and loss accounts.  However, the Finance Bill 2017 as initiated incorrectly treats material or fundamental errors in the same way and this is the subject of this amendment No. 36.</p></speech>

In this country we have had and have in process a great deal of correction of accounts because we have moved from a situation ten years ago of wholesale collapses which resulted in very significant losses to a lot of companies, including financial companies, in particular.  In some cases, we know subsequently - but we do not know the extent of it - that there were errors and misrepresentations and so on in accounts because some cases have come before the law in different adoptions of different treatments, for example how loans were treated in Anglo Irish Bank.  Consequent on that and into the future - I tabled a related amendment - there will be situations where financial companies such as banking companies will have large accumulated losses.</p><p>I raised this issue with the Minister's predecessor and I was given very detailed information.  The amount of the accumulated losses, some of which arise from errors committed some time ago, are very valuable to the banks concerned.  What is the position in respect of looking back?  In particular, are these companies to be allowed to carry these losses, some of which arose as a result of all types of accounting errors and so on, into the future indefinitely?  The amount at issue runs to many billions.  </p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware, because we have previously discussed this issue, that the ability to carry losses forward is a feature of our tax code.  In recognition of the quantity of losses that our banks are carrying forward I am committed to the retention of the bank levy.  It provides me with an alternative mechanism to generate needed tax income from the banks in recognition of the support made available to them by the Irish taxpayer.  I do not have any plans, including by way of amendment of this Bill, to change that provision.</p></speech>

I was involved in the discussions that resulted in increases in bank levies, which in my view are a relatively poor substitute for taxes.  These rules were devised when the banks were mired in massive losses and there was not an optimistic view as to how quickly they might return to profitability.  The banks are now returning to profitability and will possibly return to very significant profitability into the future.  It is interesting that this is being done.  It shows that there is flexibility in the Department of Finance to address issues but not in the context of the future significant profits of the banks that were bailed out in terms of the indefinite carrying forward of losses.  This means effectively means that the banks on a voluntary basis can decide whether, for ten or more years, they will pay corporation tax.  In terms of accounting standards and so on this may be policy but it is a wrong policy, notwithstanding the levy.</p></speech>

It is my desire to ensure that we do not lose any tax revenue as that happens.  The Deputy is raising a different matter, which she is entitled to do, in regard to how we treat losses within our banking system.  As I said, how we deal with the treatment of losses corporately is a consequence of our tax code.  The Deputy knows well that if I were to make a change as to how we account for the taxation of losses within our banks, it would have consequences for capital levels within the banks and the value of our shareholding in the banks.  One of the reasons for these changes was the change in respect of the capital requirements for the banking system across Europe.  The retention of the bank levy mechanism provides an alternative means for the generation of much needed tax revenue from the banking system for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Essentially, these schemes involve converting what should be taxable income payments into capital payments to avail of the lower capital gains tax rates.  The potential charge to capital gains tax is then often avoided by the use of CGT reliefs such as retirement relief and entrepreneurial relief, resulting in funds being extracted by shareholders entirely tax free or at a significantly reduced tax liability.  It is unfair that some individuals are engaging in these tax avoidance structures solely to take advantage of lower tax rates.  This leads to unfair outcomes and puts other taxpayers who do not engage in such avoidance arrangements at a competitive disadvantage.  I am, therefore, taking steps to counter these avoidance schemes.</p><p>I am amending the distribution rules in section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for determining whether an amount is to be treated as a distribution of income for tax purposes.  The first amendment deals with a scheme which has been exploited by taxpayers in order to generate new capital in a company, without investing any fresh capital, so as to enable income to be turned into capital on a subsequent repayment of the share capital.  The distribution rules are being amended to ensure that any artificially generated capital will be properly subject to income tax when it is subsequently distributed to shareholders. </p><p>The second amendment to section 135 deals with another scheme identified by Revenue, which seeks to avoid a liability to income tax where a company indirectly buys back shares from a shareholder.  The provisions are being amended to ensure that distribution treatment correctly applies.</p><p>I am also bringing forward proposals to amend the capital gains tax provisions in order to restrict the availability of CGT relief in respect of certain connected party transactions by individuals.  This follows the identification by Revenue of three specific avoidance schemes in operation involving the disposal of assets to connected parties by individuals, without any change in the underlying beneficial ownership of the asset, in order to extract cash from a business in a tax free manner.</p><p>I am therefore restricting the availability of retirement relief and the revised entrepreneur relief in respect of such connected party transactions.  In addition, an amendment is being introduced in relation to inter-family disposals of shares and securities to ensure that the maximum tax-free threshold, which is laid down in the legislation, cannot be circumvented.</p></speech>

The Minister introduced an initiative in budget 2017, which ended up bringing in &euro;79 million when the estimate was &euro;30 million, but has he had or will he have discussions with Revenue prior to the completion of the passage of this legislation on the question of extra powers, particularly around anti-avoidance, in order that the Revenue can intervene and strike down transactions or structures that are clearly designed to deprive the Exchequer of revenue?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#GGG01300"><p>I tabled an amendment to section 21 that would have followed through on issues I raised during the earlier budgetary process to the effect that this measure, which allows for a capital allowance to be set off 100% of the profit recorded by a trading company, would revert to the pre-2014 position where only 80% would apply.  I welcomed the pre-2014 position.  I will go into details in terms of the motivation for the changes at that time.  It is my view that this should apply from now, and to capital allowances that have been onshored in the past number of years.  The Minister is of the view that the cap applies to capital expenditure incurred by a company on or after 11 October 2017.  I understand it is a policy choice, that there is no legal reason the Minister has to do this.</p> <p>  It is only fair to acknowledge the sterling work that Mr. Seamus Coffey has done on this in his report on corporation tax that was commissioned by the Minister following last year's budget.  I am sure the Minister has read the report.  Mr. Coffey wrote a blog which detailed the amount of revenue that has been lost and that will be lost in this tax year as a result of the measure the Minister is introducing only applying from 11 October this year.  Mr. Coffey argues strongly that there is no reason for that to be the case.  He makes the point that if the Minister did not apply this grandfathering effect, the amount of revenue that could be collected in 2018 would be &euro;1 billion as opposed to the &euro;150 million the Government is expecting.  Mr. Coffey also draws attention to the fact that the onshoring of these assets, mostly intellectual property, has resulted in increasing our GNI, which, as a result, has increased our contribution to the European Union, and the portion of the increase resulting from the onshoring of these assets equates to &euro;200 million.  He makes the easy calculation that in ten years we will pay approximately &euro;2 billion more to the European Union as a result of the onshoring of these assets and the conclusion being drawn is that we will not be taxing these during this period.  I am sure the Minister will say that this is deferred tax etc., but that is not necessarily the case.  That is only the case if the companies still exist in their current tax structure form at the point when all of these capital allowances are used up.  There is no certainty whatsoever that many of these highly mobile companies will have the same structure at that point in time and, therefore, will pay an increased level of taxes.  There are a number of companies that we could look at which have left these shores in the past, and that is where the Minister could get seriously caught out.  I cannot understand why when the author of the report, although he has not called for that, has made it clear that he sees no reason.  He makes it clear that if there are other companies willing to come here and if the Department expects &euro;150 million to be recouped from this then obviously people are still willing to come and invest in us.</p> <p>  Second, I have deep suspicions, as I said on budget night, about how this happened.  Before the Paradise Papers were released, I had serious concerns about how this happened.  The Paradise Papers only strengthen my suspicions.  The history of it is that in 2013, in the Finance Bill, the Government decided to end the stateless status following huge international pressure.  I, myself, was pursuing the Minister's predecessor with regard to this issue about stateless companies.  He kept on denying that we had the ability to end it.  I wrote legislation and pointed out the provision in the Act that needed to be changed.  That is exactly what happened in the Finance Bill in 2013 but, crucially, the effect of this only came into effect over a year later, on 1 January 2015.  Then we had the double Irish, which was closed down in the Finance Bill of 2014.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, told us that this was a mismatch between two tax codes, which is technically true, that we did not have the ability to close it down unilaterally, and that the only problem with the double Irish was that it had "Irish" in its name - that was the phrase the former Minister used on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Lo and behold, as a result of pressure, international and domestic, we had the double Irish closed down.  As the Government closed down that loophole, however, it made a conscious decision to change how capital allowances could be written off against profits.  Up until then, a level of profits could not be written off as capital allowances - it was 20% and 80% was the threshold - but the Government decided to increase it to 100%.  The Government knew that as a result of changing the residency status within our tax codes there would be onshoring of intellectual property, IP.  We now know what happened.  We see, from the 26% growth rate and so-called leprechaun economics, that hundreds of billions of euro worth of intellectual property was onshored in the State.</p><p> We now know from the Paradise Papers that during that period when the Government was ending the stateless rule - when we questioned the Minister on this we were told that to his knowledge only three companies were stateless - that of the three Apple subsidiaries based in Cork that has no tax residency here or anywhere in the world, two ended up in Jersey and one became an Irish resident company.  One of the Jersey companies, Apple Sales International, ASI, which had the rights to the intellectual property of Apple which was worth about &euro;170 billion sold those rights to Apple Operations Europe, AOE, which is the Irish resident company, and as a result of that it is able to use its capital allowances to write off against any profits in this State for a long period.  </p><p> How does this affect us?  Apple confirmed yesterday that all sales outside of the Americas are being registered through an Irish company in Cork.  The value of those sales is &euro;119 billion.  Apple confirmed that.  That was the same position prior to 2015 when we ended the stateless designation of those companies.  In 2014 they were stateless and had no tax residency so even though all this money went through a company which recorded a turnover or sales of &euro;119 billion they did not have to pay tax because they were not tax resident here or anywhere else and that is subject to the European Commission's infringement proceedings.  When we made them stateless, and now Apple have confirmed that all those sales are still being recorded in this State, one would imagine that we would be in receipt of a massive windfall of corporation tax from Apple.  That has not happened.  Apple paid &euro;1.5 billion, it tells us, over the last three years in taxation.  Some of this is on the public record and we know that a certain part of the company paid &euro;430 million, but where is the tax from the new company that is no longer stateless that now has sales recorded of &euro;119 billion?  It does not exist because even though the company is no longer stateless, the loophole, a measure the Minister's predecessor introduced, allows it to write off all these capital allowances, the intellectual property that was taken onshore, against all its profits.  Things had come to a point where no one could accept that any company could have no tax residency anywhere in the world so the Government closed that door on Apple but it gave them 13 or 14 months to get its act in order, which it did.  It went to Appleby, got its structure in place, sent the two companies to Jersey, registered one in Ireland, took the intellectual property over and then it used the capital allowances to pay no taxes.  </p><p> That the Government did that at that particular time is deeply suspicious.  I want the Minister to put on the record all the engagements which he, his predecessor and their officials had with Apple during that period.  I want him to tell us the lobbying by any individuals regarding the onshoring of intellectual property.  For instance, the head of tax in Allergan, a company based in County Mayo - an individual who has been reported in the context of the Paradise Papers but is not himself involved in the Paradise Papers, he is mentioned in the side reporting of the papers - lobbied the Government and talked about how, with the changes to tax residency, there needed to be certainty as a result of onshoring of intellectual property.  That is the point that I made at the beginning.  There is no way that the Minister or the Department did not know that a change of tax residency rules would result in an onshoring of intellectual property and, as such, I seriously question the Government's motivations, or the motivations of its predecessor, for closing what was a stateless company which was frowned up internationally and then opening a loophole to effectively give the same company an ability to continue not paying tax on sales in excess of &euro;100 billion.</p></speech>

Because this measure was passed via a financial resolution on the night of the budget it is in effect from now.  The measure became available and applicable from 11 October 2017.  In relation to the various points Deputy Doherty has put to me, before I refer to them I will make the point that the opportunity that is ahead of this country at the moment is one that other countries are pursuing and are aware of, namely, to be in a position where we have a combination of commercial activity, manufacturing activity, research and development activity and the registration of IP assets, all from the same company located within Ireland.  We have the potential to realise that because of the number of employers we already have located in this country whose companies tend to be associated with and tend to have intellectual property assets that have a high value.  As I look out, with many of the different issues that we have to manage, I see the prospect of us being able to achieve that form of co-location, as something that would be very valuable for Ireland.  In terms of the decisions that I have made in relation to the Finance Bill and this particular amendment, I will outline the reason I have decided to make it applicable from 11 October - it is applicable on a forward-looking basis - the Deputy is correct that it was a policy choice.  The legal framework was there to do it.  My judgment is that at the core of our corporate tax framework is the concept and value of predictability, of being able to explain to people that if they locate jobs and investment in our country that we will tax them in a certain way going forward and that people are clear on that.</p><p>My view was that if I introduced a measure like this that was retrospective in the context of assets that had already been moved here, it would deal a massive blow to my ability to be able to argue that our corporate tax code and the policy relating thereto are predictable, clear and certain.  In essence, I would have been claiming that we would now change how we would tax the assets a company had moved in here in the past as well.</p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty touched upon this point.  We are talking about the timing of payment of tax; it is deferred tax.  The Deputy stated that this might not apply because we might get an income stream from a company now because of how we tax the intellectual property asset.  The company might not be around in a number of years, however, at which point the reliefs relating to the depreciation of the asset would be gone and we might not be able to claim revenue from that company.  That is not a way in which I can structure tax policy.  I cannot structure tax policy on the basis of my personal view or that of the Government as to whether a company will be around in the future.  If companies are located here, are employing here and have investments located here, we must assume they will be here for a period.  Many of the companies that have been at the heart of the recent debate have had operations located in Ireland for many years.  I will not get into the debate over the tax affairs of a particular company tonight because I must respect its confidentiality as I would for any other taxpayer.</p><p> On the timing of this decision and the previous one, I have not had contact with any individual on the matter.  Mr. Seamus Coffey gave me a report.  On the basis of that report, I made a decision, in consultation with my Department and other Departments, on what I believed was the right choice.  I no more went out and sought the opinion of individual companies on this matter than I did with any other measure in this Finance Bill.  I made what I felt was the overall right decision for the country.</p><p> Before the change was made, the threshold stood at 80% and then it went to 100%.  At the time it went to 100%, many of the peer countries to which we would have compared ourselves would have treated intellectual property assets in the same way.  It is the right decision to introduce a cap in respect of the depreciation of intellectual property assets and how this is dealt with because of the scale of assets on which we are focusing.  When the decision was made to move it back to 100%, that was the case in other countries to which we would have compared ourselves and countries against which it was important for us to be competitive.</p><p> Having said that, I believe this is the right stance for us to take.  It is also apparent to me and to all who debate and discuss these matters that the scale of the assets being moved around is bigger than in the past.  What has had a decisive effect on the attractiveness of Ireland as a place in which such assets could be located is the effect of the OECD work that has happened throughout the world, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months, and that means it is no longer possible to locate these assets in other locations in which they would have been located in the past.  As a result, companies want to find locations for the assets.  It will be of long-term value to Ireland to have the assets located here, taxed in the way I propose and co-located with commercial, manufacturing, and research and development activity.  I am making this decision in the Finance Bill in the context of that view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#LLL00200"><p>The Minister has said the companies at the centre of this have a long-standing relationship with the State.  I accept that the Apple company in Cork that employs more than 4,000 people has been here for a long time.  Hopefully, it will stay for an equally long time.  We are not talking about the company for which the employees work; we are talking about the other companies.  Two of them skedaddled to Jersey.  Apple Sales International is no longer based in Ireland.  Apple Operations International is no longer based in Ireland; it is now based in Jersey.  They left because Ireland decided to end the stateless company status they enjoyed.</p> <p>  The other company Apple Operations Europe, AOE, decided to register here for one reason only.  It was because there is no tax implication on the profits attributed to all the sales of products recorded by that company outside America, worth &euro;119 billion, because it is allowed to use its capital allowance against its taxes.  It is able to do that because the Government and the Minister's predecessor allowed that change to happen.</p> <p>  Was the Minister, his predecessor or the Department aware that as a result of the change to the residency rules there would be an increase in the onshoring of IP?  Was the Minister lobbied on giving certainty to these companies onshoring IP?  Was that factored into the judgment to change the threshold from 80% to 100%?  The consequence of that was that in the period from 2014 to 2015, the claims for capital allowances went up from &euro;2.8 billion to &euro;28 billion, a massive increase.  However, it does not end there because hundreds of billions worth of IP was taken onshore during that period.  I ask the Minister to answer first those questions on the lobbying of Department of Finance and the Minister over certainty of IP onshoring as a direct result the changes in residency the Government introduced in 2013 and 2014.  I know it happened.  Companies lobbied to have IP onshored.  The Paradise Papers inform us what Apple is doing.  Once all Apple's capital allowances are used up, AOE could move to Jersey or anywhere and then we will never see the taxation on the profits.</p> <p>  We need to remember what we are talking about here.  We have discussed a lot of stuff in respect of this Bill over the past two days.  The Minister is deciding to forgo &euro;850 million of tax.  To change that all we have to do is change four numbers in the Finance Bill - just the date of implication.  The Minister wants it only to apply going forward because he wants certainty for Apple that it will not have to pay a penny in tax for the next decade on the &euro;190 billion in transactions it is recording in an Irish company.  That is what the Minister is doing.</p> <p>  There are serious questions.  I have serious suspicions that a deal was done.  It may not have been done directly sitting across the table with Apple because people are smarter than this.  However, the Minister knew when the Government closed down the stateless companies that those stateless companies had to do something - either leave here for another jurisdiction, which two of them did, or register here.  Allowing them to take their IP onshore and increasing that to 100% gave them a massive windfall.  It is not just Apple, but Apple is the major beneficiary of it.</p><p>The Commission is now looking into its post-2015 structure.  This stinks to high heavens.  As the Minister has said, this is a policy choice.  It has been made by the Minister and not by his officials or legal advisers.  He has decided to let an annual sum of &euro;850 million go amiss.  He has decided to let Apple be able to write off its taxes and to settle for the &euro;150 million that will come in the future.  That is not sensible.  Is the Minister aware of the lobbying that went on regarding the proposal to move intellectual property onshore as a result of the changes in tax residency rules?  Did that factor into the decision made by the Minister at that time?  Will the Minister release all of the documents relating to lobbying directly to the Minister, the Minister of State or any officials within the Department over the period from 2013 to 2015, including any direct or indirect contact with Apple or any of its subsidiaries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#MMM00200"><p>Everything about the Apple situation, including the changes made in the budget by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in 2014, stinks to high heaven.  Frankly, it stretches credibility that this happened at a time when new political forces had come into this D&aacute;il.  In 2012 and 2013, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I raised at the then Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform the massive loopholes we could see in the corporate tax regime.  We suggested that the effective rate being paid by big corporations like Apple was a tiny fraction of 12.5%.  The double Irish arrangement was at the centre of that.  There are plenty of other examples of loopholes.  We will talk about some of them in a moment.  When the spotlight began to come on, the reaction of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and Fianna F&aacute;il was to close ranks immediately in order to protect Apple.  In July 2013, when this stuff was starting to be debated, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I proposed that representatives of Apple, Google and Facebook should be brought before the finance committee to face questions about the tax affairs of those companies.  The cameras were literally shut off as a result of a manoeuvre from the Chairman of the committee.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, along with Deputy Donnelly and a couple of others, voted to switch off the cameras while we debated whether Apple and the other companies might be brought in.  Not only did they not want those companies to come in, but they did not even want anyone to know we were discussing whether they should come in.</p> <p>  In 2013, the Government closed ranks to protect Apple and ensure it was not questioned about what it was up to.  At this time, international and domestic pressure was building with regard to the double Irish arrangement.  Right up to the last moment, the Government denied that this country was playing any role in that arrangement.  It was finally forced to announce that it would be closed, although it is worth noting that it is still not closed.  It is still operable up to 2020 for companies that have benefited from it.  Apple, and probably others, had to try to find a new way of evading tax.  In January 2014, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple.  I would love to know what happened at that meeting.  I do not know what happened.  The closeness of this Government's relationship with Apple is remarkable.  We know from the Paradise Papers, or, as I like to call them, the parasite papers, that in March 2014, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple began to search for new ways to avoid paying tax.  According to one of the leaks, Baker McKenzie, which was acting on behalf of Apple, contacted Appleby about its various tax haven locations and asked it to "confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction".  That is what Apple wanted to do.  It wanted to avoid paying any tax at all and, as we have now discovered, that is what it did.</p> <p>  Shortly afterwards, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, decided to change the allowances regime for intangible assets, such as Apple's intellectual property assets from which it derives its profits and around which much of its tax evasion activity centres.  I refer to the manner in which it sells ideas or intellectual property assets from one arm of the company to another, thereby turning profits into costs and consequently writing down its tax liabilities.  Oddly and strangely, we made this change at this time.  It is quite extraordinary.  Frankly, I do not even understand why it should get an 80% allowance, never mind a 100% allowance.  Why should it get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets?  I would like somebody to explain that to me.  When one arm of a company supposedly sells something to another arm of the company, which is a joke in and of itself, the company in question is allowed to claim massive allowances and gain enormous tax benefits that are worth hundreds of millions of euro to the company.  We used to give this company an 80% tax break, but in the year in question, that was increased to 100%.  Why did that happen?  Is it a coincidence that it happened in the same year that Apple had to start thinking about restructuring its tax avoidance strategies?  It moved one of its subsidiaries, which was previously based here, to the Channel Islands.  I presume that company now sells the asset to the Irish-registered company without having to pay any tax on the profit it gets.  It has discovered via Appleby that it pays no tax whatsoever there.  The 100% allowance that the Irish subsidiary gets allows it to write down all of its profits which derive from that intellectual property for the next decade or so.  It is quite extraordinary.  Can the Minister explain how it happened?  Why was that decision made in 2014?</p></speech>

On the question of contact between the Department of Finance and Apple, it is obvious that this was a number of years ago and predates my arrival in the Department.  I will consult my departmental officials on the matter to see how contact can be established.  The one principle I want to be absolutely clear on is that Ireland does not set its tax policy on the basis of any particular company, such as the company mentioned by the Deputy or any other company.  We base our corporate tax policy, like all tax policies that are relevant to parts of our economy, on what we think and judge to be the right thing for the economy and for the taxpayer overall.  We do not make tax policy on the basis of what any particular company wants or needs.</p></speech>

This is why the EU is very suspicious, yet again.  We have already been told we should have collected &euro;13 billion of tax that we did not collect.  The Government has still not taken that money and the interest off Apple and put it in an escrow account.  As soon as there was movement on that particular tax avoidance strategy, lo and behold, we made changes which ensure Apple does not pay a single cent more than it was paying previously.</p><p>Not a single cent.  It is perfect restructuring, almost to the euro.  It involves the Channel Islands and the changes in the intangible asset allowance.  It works out so perfectly that companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  Their spin is that they did not pay any less tax.  Brilliant.  They did not, however, pay any more tax; they paid exactly the same amount of tax.  With regard to their tax liability, the net effect of closing down the double Irish is zero as they do not pay any more tax.  This company is nakedly avoiding tax.  Was the Minister aware of this and will he acknowledge that this is what these companies were and are doing?  We might quibble about what the Minister did or did not do, but the reason there had to be movement against the double Irish is because these companies were just nakedly and rampantly seeking to avoid paying tax.  What they are doing is immoral; companies are looking around for tax jurisdictions and loopholes in our tax code so they pay no tax.  We say it is nothing to do with us, it is inconsistencies between tax codes and there is nothing we can do about it.  Yet, Ireland seems to facilitate these companies.  First with the double Irish and when a light is shone on the double Irish we then, coincidentally, facilitate them in a new way.  We may have done it inadvertently.  Is that the explanation?  Inadvertently, the change that was made in 2014 perfectly succeeds in doing exactly what Apple would want to do, given that there was a problem developing with the double Irish tax avoidance strategy.  This is too much of a coincidence.  Does the Minister believe that anybody who looks at this would not say it is too much of a coincidence?  The net result is that these companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  How convenient.  Does the Minister not believe that the European Union and Commissioner Vestager have some justification for being suspicious of this and that anybody looking on would say "Jesus, that stinks"?</p></speech>

Seamus Coffey's online blog makes for very insightful reading.  In 2014, when the 80% cap last applied, &euro;2.6 billion of capital allowances were claimed under that regime.  In 2015, when the cap was increased to 100%, &euro;28.9 billion was claimed for capital allowances under that regime.  This is a more than tenfold increase in the amount of capital allowances claimed in 2015 over 2014.  Presumably, this is directly linked to the change of the cap from 80% to 100%.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show there was a &euro;26 billion increase in intangible asset related gross trading profits in 2015.  There was a dramatic change in the onshoring and the claiming of capital allowances against intangible asset related income.  Does the Minister have data on how much intellectual property, IP, was actually onshored since the change came into effect in the Finance Act 2014?  We need to tease out what is there with regard to stock, IP and related capital allowances since that period of time.  A while ago the Minister said that the corporation tax system should be certain and predictable.  Up to 2014 he had the 80% cap then he removed that and it became 100%.  Now, less than three years later it is going back to 80%, but all the IP, which was onshored in the intervening period, will continue to benefit from the 100% set-off around the limit on income; they can be offset by the capital allowances and the IP.  Will the Minister give the committee the data he has on the IP that was onshored so we can tease out, from a tax point of view, the consequences of treating the capital allowances associated with those?</p></speech>

We set our tax policy, be it corporation tax or any other policy, on the basis of what we judge to be the right thing for the economy overall and the long-term interests of the Irish taxpayer.  Across the period in which we have made decisions like that, we have seen an increase in corporate tax receipts overall.  This point is missing in the analysis that is being offered here.  In 2014 corporation tax receipts were &euro;4.6 billion.  They grew to &euro;6.9 billion.  For this year we are currently expecting corporation tax receipts of &euro;8.3 billion.  We are collecting more corporation tax at the moment.  One of the factors in this is changes that have been made over the last number of years in how we structure our corporate tax policy.</p> <p>  I have been asked how we can handle IP that moved here in the past.  Again, I will emphasise two points.  We are talking about the timing in which depreciation reliefs are run down.  Overall this makes a big difference to the timing in which tax is collected.  It is a timing issue around when we actually collect tax from companies.  Alongside that, while much of the debate here is focused on a particular company, I have to consider that this is a tax policy I would have to set for every company located in Ireland.  I would have to say to every company that has an intellectual property asset, regardless of its form, that Ireland would change how it taxed the assets the company had moved here in the past.  It was my judgment, and my decision, that a policy such as that would undermine the predictability at the heart of our corporate tax offering, and which is essential to its competitiveness with all the change that is under way now.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath asked about figures and I have some of them.  I have the figures relating to the corporate tax reliefs that have been claimed but I believe the Deputy already has those.  The other figures that I have available to me from our national accounts relate to the purchase of patents, which is part of the movement of intellectual property assets.  Those figures are as follows: in 2014 it was &euro;1.9 billion; in 2015 it was &euro;8.3 billion; in 2016 it was &euro;35 billion; and in the first half of 2017 it was &euro;11 billion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#NNN00400"><p>When the Minister says that Ireland's corporate tax revenue has increased he forgets to mention the extraordinary rise in profits during that period.  The percentage increase in profits far outstrips any proportionate increase in tax revenue.  For example, 2012 pre-tax trading profits were &euro;76 billion.  By 2015 these had gone up to &euro;149 billion.  As we know, and we can surmise, a vast amount of that is attributable to these companies' enormous and spectacular increase in profits that are beyond belief.  A doubling of aggregate corporate tax profits is overwhelmingly attributable to a small number of companies.</p><p>Just as those profits go through the roof we give them extra tax allowances to ensure that there is not a commensurate increase in the proportion of tax that we will get from it.  I accept that there is some increase - how could there not be - when profits increase to that extent.  Proportionately, however, the effective rate is going down not up.  It is actually going down and it is already pitifully low.</p><p> In addition, the effective rate as against the total profits is actually falling for these companies because of measures that we are taking or our failures to close down these loopholes.  In doing that they are robbing this country of tax revenues that we should be getting.  They are also robbing people all around the world.  All of the tax and global justice groups say this kind of behaviour that Apple, Facebook and Google are engaging in is the major contributory factor to growing global inequality, poverty and deprivation.  These people are robbing us blind in a deliberate, naked and explicit drive to ensure that they pay no taxes whatsoever.  </p><p> The Minister has not really answered the question as to whether he finds that morally repugnant.  Is the Government bothered by that?  The signs are, given the behaviour of the Government, that it does not find it repugnant but in fact at best turns a blind eye to it and at worst is actively colluding with it.  Deputy Doherty and I have both set out the chain of events where very serious questions are now also being asked by the European Union about what happened and why it happened.  We also need to know about the lobbying and the interactions that this Government had with Apple and with any of these other companies.</p><p> The one aspect on which I will agree with the Minister is that this is not about one company, although there is definitely one favoured company that is leading the charge.  It concerns a few companies, a very small number.  It is maybe five to ten companies who accrue these massive tax benefits because of the regime that we have and the changes that we made in terms of window we created for them between 2014 and now.  The move to reintroduce the 80% rate is closing the door after the horse has bolted and followed the massive onshoring of these assets.  That allows those companies to pay no tax for a decade ahead against these enormous profits.  It looks like collusion.  Their behaviour is certainly immoral.  Does the Minister agree that it is immoral?  </p><p> If the Minister does agree that it is immoral, why do we not capture the additional tax benefit that these companies have accrued as a result of the change from the 100% to the 80% going back to when that change was made?  Why do we not do that if we think it is wrong?  I do not see how anybody could say what they are doing is not wrong.  Why do we not do it?  Is it because we made an agreement with them?  Is it that we gave assurances to Apple and a few others at the time that we are going to allow them to do that?  Otherwise, I do not see why we would not do it.  Many people, and not just the left and Sinn F&eacute;in, are saying that the window they were given should be closed and we should recover that 20% difference which resulted from the changes in 2014 and, in the process, get the &euro;800 million or so that would accrue if we did that.</p></speech>

We will have differing views regarding what that level of tax could be because of potentially differing views regarding those companies and the role they play.  However, I strongly believe that they should pay their fair share of tax.  That is the reason why I am committed to putting in place the different measures that form part of the OECD work that is underway and having them enacted in the Irish tax code.  It is important that we all move in a co-ordinated way across the world to make sure that opportunities do not exist for companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  I strongly believe that to be the case and that is one of the reasons why I am committed to the OECD process and one of the reasons why in the Finance Bill I am seeking to make progress in that area.</p> <p>  With regard to the point concerning an allegation of collusion, I want to state again very clearly that we do not make tax policy on the basis of the needs of any company.  We do it on the basis of what we judge and believe to be the right thing for the economy overall or for a sector within the economy.  That has been my guiding principle in making this decision to go back to 80% because I believe that it is the right thing for our economy.  I also believe it is the right thing in the context of the scale of these assets and their movement across the world that we have this form of taxing them.  </p> <p>  In regard to why I will not go back, in terms of the point the Deputy raises, it goes back to the earlier point I made here that I do not do tax policy on the basis of individual companies.  If I was to make a decision like this it would apply to all companies and all intellectual property assets.  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is my view that if I was to make a change like that if would affect the view that people have regarding what Ireland is offering now and in the future, including many companies that have not been mentioned here that have investments in the country.  It is because of that that I am making this decision and for this move that will have had effect since the night of the Budget Statement.  </p> <p>  On the question of the section the Deputy is putting to me, that is making clear that this relief will have to apply to all of a trade as opposed to part of a trade.  As currently defined, a relevant trade makes reference only to relevant activities which are carried out as part of a trade.  This is now shifting that definition to say that now it must take account of all of the trade.</p></speech>

The Minister has put on record the figures for the purchase of patents for the years 2014 to 2017, inclusive.  Let us call it the onshoring of intellectual property, IP, during the 100% window.  Do we know how many companies those figures represent?</p></speech>

The information that I gave came from the Central Statistics Office so I do not have that information.  The figures referred to the purchase of patents, as I said when I gave the information earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#PPP01100"><p>I wish to make a point about the change made in the Finance Act 2014.  Since then, in 2015 the figure was &euro;8.3 billion; in 2016 the figure was &euro;35 billion; and in the first half of 2017 the figure is &euro;11 billion.  I interpret that to mean a total of about &euro;55 billion of patent purchases was onshored.  All of that money is now in the system.  Therefore, a 100% corresponding amount of trading income can be offset by the capital allowances related to that IP.  If it was 80% then the sum would be &euro;44 billion.  The difference is &euro;11 billion in terms of the amount of related trading income that can be offset by the capital allowances associated with those intangible assets.  That is the net issue of what is involved in dropping the axe on budget night or making a retrospective change to take account of the IP that is already in the system since the Minister made the change in the 2014 Act.</p></speech>

As I said, I am looking to move the percentage back to 80% because I believe it is the right way in which these assets now need to be taxed.  I do not want to do this in any way that is backward looking because, as I have said on a number of occasions, I am very concerned about the effects it could have on how this tax policy is perceived.</p></speech>

So, at a point in time, when the depreciation reliefs that are available are gone, the Irish State will receive more tax.  What I am trying to do here is smooth out the tax in income that will be available to the State over a longer time period to make them more sustainable.  It is my assessment that moving to an 80% rate will allow that to happen.  As opposed to us receiving a large amount of additional taxation at a point in the future, granted this assumes that companies still exist, as opposed to us moving to that scenario where there is a big amount in the future and nothing in between, I am trying to get to a point where we can smooth out the tax revenues that are available and post some of that forward.  The provision is not going to affect the total amount of tax liability that is available to the State over the lifespan of the asset.</p></speech>

There is a lot of uncertainty concerning the question of it just being a timing difference.  If one assumes that everything continues as it is then one would be right that it is a matter of timing.  However, there are a lot more moving parts and this matter is moving so quickly.</p></speech>

It is my assessment that a further moving part, that we would move to, would be if we were to make a kind of change that looked backwards.  It is my view that such a move would have an effect on our ability to retain investment, jobs and all of those things in our country and, therefore, corporate tax policy, and the certainty of it, is so important.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's concerns about the presence and diversity of different companies in the future, I will reiterate the following.  Some of the companies that we have talked about have been based in Ireland for a very long period.  We are talking about a corporate tax stream that has grown.  I do not believe that it will continue to grow at this rate in the future though I cannot be certain.  Mr. Coffey, in his report on corporation tax, made the point that he believes our revenue streams, as projected at present, will be stable up to 2020, which is quite an horizon to have available to me in terms of making an assessment like this one.</p></speech>

The point is that section 21 of the Act has two subsections.  Subsection (1)(a) has been explained as an insignificant tidying-up exercise but it will nonetheless be applied from 8 May 2009.  The principle of retrospection, therefore, is included here.  The Minister's decision not to apply the capital expenditure for the intellectual property that was onshore up until now does not stand up to rigorous testing.  I understand that the Minister wants to give certainty and so forth but it is a certainty to companies like Apple that they will continue to be able to write down their tax liability for several more years.  We are only just starting to see the tip of the iceberg that is the Paradise Papers and I have no doubt but that we will see more of a spotlight being shone on tax structures.</p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of lobbying.  Are the Minister and his officials aware of the lobbying that took place when the Government changed the threshold from 80% to 100% in 2014?  Will the Minister inform the committee of this?  Will he give a commitment, if he does not have the information to hand, to inform us of all of the individuals, groups and representative bodies who lobbied the Department, the Minister and the Ministers of State on this issue, either directly or indirectly?  We already know, for example, that during this very period the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland was lobbying the Department for the threshold to be increased.  I do not know if Apple is a member of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland but I am sure that it has the interests of Apple and companies like it at heart.  That chamber lobbied as part of its pre-budget submission in 2015 for the threshold to be increased.  What is interesting is that it only asked for it to go up to 90%, whereas the Government went the whole hog of raising it to 100%.  We also know that the Department was lobbied on the onshoring of intellectual property as a result of the change to the tax residency rules.  We know that the Minister himself was lobbied by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland with regard to tax changes.  I would like him to inform the committee now if any of this concerned the threshold and the date from which it would apply.  Was there any discussion of that when he had a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland?  Will he also put on the record if he or his officials have had any other meetings with representative groups with regard to any aspect of this issue?  Did the Department notify, engage with or seek the opinion of any of these companies?  I do not mean directly with the companies themselves, of course, as we know how these things work and it is usually through legal representatives.  Did the Department seek advice from bodies outside of the Department with regard to the application of this section?</p></speech>

We had a wide-ranging discussion on a number of matters, but not on this particular issue.  I have not had meetings with any companies on the matter and I have not met any company or individual on this matter, outside of the standard work that I would carry out on this.  I obviously met Mr. Seamus Coffey, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, I had many meetings within my own Department on this matter, and I also sought the view of other Departments with regard to the Coffey report and what I was considering doing.  When it comes to the contacts that my officials have had both now and in the past, I am certainly not in a position to speak about what happened several years ago because, as the Deputy has acknowledged, I was not in the Department at the time.  I will ask my Department to see what records are available for the periods in question, though I am sure the Deputy may have got access to them through other means.  I will come back to the committee when I have an answer to this.</p></speech>

We have made the point.  To paraphrase the Minister, he said the Government does not gear its tax policy around any particular company.  That is probably true because I think it was more around a group of companies.  The Minister did refer to sectors of industry.  I think it was a group of companies who benefitted from this.  We are all familiar with names such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and a few others.  I believe that whether it was through direct lobbying or just the servile attitude that successive Governments, not just that of which Deputy Donohoe is a part, but previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, have shown towards those companies to the effect that they just want to do anything they can to please them and that means tailoring the tax code to suit their purposes.</p><p>We have had the discussion so there is no point in labouring it.  We clearly disagree on this issue.  However, I take issue with the argument the Minister made about what would happen were we to go back and close the window that was opened for them in 2014, which the Minister is only closing now after all the intangible assets have been onshored and where they will derive the tax benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years.</p><p>I do take issue with the argument the Minister makes that, were we to go back and close the window that was opened for these companies in 2014, and which he is only closing now after all these intangible assets have already been onshored, and where they will derive the enormous benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years, many other people might be affected where there might be a legitimate basis for their expectation to benefit from that change.</p><p> I do not know how the Minister does not draw a distinction between a company that might actually purchase an intellectual property asset, where it is a genuine cost on the company, and a company that is clearly doing this as an accountancy exercise, where it is not a cost on the company because it is buying the asset from itself and has set up a network of companies purely for the purposes of minimising its tax liability and benefitting from these kinds of allowances.  I just do not see how the Minister does not draw the distinction and why the tax code cannot so do.  Of course, if there are legitimate costs for a business, it is reasonable that it should get an allowance on those costs against its trading profits to reduce its tax liability.  However, this is a case of Apple, Google or Facebook moving around assets between its own subsidiaries in order to manipulate the tax code and reduce its tax liability.  Everyone knows that, the Minister know it, and we have known it since long before 2014 and the onshoring of these assets.  All of the tax avoidance that has been engaged in by these companies all centred around similar types of manoeuvres around intellectual property and payments of one subsidiary to another, whether from stateless subsidiaries that were incorporated here but not tax-liable here or subsidiaries that are no longer stateless but are located in Jersey, where they do not have to pay tax anyway, so it is the same difference.  It is the same type of tax avoidance strategy and it is one company doing it.  Therefore, I do not see how they can in any sense be deemed legitimate costs.  It is just a way for such companies to reduce their tax liabilities on their absolutely staggering profits, and they are literally writing their own tax bills.  They are deciding how much tax they will pay, not the Government, the tax code or the nominal tax rate.  None of that actually determines how much tax they pay; they decide how much tax they pay through a manipulative accountancy exercise.  I do not see how the Minister deems that to be legitimate and, as I said, why he cannot draw a distinction between companies that clearly are engaged in tax avoidance and companies that might actually have a legitimate claim on an allowance.</p></speech>

I will list the key ones, given the claims the Deputy has just made.  Relief is only available where a company is carrying out a bona fide trading activity in respect of the management, development or exploiting of intangible assets.  Relief is not available in respect of any expenditure incurred as part of a tax avoidance scheme.  Under the scheme, allowances can only be offset against income of development trade in which the intangible assets are used, not against any other profits.  An arm's-length rule applies, ensuring that the correct amount of income expenditure is attributed to the relevant trade and to prevent excessive relief being claimed.  Finally, provision is made for Revenue to engage an expert to assist in the determination of arm's-length values where necessary, and the Revenue Commissioners keep these measures under review all the time to make sure they are operated as intended.</p></speech>

It may be the case that the profits then derive, as the Minister says, from that piece of intellectual property, but the parent company is deciding how much one charges the other and is setting the cost at precisely the level that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax.  That is what these companies are doing, and we all know it, so it is a tax avoidance strategy.  As the Minister said, our tax code - I cannot remember the exact section - actually refers to not allowing, or prohibiting, things that are very obviously tax avoidance tactics.  This, to my mind, is very obviously just that, and everyone knows it is, but we allow it.  I do not see how the Minister can stand over it, frankly, but-----</p></speech>

It is worth saying the same groups we have just talked about are the major beneficiaries of this: the Apples, Googles and Facebooks and probably the pharmaceutical companies and so on.  A relatively small number of companies benefit from this vast array of allowances, deductions and reliefs.  What we seek in moving this amendment is a really detailed look at these, with a view to trying to close down all these loopholes that are being exploited to reduce the effective rate being paid by a small number of corporations.  I think the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country do pay in or around the 12.5% because they cannot for the most part utilise many of these reliefs.  It is the big players, the favoured, pampered few of these extraordinarily profitable corporations, that are the big beneficiaries and have the accountants, the consultants and the lawyers and so on to maximise the benefit they derive from all these reliefs.  The scale of the tax benefits they derive is quite extraordinary.  We have talked about the intangible assets.  Another one I came across looking at Revenue's list of these reliefs and allowances is the one entitled intra-group transactions.  I would not mind hearing a little more about this one, which was a relief that cost the Exchequer &euro;2.9 billion in 2015 and &euro;9 billion in 2016.  Again, it is one of these reliefs where we see a staggering increase over one year.</p><p>If the officials want the document to which I have referred it is the second page of a Revenue document titled Cost of Tax Allowances, Credits, Exemptions and Reliefs<b>.</b>It details the various reliefs.  Losses, including capital allowances brought forward from earlier years, were mentioned earlier, and account for &euro;2.7 billion; group relief costs &euro;254 million; research and development tax credit, &euro;700 million; and capital allowances totalling &euro;6 billion.  The total of these, when we add them all up and set them against profits, is extraordinary.  Mr. Seamus Coffey remarks on this in what is a very good paper.  As I have said before, I do not agree with his ultimate conclusions, as I do not think they are radical enough.  However, he comments on the enormous increase in these deductions and allowances.  He writes that they have increased from &euro;18.9 billion in 2003 to &euro;97 billion in 2015.  Those are all tax loopholes that a small number of corporations benefit from.  I repeat, the increase is from &euro;18.9 billion to &euro;97 billion, an extraordinary jump by any standards.<br/><br/>If the small and medium enterprises are for the most part actually paying the 12.5% rate, this explains how a small number of corporations benefitting from these reliefs have actual effective tax rates of 1%, 2%, or in some cases less than 1%.  At the same time, their total aggregate profits, as I mentioned earlier, have gone from &euro;76 billion in 2012 to &euro;149 billion, more than doubling.  There is no doubt that this doubling of profits is attributable to the same small group of companies.  Yet the tax that we get from it does not double.  If gross trading profits double over that period, then one would think our tax revenue would double.  Yet that is not the case.  The increase is from about &euro;4 billion to about &euro;6 billion.  That is a 50% increase in corporate tax revenue, roughly speaking, but there has been more than a 100% increase in profits in that period.  How does one explain that?  It is explained by the fact that we have had this dramatic increase in allowances, reliefs and deductions.  <br/><br/>Do the members not think we should do something about that, and move towards some sort of minimum effective rate so that these players would be forced to pay a fair contribution in tax, rather than doing what we are doing at the moment?  If I give the best interpretation of what the Government is doing, it is chasing them around, trying to catch up with them as their lawyers and accountants engineer ever more imaginative and innovative ways to get around and exploit the tax code, to open up loopholes and so on.  That is the most benign explanation of what is happening.<br/><br/>However, I believe it is worse than that.  I think there is collusion.  Even if I am wrong, surely the way to deal with it, to stop this behaviour, to stop this exploitation of loopholes and to make these people pay a fair proportion of their enormous profits in tax, is to introduce some sort of minimum effective rate.  I would go further.  I would do that and raise the nominal rate.  I know that would be unthinkable for the Minister but could we not at least introduce a minimum effective rate, so that they actually pay the 12.5%?  <br/><br/>These companies would still be making staggering levels of profit.  I do not believe they would leave the country if we did that, because even if they actually pay the 12.5% they would still be paying significantly less here than they are in most jurisdictions in Europe, at least in western Europe, which is where they want to be.  I am sure they want to be in English-speaking western Europe, so our real competition for a lot of this investment is probably only Britain and Scotland.<br/><br/>Would that not be a fair and reasonable thing to do?  Would it not be fair and reasonable, as this amendment suggests, to at least look at all of these allowances and deductions, examine how they are being exploited by these corporations, and look at ways of trying to increase the tax take from them?</p></speech>

My amendment is different, but it captures some of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  It focuses specifically on the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit.  I believe there is a value to the R&amp;D tax credit.  I am not arguing for it to be abolished but I am concerned about the way it is set.  I am concerned about the fact that it is out of control and that the cost of this tax credit is increasing dramatically.  We need to do something about it.  It needs to be reformed.  We see that the cost of the tax credit in 2010 was &euro;224 million, yet five years later it went up to &euro;708 million.  That is a huge increase in a tax credit.</p> <p>  We also see that the number of companies availing of the tax credit has actually decreased, particularly in the 2013-15 period, when the tax credit increased by &euro;300 million.  We know from the data provided by the Revenue and from the independent analysis that ten companies are currently claiming two thirds of the credit.  Some &euro;460 million of it is going to ten companies.  We also know that &euro;283 million of it is dead weight, that is, research and development worth &euro;283 million would have been carried out anyway.  In any type of tax credit there will be a portion of dead weight but 40% is on the high end.  </p> <p>  I know the Government is not there to please me but I do not think it is a good practice to release a lot of these reports on budget day.  A case in point was the help-to-buy report.  I do not think there was anything in that report that could have affected the market, and it could have been released a week before.  This review of the tax credits is another example because there is so much information surrounding it.  It is good that there is so much information in the budget documents but when reports like that are published online on that day they sometimes do not get the attention they deserve.  The evaluation was not a full evaluation or a cost-benefit analysis, and that is something that should be done on the R&amp;D tax credit.  It did recognise that the relief is reasonably successful but it notes that this must be immediately qualified by referring to the notable dead weight associated with this unrestricted fiscal incentive and it goes on to refer to the 40% dead weight. </p> <p>  One of the key things that jumped out at me is that when this report was done, the cost of the tax credit for 2015 was not known.  At the end of the conclusions it suggests, as another approach, lowering the tax reduction to firms that need a break.  The report notes that the value of outstanding credits in 2014 was &euro;592 million and given the size of this future liability to the Exchequer, it recommends considering how to prevent it from increasing even further in the future.  The authors go on to suggest a number of ways in which that can be done.  In 2014, the figure was &euro;553 million, yet within a year it jumped to &euro;708 million.  God knows where it was in 2016, and indeed 2017, but on this basis we could be looking at a billion-euro tax credit very soon.  The problem here is that two thirds of it is going to the top ten companies, so it does not reach small and medium enterprises.  Indeed, the report refers to the fact that younger companies are not benefitting from this and it refers to a wait-and-see approach.  That is not good for younger companies.</p> <p>  We have a scheme that is not working and is costing a lot of money.  The number of companies that it are availing of it shrinking, yet the cost of it is increasing and there is significant dead weight.</p><p>While 40% of dead weight might be acceptable in a lower-cost scheme, when the dead weight is at over &euro;250 million, we have to ask about the structure of the tax credit.  My amendment therefore calls for a report within six months setting out the specific actions to be taken to reform the research and development tax credit, reduce the cost of the credit, stop abuses relating to inflated claims and make the credit more appropriate for SMEs.  I refer to abuses because there appears to be a mismatch in the CSO data and the data provided by companies.  That could be the result of an inflation of research and development for the purposes of gaining the tax credit.  That is something that would need to be teased out.  I am not asking the Minister to amend this now as I do not really know how to do that.  There is a report already which has provided a number of suggestions.  We need to signal the fact that there will be changes to the research and development tax credit, in relation to which the Minister needs to carry out a proper and full cost-benefit analysis as suggested.  It is time to look at implementing some of the recommendations suggested.</p></speech>

This is specifically on the research and development tax credit.  I am asking the Minister to consider whether the amount of money which has been given in a tax allowance for research and development to a very small number of corporations, as has already said, would be better spent on public universities.  The debate is often framed as follows.  If one is against research and development credits, one is claimed to be against innovation and research and development.  I am very much in favour of research and development but there is an opportunity cost in giving the funding to private companies through tax expenditures because that money is not going to public universities. There would be a lot more benefit and advantage for the domestic economy if that happened.  I refer to the real Irish economy as against the economy that exists around a tiny number of multinational corporations which could be gone at any point and who get far more from us than we get from them.  We should look at which approach would provide a greater benefit to the Irish economy and society as a whole.  Is it to continue with this very large tax expenditure which benefits private corporations or is it to provide that money for research and development in our public universities?  I ask the Minister to address that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110800002#WWW00300"><p>Before I do so, I have been asked to refer two matters to the committee.  This will only take one moment to do.  First, I have been asked by the Revenue Commissioner to clarify a comment made during the earlier discussion on REITs.  REITs do not get a tax deduction for local property tax.  REITs pay a dividend out of the profits available for distribution and the shareholders are taxed on the amount received.  I think there was an exchange earlier that may not have given that point the certainty it needed.  On another matter relating to section 8 of the Bill, my officials have advised me that a technical amendment may be required to make the section work as intended.  I am signalling that I may need to bring such an amendment forward on Report Stage.</p> <p>  On the amendments proposed by Deputies Doherty and Boyd Barrett, I note that the Irish corporation tax regime contains a small number of specifically-targeted tax reliefs the focus of which is on the creation of additional employment, as is consistent with current Government policy on innovation, with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  In contrast, our approach to this tax is clear.  We have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  The amendments relate to a number of different areas which I will address individually.</p> <p>  Under existing loss-relief provisions in the Taxes Act, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for off-set against trading income of the same trade in a future accounting period.  Losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade are a normal fact of business life.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code as it is in all other OECD countries.  The carrying forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions.</p> <p>  The central purpose of the knowledge development box, or KDB, is to encourage companies to carry out their substantive activities in Ireland.  The KDB is based on the modified nexus approach which was designed by the OECD as part of the BEPS project and is not designed by tax planners seeking to design complex tax avoidance structures.  By adhering to the rules, the KDB is a positive measure for Ireland which is focused on incentivising substantive research and development and encouraging companies to bring in real operations and high quality jobs that have a positive impact on the Irish economy.  The research and development tax credit is also a very important feature of the Irish corporate tax structure.  The central purpose of the tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high value-added research and development activity in Ireland thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  Reflecting these considerations, the Government's innovation 2020 strategy aims to achieve the EU 2020 target of increasing overall, i.e. public and private, research and development expenditure in Ireland to 2.5% of GNP by 2020.</p> <p>  A review of the research and development credit was carried out by my Department ahead of budget 2017.  It concluded that the credit was responsible for 60% of the research and development being conducted in our country.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of additionality.  The bang-for-buck ratio is estimated to be 2.4.  That means for every &euro;1 in foregone tax revenue, &euro;2.40 in additional research and development is being conducted.  This is also considered a reasonable result.  Overall, the paper's findings suggest that the rationale for the research and development tax credit is not in question.  Firms have clearly responded to it by increasing their research and development.  My officials and I are conscious of the need to evaluate the research and development tax credit regularly, but it is important to recognise that while this is a significant credit, it is one of the few tax credits in our corporate tax code compared to other jurisdictions.  However, I am mindful of the need to monitor the cost of this tax credit and will continue to do so in line with the Department's tax expenditure guidelines.</p> <p>  In line with the established practice of carrying out periodic reviews of key areas of tax policy, a review of Ireland's corporate tax code has recently been undertaken.  The review made 18 substantial recommendations which we are now working to implement.  Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the review sets out a road map for the State to create certainty on the implementation of the recommended measures.  These include the launch of a consultation process which is now under way.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.</p> <p>  One of the points raised during the contributions of the Deputies related to the discrepancy between the Revenue Commissioner and CSO figures.  According to the CSO, total business expenditure and research and development, which is referred to as "BERD", was provisionally estimated at &euro;2.1 billion in 2014, of which &euro;200 million related to capital expenditure.  Initial Revenue tax returns indicated a 2014 figure of &euro;4.6 billion, with no capital expenditure subtotal given.</p><p>In 2014, at that point a broad definition of Research and Development was still in operation in the Revenue guidelines.  The Revenue Commissioners has now confirmed that the initial figures, including carry forward tax credits resulted in a double counting of the eligible expenditure.  Further data provided by Revenue, removing the influence of the carry forward credits indicate there is not a substantial difference between the Revenue's estimates for gross expenditure linked the Research and Development tax credit and the CSO's BERD.  In regard to the cost and why it keeps increasing, the costs of the scheme have continued to rise and the most up-to-date figure is &euro;708 million with 1,535 claims.  It has risen from &euro;282 million in 2012.  However, between 2012 and 2015, the base year threshold of the research and development tax credit was phased out and ultimately removed.  This entailed that all relevant expenditure could qualify for the tax credit, where previously qualified expenditure for research and development was only that in excess of the expenditure incurred in 2003.  In other words there was a change in the base year which in turn had effect in the cost which increased the following years.  </p><p> I am aware that this is one of the few credits we have in our corporate tax code and that is in contrast to other countries with whom we compete.  I am also aware of the fact that this is tax expenditure that is increasing and has increased significantly.  While I can point to plausible reasons as to why this has happened, it is reaching a very large and even larger figure and I will monitor further growth in that figure carefully across next year.</p></speech>

I think the Minister is ignoring some of the points made in the report.  The report states that it is pertinent  to ensure that this does not increase.  After the publication of the report we find out that it has already increased by another  &euro;150 million.  The Minister is also ignoring the recommendations in the report about multiple claims and the fact that it does not affect younger firms.</p> <p>  My amendment is very simple.  By the time we return next year to consider the finance Bill the research and development tax credit could be worth &euro;1,000 million.  In my amendment I  request the Minister to report on action to be taken to reform the tax credit.  It needs to be reformed as fewer companies  are availing of it and younger companies are not availing of it.  It completely out of control.  The rate of increase is &euro;150 million a year.  We argued the toss of &euro;10 million here and &euro;10 million there, but this is similar to the Minister spending this amount of money.</p> <p>  It is disappointing that the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I see the value in research and development tax credits.  It is important for companies to have that tax credit.  It is also important for the certainty of research and development but we have to do something about it.  The Minister has given no commitment to a review of the tax credit.  The report that he published on budget day last year called for further analysis on it.  There was no cross-benefit analysis and it referred to simpler ways for analysing it.  I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage but I encourage the Minister to look again at that report and come back with a substantial amendment.</p></speech>

It seems to amount to the privatisation of research and development.  The funding of our universities was hammered during the period of austerity.  They lost approximately 30% of their funding.  Would it not be better, rather than have this huge tax expenditure on research and development tax credits, to put more money back into our universities?  Should we not at least examine which would be more beneficial to our economy and our society and examine whether this is a good tax expenditure?</p></speech>

As Deputies know, I made an announcement that I am planning to increase the training levy by 0.1% per year for the next three years.  For next year alone that will bring in an additional &euro;36 million to &euro;37 million that would be available for higher and further education in our country.  I plan to increase that by two further moves afterwards.  I have also made a very significant increase in funding that is available to the Department of Education and Skills.  Granted, much of that funding is going into challenges that the Department must meet in primary and secondary education.  That is the reason I have decided to increase the training levy in employers' PRSI, to create a funding stream that will go directly to third, fourth level education.  I decided on a levy rather than a tax because if I introduced a tax I would not have the ability to divert it to that sector.</p> <p>  I largely agree with the Deputies on the value of research and development in our universities.  To end on a final point of agreement, the research and development that takes place under this tax credit clearly has to have a commercial value to the company, otherwise it would not be happening.  We link it into particular criteria.  One of the reasons that I want to increase funding to universities is that there is a great value and benefit in research and development that does not have a commercial value.  Our universities are the place where that should happen.</p></speech>

I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses that their opening statements may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Mr. Hennessy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

If I understood the Chairman's letter correctly, today's focus is on the process for evaluating orphan drugs and the potential reasons for delays in reimbursing approved drugs.  The process for evaluating applications was covered at some length at the July committee meeting, so I will not repeat the full detail other than to re-emphasise that the criteria for assessment are those outlined in the legislation, namely, section 19(4) of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  I have the criteria with me and can go through them later if members wish.</p> <p>  The important point to bear in mind is that the legislation requires the HSE to have regard to the cost effectiveness and clinical benefits of the product being applied for and does not make specific provision or permit a different rule set to be applied in the case of orphan drugs.  Nevertheless, particular features that relate to orphan conditions are considered during the assessment process and factors such as the clinical effectiveness of the product and the number of potential patients affected are clearly set out in the reports compiled.  Professor Barry will allude further to this matter in his opening statement.</p> <p>  In the case of approved medicines, the reasons for delay can be many, but they are mainly logistical - putting in place the conditions that may be attached to an approval - or they are financial, for instance, in the case of products that confer clinical benefits and are deemed to be cost effect but budgetary provision for whose approval does not exist in the service plan.  As members will recall from our previous meeting, a delay between approval and reimbursement occurred in 2017 in the case of products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, cancer, heart failure and a number of other conditions.</p> <p>  Delay can also occur where the clinical benefits demonstrated by the trial studies are marginal but the prices charged are substantial.  Everyone will be familiar with examples of products being referred back for further negotiations on price.  Companies are encouraged to submit their initial applications based on the end price, but experience has shown that further price adjustments can, and do, become available after decisions are taken and notified.</p> <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance.  My colleagues and I will try to answer whatever questions the committee may have or provide any further information that may be required.</p></speech>

All of these factors are considered in our evaluation - it is not just about money.  It is a standardised process and is in keeping with the guidelines set down by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which were updated in 2014 and are being updated again.  That process will be completed in a few weeks' time.</p> <p>  The process is well established.  It entails an initial rapid review, in which we examine a product, usually over two to four weeks, to decide whether it needs a full evaluation.  If it does not, it is usually reimbursed without delay.  If it does, we move on to a full assessment, which means that the manufacturer has to submit a dossier to us outlining the benefits and so on of the medication and proving that it is cost effective.  Orphan drugs are assessed in the same way as other drugs, although we are mindful of the differences and challenges in terms of patient numbers and so on, which we can discuss later.</p> <p>  The health technology assessment, HTA, submission process includes a facility for patient groups to make contributions.  This is a new feature.  Approximately 40% of assessments in 2016 included patient submissions, which were helpful to us.</p> <p>  The final decision on the reimbursement on any drug is not ours.  That rests with the HSE.  We give our unbiased, transparent opinion on the value for money proposition related to the medicine.  I have provided the committee with examples of medications for rare diseases that we have considered.  The majority have been reimbursed.  We have not reimbursed Vimzim for Morquio A syndrome or Translarna for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p> <p>  I will highlight the recent development in the form of the rare diseases medicinal products-technology review committee, which is a mouthful, in recognition that there are differences with drugs for rare diseases.  This committee will probably have a role in managed entry, in the sense that there may be entry or exit criteria that one would apply for rare diseases drugs.  I hope that this will improve matters in terms of access to drugs for rare diseases.</p> <p>  The document I have supplied highlights the issue in Europe and joint HTAs, such as the European network for Health Technology Assessment, EUnetHTA, which aims to co-ordinate HTAs across European countries.  Another development is the BeNeLuxA initiative, which involves Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria.  They are examining the prospect of undertaking combined HTAs.  Recently, Belgium and the Netherlands undertook a joint HTA in respect of Orkambi, although it did not seem to improve access as such.</p> <p>  I will correct something in my submission.  It reads: "As a result Orkambi is not reimbursed in either Belgium or the Netherlands today."  That has just changed.  The Netherlands will now make Orkambi available.  It was factual at the time of writing.  We have more than 300 citizens on Orkambi.  All of this shows that we were not an outlier.</p> <p>  Under the Valletta declaration, Ministers from Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain agreed to explore collaboration in this regard.</p><p>Ireland is also involved in that collaboration.  Germany was mentioned in the invitation to this meeting.  We must be clear that Germany remains the front-runner in Europe in terms of availability of new authorised medicines following market authorisation, but there is free pricing in the first year in Germany.  Therefore a company will get immediate access and free pricing.  That comes at a price.  I think that has to be acknowledged.  The vast majority of European countries will look for an assessment, following the market authorisation before the drug will be let into the market.  That is a key point.</p><p> There was a very nice review last year, including 13 of the 14 countries from which we reference our drug prices and only two of them allow free entry. The other 13 countries have an assessment of the drug before it is let on to the market and the vast majority of cases relate to pricing.  In contrast to Germany, reimbursement of medicines in many European countries including Ireland and other developed countries only occurs following a post marketing evaluation, which is what we do here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their evidence.  I have a number of questions and I would imagine that none will shock or surprise the witnesses.</p> <p>  Following our engagement with Alpha One Foundation, specifically in respect of Respreeza, I have stated publicly that the families of the patients involved have been treated disgracefully.  I would apportion blame equally to all involved in this.  The patients and their families have been left in Limbo in a way that is actually quite cruel for them.  They are in a situation whereby the drug they need is being provided on a compassionate basis.  I do not think there is much compassion in global pharmaceuticals but that is the term that is used.  On a compassionate basis that drug is available to them but they now do not have anyone to administer it, so they have the dual difficulty of the ticking time bomb, where compassionate access will run out and they know that but they also have a difficulty as to how it will be administered.  That begs a broader question, which I will put to Mr. John Hennessy.  In the situation that families or patients can by whatever means find the necessary funds to pay for the orphan drugs themselves, what is the involvement of the HSE regarding the administration of that drug?  If a drug has been turned down for reimbursement for whatever reason, the HSE are making a statement that it will not have any involvement with it, but yet there are patients and their families who are really depending on these life saving and life altering drugs.  What is the situation and could the witnesses comment specifically on the families that use Respreeza because I know they are going to be watching the committee proceedings?  They have been let down on more than one occasion.</p> <p>  The broader questions are on the process of evaluation.  Professor Barry alluded to this.  The same process is used for orphan, ultra orphan and drugs such as Panadol.  I am not a scientist but what strikes me is that there is a case to be made for orphan and ultra orphan drugs being assessed in a different way, the way they do in other countries and using a different assessment tool because clearly the numbers are not there.  When we talk to families who are depending on these orphan drugs or the companies that are selling them, they will without exception tell us that the process that is used in this State is not appropriate for orphan drugs, or more specifically for ultra orphan drugs.  The view of the witnesses on that issue would be very welcome.</p> <p>  Professor Barry alluded to the stakeholder involvement in the process.  I have spoken to the stakeholders and it strikes me that they feel anything but involved.  They feel very much excluded.  The stakeholders are getting information from the media, information that is put into the public domain by the pharmaceutical companies.  That is wholly unacceptable.  Will Professor Barry provide more detail on his point of view as to how the stakeholders are accommodated?  I do not purport to speak for them but I can repeat what they have said to me, which is that they feel anything but involved.  They feel excluded.  </p> <p>  With regard to Translarna and I know that my colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh will want to speak on this as well.  Could Professor Barry outline briefly what is the difficulty with that drug in Ireland, if it is available in 22 other countries?  When we discuss co-operation on an European level, there has to be some sort of standard.  It strikes me as odd that a drug would meet the standards in one country but not in another, but a drug that meets the standard in 22 countries but does not meet our standard is strange.  Will the witnesses outline that for us.  I do not need to hear the areas where we have been leaders on this.  We should focus on where we have been behind because we are clearly behind on this.  I am aware that a High Court action is underway at present.  I am sure that will give the witness the comfort of being able to say that he cannot say too much but I ask for an update on where that is at and when the outcome is going to be known.  I know there may be a certain amount of estimation that has to go on because obviously it is the subject of proceedings.  Will they give us an idea because families who are waiting are extremely anxious to know when they are likely to have an outcome.  They are very disappointed that it had to come to this.  The families concerned end up caught in the middle of this between the NCPE, the HSE on one side and the pharmaceutical companies on the other.  There is a human story in the middle.  For their sake the witnesses might be able to give us some idea when they see this matter coming to a conclusion.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy O'Reilly on the specific drug Respreeza.  I too have a constituent whose life is on hold.  She is going from month to month.  The uncertainty of her future is really taking toll on her life.  It is important for us all to remember that behind every case there is a person and a family.  No monetary value can be put on that.  It is important that remains in our mind the whole time.  I would welcome comments on Respreeza.</p> <p>  The process of reimbursement for drugs seems broken.  Do the witnesses agree with me?  Ireland has become one of the worst countries in western Europe for speed of access to new medicines.  Why has this happened?  Other countries are clearly serving patients better.  Professor Barry referred to a number of other countries and the differences in processing.  At the same time, I feel we are being left behind.</p> <p>  The pricing of drugs is the same as 14 other countries but yet spending on pharmaceuticals in Ireland is significantly below the average, with Ireland spending 13% compared to the OECD average of 16%.  Do the witnesses consider there is an issue for the Government to consider more funding for drugs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#F00100"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I wish to make a few brief points on two issues that are very much to the fore at present.  First, there is the new drug called Respreeza, which was developed by CSL Behring, and the reimbursement of same.  There has been an extension to the compassionate programme.  I hope that I have misread the situation because it is hard to believe that the HSE will not facilitate transfusions in that particular area.  Perhaps the matter is for another forum.  I would like to know why, in view of the fact that the compassionate programme has been extended by the company, that the HSE, at the very least, would not assist the patients with transfusions on the Respreeza side.</p> <p>  Second, Translarna is a medicine that has been referenced by previous speakers.  We seem to have fallen way behind in assessing medicines and drugs and in how we handle the reimbursement process.  The rare diseases national plan 2014 was launched by the Minister in July 2017 and it is a generic policy framework for rare diseases.  The scope of the plan is broad as there are 8,000 rare diseases that affect millions of people.  The document goes on.</p></speech>

I was referring to the national rare diseases plan for Ireland, launched by the Minister in July 2014.  The witnesses are aware of it.  I tabled a parliamentary question recently which highlighted that quite a number of areas have not been fully implemented.  These include recommendations Nos. 30 to 39, inclusive.  Quite a number are in their infancy.  Recommendation No. 33 is that the HSE develops a publicly available annual report documenting the use of existing and new to market orphan medicines and technologies in Ireland and a summary of applications received and decisions relating to those applications.  This has not been commenced.  Recommendation No. 38, that early dialogue between the HSE and the companies running clinical trials in Ireland with Irish patients where licence approval is imminent, has not been commenced.  Recommendation No. 39, whereby sponsors could be offered an incentive to run trials in Ireland, increasing access to innovation for Irish patients, has not been commenced.  Quite a number of areas in the rare diseases plan have not commenced.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.</p><p>With regard to how we assess and appraise drugs coming to market, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, makes approvals, as does the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, in this country.  Sometimes there is an application for reimbursement, which goes through the entire process, including the National Centre For Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE and the HSE, and when it is all said and done, it still seems to end up going to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, if I am correct.  It then goes to the Government and sometimes back to the D&aacute;il where political pressure is exerted and we have a situation where advocacy groups are campaigning outside the D&aacute;il gates.  Is there are better way for us to do our business in terms of how we assess the impact a drug would have and its cost-effectiveness, and take it from a situation where people feel they are almost playing God in terms of political decisions having to be made and pressure being exerted?  It is extremely distasteful, to be truthful, that we have this type of continual toing and froing, where Ministers go to the Government to try to get money to secure a drug but it is not made available and then pressure comes on, or <i>vice versa</i>, as sometimes Ministers try to get approval for something that has not been approved through the process.  I will take Translarna as an example, although there are many other drugs.  It is hardly the case that all of the other countries in Europe are wrong.  Why are we the outlier so many times when it comes to reimbursement for drugs?  Many First World countries with very advanced technologies for the assessment of drugs and their impact, with quality First World health services, can approve drugs.  Equally, even in the European context, countries with huge budget deficits, which are far worse off economically than ourselves, are able to approve these drugs.  Why are we the outlier so often when it comes to the reimbursement for drugs?</p></speech>

It strikes me that very little has been done.  Will the witnesses give an indication as to whether they feel all of this work will be completed by the end of the plan?  That is what people want to know.  The witnesses might give us an idea of what will not be achieved and what will be achieved by the end date, given that we are very far into the plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#H00400"><p>I will try to address the points made earlier on Respreeza and alpha-1 patients.  I appreciate the difficulty these patients find themselves in at present, but the fact remains the application for the reimbursement of Respreeza did not pass the effectiveness tests we have in place.  It was considered that the health technology assessment process and the expert group reviewed the evidence.  What was demonstrated were marginal clinical improvements but coming at a very high price.  At the end of the process, the decision was that it was not cost-effective and the decision was not to reimburse.  That does not mean treatment is not available for these patients.  Of course there is conventional treatment available at all times.</p> <p>  On the compassionate access situation, to be clear on this, the HSE was not involved in establishing the clinical trials or the compassionate access program and cannot become involved in it now without drifting into a contradictory position of declining the application for reimbursement and then becoming involved in the administration of it.  However, we do feel those involved in the trials and the compassionate access programme have a duty of care to those patients and have a duty to manage those patients properly and appropriately.  We do not accept that making deadlines and setting new deadlines repeatedly is helpful in the process.  We would like to meet the company to discuss its approach on the management of those patients in particular.  I do not accept it is a cost issue.  It is a substantial multinational company.  There are and have been arrangements in place for the provision of this treatment for those compassionate access patients for many years, and we will call on it to continue this, at least until we have a chance to discuss its arrangements for the orderly and appropriate management of those patients.  A meeting has been arranged, which is scheduled to happen next week.  It might have been out there that it was to be on 13 November, but it is the week commencing 13 November.  I hope to be able to make further comment at that stage and understand better what the company's arrangements are for those compassionate access patients.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#H00500"><p>Quite a number of other questions were asked.  I will start with Translarna, also known as ataluren, for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and the concept we are behind and an outlier.  That is not what the evidence shows.  The FDA, which authorises medications in the United States, concluded only two weeks ago that additional clinical trial data will be necessary at a minimum to indicate that the drug is effective in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  This is not us saying it, it is the FDA.</p><p>In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, has granted conditional authorisation.  The condition is that the company needs to carry out a further 18 month trial to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  Those two stances illustrate the issue.  As Mr. Hennessy said, it is not always about price as very often when we say no, it is because of the clinical data.  The FDA was very clear that the clinical data in this case are not good enough and I agree with that assessment.</p><p> I do not know where Deputy O'Reilly's information in regard to the 22 European countries comes from but my information is that, as of last week, Translarna is not being reimbursed in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Poland or Slovakia, there have been no applications for it in Croatia or Scotland, and it is currently being assessed in the Netherlands.  Taking all that into consideration, I do not see us as being an outlier at all, and the evidence we have does not support that statement.</p><p> As regards the assessment of orphan drugs-----</p></speech>

With regard to most of the countries where it is available or the countries the witness listed where it is not available in any form, conditional or otherwise, is he specifically saying it is not reimbursed in the mainstream way through the public health system?

If we do not assess drugs, we will pay the asking price for them.  I believe that when we are using taxpayers' money, we should be looking for value and should assess the medications.  That is my personal view.  It was a very prominent statement from the FDA in the United States to clarify it did not believe this drug worked very well and would not authorise it.</p></speech>

That is particularly so for ultra-orphan drugs.  As regards Orkambi, the manufacturer submitted a very good dossier and was able to put forward a case for cost-effectiveness even though we said "No".  Mindful of that and in the context of the rare diseases plan, the rare diseases medicinal products technology review committee is being set up.  It can be quite complex in the sense that possibly 10% or 15% of people in a particular cohort will respond to the drug.  The new committee will be of benefit in that regard as it may be able to devise managed access for patients who respond to the drug and ensure they get access to the drug.  That is a reasonable response to the current situation and very similar to what we do for cancer drugs.  The national cancer control programme technology review group provides its opinion on top of the data we send to the HSE drugs group.  The rare diseases medicinal products technology review committee is modelled on that and may go a little further.</p> <p>  We are getting better at facilitating stakeholder involvement and we need to do continue that.  Some 40% of the HTAs we looked at in 2016 included stakeholder engagement and we have been working with groups such as the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry, IPOSI.  We have been working with IPOSI to provide patient groups with more information in respect of the HTA process and that is ongoing and educational.  We are very grateful for its collaboration in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked if the process is broken.  I do not believe it is.  It is a fair, open, transparent and rigorous assessment.  It is unquestionably rigorous.  We are lucky to have an expert team who are able to go through all the clinical and economic data.  In terms of what transpires from the process, when we make a negative recommendation, it does not finish there, but rather goes to the HSE to negotiate a better price with the pharmaceutical industry.  Everyone wins with that because we are now obtaining discounts in the order of 30% to 50% for products.  If we said we had no problem taking the asking price, for 2016 that would have added &euro;1 billion over five years.  That we can enable the HSE, using our data, to obtain such discounts is a good thing because the money saved can go to other aspects of health care.  It does not tell me the system is broken, but rather that the prices being asked for by the pharmaceutical industry in many cases are completely over the top.</p></speech>

We have taken that point on board and there is work ongoing in the background to strengthen that.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked if there is a funding issue and whether we need more funding.  Everybody would say yes to more funding.  However, no matter how many resources are available, most people would accept that new products still have to pass an effectiveness test.  There will always be competing demands for health care resources for well-proven and established treatments.  Members know those demands as well as I do, and they include measures such as home care packages, hip replacements and scoliosis surgery.  I could go on with that list.  There are endless demands on funding and resources always have to be prioritised on the basis of proven technologies.</p> <p>  Where the evidence is good in respect of new products and medicines in terms of clinical benefits, our track record is very good on getting those approved and reimbursed.  Where the evidence is not as solid or established and prices are very high, a product or medicine will have a more difficult passage.</p><p>Deputy Kelleher mentioned the rare diseases plan and I am aware there is a steering group in place between the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health to implement the recommendations.  There is a clinical lead in place.  I might arrange a more full report or update on the implementation of the rare diseases plan to the committee at a later stage if that is okay.</p></speech>

Maybe they do not bear any relation to the price being asked for them, which can be as high as &euro;400,000 per patient per year.  That is the issue.</p></speech>

On the previous occasion I had a concern, which I raised at the September meeting, about the matter being revisited.  The figures being given to me are to the effect that there are approximately 148 orphan drugs, with 133 approved and used in Germany.  We are using either 53 or 55 and other countries around Europe seem to be way ahead of us in using new drugs.  That is the reason I suggested in September that we revisit this.  There is also the matter of the delay in the process.  I have a note from one company, which made a submission in March 2015.  It went through the process, and there was a decision in June 2017 that the drug would not be reimbursed.  It filed an appeal and advised that the subject would be considered at a meeting of 14 September.  As of today, the company is still not clear what has happened and has had no response.  I got that from BioMarin about a specific drug.  The case has been ongoing since March 2015, we are now in November 2017, and there has been no conclusion on whether the application is in or out.  An initial decision was taken but the company filed an appeal against it.</p> <p>  The second matter is that we seem to be lumping orphan drugs into the same type of process as any other drugs that would be commonly used.  We are talking about a very small cohort.  There are some drugs that might only be available or suitable for approximately ten people in the country.  I know it is a very difficult process but the argument has been put forward to me.  I have dealt with rare diseases for quite a number of years.  Last week I had representatives of a group of sufferers of epidermolysis bullosa into Leinster House.  It is a genetic skin disorder and skin keeps peeling from people's bodies.  There is no medication for it.  I am fairly familiar with the rare diseases area.  This is about orphan drugs being put through the same kind of process as drugs that would be commonly used.  This seems to be a big concern of people involved in the rare diseases area.</p> <p>  Have we looked at how other jurisdictions process this?  We have raised the German system and there is the question of how the German system operates.  It allows the drug and there is a price negotiation process thereafter.  I accept it would be quite difficult for us to implement that kind of system.  I know we are talking about working with other countries to negotiate with drug companies.  Our process seems to be extremely slow.  Representatives of one company told me a drug has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency but it has had to file 300 or 400 pages of documents to support the application.  I do not understand why we need to go through that kind of a complicated process.</p> <p>  There are cases where a drug is being used with the support of the drug company but we are told it will not get approval under the drugs refund scheme.  Do we need to set up a mechanism to deal with the people who have now become reliant on that drug?  In many cases they have been on the drug for anything up to 18 months, two years or even two and a half years while the process has gone on.  Suddenly, they are told by the pharmaceutical company that it is no longer prepared to cover the cost and it will not be covered by the drugs refund scheme.  Do we need to set up a process to deal with that?  I have received numerous letters over recent weeks from people who are concerned about this.  They are on medication but do not know what will happen from now on.  Have we considered that?  Orphan drugs are different from drugs used by wider numbers of people.  Is there a need for a specific budget?</p><p>We use quality adjusted life years in the cost assessment.  Should we consider using a different system when we deal with orphan drugs?  I am not convinced that we are approaching our assessment correctly.  It concerns a very small group of people in many different areas but we appear to be applying the same set of rules, and I do not know if that is appropriate in the area of orphan drugs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#L00200"><p>To move away from the area of orphan drugs, I have a question that Mr. Flanagan might answer.  If Mr. Flanagan was in the role then, he might remember that in 2013 Aspen Pharma significantly increased the price of several drugs.  My understanding is that it was almost holding the HSE to ransom.  There were long established drugs that would have to have been off patent then, including Purinethol, the cost of which went from &euro;17.88 to &euro;65.  My understanding is that Aspen told the HSE it was increasing the price and if the HSE did not pay it, there would be no supply and the HSE paid up.  This cost the HSE in the region of &euro;200,000 annually.  The year 2013 is some time ago, but what has the HSE done since then to prevent something similar happening again?  I understand that only small quantities of Purinethol would be used in Ireland relative to more standard drugs.  My concerns follow on from this.</p> <p>  When these drugs were in development stage, they would have had a nine year patent and would have had the benefits of high costs in their early years to pay for the research and development involved in them.  They then go off patent or become a regular medicine, but a company can go in a full circle, come back to the HSE and charge a huge increase.  What has the State done since 2013 regarding such drugs to prevent this happening again?  I have a list of them before me which I can provide to the witnesses, although they no doubt know them.  Aspen is being investigated by the European Commission but that does not help if the same problem could arise next week.</p> <p>  Orphan drugs are a necessary evil.  Medications such as Sildenafil can sometimes go on to become blockbuster drugs which provide significant benefits to society.  The incremental cost effectiveness ratio is set at about &euro;40,000 to &euro;45,000 which, from my reading, seems a low threshold.  Does the HSE plan to increase the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to a level of, for example, &euro;100,000, or at least something more appropriate to the current situation?  </p> <p>  One of the witnesses said in their opening statement - it may have been Mr. Barry - that, ultimately, the final decision rests with the HSE.  Who is that person in the HSE?  My understanding is that the witnesses' area is well-resourced with highly qualified people to go through the processes.  Why would we have the witnesses, who are a group of highly qualified people, go through this process and evaluate the data and information, but then hand it over to someone else?  Is that person to whom the reports are given super-qualified?  What is their special power that makes them capable of overturning the decision of the people here based on their qualifications to do the job?  I am concerned about the process.  From my reading, the people here could go through the whole process and support a drug which might solve a particular issue, but then this secret person in the HSE can reverse the decision, or say "Yes" as the case may be.  Will the witnesses elaborate on this?  The members of this committee have a duty to make sure that the witnesses before us are able to do their job properly.</p> <p>  There was a reference to Germany in an earlier question.  The witnesses said that there is free access and free pricing in the first year in Germany, but what happens then?  Do the witnesses have any information about what happens after the first year when everyone gets anything for any price at all?  Is it the case that people are hooked on it, but what do they do after the first year?  Do they cut off supply of 50% of these drugs to which there has been free access in the first year?  Does it usually continue as it is?  It must generate endless bills.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses outline what they need from us to get the best value for money for people in Ireland?  It is a very emotive area because the situation is impossible in cases where patients might be offered another couple of years or months at a massive cost.  I am very concerned that it would be a case that those who shout the loudest get the most, with the provision of certain drugs being improved because of calls to "Liveline".  I am not comfortable with business being done in that way.  What can we do to streamline this issue and ensure that people have equal access to treatment, rather than treatment being provided to those with the strongest lobby group or because they have the saddest story?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017110800002#L00300"><p>I support the view expressed by my colleague.  We are all concerned that patients in this country have ready access to the best medicine as quickly as possible in line with best international standards.  An evaluation has taken place in Europe, which has been undertaken recently in the case of Translarna and a number of other contentious drugs, and I do not know if the same process needs to be undertaken here unless the European evaluation is regarded as being insufficient, a lower standard, not having due regard to the health and safety of patients or something like that.</p> <p>  I seek clarification regarding the Food and Drug Administration in the US.  What are the competing drugs in the US market about which the FDA has been concerned?  We know that the market place can be protective of products from time to time.  What are the competing drugs and does it have any impact on FDA decisions in the US?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the lack of evidence from Europe, and whether the drugs in question may be unsuitable or unsafe.  Safety is important.  The other issues were dealt with my colleague earlier.  The drug is safe or it is not, and I do not think that we need to test it again.  It should be obvious that we accept European standards or we do not.  If we do not, then we should bring a case to Europe and explain why.  </p> <p>  It is a very emotive issue for patients and their families.  I fully appreciate the reservations that exist on costs.</p><p>I will come to those in a moment, but, from the point of view of the well-being and welfare of the patient and for his or her peace of mind, it is very difficult to explain to a patient and his or her family why a particular drug is not being made available to him or her if it is made available in other jurisdictions.  If we have a different set of standards for the examination of drugs, we should tell that to patients.</p><p> My understanding is that various drug companies have already offered to talk with the HSE about the cost on a confidential basis.  Is that true?  If that were the case and given that there is conditional approval, I can see no reason that cannot be done, without commitment to anything else.  It would resolve the problem for patients who are distressed at present because of the situation that is ongoing.  It would not affect their health because the drugs have already been given conditional approval.  Without going into too much detail, what are the conditions of the approval?  I presume it is generally based on health and safety grounds and side effects.</p><p> I wish to emphasise the point about the duplication of evaluations.  There is no case at all for that today.  We either have standards that are acceptable at European level or we do not.  If we want to have a super standard, in deference to my colleague, then let us set it up and put ourselves on a pedestal above and beyond everybody else but do not let us play around with it.  Apart from being an emotive issue, this is a serious issue from the point of view of patients.  Depriving them of what they see as being available in other jurisdictions without any difficulty is one they look to us to raise with the experts to see what can be done.</p><p> I accept a court case is ongoing and so not much can be said about it at this stage but there can be negotiations off stage, notwithstanding the court case, that could have an impact of a beneficial nature in the interim without any commitment to the future.  Could I ask if that could be done in this situation and whether it will be done?</p></speech>

I will start with the questions asked by Senator Colm Burke.  I will ask Professor Barry to comment further on the question on the German system.</p> <p>  If I understood the question on a specific drug, the particular product to which the Senator referred has been in process for some time but notifications are due to issue to the company in the coming weeks as it is coming to the end of its assessment process.  More information will be available on it in the next week or so.</p> <p>  The third question related to orphan drugs and the process involved.  Deputy O'Connell mentioned that as well in terms of what the committee can do.  The issue for us is that the legislation that is in place, which guides our approach at the moment is the 2013 Act, and it does not make separate provision for orphan conditions but obviously there are features that apply to orphan situations that need to be taken into account.  It is perhaps an area the committee might wish to consider from a policy and even a legislative point of view.</p> <p>  The point about compassionate access is a good one.  The Helsinki protocol is in place for patients on clinical trials and compassionate access.  In fairness, when the trials conclude, most pharmaceutical companies manage the patients that are on those programmes very well.  When companies say they are closing down a trial or compassionate access, most companies mean they are not taking on new patients but they manage the existing patients in a responsible manner.  Obviously some companies take a different approach and wish to conclude their compassionate access programmes.  That is something of which we do not approve in terms of the manner in which that is done.  Conversations are ongoing with a number of companies in that regard as well.  The Helsinki protocol does set out very clearly the arrangements to be put in place at the outset for the management of patients at the end of trials.</p></speech>

Is anyone at the moment on a programme that for whatever reason has not received full endorsement where the HSE is administering the drug? The difficulty that arises for those people is who is going to administer the drug.  Is anyone at the moment having the drug administered by the HSE even though it is not necessarily being fully refunded?  Would that happen?</p></speech>

She asked about increases in the price of aspirin.  This relates to medicines that were previously owned by a major pharmaceutical company and that were sold on to Aspen in 2010 or 2011.  In 2011 or 2012, Aspen commenced a process whereby it came to a wide range of European authorities and demanded or sought price increases to maintain supplies of the products in the market.  These are not orphan drugs, so I have not prepared for this question.  However, from memory, the company approached the HSE in early 2012.  We refused the price increase on at least two occasions.  Eventually, we arrived at a scenario around December 2012, where, from memory, the paper record was that the company had said it would not be in a position to release any more stock into the Irish market unless a price increase was granted.  It pointed to the fact that at least 12 authorities throughout Europe had granted price increases already.</p> <p>  We were left in a position where we either we granted a price increase to maintain access to the medicines or we did not.  A judgment had to be made as to whether it was reasonable to expend &euro;200,000 to maintain access.  A judgment was made that in the context of what we were faced with.  It was not reasonable to pay the sum of &euro;200,000 but we had no other choice.  As Deputy O'Connell stated, Aspen's activities across Europe are now the subject of an inquiry by the Directorate General for Competition, or DG Competition.  The HSE is assisting the DG Competition in the context of that, as are many other repricing and reimbursement authorities across Europe.</p> <p>  Price increases do not happen that frequently.  Over the past decade, there have probably been between 3,000 and 4,000 price reductions.  We have had fewer than 50 price increases over that period and some of these were reversals of previous reductions in circumstances where those reductions may have gone too far and where there were concerns about continuity in the market.</p> <p>  Regarding what we have done to prevent it, there has been useful activity by some of the competition authorities across Europe.  In particular, the UK fined another pharmaceutical company for similar activities.  The findings in that case affected corporate governance and directors, and what the latter have to sign.  If someone comes to us for a price increase, we now require two directors to indemnify or sign, confirm that the documentation put forward is accurate and complete, and provide as much of a business case as possible.  That has seemed to help a bit because, as a result of the activities of the UK Competition and Markets Authority, directors are reluctant to sign those confirmations.</p> <p>  The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, ICER, was referred to.  I am not an expert in economics, but there is a whole science around what the cost per quality adjusted life year, QALY, might be.  In theory, as I understand the matter, it breaks down to two forms; what one's willingness to pay is; or what is the actual cost per QALY of the average health intervention with which one is comparing it.  If we take a view that every health intervention comes with a sum of roughly &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 per QALY and if we introduce something into the system that is above that level, we reduce our efficiency.  If we then introduce something that is below that level, we increase our efficiency and use resources better.</p> <p>  The issue regarding the ICER relates to how inefficient we are willing to be.  In other words, how many opportunity costs elsewhere in the system we are willing to accept in the context of the introduction of a new medicine, technology, service or whatever.  That is fundamentally an ethical and a policy-level discussion.  We operate within the parameters that the Oireachtas has given us, which is the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  We operate within the parameters of an ICER of &euro;45,000 per QALY, which some policy-level Departments suggest should be lower.  We try to then match the various criteria in the Act, which include the clinical need for the item.  We end up with a scenario where Professor Barry is asked by the HSE to make a judgment at &euro;45,000 per QALY and at &euro;20,000 per QALY as to whether something is cost-effective.  That does not mean that those are always the decision points that the HSE uses.  Clearly, there is no way Orkambi could have been reimbursed on that basis, because it does come not within a yard of that type of ICER score.</p> <p>  The HSE tries to weigh up all of the criteria that the Oireachtas set out in the legislation, which include: effectiveness; efficiency; cost-effectiveness; alternative items; the budget impact; the level of resources available; and the certainty around the information.  All these things are clearly laid out in the Act.  We have to include all of those.  The HSE tries to arrive at a judgment.  It is very reluctant to go anywhere north of &euro;100,000 per QALY, though on occasion it has done so.  It is very happy to go well under &euro;45,000 per QALY if it can.  Professor Barry's process is about is establishing if something is cost-effective at the price submitted.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked if we engage in commercial negotiations.  Yes, we do.  A member also asked if we engage in confidential commercial negotiations.  We do.  The reality is this.  I went back over the last 50 medicines that we have assessed.  Without weighting the value of each individual medicine, the average reduction, arrived at by summing the reduction and dividing by the number of medicines, is 25%.  We are doing our best to stretch the resources as far as we can to provide access to as many medicines as possible.  If we increase the QALY threshold, we would get more access to more medicines, but we would also have to pay.  The State would have to fund us more.  That is the reality.  Again, those are policy-level decisions.  I am agnostic on that.  I have a personal view, but it is a personal view.  It is not for me to put out my personal views on that.  The State could decide to set a QALY threshold of &euro;100,000 per QALY.  That would mean that more medicines would be approved.  It would mean that the HSE would probably pay more for those medicines - one of the advantages of the threshold we have is that it gives us an opportunity to challenge the prices charged by pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>  These are really difficult policy-level ethical issues.  We do not have the answers on this side of the table.  What we do is try to stretch our resources as far as possible in order to provide access to as many medicines as possible.  What is the answer that everybody wants?  Everybody wants to say yes to everything, even on this side of the table.  However, we cannot say yes to everything with the resources available.  That is the simple truth.  Maybe we can say yes to more resources with softer decision thresholds, provided that does not introduce any perverse incentives in how the industry interacts with the system.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell inquired as to who in the leadership makes the decision.  Essentially, what happens there is that the HTA reports go to the drugs committee, which reports to the leadership team of the HSE.  A number of those reports are on the agenda for the HSE leadership team each month.  As an indicator of the significance of the decisions that are involved, we are talking about multimillion euro expenditure and investment decisions, particularly over the five-year lifespan of most drugs and products that are considered.</p> <p>  Those applications come to the leadership team.  They are considered in the context of all the other demands on the health care resources, such as hospitals, mental health services, social care, etc.  The decisions taken are published as part of the HSE directorate minutes each month.  My experience is that it is very unusual for the decision of the leadership team to be contrary to what was recommended by the drugs committee.  In fact, I cannot remember any occasion when that has happened.</p><p>The process is pretty clear and transparent.  The decisions taken are published each month as part of the leadership team papers.</p></speech>

The drugs group recommendation is often quite different to the recommendation from the National Centre for Pharmoeconomics, NCPE, because commercial negotiations may have taken place.  There is a step through the process and the drugs group has a mixed membership with 50% consisting of clinicians, senior clinical leaders within the HSE and a clinician from the hospital acute system, economists and various experts like that.</p></speech>

Obviously, companies feel that they have to operate in a price-confidential manner in the process and, as Mr. Flanagan said, those negotiations do become protracted on some occasions.</p></speech>

It is followed by a negotiation at the end of the year.  If those negotiations are not successful then it is referred on to their equivalent of our group.  It is called the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, IQWiQ.  However, not many drugs find their way there because they do come to a settlement in relation to the price of the drug.  In general, the access will continue for the vast majority of drugs.</p></speech>

Orphan drugs are reimbursed automatically.  It is the point that we were making.  They have better access but it costs and that is the issue that we have.  In relation to those drugs that are free priced the vast majority of them continue to be reimbursed under the German system.  The other issue which a number of speakers raised was the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and when they approve a drug.  It is a very important question.  The EMA looks at the safety and the effectiveness of a medication.  It does not look at the aspects that we look at or that similar agencies around Europe look at, in other words relating the effectiveness to the cost and the value for money proposition.  That is not for the EMA.  It does not do that.  That is why sometimes one can see a divergence between what the EMA is saying and what agencies like ours say.  There is a fundamental difference there.</p> <p>  On BioMarin, it took us eight months to assess that.  I know it took a number of years but we spent eight months on it.  On average we spend six months on a drug for a full assessment.</p></speech>

We will leave those and bring in other members who have not had an opportunity to speak yet.</p></speech>

First, I want to take it in relation to the FDA and what has been said so far.  Then I want to take it on the cost specifically and on the data issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the FDA and the witnesses' reference to non-approval in the US, is it true that most orphan drugs that are put before the FDA are not approved in the first instance?  Is it the case that almost all drugs fail in the first instance and then additional information is requested at that point?  Could the witness tell us, and I am sure he will know these figures, in the last year how many drugs were approved by the FDA and how many were refused on the first submission?  I refer to orphan drugs.</p></speech>

In relation to Translarna I know it was not its first look by the FDA.  In fact, the actual current look by the FDA was an appeal by PTC Therapeutics against a previous refusal to accept an application.</p></speech>

We know what happened with Translarna because we always look at the evidence base to sense check any decisions the HSE has made to ensure they sustain challenges around whether or not we are outliers.  We are always looking at how other authorities have looked at decisions, particularly when we have made a decision and their decision comes afterwards.</p></speech>

It has come to a similar decision as the HSE.  Did the HSE consider the FDA position in making its decision?  Absolutely not.  The HSE came to its own decision independently.  Granted, when it is trying to defend a decision, the HSE will then point to decisions that other agencies have made.  However, one is not using their decision process as a proxy for one's own.</p></speech>

So really the EMA is the body that would carry more weight because obviously that is within Europe and we are all part of Europe.  I just want to get at conditional approval.

Deputy Burke suggested that there were 158.  There have been 158 orphan drug approvals over the years but 45 of those are technically no longer orphan drugs because once the patent is lost it is no longer classified as such.  As of 6 November there are 113 public assessment reports on the EMA website on orphan drugs.  Technically there are 113 orphan drugs left in Europe.  Of those, 98 have had approvals, 11 have been refused by the EMA, and four have had withdrawn market authorisations.  Of the 98, 14 of those market authorisations were approved on a conditional basis, 72 had full market authorisations and 12 were approved on an exceptional basis.  Seventy-six of the 98 orphan medicines have been approved on a conditional or exceptional basis by the EMA, but 72 of them have full market authorisation.</p></speech>

Have we done that for any other drugs?  I ask these questions in the context of the situation Lewis Harte-Walsh from Castlebar finds himself in.  He was six last Thursday and he desperately needs Translarna so that he can continue to walk.  We are talking about two boys in the whole of the State who need this drug now.  We need to bear that in mind in the decision-making process.  Is it not possible to grant conditional approval for Translarna on that basis and then use the additional data that would become available either to accept or reject?</p></speech>

From this side of the table, we would love to be able to provide access to every medicine.  We do not like saying no.  I personally hate saying no, but that is how it is.  We are required to arrive objectively at a decision on every medicine.  The Oireachtas has put in place legislation which requires us to arrive objectively at decisions, using the criteria in that legislation.  The HSE did that with Translarna.  I accept that people do not like the decision.  I accept that other people may feel that the decision is wrong, but the HSE has done its best to arrive at an honest decision in the context of the Health Act.</p></speech>

On the cost that has been quoted, as opposed to the real cost, I want to know how much negotiation was done with the drug company to come to an agreement on a reasonable price.  I understand the figure quoted by Professor Barry is based on a ten year old boy because Translarna is subject to the weight of the child.  For someone like Lewis, who is six years old and whose weight is different, the cost of that is immediately reduced.  What negotiations have taken place on price?  Did the drug company name a price?  Did the witness go back to it?  How many times did he go back to the drug company to get that price reduced?</p></speech>

It is not that I do not want to, but the company has made it clear to us, in all of our engagements, that we are not authorised to release the price.  I can talk about what the budget impact would be to provide access to the patients who qualify over five years.  The budget impact would be in excess of &euro;3 million.  That is the type of money we are talking about.</p></speech>

Having said that, the door is never closed to new information and-or new applications, and the HSE is always happy to receive and consider new information.  As for the application process and the decision taken, that has concluded and is going through another process in another forum.  We have constraints as to how far we can go into that.</p></speech>

It is not helpful for companies to be coming in at a high price and then being prepared to come down subsequent to decisions being taken.  All that achieves is delaying the process and keeping a protracted process going.  Our preference would be to conduct a clean process and have the absolute bottom-line price on the table from the word go.</p></speech>

I accept the expectation that the drug company would come in at a price that was fair and reasonable.  However, if in the HSE's opinion it is not fair and reasonable, surely it would be then fair and reasonable to go back and inform the company that the price is unacceptable and ask it for its discounted price, not the initial one.  The HSE did ask for a discounted price.</p></speech>

Would the HSE be willing to sit down with PTC before this goes to court to try to work out a cost and provide conditional approval albeit that there may be additional data?  It is very hard for people to understand why those two little boys cannot be the same as their peers in 18 other EU countries.</p></speech>

A total of 148 orphan drugs are available to deal with rare diseases and ultra-rare diseases.  Of those, 53 qualify for reimbursement in Ireland, which is 36%.  While I do not want to get into other countries' models and how they deal with it, if we compare with other countries, the UK reimburses 68 of the 148; Spain reimburses 75; France reimburses 84; and Germany reimburses 133.  By comparison with those EU countries we are at the bottom end of the scale.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony stated she believed the system was broken, which the HSE witnesses rejected.  If it is not broken, it is certainly not operating satisfactorily from a patient and a public representative point of view.  I am sure it is also true from the HSE's point of view because Mr. Flanagan said he would love to be in a position to approve every drug that could be of benefit.  At 36% and 53 out of 148, we are not performing to as high a level as we should.  That is factual and we need to do something about it.</p> <p>  In its assessment the HSE uses a quantitative approach.  It follows the 2013 Act.  While that Act mentions cost effectiveness, it is not the bible.  It does not have to use cost effectiveness and other parameters could be used.  The HSE could take a qualitative approach to certain drugs if it wanted to.  Rare diseases affect less than five in 10,000 which is 0.05% and ultra-rare diseases affect 0.002%.  The patient cohort is tiny.  It is extremely difficult to acquire clinical data on those patients.  Using a quantitative approach in such cases will never work and will always result in "No" as the answer.</p> <p>  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in this opinion.  We are not bound to the quantitative assessment.  If we want to use a different approach, we can.  We can determine that the health technology assessment guidelines are not relevant to a particular drug if we want to.  We can take a particular drug and decide that we will not use the HTA guidelines because in this particular case they are not relevant and then come up with a different methodology that gives it some chance.</p> <p>  When dealing with a very specific disease we will never help those two, five, seven or eight people in a population unless we take a different approach.  We need to take that on board as part of the HSE's review or otherwise we will be back in here every six months having the same debate, be it Respreeza, Translarna, Kuvan or whatever drug we are battling for on behalf of our constituents.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to take that into consideration.  We need to broaden our approach to give these drugs some chance of getting over the line.</p><p> Let me mention specifically a few drugs.  One currently under review is Kuvan for phenylketonuria, PKU.  There was a time when we were world leaders in dealing with this particular disease.  We came up with a dietary concept and we changed the lives of the people who suffer from this very rare condition.  My colleague, Deputy Kenny brought in people who suffer from this particular disease to the AV room and we had a very good presentation.  We are at a very critical stage of that.  Mr. Shaun Flanagan mentioned about the ability to argue cost.  My information, and it might be wrong - I hope it is - is that the HSE has not gone back to the company looking for a negotiated cost on this.</p></speech>

I want to get a negotiated settlement for this drug.  I have a constituent in my village, who I did not realise until the AV presentation suffered from this condition.  The boy's mother gave me a detailed breakdown of her day and how they deal with the diet and counting out 22 chips for the dinner, because that is allowed.  Kuvan is not going to cure PKU but will increase the quality of life of the person.  I would like to see this particular drug getting over the line and I hope it will.</p><p>Mr. John Hennessy mentioned the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki &ndash; Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, which I am glad he did.  Let me draw attention to paragraph 34, which deals with post-trial provisions.  It states: </p><blockquote>In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial.  This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.</blockquote> <p>That is what the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki tells us about people on clinical trials and compassionate access programmes.  We have a responsibility which paragraph 34 states in black and white: the host country government has a responsibility.  In  Parliamentary Question No. 435 on 3 October 2017, Deputy Brendan Smith asked the Minister for Health if persons currently using Respreeza will not be denied access to this medication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  In his reply, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, stated in the final lines:</p><blockquote>The HSE has also advised that it has decided to continue with the provision of this treatment to this patient cohort only, for an initial period of two weeks.</blockquote> <p>The very obvious follow on question from that is that if the HSE agreed to provide the medication for two weeks, the HSE is accepting that the drug has use and is of benefit to these 21 people.  I can see no other reason that the HSE would agree to extend it for two weeks.  If one does not accept that there is some benefit, giving it for another two weeks is not going to make any clinical difference.  To use a phrase that has been used in financial terms, the HSE has skin in the game.  In my view, the response to the parliamentary question indicates the HSE has bought into this drug.</p><p>When the company agreed to provide the drug for six months free of charge, subsequent to this answer, they would be the sponsors, as referred to in the Helsinki Declaration, the researchers would be the Alpha One Foundation, and they are trying to put together a programme whereby the patients get the distribution and the administration of the drug.  To me the HSE is just saying that it is not its responsibility, it is the responsibility of the researcher or the drug company but is not the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>I have had several meetings and the officials have been very accommodating to me with any requests I have had and I appreciate that but I think taking into consideration what it states in the Declaration of Helsinki and the reply of the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, I think the HSE has a responsibility and it needs to assist patients in getting the administration of this drug.  It is not acceptable for the HSE to say that is the responsibility of somebody else.  I respectfully ask that the HSE sorts out the issue in the coming days.</p><p>The drug is being provided free of charge for a period of six months.  We are down to arguing on how it will be administered.  That is a significant issue to the 21 patients because they will not know what day, time or week it will be administered, but know that the drug is waiting for them.  That is not acceptable by any standard.  We as elected members and members of the HSE really have a responsibility to put this right very quickly.</p></speech>

When the HSE is considering an orphan drug for a rare disease, is it treated separately or is it treated in the same way as every other drug?  If the HSE does not put orphan drugs into a separate box, I think it should.  What do the officials from the HSE think should happen to speed up the availability and make more orphan drugs available in Ireland?  Do we need legislation to allow the HSE to do that?  Do we need to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013?  If the 2013 Act is interpreted differently as I said in my opening comments, would that be enough to change where we are at to move us from the 36% of drugs available up to somewhere north of 50%, so that we are not in or out with the various arguments we have?</p> <p>  The previous time Professor Barry from the NCPE was before the joint committee, he had nine staff available to him, which was recognised as not being near enough and he had indicated that he could use 18 staff.  Has the number of staff increased?  I hope there has been an increase in staff but if there has not been, I will go back and try to improve that statistic.</p> <p>  My final question relates to biosimilar products.  This is a question for the HSE officials, Mr. Shaun Flanagan and Mr. John Hennessy.  I am aware of the biosimilars that could make significant savings to the drugs bill if they were used or even if the price of the original products was reduced to the same price as the biosimilars or if there was some sort of a competitive environment.  That would make saving that would make providing money for Kuvan, Translarna and Respreeza a great deal easier.  I ask that we pursue this vigorously because the savings are there for us as we speak, without having to do anything other than having physicians prescribing the biosimilars.  When that happens, as it happened with the generics, the original product comes down in price.</p></speech>

Access to orphan drugs is a very topical issue in Ireland at present and I wish to ask a couple of specific questions.  Can the HSE overturn a decision made by the NCPE?  If so, where has it happened and for which drug?</p> <p>  Mr. Hennessy referred to the assessment of orphan drugs.  In my view the process is largely flawed, particularly for one drug called Kuvan, which is used in the treatment of phenylketonuria, PKU.  Kuvan was approved by the FDA seven years ago, it was approved by the European regulator in 2009, it has been approved for use in 20 European countries and Ireland has one of the highest rates of PKU in the world.  More bizarre is the fact that Kuvan is made here in Ireland in County Cork.  I have outlined all of the mitigating circumstances for Kuvan to be approved as a drug to treat PKU.  Mr. Hennessy has said that the HSE will meet to discuss Kuvan in the coming months.  The meeting is imperative.  </p> <p>  I wish raise the perennial issue whereby pharmaceutical companies ask Governments to pay extortionate amounts of money for drugs.  It is all done at a time when they have countries and patients over a barrel.  I do not know whether Mr. Hennessy can comment on the matter.  The scenario is profiteering at its worst.  It is the jungle mentality of capitalism.  I would go so far as to say that huge pharmaceutical companies, and there are a lot of them in this country, are killing people.  The companies have priced people out of their health and countries out of their wealth.  I know Professor Barry because I have watched him speak a few times on television.  I have a great deal of respect for him because he said that pharmaceutical companies have flexed their power over countries where drugs should be available to people.  I ask the witnesses to comment on my questions, particularly my queries about Kuvan.  </p></speech>

Before the witnesses respond, I would like to ask a question.</p> <p>  Membership of the EU must yield substantial benefits.  Is it possible to harmonise the assessment process and, consequently, the pricing situation across Europe?  Harmonisation would strengthen negotiations on pricing with a company.  Surely that is one of the benefits to be gained from our membership of the EU.  </p> <p>  There is great dissatisfaction with the process from the point of view of patients, companies and politicians.  Deputy O'Connell has asked what we, as legislators, can do to improve the process.  Does the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 inhibit our ability to change the way we consider orphan drugs?  Is that the pressure point that we, as legislators, should consider?  I ask both Mr. Hennessy and Professor Barry to address my questions.</p></speech>

People have made huge amounts of money from this situation.  I fully respect the role that the HSE plays in trying to get the best value for money.  We have witnessed scenes where people protested at the gates of Leinster House.  People have put pressure on us to put pressure on the HSE.  The issue is cyclical, which is really unhelpful.  I echo what was said earlier.  If there is anything that we can do, from a legislative perspective, to make the process easier and eliminate problems then we should consider doing so.</p> <p>  In terms of the drug Kuvan, Mr. Hennessy talked about stakeholder involvement earlier.  I understand that the HSE is not hostile to the initiative but there does not seem to be a structured mechanism to allow stakeholder involvement.  Is there?  I ask because people have contacted us to tell us that they await news.  Unfortunately, they do not know whether to check the Internet or await a telephone call.  It seems that the families and patients, who are central to a lot of what we have discussed here this morning, often feel that they have been left out of the process.  I appreciate that Professor Barry and Mr. Hennessy have held a meeting and there might be another meeting.  Has a set of rules and protocols been written down that governs stakeholder and family involvement?  They do not feel like they have been involved.  They do not want to contact their local Deputy about this matter because they have better things to do.  They make telephone calls to our offices and drop in because they do not feel that they have been involved in the process.  Please outline how their involvement is catered for.</p></speech>

I would like to discuss what he has said because the figures he has quoted do not easily reconcile with me.  The number of products that have been declined or refused here is very small and I am only aware of a handful.  If he is suggesting that there are 148 products but only 53 are reimbursed here then that either means that an awful lot of them are still in process or they have been refused.  Clearly they have not been refused.</p></speech>

My experience is that where the clinical benefits are strong the products tend to be approved and cost is not the overriding factor.  I am talking about products that clearly transform the lives of patients or save their lives.  Where the clinical benefits are quite marginal and the prices are extremely high, that leads to a more protracted assessment and negotiation process.  That is the space in which we are having much of our conversation today. <br/><br/>I wish to say to Mr. Flanagan that the process for Kuvan is ongoing and we need to see the process through to conclusion and, obviously, give people due process, rights of reply, etc.  Further discussions are on the cards.<br/><br/>I am not sure I accept the analysis of the compassionate access to Respreeza.  The State and the HSE was not involved at the start of those programmes and was not involved at any stage in the process up to now.  It seems a bit disingenuous to now hand it over to the HSE and the State.  I imagine it is not an issue of price, even though we still have to meet the company to clarify the issue.  It would appear not to be a cost issue.  If it is not a cost issue then it would appear to be an attempt to get a product approved by a different mechanism.  If the product went through an application process that was concluded and the result was issued then getting involved in the compassionate access programme could be considered to be an approach to get Respreeza approved in spite of that decision.  We have yet to hear the explanations and I do not want to pre-empt the discussions.  I am sure that the committee members have also pondered the reasons the company is not prepared to continue the <i>status quo</i>and to provide for the administration of the drug.  There must be some explanation for it doing so but I do not know what it is at the moment.  We await the meeting with the company to clarify.<br/><br/>Deputy Brassil and other Deputies have asked what should happen.</p><p>What is being suggested is a change of policy that would somehow make access to orphan drugs easier.  What would be needed to do that is to relax the criteria that need to be considered.  The obvious thing that accompanies that is providing the funding to meet the cost.  If it is made easier for orphan drugs to be approved in this jurisdiction then there will be an inevitable cost that will come with that.  I might ask Mr. Flanagan to comment on the biosimilars point.</p></speech>

We are in discussions with a number of biosimilar companies around additional pricing opportunities with them.  There are automatic price reductions that take place.  There is a 30% price reduction that has taken place on the brands where a biosimilar has been introduced.  It is timely to flag that a number of our hospital groups have started tender processes for some biosimilars and in particular for infliximab.  I refer to formal tender processes with clinicians within the hospital groups.  Clearly the difference between the biosimilars and the generics is that with generics there is a substitution available at the pharmacy level.  That is not an opportunity currently with biosimilars.  Evidence may develop over time to get that and make it easier.  However, even with generics it was very difficult to get all clinicians on side around them and the committee will know that from its own experience.</p> <p>  What changed the market in Ireland almost overnight was the ability to enforce some level of substitution.  I am not suggesting that the evidence is strong enough there yet for biosimilars but I think it is challenging to try to get clinicians to use them.  It is about encouragement, trying to bring clinicians along and to get them to prescribe biosimilars.  That is a bit of a challenge in some areas but particularly when the clinicians do not necessarily see the advantages of the biosimilar.  Sometimes the clinicians may not realise that the inability of the HSE to maximise the use of biosimilars could be impacting on the new drugs that they want.  We need people to buy in and understand that there is a life cycle when a biosimilar is introduced.  If it is not used there is an opportunity cost.  That is something the committee has clearly identified.  We do not have the size of fund that we would wish to have available for all new medicines.  That involves people taking a public good approach rather than a "what is in it for me" approach.  Occasionally in our engagements there tends to be a "what is in it for me" and "what is in it for my service locally" approach.  We need to get beyond that and we need people to realise that if there are biosimilars then the failure to proscribe them does have costs.  People might not necessarily be aware of them and maybe there is no new drug on the horizon in their space but there are new drugs on the horizon in other spaces.  I would echo that.  We are working with a number of the biosimilar companies trying to learn from their experience in other countries around how they manage to leverage and get better utilisation.</p> <p>  In terms of phenylketonuria, PKU and the timelines, there was an assessment in 2009 and a decision was made that Sapropterin, or Kuvan, would not be reimbursed at that time.  The fact that we are looking again at it shows that the HSE is always open to taking that approach.  That addresses some of the questions that the Senator was asking around Translarna, as in is the door closed.  The door is never closed.  We will always look again at a medicine.  The door is never closed.  We say no to the application that we have at the current time but if new information becomes available a new assessment process is started and that is what has happened in the case of Sapropterin, or Kuvan.  We are due to meet the company.  I do not want to get into the issue of the newspaper media and the outcome of the negotiations, but the meeting with the company is due in the next weeks as opposed to months.  </p> <p>  I cannot answer the question on an extortionate approach being taken for the simple reason that I have to engage with the industry and if I was to go and say it was extortionate it might-----</p></speech>

That is not a criticism of the process undertaken by the NCPE.  It looks at a medicine at a priming point, at a price at that point and gives advice.  Professor Barry is always very clear in the media that what he is giving is advice on the basis of the proposition put forward by the company.  Is it a reasonable use of money at that time?  If we can improve the commercial terms, clearly the reality is for almost every medicine 20% to 25%, 30% to 35% is how the terms move.  That is how the prices move over time.  That is a substantively different matter to the that Professor Barry would have been asked to look at.</p></speech>

Where we would say "No" initially to the initial price ask, as Mr. Flanagan was saying, one can get a substantial price reductions.  That means of course that the expenditure from the HSE on that drug is much less and it is therefore available for other things.  I think they use our work in a pretty good way many times.</p></speech>

With regard to the questions on harmonisation on reimbursement, there is obviously the challenge that different countries have different abilities to pay.  That is a statement of fact.  We have tried to engage with our colleagues in Europe.  For example, in preparation and even during the Orkambi discussions we met our colleagues from The Netherlands in The Hague.  Could we have agreed a process?  We made a decision to say "Yes" in June but they have only been able to say "Yes" now.  Our colleagues in the UK have still not said "Yes", nor have colleagues in Australia and Belgium.  They have a different view to the one that the HSE and this State ultimately took.  It is difficult to get everybody aligned on the same basis.  I doubt that we got an offer that they did not get.  I doubt my team is that good.  Perhaps we are but I doubt it.  I would imagine that pharmaceutical companies take a pan-European approach that at a particular point in time they will offer a certain price.  Maybe in a year's time it will be that price minus 5% or minus 10% as price moves on.</p></speech>

Reimbursement agencies internationally would concur that companies go to the countries that pay the highest prices first.  There is no doubt that in the past, a decade ago, Ireland was the first.  We know where our prices were a decade ago.  Unfortunately, once one starts challenging companies are reluctant to make concessions.  Over time they might make a concession in Germany.  My guess is that concession then becomes available across Europe because someone has broken the bar within their own government structure.  Then maybe France does a better deal, maybe Ireland does a better deal,  and that becomes available to other countries and parties trickle into it eventually.  Could we do better if we got everybody on side?  Perhaps we could.  However, how do we make that happen?  We are all willing in our budget, our national service plan process, to put aside the amount of money needed to say "Yes" to these 25 or 30 drugs.</p> <p>  The one point I would make to the criticisms of our process is that there are 45 new medicines that come through the EMA every year.  Some of those medicines have multiple indications.  The list we are getting here today is four or five medicines.  There are not 40 medicines coming through in representations.  That is my understanding because I have not seen the replies to the parliamentary questions.  Yes, we are having challenges and yes, we are facing funding difficulties.  However, historically our record is very good.  Over the last few years we have struggled.  As a country we have come out of the biggest economic depression in decades.  We managed to keep the process going through that from the significant savings that we made through reference pricing and generic substitutions.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that in the last couple of years there has been a step-change in the number of medicine coming to us.  The committee could give me a couple of hundred million euro today and I still would not be able to clear every medicine over the next five years.  That is the reality.</p><p>That is the volume of it.</p></speech>

Professor Barry might want to comment a bit more on the changes that are happening in the pharmaceutical world that are moving now away from the high volume products towards rarer products and higher prices.  That does seem to be a significant pattern.  Perhaps it explains why we are back at this committee for the second time this year; that signifies in its own way the importance of this issue as an emerging issue for so many people.</p> <p>  To finish on Deputy Kenny's point, it does not appear that the product being made in Ireland gives us any entitlement to better pricing by the way but maybe that should be something that is worth considering a bit further.  It does not appear that way to us anyway in terms of pricing strategies that are accompanying applications.  </p> <p>  On Deputy O'Reilly's point about structured or more structured measures to address stakeholder involvement, I think we would be open to exploring that and examining that further.  Stakeholder, patient and advocacy groups are very welcome to make submissions as part of any application that is being processed at any time and to be heard.  We are happy to conduct oral hearings in the course of the assessment of a new product, but if there are measures that can be done to strengthen that and improve that I think we would be very open to that.  Obviously, at some point the process has to close and the decision get taken on an application.  Otherwise it goes on indefinitely.  </p></speech>

Our colleagues in Scotland have been very active in this.  However, they did get &pound;1 million to actually do it.  It is very labour intensive and it requires resources to do proper stakeholder engagement.  With our current resources stakeholder engagement would make it very difficult for us indeed.  We try to do the best we can and try to incorporate it into our assessments whenever we can.</p> <p>  On harmonisation, I do not see European harmonisation happening anytime soon.  There is no evidence that the European countries would agree on the process for assessment.  Some of them would require legislative change if pan-European heath technology assessment, HTA, was brought in; Germany is an example, it is in their constitution.  Then there is the differing cost base right across the Europe.  Even the drug prices will differ substantially across Europe because of various margins not to mention other health care costs like hospitalisation utilisation.  It is something we discuss regularly at international meetings, only just yesterday and the day before.  The conclusion of those meetings was that this will not happen any time soon.  That does not mean that we cannot try.  That is why we saw the Belgians, Dutch, Luxembourgers and Austrians coming together into BeNeLuxA.  Having said that, they still said no at the end of their joint assessment of Orkambi.  It is not going to happen any time soon to be honest.  I do not see it happening from what I see.  </p></speech>

I fully appreciate the work that the witnesses do and that their goal is the same as mine.  The witnesses do not need to be defensive as far as I am concerned.  I respect what they are doing.  I am just trying to improve what we do with the resources we have to make as many new and orphan drugs available as we can that are beneficial and cost effective.</p> <p> The supplementary question I have, which I asked the last time that the witnesses were in, and did not get an answer to at the time may be something that the witnesses could follow up for me.  What percentage of our drugs bill is spent on orphan drugs and drugs for rare diseases?  That is an important statistic for the witnesses to have so that they can compare it with other EU countries.  It is important if we are in a low percentile, we could increase, mindful of the fact that as technology develops and companies develop new medicines, we should have a target percentage-wise and work within those parameters.  That might make it easier for the witnesses to do their job as well.  </p> <p>  Kuvan is under discussion.  There is substantial evidence, I hope, to show that Kuvan does work.  Mr. Flanagan made the point that there are 45 drugs and we are only talking about a few.  I would respond by saying that the reason we are only talking about a few is because I believe those drugs to be effective and that is why we are arguing about those.  I believe in Respreeza.  I have met the patients, I have dealt with them, I have spoken to them, I have seen the benefit to them and that is why I am advocating on their behalf.  The same applies with Kuvan.  I have met the families involved and I have seen the research.  The drug can bring about a very significant improvement in quality of life  I am not going to get into the Translarna one because I think it has been debated enough.  </p> <p>  The last point I would make to Mr. Hennessy concerns the comment he reiterated about Respreeza coming back on the witnesses.  I think the Declaration of Helsinki clearly states that we are involved whether we like it or not.  I also go back to the point about the reply to the parliamentary question, whether it was something that the witnesses are going to regret putting in or not for rest of their days.  I do not know.  However, by stating that the HSE will continue to provide the treatment for that patient cohort for two weeks I firmly believe that basically says that the witnesses believe that it has a benefit or otherwise they would not have agreed to do that.  Please take all those things into consideration and sort out this administration issue so that we can get it out of the way and hopefully in six months time we may come to a solution on that particular product.</p></speech>

I think the Deputy referred to orphan drugs and medicines that are cost effective and effective.  The point that we have been trying to get across is that if that is the decision criteria, we cannot get there.  For some of the orphan medicines, if they are to be reimbursed they have to be reimbursed despite the cost effective evidence.  I would like to get that nuance out there.</p></speech>

They can decide that it is not relevant in this case; it is not possible because due to the low patient cohort, they cannot get the clinical data; they can make a call on this on a separate basis and I think they have to-----</p></speech>

We think that we have pushed the legislation as far as we can.  A lot of the things we are being criticised for, some of them are on a pure evidence basis where we are not necessarily aligned with the Deputy on all of those evidence bases.  However, in many cases, if people want a "yes" to all of those medicines, that has to be in the full knowledge that the medicine is cost ineffective.  Does the Deputy know what I mean?  It is proven beyond doubt that the medicine is cost ineffective.  I do not mean to be offensive in anyway but that is the challenge that the HSE faces.  When we know that we must consider its consequence for other services and that is the policy and ethical nuance that we are always hanging on.

When a drug comes off patent, competition applies.  Companies will do their level best to hold on to as much as they can and get as much as they can for it but there is nothing that we should be doing that in any way prevents us from getting the best possible value, and I make no apologies to any company out there, one gets one's opportunity and one makes one's investment and the more profit that one makes that is fine by me.  However, when one's patent time is up and there is an opportunity them for the drug to be made elsewhere and better value to be achieved we should be achieving that to the maximum.</p><p>If we did, I guarantee that the witnesses would not be sitting there worrying about the few million euro that we need for those important drugs because the HSE would have the money to deal with the matter.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Frank Feighan for his attendance to facilitate the commencement of our meeting.  I have received apologies from Senator Frances Black.  The purpose of today's meeting is to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the communications (retention of data) Bill 2017.  I welcome from the Department of Justice and Equality, Ms Geraldine Moore, principal officer, Mr. Dermot Woods, principal officer, and Ms Layla de Cogan Chin, assistant principal officer.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance to discuss this important legislation.  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question-and-answer session with the members.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the attention of our witnesses to the situation on privilege.  The witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members of the committee should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms Moore to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Moore" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017110800002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to participate in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the communications (retention of data) Bill which was published in October.  The purpose of the Bill is to update data retention law in Ireland to take account of evolving European Court of Justice jurisprudence in the area.</p> <p>  By way of background to the general scheme, the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 provides the legal basis for the retention and subsequent disclosure of both telephone and Internet data for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of serious offences and safeguarding the security of the State.  The data in question are subscriber data, which are the identity of the subscriber, and traffic and location data such as the location of a mobile phone and the numbers of other mobile phones it has communicated with.  Access to such data is very important in the context of both combating serious crime and safeguarding the security of the State.</p> <p>  In its judgement of April 2014 in the Digital Rights Ireland case, the European Court of Justice found the EU data retention directive to be incompatible with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The judgement was the consequence of the referral of a number of questions concerning the compliance of the EU data retention directive with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to the European Court of Justice by the Irish High Court.  The court found the directive went beyond what is necessary in that by requiring subscriber, traffic and location data to be held by service providers, it entailed an interference with the lives of almost all citizens in Europe and not just those linked to serious crime.  It also held that the directive did not expressly provide that access to and subsequent use of the data should be restricted to the purpose of preventing serious offences.  The directive did not provide for prior review by a court or independent administrative body when law enforcement agencies sought access to metadata.  There was no clear basis in the directive for the length of time that service providers were obliged to retain data. </p> <p>  In light of the ruling, the Government approved the drafting of a revised data retention Bill which would take cognisance of the findings of the court.  In December 2016, the European Court of Justice considered the issue of data retention again, and in its ruling in Tele2, which related to data retention law in Sweden and the UK, the court adopted a strict interpretation of its previous ruling in the Digital Rights Ireland case.  The court found that national legislation providing for general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for the purpose of fighting crime was in breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It did not, however, preclude member states from adopting legislation permitting the targeted retention of such data.</p><p>It also found that EU law precluded national legislation from providing for data retention and disclosure which was not restricted to fighting serious crime, where access was not subject to prior review by a court or independent administrative authority, and where there was no legal requirement for the data concerned to be retained within the European Union.<br/><br/>The 2011 Act already provides for a number of the requirements identified by the court.  The current Act provides that data can only be accessed by specific agencies where the data are required for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence, the safeguarding of the security of the State or the saving of human life.  Additional safeguards provided for in the legislation to protect the data in question include data security provisions, data destruction provisions and restriction on access to retained data.  The legislation also provides for oversight of its operation by a High Court judge who reports to the Taoiseach at least annually and for a complaints referee, who is a Circuit Court judge, to deal with the concerns of any persons who believe that their data may have been unlawfully accessed in breach of the Act.  These safeguards have been retained in the revised Bill.<br/><br/>The existing legislation requires service providers to retain Internet data for one year and telephone and mobile data for two years, and allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies to make direct requests to service providers for retained data for investigative purposes, and as such, the legislation needs to reflect those elements of the European Court of Justice rulings.  While in strict legal terms the Tele2 judgment does not have direct effect in Irish law, it sets down clear parameters on what member states may provide for in national legislation relating to data retention, and as we are obliged to ensure that our law is in compliance with EU law, we have revised the original heads of the Bill approved by Government in 2015 to take account of the ruling in the Tele2 judgment as well.<br/><br/>The revised general scheme which members have before them responds to both EU Court of Justice rulings by providing for ministerial authorisation for the retention by service providers of targeted categories of traffic and location data for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime or safeguarding the security of the State; by requiring judicial authorisation for disclosure of retained data to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies; by providing for notification of persons whose data have been disclosed when such notification is unlikely to jeopardise the investigation of an offence or to undermine the security of the State; and by providing for the data concerned to be held for a 12 month period and for that data to be held in the EU.  Overall oversight of the new legislation will continue to be vested in a High Court judge, with a judge of the Circuit Court independently investigating complaints.<br/><br/>It has to be said that the Tele2 judgment is challenging from a law enforcement point of view.  It limits national legislation to requiring the targeted retention of data based on objective evidence.  While the Bill reflects this requirement and provides for the making by the Minister of orders for the retention of specified categories of data, the actual making of such orders will require careful consideration.  No final decisions have been made on what specific categories of data might be the subject of ministerial orders for targeted retention.<br/><br/>In January 2016, following reports alleging inappropriate accessing of the telephone records of certain journalists, the Government commissioned a review of the law in this area.  In his review of the law on the retention of and access to communications data, Mr. Justice Murray took account of the Tele2<i></i>judgment.  Most of the review is taken up with an analysis of the 2011 data retention Act with recommendations on how the Act might be amended in light of the judgment.  This report has been hugely helpful to us in preparing these proposals.  The vast majority of its recommendations have been taken into account in the general scheme, with a small number of issues to be resolved in finalising the Bill.<br/><br/>There are relatively few recommendations specific to accessing the data of journalists contained in the review, the key one of which is that access to journalists&rsquo; retained data for the specific purpose of identifying their journalistic sources should be authorised by a judge of the High Court.  The approach advocated by the Minister is to apply the protection of judicial authorisation to every citizen in all cases and not just to a particular class of citizen in particular cases.  The revised heads of the Bill propose that any application for authorisation to access any person&rsquo;s data, except in cases of urgency, must be approved by one of a number of designated District Court judges.  This is the strictest form of compliance with the ruling of the European Court of Justice which requires authorisation either by a judge or an independent body.  The hierarchy of a complaints procedure administered by a Circuit Court judge and oversight of operation of the Act by a High Court judge has been maintained.  Given the proposals in the Bill, making additional provisions for High Court authorisation for accessing journalists&rsquo; data in certain cases could give rise to complexities.  Such an authorisation would only apply to requests for access to journalistic sources, so District Court authorisations would be required for all other access requests.  The result would be that other categories of persons who may have sources, for example, Members of these Houses, would be treated differently.  Search warrants, which could result in more intrusive content data being discovered, are issued by the District Court.  For these reasons, the Minister believes that there are strong arguments for a clear and consistent level of judicial protection for everyone&rsquo;s data, but of course he would welcome the committee&rsquo;s views on this.  The Minister forwarded a copy of Mr. Justice Murray&rsquo;s review together with the revised heads of the Bill in order that the committee could examine the proposed legislation and the review together in considering the Minister&rsquo;s proposal for a balanced and proportionate data retention regime providing a high level of protection for all citizens.<br/><br/>Committee members will have read through the heads of the Bill.  There are numerous key new provisions, including in heads 3 and 4 which place an obligation on service providers to retain subscriber data for a period of 12 months from the date on which the data were first processed and allow the competent authorities to make direct requests to service providers for that data.  Heads 5 and 6 provide for applications to be made by the competent authorities for ministerial orders for the targeted retention of categories of traffic and location data or traffic and location data in respect of specified persons for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime or safeguarding the security of the State and for the making of ministerial orders to retain such data.  Head 8 allows a competent authority to apply to an authorising judge for an authorisation to make a disclosure request.  Head 15 provides for the notification of a person who has been the subject of a disclosure request or other persons whose interests have been materially affected by the disclosure request.  Most of the other provisions of the Bill relating to data security, data destruction arrangements, restrictions on access to retained data, the complaints procedure and oversight of the operation of the Act by a High Court judge have been taken from the existing 2011 Act.<br/><br/>I hope that I have provided the committee with an understanding of the background to and content of the Bill and I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

It is important, in the first instance, to remember the background and context for this, and having read the Murray report, I am not certain that the Bill as currently proposed would meet the threshold that is laid out in that report.  One of the recommendations of the Murray report was that consideration should be given to the inclusion in any amending legislation governing access to retained communications data of a provision expressly prohibiting access for the purpose of identifying a journalist's sources, except in accordance with the circumstance and conditions laid down in that legislation.  Those conditions should be the suspected commission of a serious criminal offence or unlawful activity.  It appears that the threshold as outlined here is lower because the Minister can, for example, intervene in circumstances where there is only a suspicion of such activity.  There is a mismatch between the recommendations of the Murray report and the heads of this Bill.  I know that the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, and others have expressed concern that this does not meet the threshold and does not implement the recommendations of the Murray report.  I invite Ms Moore to comment on that.</p></speech>

The Act applies to everyone, to all citizens.  Head 8, which is probably one of the most important heads, sets out what has to be considered by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the other State agencies in making an application for an authorisation.  They have to be satisfied that the data would relate to a person who is suspected of having committed a serious offence or would have implications for State security.  The provisions of head 8 apply equally to journalists.</p></speech>

Does she not think that there is a need to include that within the general scheme of the Bill?</p></speech>

We did not think it would be appropriate to provide for particular categories of persons.  We would have had to draw up a list of particular categories and we would end up with a two-tier regime.  We have provided for the one data retention regime and all the protections apply to everyone equally.</p></speech>

The draft scheme does not seem to have met that threshold.</p></speech>

We had been working on the draft scheme before Mr. Justice Murray's report and had decided in favour of a District Court authorisation procedure for everyone.  When we received Mr. Justice Murray's report, we considered the proposal in regard to the High Court but journalists are not the only ones who would have sources to protect.  As I said in my statement, Members of the Houses or teachers or doctors could have sources.  It would be very difficult to legislate in this way for a particular category.</p></speech>

The level of intrusiveness is potentially increased by lowering the threshold.

It does not appear that this requirement is laid out in the general scheme.  Again, it seems that the threshold or requirement is more vague and is not specifically defined within the general scheme.  Has Ms Moore tried to match this against that judgment or from what has she tried to set the threshold?</p></speech>

He said previously that the legislation will clearly define what the circumstances are in which sources could potentially be accessed.

He can investigate any case.  He has powers of investigation, powers to request information and powers to compel people to provide him with information.  He can make recommendations, including revoking an authorisation, and he can communicate with the Minister, with the Data Protection Commissioner and the Taoiseach in this regard.

There is also information in respect of those who are not involved in it, but may have information.  The second heading relates to State security and a person who is suspected of posing an existing and serious threat to the security of the State.  Can Ms Moore give me an example of where a person may pose a threat to the security of the State, but he or she would not be involved in the commission of an offence?</p></speech>

I would assess that in the vast of cases those people who pose a threat to the security of the State are likely committing a serious offence.  Essentially, these powers are targeted at terrorist organisations or people who would be providing support or other services to terrorist organisations and, largely speaking, they would be doing so in committing a serious offence.  There may be circumstances where persons would be providing legitimate financial services but for a terrorist purpose.  It may be difficult immediately in terms of the evidence available to the authorities to identify the criminal offence but they would have intelligence information perhaps from other agencies or from other sources or investigations that support or succour would be in the course of being provided.  Those actions would of themselves be a threat to the security of the State.  However, the Deputy is quite right that in the vast majority of cases, they would already be committing a criminal offence, such as a firearms or explosive offence.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Woods envisage the issue about the threat to the security of the State being used against people in the political sphere?</p></speech>

Part of what guards against that now in the framework of thresholds that has been put in place in the proposal here is that there is in effect a two stage process by which access to traffic and location data will be governed.  The first is an application to the Minister in which a reasoned case which satisfies the thresholds must be made.  The second is then to access the actual data that has been instructed to be retained in front of a judge and again the thresholds have to be reached to the satisfaction of a judge.  The requirements that are set out in the Act in each occasion that the data is to be accessed have to be satisfied and the judge can only then authorise access to it.  Subsequent to that, after the fact, there are two layers of further oversight.  One is the complaints referee in an individual application and the second is the designated judge who has a general oversight of the Act, including access to individual applications and authorisations.</p> <p>  Coming back to the point of pitching at the threshold of the District Court, that also fits into the Minister's decision to retain the existing oversight arrangements but also to manage the new process of authorisation for access within the current hierarchy that exists between the various judicial levels in the courts.</p></speech>

Deputy Chambers was asking whether there should be a new head or a provision within one of the heads recognising what is referred to as journalistic privilege.  The response was that everyone is covered by this and why should journalists be given a particular heading.  However, in our law there is some recognition of the principle of journalistic privilege which does not really apply to many others.  Was that given consideration or is it something that the Minister intends to give consideration to, particularly in light of the Murray report?</p></speech>

I think the Minister's view partly, on the one hand, is that if one identifies journalists as a group who have a particular position, and indeed they do and that is recognised in law and would therefore have to be taken into account by the District Court judge who is considering granting an authorisation, there is also particular recognition in law of the privileged position of medical practitioners or legal practitioners or sacerdotal privilege.  Members of the Oireachtas have a particular position and that is recognised in law also.  One ends up then with a potential schedule of individuals in respect of whom applications might have to be made in a different way and who would then attract a greater protection for the same rights than other citizens.  The Minister's view was that his preference was to accord protection across the board.  That does not mean that journalists are in any way less protected than other citizens.  It means that they have an equivalent protection.  In respect of the arrangements that are in place in law already, the specific position in law of the protection of journalistic sources, those arrangements have to be taken into consideration by the judge in assessing whether he will grant access of not.</p></speech>

In a way, there is an oddly complex interaction between the two judgments.  In the 2014 Digital Rights Ireland judgment, the ECJ set out a number of features of what would constitute a proper data retention regime.  According to subsequent analysis and interpretation of it, it set out not quite a checklist of all of the factors that must be satisfied in order for a regime to be complaint, but that there could be a pattern of arrangements, elements of which would, if drawn together, satisfy a threshold set by the court.  Many features of the existing Irish regime satisfy those requirements.</p> <p>  The Tele2 and Watson joint case and judgment built on the Digital Rights Ireland judgment but took a significant step further.  The court set out a number of features that were required, including a mandatory checklist.  That has led us to putting in place legislation that satisfies those ECJ requirements.  Given that the requirements of EU law have changed, we must satisfy them.  Even though some of the existing features of the Act satisfy requirements of the Tele2 judgment, in overall terms they are not satisfied, so we have to put in place additional measures, for example, independent prior authorisation, judicial authorisation and an explicit requirement for the data to be retained in the EU.  Such elements must be put in place, which is why the Act is being revised.</p></speech>

However, the ECJ has found that a number of features are required of any given data retention scheme in a member state.  We must satisfy those in so far as they are not currently satisfied.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the ECJ does not pronounce on the validity of national law.  It cannot.  It pronounces on the validity of European law, as it did with the 2006 directive, or it sets out the requirements of European law, in this case in respect of the charter, that have to be satisfied by national systems of legislation in order to be compliant with EU law.  That is what we must do now.  It is a position that faces all of the EU member states.  I will not say "as a matter of routine", but almost as a matter of routine, the ECJ will evolve and develop European law and member states have to respond to that.  That is what we are doing in this case.</p></speech>

The Murray report highlights the importance of an objective standard of data security and that achieving objective standards in respect of EU law would require a robust form of monitoring and supervision of service providers by an independent authority with a clearly defined role and expressly associated powers and duties.  Mr. Justice Murray suggested the Data Protection Commissioner for this role.  Why has the Department not accepted his recommendation?</p></speech>

We decided to opt for what we had previously and which worked well, namely, the review of the operation of the Act by a designated High Court judge who has overview of all aspects of the legislation and who can investigate any case in respect of which authorisations or approvals were granted.  The judge would have extensive powers to access documentation or compel people to provide him or her with information and could make recommendations in that regard.  That is the system that we have put in place.  There is also a complaints procedure for people who are concerned that their data have been disclosed in breach of the legislation.</p></speech>

I am not particularly involved in the development of the legislative proposals on the GDPR and the directive but, as a matter of course, the Data Protection Commissioner will have a role in respect of, for example, a given service provider in terms of the latter's general compliance with the GDPR.  The arrangements that will be put in place in that regard, reflecting in more detail what is in the current data protection Acts, require service providers and other private corporations to have in place arrangements of a particular standard for the protection of personal data.  In that regard, the Data Protection Commissioner will have a power of enforcement and investigation in respect of that for telephony service providers as she will for any other private corporation.</p><p>In addition, there are the layers of judicial supervision at District, Circuit and High Court levels.  It is due to the specific nature of the data that are held and processed, for example, in respect of members of a criminal gang or people who carry out criminal offences, that we think it is important to retain the independent scrutiny at a judicial level.  All of that is in addition to the general scrutiny that would be available in law anyway to the Data Protection Commissioner.  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, will not take away that role from her in respect of the investigation and oversight of data controllers' management of personal data.</p></speech>

The Minister will give great consideration to making the order on the data, and will only do so if he considers it to be proportionate.  On the judicial authorisation, the judge making the authorisation will have to be satisfied that the authorisation is for valid purposes, including for the investigation of an offence.  The criteria for such considerations is set out in the legislation.  We believe that the targeted retention and judicial authorisation will work well together as a process.</p></speech>

For example, there is great potential for a person in the Government of the day to take advantage of something potentially being in the interest of the security of the State in order to withhold information.</p></speech>

We should not forget that there are <i>post facto</i>judicial and independent control mechanisms.  The designated judge who examines the use of the powers under legislation such as this each year in a detailed way would very quickly identify if there was a problem in that regard or some abuse of the process.  No such abuse has been identified.  There may be individuals engaged in paramilitary organisations on an ongoing basis who would not necessarily at a given point be convicted of an offence but would still be engaged in activities giving rise to State security issues, such as, for example, a paramilitary or serious criminal organisation  There would be a difficulty in maintaining the value of the investigatory power of the Garda in counteracting those activities if at a certain point in the process it had to reveal information to the individual that let him or her know they were under investigation or the subject of interest for those paramilitary activities.  However, because there are three layers of potential judicial examination of each application, which is a process independent of the Minister, there is not much scope for widespread abuse.Although a detailed case will have to be made to the Minister to make an order for retention, the key point in our view and that of several other member states, as highlighted in the Digital Rights Ireland and the Tele2 Sverige AB cases at the ECJ, is that controls need to be at the point of access rather than retention.  Although the Minister may issue an order to a service provider to retain a subset of data for an individual, the data is not released to anybody outside the company until a judge has decided that it can be accessed by, for example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is one layer of judicial control.  At that point it must satisfy all the requirements set out in the Act and the judge would also take into account the general principles of law that go beyond what is explicitly set out in the Act.  Subsequent to that, there is a potential level of control by a Circuit Court judge, Judge Hannan, who is the complaints referee, and then a further level of routine control by Ms Justice Baker, who is the designated judge.  They have very significant powers of access and compulsion in respect of records and persons involved and can recommend remedies.  For example, the complaints referee can recommend a remedy in terms of a sum of compensation which must be given effect to by the Minister.  There is no choice in law about that.  In that sense, there is a strong pattern of independent judicial oversight that guards against abuse and that is independent of the Minister in respect of both the use of the retained data powers for criminal offences and in respect of the security of the State,.</p></speech>

In that context, we have to proceed with caution and be very attentive to the opinions of human rights bodies in the State and across Europe.  As the witnesses said, journalists are afforded a certain amount of privilege and protection in any case in terms of their employment and, therefore, I do not believe it necessary that they be singled out for special protection.  There is a certain irony in the uproar that occurred when GSOC went looking for journalists' phone records not to investigate the journalists but in order to look into garda&iacute; illegally invading the privacy of other citizens.  When the journalists' records were sought in order to investigate those illegal acts, the journalists complained their privacy was being violated but they had no problem using the information to illegally violate other people's privacy.  Sadly, the days of a free press crusading against the State are long gone, as is evidenced by Denis O'Brien owning 60% of the Irish media and those in RT&Eacute; behaving like lackeys.  A crusading press does not exist and journalists do not deserve any special privilege, although I wish there were some worthy of it.  I do not think there is anything less or special there because the protections are the same.  The big question is whether the protections are adequate for anybody and I have concerns in that regard.</p> <p>  The witnesses have said that not every District Court judge will be involved.  I am thankful for that because the carry-on of some is well documented and people would be really scared if it were envisaged that every District Court judge would be responsible.  That is particularly so as we do not have a judicial council to have oversight of judicial conduct in the performance of their duties.  Although the witnesses have said there will be a panel rather than every District Court judge being involved, that is not enough and I would be uncomfortable with it.  It should at least be at Circuit Court level.  I presume the witnesses do not envisage requests coming in every day of the week and, therefore, it should not be a particularly onerous function whereby one would have to give up one's day job to deal with all of this.  I do not see how a Circuit Court judge or a panel of Circuit Court judges would not be better in that regard.</p></speech>

Who would select the panel?  How is that decided?   Who appoints them?  Where is the input on that issue?  I appreciate the witnesses have half dealt with the issue.  It will be a problematic area.</p> <p>  As regards judicial oversight and adopting the model of some of the procedures under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, we have repeatedly highlighted the deficiencies in that legislation in terms of people not being able to access a complaints procedure because they did not know their communication was intercepted unless they learned of it by accident.  There are particular deficiencies in judicial oversight and we gave an example of the judge overseeing the procedure going in and spending half a day covering the Garda, the Defence Forces and the other areas that needed to be checked in terms of whether the legislation was complied with.  That is not effective judicial oversight and I am concerned by it.</p><p>The officials have said that they are considering reviewing that model and I hope they do so because that will be a problem.   </p><p> The last issue is the option of being allowed to do it without any judicial oversight at all if the urgency of the situation dictates it.  Again, how is urgency being defined here?  Where is that quantified?  Who determines that the situation does not require judicial oversight?  I note that a superior officer has to prepare a report within seven days to explain why it was done without judicial oversight but there needs to be more meat on defining that in its entirety.  </p><p> In terms of the points made by Deputy Wallace about threats to the State, the argument could be made that  individuals are involved in a paramilitary organisation or in criminality and therefore they cannot know that their data is being retained.  Surely the point is that garda&iacute; only believe the person is involved in criminality or paramilitary activity but do not know that to be the case.  They do not have the evidence to prove it because if they did, they would have brought them before the courts.  There is a danger there, in the context of the Special Criminal Court, non-jury courts and so forth of this being done under the auspices of dealing with terrorism but then being used by everyone else.  I would still have questions around that.  </p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has told us that in the year up to October 2016, there were 1,027 missing persons.  Approximately 500 to 600 of those went missing late at night.  In those circumstances, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would ask the service providers to tell them the last known location of the person's mobile phone.  That is where they would envisage using the urgency provision without judicial authorisation.</p></speech>

If one reads it strictly, it would not allow one to access retained data in order to locate somebody who has disappeared and who may have mental health issues and whose family knows that there is a risk of suicide.  This is one of the routine uses for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in trying to locate people at short notice.  One often comes across cases of elderly people who have Alzheimer's disease or dementia who have left their care home or their home and there is an urgent requirement to locate them.  We have taken the view that it simply could not be understood that one could not put in place, where a person's life might be in imminent danger, an arrangement or mechanism to try to support locating that person.  That is the key, if not the overwhelming use of the urgency procedure in respect of communications data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is used in efforts to locate people at short notice.  It can also happen in cases where, for example, in a domestic violence situation a woman has been removed from the house by her husband who is abusing her.  There have been cases of women who have been taken out of their homes being located in the boot of a car.  The locating of such people is achieved by using location data from the last use of the phone.  It is in those circumstances that there is an identified and justifiable need for an urgency procedure in order to make sure that data garda&iacute; need in order to try to locate people can be accessed.</p></speech>

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

That order came to light when the then Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Joe Meade, said that in the event that the aforementioned order remained the sole basis on which data was retained, he would challenge it in the absence of any further legislative basis.</p></speech>

That was the basis on which Digital Rights Ireland launched its legal challenge to the data retention regime and that was commenced on 11 August 2006.  It was evident to Digital Rights Ireland that the data retention regime in Ireland was not compatible with European law or the Constitution.  I am somewhat constrained in respect of discussing the matter because it remains a live action to this day.</p><p> Anyway, it was interesting to hear the comments from departmental officials in respect of the position on the Tele2 judgment.  The departmental position has been that the current Act is not satisfied by the Tele2 judgment.  In other words, it is not in compliance.  However, the Department's position in terms of its defence before the courts remains a full defence on all heads of the action.  The defence continues to rely upon the now struck-down data retention directive, among other things.</p><p> It is difficult to address these two tracks plainly.  I propose to simply address some of the principles that are being restated by way of the Communications (Data Retention) Bill 2017 and to demonstrate why the problems that have always been present in this legislative format continue in this latest incarnation.</p><p> Primarily, the problems lie in Ireland's duty to ensure that European law is upheld.  The State has a duty to ensure that the requirements of European law are not breached.  Several areas of the general scheme are specifically in breach of the provisions laid out in the Digital Rights Ireland case.  That case set out the principles on which a data retention scheme could be brought in.  It stated the general principle that unless a scheme met those principles, it was illegal.  The reason the directive fell was that it did not meet those principles.  Our original legislative provisions were based on that directive and continue to be based on that directive.</p><p> The new scheme requires that there continues to be a shortfall between the checklist in the Tele2 and Digital Rights Ireland cases and what is proposed to be brought in now.  In consequence, the new legislation, like all previous legislation on this topic, will still be in breach of European law.  This is bad, obviously, because Ireland is required to be in compliance with European law.  Moreover, it will have specific consequences in respect of the use of the evidence gathered and the significance of how that evidence can be relied upon in court.</p><p> If it is the case, as has been decided by the Supreme Court, that data collected in good faith by the Garda by a means which is believed to be fair and reasonable but which subsequently turns out not to be, then it is possible for the courts to such data collected in that manner into account.</p><p> It is held by the State that data currently being collected and accessed is protected by that decision of the Supreme Court.  However, there is no doubt &ndash; it was acknowledged at the committee today - that since the Tele2 and Digital Rights Ireland cases it is clear the State system of collecting data is not in compliance with the law, and the State knows this.</p><p> This is a crisis.  In his report, Mr. Justice Murray recognises the level of crisis this represents.  He makes a strong call for the current regime to be suspended.  That is not simply from the position of human rights and civil rights, although these are absolutely critical.  It is also because there will be instances, if this goes forward, of the occurrence of risk that prosecutions that would otherwise be successful could face challenge.  This could arise on foot of evidence produced being challenged on the ground that the State knew or ought to have known that it was not properly collected.</p><p> What we have is a system of mass surveillance.  It has been going on for little over a decade, longer if we take the pre-legislative position.  It has been under-challenged since 2006.  The European law underpinnings have been found to be incompatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and, therefore, incompatible with European law.</p><p> Contrary to the statement committee members heard earlier, European law is directly effective on Ireland.  Unlike the European Court of Human Rights, judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union are directly effective in Ireland.  Decisions in respect of legality are directly effective.  They can be appealed to and are superior to Irish law.  What we have is a system whereby those laws have been allowed to continue.  I am not going to suggest this is as a result of a state of denial, but we have seen no evidence of recognition of the urgency for this matter to be addressed.  We can see now the means by which it is proposed to address this.  It appears that the actual problem, which is what the State wishes, has been expressed clearly.  The State wishes that the collection of data in itself was not a breach of data protection rights, but it is, and that is what the court has found.  The State wishes that the relevant question was when data was accessed rather than when it was collected.  The Court of Justice in Europe has found that this is not the case.  The court made this finding in 2013 in the Digital Rights Ireland case.  The State wishes the question was merely that it could take account of court cases without having to apply them directly.  In fact, those court cases are binding on the State.  The decisions of the court in Luxembourg are binding on the State.  They can be appealed to directly in courts and the courts must apply them directly in Ireland.  The argument that European courts do not make decisions on domestic law is a distinction without a difference.  If there is a finding that a domestic law is in contravention of European law, and European law is defined by the courts, then the domestic law in question falls.</p><p> That is the scene-setting I have sought to put in place.  We have a potentially critical issue involving the mass surveillance of the entire population of Ireland.  It is not limited to journalists, but it should be noted that European law specifically recognises certain classes of communications that are particularly sensitive.  These classes include communications between: trade unionists and union members; journalists and their sources; and lawyers and their clients.  These are recognised as specific communications that are specifically sensitive.  That is not to say these are the only communications that ought to be given protection, as was correctly pointed out by the departmental officials at the committee earlier.  The correct role is to ensure that the floor of protection for all citizens meets the requirement of the most vulnerable and sensitive data communications.</p><p> I will hand over to Dr. McIntyre, who will take the committee through some of the details in respect of the heads of the Bill.  I hope we will have time for questions.  I am mindful that some of the members need to be elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-08a.1866" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. T.J. McIntyre" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017110800002#L00200"><p>I was somewhat surprised by the posture taken by the Department today.  I did not recognise many of the points departmental officials made as accurate statements of the law.  The overall posture of the Department was that this was a new issue that had crept up on us and taken all of us by surprise in December last year, when the Tele2 judgment came out.</p> <p>  I am surprised by that because I feel like I have been talking about this issue for decades.  In fact, I have been, because we commenced our constitutional challenge in 2006.  At that stage, we highlighted the exact issues that we are talking about today.  The Department has known for many years that these are live issues.  In fact, prior to this matter getting to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, national data retention laws were struck down by national constitutional courts in quick succession in 2008, 2009 and 2010 before the German Federal Constitutional Court and the constitutional courts in Bulgaria and Romania.  At this stage we have had literally a decade to address the issue.  It is remarkable that it is only being done now.</p> <p>  It is also remarkable that the Department continues to fight our case.  The Department is in the remarkable position of having commissioned a report from the retired Chief Justice that describes the existing scheme under the 2011 Act as a form of mass surveillance that is in breach of European Union standards, while, at the same time, maintaining the position in the High Court that the matter must go to full trial because the allegations against the State are denied in every regard.</p><p>If only from the perspective of the hard-pressed taxpayer, it is remarkable that the Department will continue to subsidise the legal profession in this regard.  As a lawyer, I suppose I am grateful for that to some extent.  It is, nevertheless, undesirable.<br/><br/>This summer the Department fought our application to have a preliminary hearing that would expedite the resolution by the courts of these matters.  We sought a preliminary hearing on purely the European law issues.  In other words, to save time and expense we sought to have these European law points determined separately before we got into the constitutional issues that arose.  While the Murray review was on its desk, which made these points which determined that, as a matter of European law, the scheme was illegal, the Department, nevertheless, opposed our application claiming it was a matter where it would be inappropriate to determine the European points separately and that the European constitutional points should all be folded into one much longer and much wider hearing.<br/><br/>Obviously, we cannot do justice to the 170-odd pages of the Murray report nor even the 16 pages in our written submissions.  I am happy to answer any questions committee members might have, however.<br/><br/>I want to address the points that were relied on by departmental officials who attended the committee earlier on.  Mr. Dermot Woods, in particular, laid great emphasis on the three layers of judicial protection, which he described as involved in the new scheme.  I would like to take issue with one of his characterisations.  He said the complaints referee system to be established under the new scheme will include provision for compensation to be awarded to people whose communications have been wrongfully accessed.  That is not in fact the case.  If one looks at our submission and head 22 of the Bill, one will see that the existing power to award compensation has been expressly taken away.  In fact, it no longer appears in the powers of the complaints referee under head 22.  It has been taken away without any explanation or justification.<br/><br/>The role of the designated judge was stressed at great length.  Some committee members have already heard me making the point in respect of the designated judge that the oversight system, as it currently exists, is inadequate.  It is worth repeating that the designated judge has to date issued annual reports, consisting of a single page in most cases containing two or three paragraphs with no substantive detail of any sort on the actions he or she has taken to oversee surveillance in Ireland.  It is worth bearing in mind that the designated judge does not just oversee data retention but also interception of the content of communications.  This is all done on a part-time basis, on top of their day jobs, which are enough in themselves to keep them quite busy in the Four Courts.  They do this on the basis of one day or one or two mornings or afternoons, attending the various offices in the Department of Justice and Equality and in the Defence Forces, and so on.<br/><br/>This is inadequate.  It is entirely insufficient to provide an adequate and transparent system of oversight.  In fairness, the new designated judge in the area, Ms Justice Marie Baker, has taken a more expansive approach and she has already issued one <i>ad hoc</i>report in response to a particular allegation of wrongful interception which contained considerable more detail than any prior reports.  It may be that she intends to issue annual reports which are more detailed in future.  We do not know, however.  The problem is there is no requirement on the designated judge to do so.  It is left up to them to decide how they are going to fulfil their statutory responsibility.  To date, they have done so in this entirely opaque way.<br/><br/>Why is this inadequate?  Is it because it is entirely lacking in transparency?  Fortunately, we can evaluate how effective the designated judge has been because we can look to some issues exposed elsewhere.  The Data Protection Commissioner carried out a review in 2014 of the handling of communications data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Murray review updated that to a limited extent.  We can identify from these several areas where the designated judge has missed fundamental breaches of the existing schemes.<br/><br/>The 2014 report revealed a systematic practice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of retrospectively rubber-stamping requests.  The theory was that requests had to be approved in advance by a senior member, namely, a chief superintendent or above.  In practice, requests for communications data were being made by individual garda&iacute; without any prior authorisation and were being delivered in batches to the chief superintendent after the fact to be rubber-stamped.  The statutory criteria were being entirely ignored.  We discovered from the 2014 audit that the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 had been misapplied.  Garda&iacute; had been citing it in applications to access data held by firms which were not subject to the legislation.  It was being used entirely beyond its scope.  Again, the designated judge failed to pick up on this.<br/><br/>We also know, courtesy of the Murray review, that requests for retained data were made in cases other than serious offences.  They were made in respect of criminal offences which did not meet the statutory threshold that the offence be punishable by five years or more imprisonment.  This is remarkably significant because successive justice Ministers have told the Houses that retained data is only used for the purposes of investigating serious crime and is not used in respect of more trivial matters.  It emerged from the Murray review that, to this day, retained data is being accessed for this purpose on the basis of what is essentially voluntary disclosure by the communications providers, which is entirely outside the remit of the 2011 Act.  Again, the designated judge for many years failed to pick up on this effective evasion of the requirements of the 2005 and 2011 Acts.<br/><br/>While there is no reason to think that the designated judges are not individuals of the highest probity who are committed to carrying out the functions in this area as best they can, our position is that the designated judge system is inadequate and has been shown to be so.  One cannot expect a part-time, busy, High Court judge, with no expertise in the area and no secretarial or technical expert support, no guidance as to how to carry out their functions, to do so on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and point to it as sufficient for oversight.<br/><br/>Mr. Dermot Woods also mentioned the role the Data Protection Commissioner has in this regard.  What he did not mention was that the Data Protection Commissioner is in effect gagged in what it can do and say.  The commissioner is limited in what she can do in that there are significant carve-outs from the remit of the Data Protection Commissioner.  As we stated in our written submissions, the Data Protection Commissioner is precluded from investigating certain matters relating to national security which covers a great deal of surveillance.  On top of that, the Data Protection Commissioner is precluded from publishing reports of what they discover in carrying out their investigations.<br/><br/>In 2016, at around the same time as the GSOC revelations were emerging, the Data Protection Commissioner indicated she was going to audit the handling of communications data by the relevant State bodies, in particular the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  She was going to evaluate how they carried out their obligations and functions under the 2011 Act, how they handled the data they accessed and so on.  We have since asked, by means of requests from journalists and freedom of information requests, for these reports.  The Data Protection Commissioner has taken the view that she is not entitled to give us copies of these reports.  The bodies which were audited have refused to release these reports.  The role of the Data Protection Commissioner in ensuring transparency is a limited one.  Again, in the current state of legislation, the Data Protection Commissioner cannot act as a sufficient oversight body.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, we can identify the legislation as having three areas where we have to think about the safeguards that will be put in place.  What are the safeguards for making a ministerial retention order?  What are the safeguards in respect of accessing retained data?  What are the safeguards in respect of notifying people that data have been accessed and then a remedy being available to them?  The starting point is the retention order by the Minister.  There is no provision for these retention orders to be made public.  There is no provision for any review of the proportionality or necessity of detention orders.  The departmental officials indicated the retention orders would be targeted.  The Tele2 case requires that they be targeted.</p><p>However, that was not included in the legislation.  There is no provision in the relevant head that retention orders must be targeted or specifically limited in this way.</p><p> The Tele2 case also sets a very high standard.  A retention order, because it is so invasive, can only be made if it is strictly necessary.  This is a point that Deputy Jack Chambers made earlier.  Again, that is not something that appears in the legislation.  The test here is essentially one of whether it would be proportionate to retain the data, not whether it is strictly necessary, that is, that any other means of achieving the same goal can be completely excluded.</p><p> Accessing the data, the second area in which we expect to see safeguards, also does not meet the requirements set out in Tele2.  Tele2 focuses on the investigation of crime.  It pertains to accessing data of people who are in some way implicated in crime and, again, this is a point that Deputies raised earlier.  However, the heads of Bill do not reflect it.  They allow for accessing - indeed they explicitly allow for accessing - of data of people who are not in any way implicated in crime, and that would include journalists.  The point was made earlier, again primarily by Deputy Jack Chambers, that there is no journalistic protection in the legislation.  We say that this is not just in breach of the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Murray, it is in clear breach of European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, case law.  The latter stresses that journalistic data has to be carved out as a special entity requiring special protections.  It also requires that in all cases - even in cases of urgency - there should be a prior judicial authorisation process before journalistic data is handed over.  The reasoning here is very simple; one cannot unring the bell.  One cannot restore the confidentiality to a source once that source has been identified.  In the case law we cited in the submissions, the European Court of Human Rights has said that even in cases of urgency, it might be possible to devise situations where, for example, it is required that data be stripped out to eliminate any information that would identify a source before any remaining information was handed over.  Mechanisms must be put in place in national law to allow it.  However, the Bill that is in front of the committee does not do that.</p><p> Finally, in respect of the third category, those situations in which we have access and we look at the notification and the remedies available for access, we have a number of concerns that again, the standards set out in Tele2 are not met.  Here we say that we have a failure to meet the core standard in respect of notification.  The problem here is that the legislation contains a very vague exemption.  People may be refused notification of the fact of access if notification would be incompatible with the purposes for which the data was retained.  That appears to be a very wide carve-out.  It is not entirely clear what is meant by it.  I do not think it is the world's greatest example of drafting.  On the face of it, however, it appears to allow a very wide exclusion, particularly because it refers to investigations which may take place in future.  For example, it might allow for an exclusion of notification in situations where there is a desire not to give away the use of this data as an investigative technique in unrelated cases involving other people.  It is not the case that it is limited to the possibility that further investigations will be carried out against an individual or other individuals who are affiliated with those involved in some way.</p><p> Second, as already stated, the role of the complaints referee is limited and the power to award compensation is taken away.  In addition, the complaints referee is gagged in what he or she can say where no violation of the legislation has been found.  One might ask why that matters.  Surely it is enough that the complaints referee says there is no violation.  It matters because the complaints referee, in finding that there is no violation, might be exposing, for example, a very wide and possibly questionable interpretation of the legislation being relied upon, which individuals might wish to challenge.  It matters because the complaints referee, by being precluded from giving reasons, will not be in a position to satisfy individuals as to why a particular authorisation to access data might have been justified.  It matters because, fundamentally, there is no reason for this blanket gag to be placed on the complaints referee.  This is a holdover from the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 and, before that, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  There, the thinking was that there had to be a blanket secrecy provision, otherwise the complaints referee could be used for what the computer scientists term an "oracle attack".  If an individual thinks they have been under surveillance, they could go to the complaints referee.  If he or she gets a full decision, fine.  If he or she gets a decision which simply says, essentially, that the complaints referee is unable to confirm or deny, then he or she will realise that he or she has been placed under surveillance and that his or her data has been accessed.  In other words, the secrecy provision was a mechanism to prevent people from determining whether their data had been accessed.</p><p> This is not appropriate any more because the 2017 Bill provides a presumption that one should be notified.  The general rule, by default, is that notification should be made, except in certain narrow circumstances.  It is possible, therefore, to say that the complaints referee should be able to discuss the facts of the matter and should be able to give reasons, if an individual already knows that his or her data has been accessed, having already received a notification.  There is no good reason for saying that someone has been notified that his or her data has been accessed but that the complaints referee will still be precluded from explaining the circumstances in which that took place.</p><p> There are obviously a lot more points contained in the written submissions.  At this stage, I would be happy to help committee members any further if I can.</p></speech>

We in Ireland certainly have a lot of work to do in order to try to make this legislation fit for purpose.  I have already raised this question with the officials who came before the committee.  Do the witnesses think that an independent authority should be appointed to monitor standards of data security and also compliance with security standards?  If so, what kind of powers would be required for that independent authority to do its job properly?</p></speech>

In fact, I think that has to be folded into a wider look at surveillance oversight in Ireland generally.  The designated judge here is dealing with just one of three statutory regimes.  We have data retention, that is, access to communications data; we have interception, access to the content of communications; and we have the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which pertains to  the planting of bugs or tracking devices on cars.  We have a separate designated judge who deals with the 2009 Act.  We also have the designated judge under this legislation who will deal with data retention and interception.  If we are going to professionalise the role, I think it would be desirable to fold them into a single oversight body to look at the oversight of surveillance generally and avoid situations where matters might fall through the cracks between the two different sets of judges.  Within that, we could have the security and monitoring function that Deputy Wallace mentions.</p></speech>

It is recommended in the Murray report that only a limited number of designated officers in statutory authorities should have authority to request disclosure of retained data, particularly as training in privacy and proportionality should be required in order for someone to act as a designated officer.  Also, should this training in privacy and proportionality for designated officers, or anyone who might access retained data, be stated in the legislation?</p></speech>

If there is going to be a system where certain designated people can seek to have access to information, they must be given the necessary training to allow them to do that, otherwise they are not in a position to perform their duty sufficiently.  What would be valuable is not so much to set out the training they should get, but rather to clearly set out what the duties are and ensure that the training gives them the information they need in order to perform those duties.  Putting descriptions of training into legislation is probably a way of building in obsolescence where a fast-moving topic like data retention is concerned.</p></speech>

This is important for the telecommunications provider.  Under GDPR, it will be liable if information is released improperly.  It is as much for the provider's protection as it is for the protection of the individual whose data has been given out that the provider at least require some sort of written record so that it can say that all necessary legislative provisions had been adhered to before it issued the information.  In terms of leaving telecommunications providers open to criticism and, potentially, substantial fines under the GDPR, it is critical that there be a set form of request with a certain number of protections built into it.</p></speech>

The Murray report recommends that persons whose rights have been affected by wrongful access to retained data should have an appropriate judicial remedy, which has been backed up by EU legislation and the European Court of Human Rights.  The general scheme of the Bill does not provide for this.  The Department stated that it was examining this issue and had not made up its mind yet.  What do the witnesses have to say on this matter?</p></speech>

I wonder whether this was done by accident.  I would prefer to believe that it was done by accident rather than by stealth.  It would be desirable that the complaints referee have that power.  One cannot expect individuals to take on the expense and risk of a High Court action in every case where there has been an abuse.</p></speech>

Then judicial authorisation would be required for it to be released to the relevant statutory body.  While the Minister would order the retention of data, judicial authorisation would be required for access to data.  Do the witnesses think these steps offer adequate safeguards against possible abuse of the process?</p></speech>

Mr. Justice Murray recommended that if an access is made under the urgency provisions there should be retrospective judicial oversight.  The access might be made but the judge should then be required to evaluate whether access had been appropriately granted.  The intention is obviously to avoid abuse.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the problem of the national security provision, that notification of the fact that access is not granted can be refused on national security grounds.  That is a problem that is compounded by the fact that this Bill does not define national security so it leaves open the grounds on which notification might be refused.</p></speech>

There is no one in the country who would not recognise the value of being able to find a lost person, missing person, a person at risk by way of an inquiry from cellphone masts, etc.  It should be recognised that the data retention scheme is intended to retain data beyond the point that it would normally be retained by telecommunications providers.  After all, they do retain this data for up to six months for operational purposes.  It is simply to give a legislative basis beyond that point.  As a result, there would be very few missing persons cases, for example, where a child goes missing, where it would be necessary to rely upon retention of data legislation to access that data.  The person would have to have been missing for up to six months before the access was sought under this legislation.  While the Garda may have given the Department some figures in respect of the purposes for urgent requests I am not sure those urgent requests are made for data that would be retained anyway in respect of people's locations and which did not require the implementation of the retention of data regime.</p></speech>

When Deputy Clare Daly and I got over a fence in Shannon Airport to search a military plane the authorities probably would have felt we were endangering state security whereas we would have had a very different idea about that.  I have never thought about this before but have other states defined what state security means to them?</p></speech>

However, when the Policing Authority was established the Act which created it was the first Irish Act to define national security because it creates a carve-out: the Policing Authority oversees Garda functions only in the area of the criminal justice system, not national security functions.  There is a definition that could be imported here which contains exclusions aimed at protecting freedom of expression and protest, for example, from national security exclusions.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes a very good point about how elastic that term is.  It is a concern because the notion of serious crime is also very elastic.  A serious crime under the heads of this Bill is one that is punishable by five years' imprisonment or more.  That includes stealing a Mars bar or painting graffiti because theft and criminal damage each carry possible prison sentences of up to ten years.  Mr. Justice Murray in his review was very critical of this and said by definition these types of offences, which could be tried either summarily or on indictment, when tried summarily are not serious offences and should not be included in this regime.  There is a risk that this could be used as a pretext for a wider investigation, for example, if, as part of a political protest, graffiti, even chalk marks, were placed on a wall, that would be a serious offence sufficient to trigger the application of this legislation. </p></speech>

They mentioned that under EU law and in general jurisprudence, provision is made for certain people in society to have particular privileges around data.  Should there be a separate pillar within the scheme and who would they include in that additional protection?  The Department tried to provide a generalised scheme without specifying anybody.  How would the witnesses codify that or are there examples in other countries?</p></speech>

There are two classes of data: personal and sensitive personal data.</p><p>Sensitive personal data is given additional protections over and above personal data.  What has happened is that the EU has also recognised that there are communications that are particularly sensitive and require particular protections.  Those communications have been set out in jurisprudence.  I think they have been set out in legislation at EU level.  If my memory serves me, in terms of the full list, the EU recognises communications between trade union officials and their members, communications between lawyers and their clients and communications between journalists and their sources.  I feel there is a fourth one but it does not spring to mind.  </p></speech>

However, the question arises as to whether it would be desirable to protect everyone's data to the highest level.  In other words, we would say this is the level we should apply to those special conditions and we will move everybody's protections up to that level.  In principle, that would be attractive and sensible given that we would then lose the problems, which the Department recognises are very valid, of creating a two-tier process where we argue over whether or not the communication on a particular instance of a person who falls inside a class falls inside the protected communications sub-class.  An example would be where a trade unionist talks to a member who is also a friend.  We do not want queries about whether or not the legislative provisions apply to-----</p></speech>

I think those protections are valuable and should be provided for here.
