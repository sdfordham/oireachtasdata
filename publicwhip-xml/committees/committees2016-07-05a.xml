Under the Water Services Act 2014, a revised domestic public water charging system commenced on 1 January 2015.  The Bill provides for the suspension of domestic water charges for nine months, from 1 April to 31 December 2016, to provide time for an extensive deliberative process to be undertaken on the funding of domestic water services.  The Government will establish an expert commission which will make recommendations on a sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services by Irish Water.  An Oireachtas committee on the funding of domestic water services will then consider these recommendations and make its own.  The Oireachtas will consider and vote on these recommendations.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his officials from his Department.</p><p>It is my intention that the committee will conclude its consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage this afternoon.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I refer members to the grouping of amendments for the purposes of the debate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#E00800"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p><blockquote>In page 3, to delete lines 16 to 26 and substitute the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;(1A) (a) Notwithstanding section 21(1) of the No. 2 Act of 2013, Irish Water shall not charge for water services provided to a dwelling in respect of the period (in this subsection referred to as the &lsquo;first-mentioned period&rsquo;) commencing on 1 July 2016 and ending on 31 March 2017.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>My understanding is amendment Nos. 2 and 4 are being discussed together, or at least considered together.  I hope amendment No. 2 will deal with the concerns expressed by Deputy Barry Cowen in amendment No. 4.  I will speak to my amendment first.  I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 2 and 4 together.</p><p>I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward amendments to deal with concerns that had been raised with me by members of the Opposition about the time lag between Irish Water's charging and billing periods.  The amendments seek to bring clarity and leave no doubt on the periods in which charges are to be suspended.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to align the period of suspension of water charging with the billing periods.  While the Bill provides for charging to be suspended from 1 April to 31 December 2016, the amendment aligns the period of suspension of water charging with the billing period.  Charging will be suspended from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 and no water bills will be issued in this period.  I hope the amendment will allay concerns that liability for domestic water charges may be reintroduced before the finalisation of the deliberative processes and Oireachtas decisions on the future funding model for domestic water services.</p><p>It was always the Government's intention to ensure there would no possibility of customers being asked to pay water bills until the Oireachtas had considered and voted on how domestic water services delivered by Irish Water would be funded into the future.  The amendment clarifies my intentions in this regard.  The nine-month period is an honest attempt by the Government to create the space in which a detailed and respectful debate on the funding of water services can take place.  We need to allow the expert commission, the membership of which I announced last week, to make recommendations, a special Oireachtas committee to examine the expert commission's recommendations and endeavour to make its own and the Oireachtas to deliberate on these recommendations and, ultimately, make a final decision on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am facilitating this period of extensive deliberation without the distraction of either charging or billing for domestic water services by Irish Water.</p><p>Let me be clear - the amendment will ensure two things.  First, no liability shall be created for water charges in the nine-month period from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 or in any extension of the period of suspension.  Second, no bill in respect of this period shall issue during the aforementioned nine-month period or at any stage in the future.  The amendment will ensure no liability for water charges will recommence before the Oireachtas has considered and voted on the enduring funding model for domestic public water services.  While a liability for the charging period of quarter 2 of 2016 - 1 April to 30 June 2016 - remains, the liability in the following quarter - quarter 3 of 2016 - will not be billed by Irish Water during the suspension period of 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 or any further extension of that suspension period.  The liability for quarter 2 of 2016 will remain to be discharged at a future date after the period of suspension of water charges has ended.</p><p>The amendment will ensure that the deliberative process proceeds unimpeded by bills issuing from Irish Water.</p><p> Amendment No. 4 was tabled by Deputy Cowen.  It has the same intent as the Government amendment No. 2, that is to amend the proposed suspension period to a period commencing on 1 July  2016 and ending on March 31 2017.  I hope the Deputy will accept the amendment that I have brought forward, which will ensure the same change as that intended in amendment No.  4.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#F00300"><p>I will withdraw my amendment in favour of amendment No. 2.</p></speech>

Irish Water will continue to issue bills during this period for any arrears for the period before 1 July.  Is he saying no bills either for new charges or arrears will be issued?</p> <p>  I assume that after we go through the amendments we will have an opportunity to discuss some of the issues surrounding the comment made by the new chairperson of the Independent Commission.  I hope that the Minister will give us some time, after we have debated the amendments, to raise the issue with him directly so he can hear our views on the matter.</p></speech>

Before the Minister came in here I raised a procedural point.  I believe a section on the commission should be inserted into the Bill.  Also, its membership should have to come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for approval.  The events of the past weekend have clearly brought home to us that is the case.</p></speech>

My query is relevant because the commission is being set up by this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#F00800"><p>The Minister might talk to us about this matter after we debate the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1254" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#F00900"><p>The Minister might want to agree to such an assertion.</p> <p>  My second query is on ministerial amendment No. 2.  When the Minister says its purpose is to allow a period of deliberation during this nine-month period he should also accept that the installation of water meters is a real infringement on any period of deliberation.  He should accept some of the amendments on the matter that were tabled by members if he wants a real period of reflection because people are very annoyed.  Would he not leave the date for the renewal of water bills and put it in the hands of the Oireachtas rather than prescribe it now?  I ask him to accept an amendment to that effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#F01000"><p>Does Deputy Casey wish to speak?</p></speech>

If we did not have any future date then we would not have a clear suspension period.  The commitment given in the amendment is for a nine-month suspension, which can be extended if the committee needs more time to carry out its work, and if the Minister judges that the time is necessary or if the committee asks for more time.  If we had no end date then the provision would effectively be seen as an abolition until the Oireachtas decided to re-introduce water charges at some date in the future.  We have given a commitment to suspend the charges for a nine-month period, not an abolition.</p> <p>  Even if I wanted to accept the amendments I could not do so because they have been ruled out of order.  I cannot do anything about them.  In addition, the amendments on the meters are out of order.</p></speech>

There will be no billing during this period.  Obviously arrears that have built up in advance of 1 July of this year still stand but there is not going to be a pursuing of bills or arrears during the nine-month period.  In other words, we are trying to freeze all billing activity during the nine-month period in order to create, if possible, a space for discussion and debate that will involve an expert commission, an Oireachtas committee and, ultimately, will involve ourselves making a decision on the floor of the D&aacute;il in around nine months' time.</p></speech>

When we were in private session I supported Deputy Coppinger because I also have two amendments that were ruled out of order.  My first amendment is on this section.  I sought a referendum to keep the water supply and wastewater treatment supply in public ownership.  Unfortunately, my amendment was ruled out of order not because it would cost the State but because it was not considered to be relevant to the Bill.  The rule is that we must challenge the Bills Officer over its ruling.  I challenge the ruling because I believe my amendment is relevant to the Bill and to the views of people on Irish Water generally. </p> <p>  In the context of the period during which water charges are to be suspended, the Minister has left it open-ended as to how long the period could be extended.  Does he have a view on how long the period could be extended?</p> <p>  I ask the Minister for clarity on a matter.  One might say this matter might not be relevant but I believe it is.  Will Ireland be fined by the European Commission for suspending water charges? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#G00800"><p>My response to both of the Deputy's questions is that the period is not openended.  We are talking about providing an extension of time to allow the committee to complete its work.  It is a nine-month suspension and if more time is needed to allow the committee to complete its work, let us say they ask for time or if the Minister believes that the committee needs more time, then this legislation grants the power to do so.  This is not a case of kicking the matter down the road for two years because nobody wants to deal with an awkward issue.  It is a case of ensuring that the Oireachtas and the committee have an opportunity to complete the work that we are trying to do here.  The legislation will enable us to put options to the Oireachtas and then have a democratic vote that I hope will be responsible and informed in terms of how we fund the domestic water supply. </p> <p>  I  will meet the Commissioner next week and I have already spoken to him on the telephone about this issue.  He is happy that I am meeting him to talk through in detail the thinking behind what we are doing here.  Anybody who lives outside of Ireland needs to understand that this is a very sensitive political issue, a fact that we have found out in recent days and indeed for the past 18 months or so.   </p> <p>   The nine-month suspension period is a review period, then options will be put and a democratic decision will be taken with all of the informed choices taken account of.  I believe that the EU Commission will understand what we are trying to do here but I do not want to speak for the Commission.  The Commissioner is well able to speak for himself.  I would be surprised if we did not get facilitation and some flexibility from the Commission on this matter.  We are not abolishing water charges.  We are suspending water charges for a period of debate, discussion and reflection.  Following all of that then we will make a decision.  We will have to make a decision with all of the  consequences that come with the different choices that will be presented.</p><p>We will wait to see what he has to say.  I do not wish to speak for him.</p><p> In response to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question on public ownership, as per her amendment No. 21, I have said repeatedly that I have an open mind on how we can reassure people that there is no privatisation agenda, because there is no such agenda.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties were in Government together-----</p></speech>

Perhaps the Oireachtas committee will make recommendations on this but we will have to wait and see.  I have an open mind on it.</p> <p>  I know a referendum seems like a solution, but referendums sometimes have knock-on consequences.  There is a great deal of water infrastructure in the country, particularly around group water schemes, which is privately owned at present.  There is nobody campaigning to bring them into public ownership.  There are considerations that we need to go through.  I would be open to constructive suggestions as to how we can give further reassurance.  </p> <p>  There is already a great deal of reassurance.  The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly provided reassurance and incorporated it in legislation, requiring a future Minister to have a national plebiscite before he or she would change the ownership structure or the infrastructure of Irish Water.  One could not be more emphatic than that.  There may be some who will say that a future Government can chance legislation if it has a majority.  Let us see how we can address that issue.  I have no attachment to any possibility of privatisation or the sale of Irish Water infrastructure.  That is not the agenda of the Government.  It is not my agenda.  We want this to be a single utility in public ownership and we want to build public trust and faith in it as a body that can deliver safe water supplies at a competitive cost.  </p> <p>  I have been consistent on this matter.  Let us wait and see how it be done.  Some people have suggested a referendum but there are complex issues around wording such a referendum, how it might be structured and how it might be done.  There may be other ways in which we can provide that reassurance.</p></speech>

It does not matter if we take his word for it.  This Government is very much in favour of privatisation.  Broadband is to be privatised.  The health service potentially would have been privatised so one can understand why people hold such a view.  On the issue of reassurance, this is a select committee, comprising Members of the D&aacute;il, the purpose of which is to,<i>inter alia</i>, deal with housing, water, planning and local government.  I am a little surprised at some of the amendments that have been ruled out of order, in particular the amendments on water metering.  That is surely linked to the issue of payment.</p></speech>

The point of setting up a commission and also having a special Oireachtas committee to look at all those issues are that some issues the Deputy raises now can be teased out.</p><p>What we are trying to facilitate now is a very simple piece of amending legislation that allows for the suspension of water charges for a nine month period to create space for that process to proceed.  We are not attempting to legislate for all of the solutions in different areas.  We are simply following through on a commitment that was made during the competence and supply discussions with Fianna F&aacute;il, to which we are also committed and we hope others will work with this to follow through on what we committed to do early in the lifetime of the Government, that is to suspend water charges so as to create space to have discussions around a range of issues that are linked to it.  That is all we are trying to do here.  This Bill<b></b>is two to three pages of legislation.

The draft legislation as it stands states that if the Minister is satisfied that the committee needs more time, he or she shall extend the period by ministerial order.  The amended text ensures that I, as Minister, have to be satisfied that the committee does indeed need the additional time requested in order to complete its work.  I can assure the committee that I will ensure it is afforded whatever amount of time is needed and that I will have no difficulty using the power to extend that time period if it is warranted.</p><p>This amendment is therefore worded to ensure the Minister will only extend the suspension period if he or she is satisfied that the special Oireachtas committee genuinely needs extra time for its work.  I think there was a view that it was important to have in the wording the facilitation of a request by the committee, which is what is covered in the new amended wording, as well as the Minister's option if he is satisfied that more time is needed.  That was proposed following a discussion with Deputy Cowen.  I can understand where he is coming from because the discussions were always on the basis that if the committee needs more time and requests more time, the Minister may facilitate that.  That is wording change we have made, which I think is more accurate in terms of the commitments and the reassurance that were given a number of weeks ago on this issue.</p></speech>

If there is an impression, and I know the Minister has told us that it is not the case, that this is kicking the can down the road, then we are far more likely to be fined by the Commission.  l would be concerned that the way this amendment is worded does not say a specific extra period.

It states: "Where the Minister is informed by the committee that it will not complete its work on or before 31 March 2017 or is otherwise satisfied that the committee will not complete its work on or before that date, he or she may, on or before that date, make an order extending the first-mentioned period for such further period".  It is specifically linked to the process needing more time to complete the work, as opposed to somebody saying: "This is awkward politically, so let us push it off for two years."  That is not what is envisaged here or what was agreed.  We have asked the Attorney General to be quite clear in terms of the wording to make sure we are true to the commitment as to what was agreed.</p><p> The amendment also states "for such further period, commencing on the day immediately following the expiration of the first-mentioned period, as does not exceed the period that he or she believes the committee will require to complete its work and is specified in the order".  In other words, if I am still a Minister at that point and if the chair of the committee says that they need an extra month or six weeks, I have to be satisfied that is a fair request and then we will agree to an extension to allow the committee a reasonable period of time to finish its work if that is necessary.  However, members should not forget that we have given three months here for the committee to do its work.  Therefore, I expect the commission will finish its work in five months, or perhaps even sooner, but we are giving five months for that process.  The committee will then have three months to consider those recommendations and come up with its own views and recommendations, and then the Oireachtas will have a month.  That sets out where the nine months period we are talking about is credible.  Let us wait and see how that transpires.  It is very clear in this amendment that this is about allowing a reasonable amount of time to finish the process that is under way if that is required.  The legislation facilitates that; it facilitates the Minister to be able to do that.  It is not about avoiding awkward decisions.  This is an awkward issue, let us face it.  There are deep divisions politically on this issue within and across political parties.  That is why we are trying to get an informed series of recommendations around which, hopefully, we can build some consensus and on which we can get a majority in the Oireachtas.  Let us wait and see whether that is possible.</p></speech>

I have brought forward amendment No. 9, to ensure that Irish Water does not charge domestic customers for water services during any period of the extension of the suspension of water charges.  Again, this is to ensure that the period of deliberation on the future funding of domestic water services is not in any way distracted by political division over the continuation of water charging and billing.  We want to take politics out of the debate, within reason and where possible, and to allow the facts to be brought forward and debated openly without that distraction.</p><p>I can assure the committee that the requisite time will be afforded to the deliberative process, and charging will be remain suspended in this period, to allow the expert commission on a long-term funding model for the delivery of water and wastewater services by Irish Water and the Oireachtas committee on the funding for domestic water service to complete their work.  In addition, the Government may need additional time to consider the Oireachtas committee's recommendations.  The amendment proposes to prohibit Irish Water from charging for domestic water services during any period of extended suspension for Government consideration of such recommendations.  </p><p>I have brought forward amendment No. 10 with the intention of ensuring Irish Water does not use bills in respect of quarter two 2016 during the period of suspension of water charges, that is from 1 July 2016 to the end of March 2017, for any extension to allow the Oireachtas committee complete its work and for any extension to allow the Government consider the Oireachtas committee's recommendations.</p><p>This will ensure there is no distraction, political or otherwise, during the period culminating in the Oireachtas deciding on how we and future generations are to fund domestic water services.  </p><p> Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment arising from amendment No. 10 which proposes to insert a new subsection. </p></speech>

I spoke to the chair of the commission today and yesterday and I am aware of some commentary and criticism made of a media interview he did and his personal views on water.  The chair of the commission will make a personal statement on that issue later this afternoon and I would appreciate if members gave him the time and space to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2016070500002#M00300"><p>When the Minister introduced Second Stage of the Bill he made clear that the intention of the expert commission was to try to take the heat out of the debate and enable us, to use the Minister's words, to have a rational conversation about it.  Many of us were sceptical about the intention of the commission but were willing to take the Minister at his word.  Having said that, the fact that some of us took the time to submit detailed proposed amendments to the terms of reference and did not even receive a formal response from the Minister's office suggests we may not have been right to take him at his word.</p><p>What most concerns me about Mr. Joe O'Toole's comments is not that he has personal views - he is entitled to his views and the Minister could not have appointed a person resident in this State who did not have views on the matter. - but that Mr. O'Toole, in his Newstalk interview, made a particular comment which amounted to much more than his personal view on the issue of water.  Speaking on the commission and the job the Minister has given him, he stated:</p><blockquote>It is a political exercise.  It is a democratic exercise.  The reality is we are trying to resolve a problem which has emerged from the democratic process.  People have voted in a certain way.  Leinster House is not prepared to grasp that particular nettle so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily. </blockquote> <p>My interpretation of Mr. O'Toole's remarks is that he has acknowledged that a majority of the Deputies elected in the general election want to abolish water charges but the purpose of the commission as he, its chairperson, understands it, is to continue some form of charge by putting enough sugar on it to allow the D&aacute;il, which technically has a majority against water charges, to swallow it, in other words, to vote in favour of a water charge.  If that is his understanding of his job as the chair of the commission, it is deeply disturbing.  While I am not asking the Minister to interpret what Mr. O'Toole meant by his remarks, I believe the meaning is clear.  My concern, therefore, is not that the chairman has a particular view but that he is describing his understanding of his function of chairing the expert commission as one of identifying how to get water charges through the D&aacute;il, albeit in a different form.  </p><p>I have two questions for the Minister.  Is this is an appropriate way for the chairman to describe his role and that of the expert commission?  Is it the Minister's view that the chairman's position is tenable?  While I was willing to give Mr. O'Toole the benefit of the doubt - I did not call for him to resign yesterday but asked that he withdraw the comment he made - the comments he made this morning and this afternoon have made matters worse.  If it was the Minister's intention to take the heat out of this issue, unfortunately the person he appointed as chairman of the expert commission has done the opposite.  This has undermined any confidence among those of us who are sceptical but want to be constructive and engage with the commission that this is genuinely an independent and impartial exercise.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to those two specific questions.  </p></speech>

People can have personal views and, as the Minister stated, we all have personal views on issues.  However, the chairman, in advance of the commission's establishment, has expressed strong views that are opinionated and biased in the sense of being very much on one side of the argument.  How can anyone interpret his words in any other way?  He stated:</p><blockquote>People voted in a certain way.  Leinster House is not prepared to grasp that particular nettle so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily. </blockquote> <p>I understood this to mean the D&aacute;il is not prepared to recognise that 70% of Deputies were elected on an anti-water charges platform.  I assume that making the medicine go down means the continuation of water charges.  Does the Minister propose to allow a person who believed it was in order to express these views to chair the commission?  Mr. O'Toole has given his honest views but if the Minister expects anybody to take the so-called new politics seriously, Mr. O'Toole must go.  I am also putting it up to Fianna F&aacute;il that it needs to make this clear because its support is the other leg of the table in this arrangement.  Regardless of what spin is put on this issue, nobody can unsay what Mr. O'Toole said.  He is completely biased and wants water charges to be maintained by making them more palatable. </p></speech>

To be fair, the idea that we will now start debating and changing the terms of reference is not a reasonable request.  We made the purpose of the commission clear.  A group of people with considerable knowledge of issues related to water, including charging and conservation, would examine all the issues in an informed manner, produce a report and make recommendations.  We then indicated that a committee would take these recommendations but would not be bound by them, although I presume the committee's work would be guided by the detail of the report produced by the commission.  The committee will make its own judgment on what is appropriate and fair and what should be put before the D&aacute;il and Seanad to be voted on.  That is how the commission will work.</p></speech>

Once they were agreed between two party leaders, they would not be undone.  I would not like to give an impression that I ever said it would be otherwise because I did not do so.  I have been up-front about the commission.  I have seen some commentary on some websites and on social media about some of the members of the expert commission.</p><p>It is deeply unfair, in terms of their role and willingness to be helpful to Ireland.  The people include a lead expert in the Environmental Directorate of the OECD, the chair of the customer forum of Water Scotland, a former Scottish Minister, the chair of the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator, the chair of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, an academic lawyer specialising in water and environmental law from the University of Dundee in Scotland and a strategy consultant from Waternet in the Netherlands.  While I do not know her, she comes highly recommended for her knowledge.  Dr. Andrew Kelly is an environmental economist who is highly thought of in Ireland.</p><p> These people are the best experts in the area we could find.  We searched high and low to get names.  Some of them were recommended by other political parties.  I also sought and followed advice from the Institute of Public Administration and the National Economic and Social Forum on the kind of skill set we would need on an expert commission, the number on the commission and the balance of Irish and international expertise.  I do not know any of these people, except Brendan O'Mahony, the chair of the NFGWS, whom I met as a Minister when he was representing group water schemes.  I have had no conversation with him about this.  We have looked to others to make recommendations and tried to pick from those and choose other skill sets in a way that is consistent with the independent guidance we got.</p><p> Mr. Joe O'Toole is a very fine person.  I have known him on and off for many years.  We come from different political persuasions, and this is one of the reasons I asked him to do this.  I did not want a Fine Gael person, or the perception of a Fine Gael person.  Mr. O'Toole has given much leadership through the trade union movement.  He was a very talented Senator and parliamentarian when he was here.  He has buckets of experience in handling difficult issues.  This is why I asked him to do the job, to try to pull together all of these experts and to have a political input into the process and ensure the political sensitivities were understood in the context of any recommendations they might make.  I thought Mr. O'Toole would be a very good person to do it.</p></speech>

I propose the following arrangements: there will be no opening statements; the Minister will make a brief opening statement prior to our consideration of each programme, in she should indicate if there are emerging pressures likely to impact on departmental performance or expenditure on each of the programmes in 2016; whether there are concerns about performance or service delivery in particular areas to the extent that there is a possibility that the funding allocated will not be fully spent by year end; the areas involved and the reasons for a possible saving or underspend; and whether reallocation of funds to, from or within the programme has taken place or is contemplated.  The issue of administration will be considered under these headings when each of the programme areas has been disposed of or as we deal with each of the programmes.  I propose that questions on programmes be taken together, at the end of which the Minister can respond.</p> <p>  I will deal with the individual programmes and corresponding subheads under the Vote.

A key driver of the increase in funding for the arts and in cultural expenditure in my Department in 2016 is the ongoing commemorations programme.</p><p>The allocation in 2016 is almost &euro;49 million, including &euro;31 million in capital and &euro;18 million in current expenditure.  The programme is ongoing, but the main commemorative events of the Easter period are now concluded.  The people of Ireland embraced the opportunity to commemorate the events of 100 years ago, and in doing so they made them a great success.  I look forward to the remainder of the year's activities.</p><p> The capital allocation of almost &euro;31 million for commemorations, supplemented by &euro;6.158 million in carryover from 2015, has provided for a number of flagship projects or permanent reminders that are being progressed this year, including the interpretive exhibition in the GPO complex, the tenement museum in Henrietta Street, the refurbishment of Richmond Barracks, where the leaders of the 1916 Rising were held after their surrender, and the new visitor centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh in Rosmuc.  Funding for 2016 has also supported the following projects, which form part of the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme: the development of a recital room at the National Concert Hall, as well as the works to the foyer and front of house facilities; and the redevelopment of the National Archives at its Bishop Street headquarters.  In addition to this significant investment provided under the commemorations programme for the concert hall and the archives, the major refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland continues in 2016, in addition to investment of more than &euro;39 million this year in our national cultural institutions.</p><p> The important and valuable work of the Arts Council has also been recognised.  This is reflected in the 2016 current allocation of more than &euro;60 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million over the 2015 allocation.  Funding of &euro;5 million is also provided to meet the anticipated demand in 2016 for the funding of the Cork events centre.  Some &euro;5.5 million is provided in 2016 for Culture Ireland, which includes &euro;3 million for "I am Ireland", or "Mise &Eacute;ire", the Culture Ireland international programme that forms part of the Ireland 2016 centenary programme.  I am happy to expand on any issues that Deputies would like to raise relating to this programme area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#E00200"><p>The Minister had a carryover of &euro;6.158 million into this year from last year in capital expenditure.  Might she explain how that arose?  At this stage, what is her estimate: will she spend all the capital under the arts, culture and film subhead this year?  Having a carryover is something to be avoided at all times because, as the Minister knows, when you have a carryover and you go to the Department of Finance looking for more money, they will say, "Well, you did not spend what we gave you last year."  It will use that stick to beat you.</p> <p>  The Department got a considerable amount of money this year for the 1916 commemoration across a number of subheads and programmes.  That is why I hoped we might have a quick debate at the very beginning about the overall allocation to the Department.  First, I take it that the Department will not expend as much next year on the decade of commemoration.  Second, I am sure that every one of the organisations that benefit, whether it is the likes of the National Museum and galleries, the archives, the Arts Council or whatever, is starved for finance.  Does the Minister expect to hold the same amount of gross money for the Department's Vote next year as this Revised Estimate, now she has it?  Can we encourage the Minister to make a very strong case to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that if he can afford it this year he can afford it next year - that the arts, heritage, the Gaeltacht and the islands have been starved of cash for the last five years and that it would be a welcome boost if the Department kept its headline budget for next year at least, because there are many things that need to be done?</p><p> We have a lot of problems in our country, but probably the most intractable problem we face is areas of high urban deprivation.  They seem to be intergenerational.  I often wonder why, with all the modern communications and interconnectivity of the world, these areas seem to be stuck in a rut of poverty.  When one compares those areas now to areas in post-Famine Ireland that were really poor, they are not self-generating and creating wealth like post-Famine Ireland.  Then one has to ask why these areas are not coming forward because they are a lot richer than post-Famine Ireland was.  Why are they not progressing like post-Famine people did, either at home or abroad?  Was there a much higher cultural and educational value in the great poverty of post-Famine Ireland?  Did people have that value of culture and education that maybe is not currently there in the highly deprived areas?  Therefore, would we get a great benefit in economic and social terms if we put more money into arts, culture, heritage, language and all the other things of the mind in these highly deprived areas?  When one looks at the output in, for example, the poorest of Gaeltacht areas in terms of the literature of the 19th century and compares it to some of our vast urban areas with massive populations, one has to ask whether we have starved these people and kept them separate from these things on the basis that culture, heritage and art are an added extra for the middle classes, but not really for everybody?  Has any analysis been done by the Minister's Department of the penetration of this &euro;188 million last year into these areas of high deprivation?  For example, how many people from the poorer, more socially disadvantaged RAPID areas go to the Abbey Theatre, the National Museum or the National Gallery, or are involved in drama and all the things of the mind?  As I said, people underestimate the power of the mind for social and economic good and they think that, in the modern world, this is not for everybody, that it does not really have much importance and that it is an add-on, rather than a huge social driver.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#F00200"><p>To take the last question first, I agree that investment in the arts, our culture and our heritage does a huge amount to improve deprived areas and, as the Deputy said, urban areas.  That is a developing problem.  The Arts Council strategy, Making Great Art Work, targets every sector of society.  We have the Arts in Education Charter.  We are working with the education sector to get young people involved in the arts at a very early age.  When one gives the gift to a child of playing an instrument or to perform, one gives it to him or her for life.  The Arts in Education Charter is something we want to build on.  I agree that we need to look at that.  As I said, the Arts Council is the main body that expends money to these different areas.  It is something that we should look at.  Arts spending should be even across the country.  I am very keen on that.  I get a lot of representations from rural counties that feel they do not get their fair share.  It is very important that arts spending should be spread evenly.</p> <p>  The &euro;6.15 million carryover mainly related to the permanent legacies, which were the capital commemoration projects.</p><p>Some of them did not spend as much money as they thought they would in 2015.  It was carried over to continue and finish some of the projects.  As the Deputy knows, we have had some very good projects that have been finished.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the commemorations and the extra funding for them.  I certainly want to hold the baseline figure.  I would like the opening figure for next year to be the same as the closing figure for this year, as agreed.  Anything I can do I will do and I will make the case for it.  On investment in the arts, the commemorations have really allowed people to reconnect with the arts and their heritage and there have been huge benefits across the country.  In every local authority area there have been commemorations and there is a plan for every county.  That is why I will make the case based on the benefits of investing in the arts and argue that we need to hold on to this budget.  I look forward to receiving the Deputy's support.  The record speaks for itself this time: we invested extra money in the arts and it certainly paid off.  There was great engagement across the country.  We had young people performing plays related to the events of 1916.</p></speech>

The Minister has a budget of &euro;56,730,000, and a carryover figure of &euro;6.155 million.  That gives a capital sum of &euro;62 million to be spent by the end of the year under the various subheads.  The biggest lump is being spent on the programme for a decade of commemorations.  How much had been spent by the end of June?  In other words, are we at least halfway there, as we would expect?</p></speech>

We have the May figures.  The profile figure is &euro;14 million.  We keep very much in touch with the different projects in process.  We maintain a lot of contact with them to try to have their budgets spent.  Like the Deputy, I want to see every penny spent, but sometimes there are delays for different, sometimes very valid reasons.  For that reason, the money was not spent as quickly as we thought it would, but the Deputy can rest assured that pressure will be exerted every month when at the MinMAC meeting, when I will want to know what is holding up projects.  We will certainly make every effort to spend as much as we can.</p></speech>

That means that if we all travel that distance, we will be here for four and a half hours.  Obviously, we want to get the job done, but we want to do it in a timely fashion.  If we allow ten minutes per member on each programme, it should give us enough time.</p></speech>

Would it be possible for the Minister to ask the Arts Council to give us a breakdown of local schemes in disbursing the money around the country, rather than just giving it to the Abbey Theatre which is central?  Will it give us a breakdown of the moneys it has allocated to RAPID programme areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#G00800"><p>I think that information might be available on the website.  It may not be available for RAPID programme areas, but I will ask the Arts Council.  It is available per county, but I will ask the Arts Council to provide us and the Deputy with the information sought.  That will not be a problem.</p></speech>

Most people reading the Department's figures will realise that the funds are not enough for the sectors for which they are to provide.  There has been much positive commentary in the past while in regard to the funding allocated to the arts.  I asked a dozen people who had a particular interest in this what they thought would be the breakdown in terms of the Department's finances.  They thought the spend for the Irish language would be approximately 30% of the spend but were shocked when they saw that the percentage was significantly lower than that at between 13% and 16% of the total figure.</p> <p>  I have a question similar to the one asked by Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  What measurements are being carried out by the Government in regard to the socioeconomic and regional delivery of funds?  Do we know the percentage the socioeconomic sectors and the regions are receiving?</p></speech>

We did a value for money audit on the Arts Council and a good deal of information came through on that.  The Arts Council has its policy, Making Great Art Work, and one of the issues I raised with it is the need to make sure there is a regional spread of the funding.</p></speech>

There are 400 individual artists but there are 450 arts organisations.  I raised this question with the Arts Council also.  Many artists involved in some of the arts organisations get funding.  It is the Arts Council which assesses those applications and decides who gets funding.</p></speech>

I know the Minister is a big supporter of arts and education and she worked closely with me in my former job with Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board.  In regard to the Arts in Education Charter, how is the higher implementation group progressing with the Arts Rich Schools programme, which is an objective of the Arts in Education Charter?</p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the local arts in education partnership - I know she was very supportive of the Cavan and Monaghan - and on that relationship between the education and training boards and the local authority arts officers and the county councils and that over-arching relationship between two closely connected statutory bodies?  Will she comment on Arts in Education officers and whether her Department has any plans to roll out something similar nationally?  As the Minister is aware, we had a very good pilot scheme in Cavan and Monaghan of which she was a major supporter.  What is the position on that?</p></speech>

A sub-group has been set up on the Arts Rich Schools programme, which will report to the high level implementation group in the coming months.</p><p>The Arts Council will be reporting to the high-level implementation group in the coming months.  It is coming forward with some very good suggestions.</p><p> The Deputy is very familiar with the arts and education sectors.  The Cavan-Monaghan ETB was regarded as having a good working relationship with the arts officers.  As the Deputy said, it is a question of two statutory bodies coming together.  The organisation was very proactive in Cavan and Monaghan.  Other counties could have examined the model, which worked so well there.  I am very keen on it.  When young people get the chance to experience arts of any kind in school, including primary school, they carry this with them for life.  We should be able to impart this to all children.</p><p> With regard to arts and education officers, the matter can be examined by the committee.  However, I do not want duplication.  There are arts officers in the local authorities, heritage officers, museum curators and the ETBs.  I want everybody working together.  I really do not want duplication.  It is important to facilitate artists to go to schools and to spend time with young people.  I was at such an event myself in Inver College in Carrickmacross.  An artist was brought in and it was tremendous for the pupils to be able to express themselves through painting.  We need to build on and progress this.</p></speech>

Bearing in mind my involvement, I would have no apprehension regarding duplication.  I am very conscious always that there should not be two separate bodies providing the very same service.</p> <p>  What was super about the arts and education charter is that it focused on delivering the expertise of the professional arts sector to schools rather than expecting teachers to pick up the pieces or expecting a maths teacher or primary school teacher to start teaching an art class.  There is a great opportunity to provide professional artists with a job.  We know professional artists have very little job security.  They could deliver a very professional, contemporary arts practice within primary and secondary schools and in the adult and further education sectors.  It has received considerable attention.  I would not be fearful at all about duplication.  As I understand it, the remit of the local authority arts officer is to focus on the professional development of an artist within the community.  By contrast, the job of the arts education officer is to bring professional artists into the education sector so we will not expect our academic teachers to pick up the pieces and start teaching as part of an artistic programme.</p> <p>  The initiative has great potential.  I acknowledge the Minister was very supportive.  She got to see the benefits of the initiative in Cavan-Monaghan.  With the amalgamation of the ETBs, there is now a great opportunity.  A I stated, there are only 16 ETBs across the island.  Appointing an arts education officer would have far-reaching benefits for artists, whom we said have very little job security, and young people, because it is with them that it really starts.</p></speech>

This is a considerable issue, especially in rural communities.  In representing my community, I met representatives of the West Cork Arts Centre and learned they believe the centre is receiving funding at the lower scale.  If there is a carryover of &euro;6 million, it is only fair that this money would be evenly spent, especially in rural communities where unemployment is at a very low level.  It might help to create some employment in rural communities.  How does the Minister intend to roll out the funding more evenly?</p></speech>

The money is still needed to finish the project.</p> <p>  There is a very fine arts centre in west Cork.  We have been supporting it.  Sometimes there are good reasons why money is not spent, although I like to see money spent if it is budgeted for.  No Minister wants to carry over money but it is sometimes the case that one cannot spend it because the work has not been finished.  One cannot pay out the money in advance of the work being finished.</p></speech>

With regard to badly-needed support for regional arts centres across the country, is there a plan to address the current need for capital injection in such buildings?  Could the Minister provide the committee with an update on the current position in Culture 2025 and the national cultural policy?</p></speech>

During the downturn, there was very little capital investment in many arts centres across the country.  I was glad it was agreed, in the context of the budget for 2016, to have a grant scheme for regional arts centres.  The applications and guidelines are being finalised.  I hope to have the scheme opened very shortly.  It is important to invest in arts centres because the windows are rattling and the roofs are leaking in some of them.  The primary focus of the scheme will be the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing stock of arts centres.  There will be &euro;3 million per year over the next three years.  That is a total of &euro;9 million.  Stream 1 will offer grants between &euro;20,000 and &euro;300,000 for essential repairs to and enhancement of existing dedicated arts and cultural facilities.  Stream 2 will offer grants from &euro;300,000 to &euro;2 million for large enhancement or expansion projects.  Stream 3 will be geared towards providing grants of up to &euro;20,000 to community and voluntary groups.  A small amount can often make a huge difference.  The centres really need to have refurbishments carried out.</p> <p>  With regard to Culture 2025, the strategy is at an advanced stage.  We carried out extensive public consultation right across the country.  We then consulted a high-level group of experts.  We invited people to make submissions and all of those have come in.</p><p>We are working with the group of experts and at the end stage.  Culture 2025 will be the basis for an ongoing formative discussion on culture and should facilitate the development of evidence-based strategies to achieve an ambitious vision.  The aim of Culture 2025 and what I want to see is the provision of a clear vision and strong foundation for the continued vitality, development and viability of Irish culture between 2016 and 2025.  I want to see it permeating all decision-making by the Government.   The programme for Government commits to the publication of Culture 2025.  At this stage we are in the final stages of putting together the draft document.  I will bring it to the Oireachtas committee in order that we can have a conversation about it.   I look forward to hearing its members' suggestions.  We are trying to put it together and include the suggestions of those who have spoken to us, but I will be happy to sit down and work with and have a discussion with committee members on it.  I hope to do this shortly.  We will publish the draft document and let the committee members consider it.  The committee can then come back to me with its suggestions on how we can improve on it.</p></speech>

Despite this, it has been able to produce good quality output.  It released a request yesterday that there be a doubling of its budget, I think, to &euro;20 million.  Would that be possible and is it among the Government's objectives?</p></speech>

In 2016 it has supported up to six creative feature film co-productions, ten documentary feature films for cinema release and the production of four animated TV series.  It supports the development of TV drama productions in English and Irish and for cinema distribution.  Therefore, it does extremely good work.  I was glad that I was able to move it in the right direction and secure an increase in its budget last year.  If we can build on the support we give it, we can get even better results.  It is very positive and proactive in that there is so much it can and wants to do.  This will be in the context of the budgetary discussions to be held later in the year, but the Film Board states we improved the level of section 481 tax relief.  The Revenue Commissioners estimates that the projects which availed of section 481 tax relief in 2015 supported 12,000 jobs and had combined expenditure of almost &euro;160 million.  The raising of the cap on film tax relief was, therefore, most welcome and helped to attract some very high-profile film productions.  In this context, I need only mention "Star Wars"; everybody knows the benefits it brought to west Cork, County Kerry, Malin Head and all along the west coast.  Up to 500 people were working on the set at any given time.  I visited it in County Kerry and it is amazing what such activity can do for a local town.  It was through the work of the Film Board and the tax incentives in place that the production was able to be attracted to Ireland.  It was hugely significant.</p><p>I went to see the first of the second or third series of "Star Wars".  A little flicker of the Skelligs can be seen at the end of it and, goodness me, it is amazing.  I hope that in the next film, we will see a lot more of Ireland.</p></speech>

For example, the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland is based in Dundalk.  Members may have been fortunate enough to attend the start of the 1916 commemoration ceremonies and the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland performed at an event in the National Concert Hall.  It was absolutely amazing.  I am sure the Chairman is familiar with the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland.  It does great work, so I was delighted that we were able to increase its funding last year through the commemorations.  Some Arts Council spend on a North-South basis goes to Annaghmakerrig in County Monaghan.  The retreat there is funded by the two arts councils, North and South, and it is a great place, a retreat for artists.  I was delighted to be able to assist it with some additional funding in order to provide a recording studio because many famous artists have been to Annaghmakerrig.  It is a great place for them to come to and they continue to return over the years.</p></speech>

The capital investment in regional arts centres around the country is a welcome development.  My experience, which I have expressed before, is that while these buildings have infrastrucutral deficits, the main deficits are staffing and running costs.  As the Minister knows, even in the Garage Theatre in Monaghan, the ETB staffs it.  That is the big downfall of any of these fabulous arts centres in that they have the best of facilities but do not have the staffing and the funds to employ the people to run them, programme them and so on.  Many of these arts centres are run through CE schemes and various other temporary schemes.  There is no continuity.  Are there any plans to roll out funding to staff these centres given that we have them?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#M00800"><p>Was any thought given to talking to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, about expanding the community services programme, which is a long-term programme, unlike CE schemes, which last two or three years?  T&uacute;s schemes last one year.  The community services programme is a long-term programme for people who are employed.  A payment is received for a manager and a number of full-time equivalents are granted and one can actually employ people and supplement the wages.  Such schemes are ideal for arts centres.  I think some arts centres have had them from the time I was in government.  They are ideal because there must be some element of income but they must also be charitable bodies and have a deficit.  In other words, the service must not be economically viable, which no arts centre is, without some support.  In support of my colleague, I believe the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection could collaborate.  The difference in cost between people drawing the dole, jobseeker's allowance, and putting them on these schemes is quite modest.  It becomes particularly modest when it takes into account that many people who work on these schemes are unlikely to get commercial employment and their social and medical well-being, which is costing the State a fortune, is radically improved.  The Department of Social Protection has some very good medical evidence of the hugely detrimental mental and medical effect of unemployment, that unemployed people have higher morbidity and mortality rates, go to the doctor more often, die younger and are ill a lot more often.  Imagine all the money that could be saved.  The Minister could bring her colleague, the Minister for Health, in on this too because his Department would save a fortune if she did this.  That is very important.  There is no point in building big capital projects without staffing them.</p> <p>  I have one other question.  I understand that each Department is meant to make its archives available going back 30 years or whatever by the end of the year and that the archives come under the Minister's Department.  Her Department has singularly failed to make its archives available on time for the end of the year.</p><p>Perhaps this year the Minister could lead by example and make the archives available.  The transfer of files does not happen on time.  I am a little surprised by this.  Perhaps the Minister could check to ensure it happens on time this year when the archives are ready to be opened.</p></speech>

I do not provide any direct funding for the running of arts centres.  The local authorities are involved at local level.</p> <p>  Like the Deputy, I believe the community services programme is great.  I was able to assist in a programme not too far from me at home.  There are arts involved in addition to community services such as meals on wheels.  The programme gives employment to people who might not otherwise get an opportunity.  I have spoken briefly to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, regarding the programme.  I will be having further discussions with him because I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that, even in terms of the rural areas brief we will be speaking about later, there are great opportunities.  A village with nothing in it and a closed post office could use the community services programme to gain assistance where it would not otherwise be financially viable.  It is a great programme.  I will certainly be having conversations on this with the Minister for Social Protection.</p> <p>  The timely transfer of the archives is an issue right across government.  My Department, with the National Archives, is about to embark on a study with a number of Departments to determine whether improvements can be made and how money could be saved on the storage of non-essential files and paper.</p></speech>

Funding of &euro;44 million has been made available from my Department&rsquo;s heritage programme.  This includes &euro;35.4 million allocated for current expenditure, with a further &euro;8.6 million in capital funding.  The protection of Ireland&rsquo;s unique raised bog special areas of conservation is a key concern, as is the avoidance of major fines by the European Court of Justice.  That is reflected in the allocation of a further &euro;1 million in 2016 for peatlands restoration.  Priority is also continuing to be given to the turf cutter compensation schemes and investment in alternative turf cutting sites for affected turf cutters.</p> <p>  The Government committed in a programme for a partnership Government to the continuation of current processes involving all stakeholders affected by measures put in place to meet the conservation objectives and legal obligations on the State under the habitats directive.</p> <p>  I announced the built heritage investment scheme, which was based on a highly successful built heritage jobs leverage scheme.  It was allocated &euro;2 million for the 2016 budget to protect our built heritage and create and protect employment across the country.  The scheme for 2016 was announced in October, with capital of &euro;2 million available to 31 local authorities, to which responsibility for administering the scheme has been devolved.  City and county authorities are participating in the scheme and, to date, 50 projects have commenced, with eight now completed.  The amount of privately leveraged funding is &euro;869,000, with a total of 1,888 days of employment created.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, will speak on the Estimate as it relates to the national parks and nature reserves.</p></speech>

I wish the members well.  I am looking forward to working with them over what I hope will be the next five years.</p> <p>  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the select committee the 2016 Estimates and to outline this year&rsquo;s priorities for a number of areas under my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  For the benefit of the committee members, I would like to set out my responsibilities in the Department.  They include national rural development schemes, including rural recreation, the rural walks scheme, the rural development fund and the CL&Aacute;R programme.  Also under my remit are the national parks and nature reserves, the development of the Atlantic economic corridor, reinforcing the role of the Western Development Commission, dormant accounts measures, tidy towns, social enterprise and the development of the rural post office network.  I will assist the Minister in the rolling out of rural broadband in Connacht.</p> <p>  With regard to the heritage programme, more than &euro;1 million in capital funding will be made available to invest in and develop visitor facilities in the national parks and nature reserves for 2016.  My intention as Minister of State is to conserve the parks and reserves, to increase awareness of the benefits of those important natural assets and to show they can help to create and sustain jobs in addition to contributing to economic and regional development.  I will be working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council to determine how the trails network in our parks and reserves, particularly along the west coast, can help to develop the tourist experience along the Wild Atlantic Way.  I am convinced that the development of walking and hiking infrastructure and the enhancement of the visitor facilities at our natural heritage properties can provide opportunities for job creation and economic growth, particularly in rural areas.</p> <p>  The refurbishment of Killarney House and Gardens in Killarney National Park, costing a total of &euro;8 million, is co-funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which contributed &euro;5.2 million.  I was glad to be Minister of State when the latter sum was allocated for the project.  Works on the gardens are nearly completed and it is expected that they will be fully open to the public within a few weeks.  The exhibition element in the house itself will be completed later this year and it is envisaged that it will open to the public in early 2017.  After it opens, the additional tourism created by the project will greatly benefit the local and regional economy and promote job creation.  The Minister and I will answer any questions members wish to ask.</p></speech>

There are a few issues concerning the legislation that need to be addressed.</p><p>I do not know how, but they need to be dealt with.</p><p> Since, like me, he lives in the west, I think the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, would agree that there is a fair spend on heritage.  However, most of the people who conserve the heritage believe that the role of the Department is a totally negative one of "don'ts", rather than positively working with farmers on how to preserve the heritage.  What extra resources would be required so that instead of the Department being negative and reactive on natural heritage, which has caused a lot of anger among farmers and rural people, it can work positively with rural communities which have preserved the heritage we all care about and which care about it deeply?  Can the Minister of State give some indication of how the Department intends to identify the resources that would be needed in order to change its outlook from seeming to be more concerned about keeping Europe at bay than preserving the heritage in partnership with landowners, who have created the incredible heritage we have?  If one travels around Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Cork or Kerry, huge distrust relating to conservation has built up between authority and landowners.  We will never conserve if we do not have buy-in and positive relationships.</p><p> Has a consensus been achieved between the people who cut bogs and the Department on a way forward to ensure that traditional rights are recognised and preserved?  This is about more than money.  There seems to be an attitude in the Department that it is all about money.  I know hill farmers, as will the Minister of State, who are more concerned about having sheep than they are about making any profit from them.  No matter what monetary compensation they are given, they would prefer to keep the animals.</p><p> Finally, the regulations under which the habitats directive operates in Ireland - dating back to 1997 - says that where the traditional output of a farmer is impacted by a designation, and where they are not in an agri-environmental scheme, they should get direct compensation from the Department.  I understand that this is not currently in operation.  I have no doubt that a new brush sweeps everything clean.  Perhaps the Deputy could outline when he will reinstate the legislative provision, which is there in law, for compensation if something a farmer had traditionally been doing is interfered with by the designation of an SAC, SPA, NHA or any other of these many designations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#P00200"><p>On the first question relating to the trust between farmers, Departments and Government, that dates back a long way.  It is very simple.  The Deputy is a rural man, like me.  Sometimes the State thinks it can just walk into people's land and property.  Sometimes it just does not talk to farmers.  I will give the committee a very simple explanation of where it works and where it does not.  In the Deputy's county of Galway we have provided a great deal of funding for the walks from Dublin to Athlone and Athlone to Galway.  That was handed over to the National Roads Authority, which thought it could treat the farmers like it were treating people.  It was taking over land for roads, using compulsory purchase orders and things of that nature.  That does not work.  We had to suspend that scheme because it was going into green land, dividing farms and land.  One cannot do that.</p> <p>  Take another example of the greenway from Westport to Newport to Mulranny and on to Achill.  Everybody said that it would not work, it would not happen and that we could not get buy-in from the farmers, but we did, simply because officials and State agencies went and talked to the farmers.</p><p>They talked to the communities.  Where there was a difficulty, they got the communities to talk to the people who had the difficulties.  Eventually, they were ironed out.  Whatever scheme we do, instead of these people reading about it in the newspapers or hearing announcements from Ministers, Deputies or whatever the case may be, we need to talk, consult and work with the landowners because it is their land and we need their help, support and buy-in.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v introduced a very good scheme, the walks scheme, which worked very well.  There was very little compensation but it was not about that.  It was about respect.  The one word that is not used often enough about people's land is "respect" because it is their land.  We need to have co-operation from the farmers for any buy-in.  Whatever schemes we introduce, we need first to sit down with the farmers, whether it is my Department, the local authorities or whatever State agency is dealing with whatever we are doing.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will deal with the two other issues.</p></speech>

First, no doubt when the Minister of State goes to his officials about the nice approach he is talking about, he will be told that we do not have enough manpower or womanpower.  Has the Minister of State made any assessment of the staff he would need to implement his new, highly positive programme relating to NHAs, SPAs or whatever?  Second, will funding be made available to comply with the law relating to compensation for farmers who have had their traditional way of life interfered with, be it a reduction in the number of sheep or whatever, and who are entitled to compensation under the Habitats Directive regulations, as brought in in this country?</p></speech>

We are recruiting staff, including from different Departments.  We certainly need more staff.  Like every other Department, this Department has been badly affected by the embargo over the past number of years.  On environmentally friendly farming relating to the Exchequer schemes, we are at a time of diminished resources but at the same time, GLAS has an annual budget of &euro;250 million, with around &euro;3.2 million allocated for agri-environmental support for 2014, &euro;2.5 million in 2015 and &euro;1.66 million in 2016.  There is a scheme there, which I would like to see used.  I would certainly like farmers compensated for any losses they have.</p></speech>

Lots of farmers - 70% of them - will never join GLAS.  In fact, I think GLAS represents only 25% of farmers.  I think the Minister's target is 50,000.  Can we get an absolute assurance today?</p></speech>

Under the regulations brought in by Michael D. Higgins, when he was Minister rather than President, there was compensation to be paid to farmers.  As the Minister of State's Secretary General will be able to tell him, for many years there was a scheme whereby, if farmers had a loss due to designation of traditional farming practices, they were entitled to compensation.  That was stopped on the spurious excuse that there was no money but unless one changes the law, one has to find the money.  It is not a question of discretion.  Can the Minister of State reassure farmers that that money will be made available and that they will not have to take the Department to court to get the money?</p></speech>

The situation is very simple.  Under the regulations which were introduced in 1997, a farmer was not obliged to join GLAS.  As I said, the majority of farmers are not in GLAS.  If their output was affected by the habitats directive, they were entitled to compensation.  Is the Minister of State going to comply with the law and make that compensation available?  This was put in place under the Department and its regulations.  I accept that if a farmer is in GLAS, which the minority are, he or she cannot get double compensation for the same action.  That is the point.  However, as the Minister of State knows, for many years, if one was not in the GLAS scheme and had to destock, one could get the money from the National Parks and Wildlife Service scheme.</p></speech>

Deputy Healy-Rae referred to hedge cutting and things moved on.  I would like to go back to it.  We are talking about a closed period.  Obviously, a Bill is going through.  I do not think there is a full realisation of the situation that is out there.  I can only talk about Cork County Council.  Going back many years ago, it had full authority and was cutting verges, which the community appreciated and was willing to pay for to a degree.  That has ceased to be the case.</p><p> The local authority does not cut the verges any more and it is left to the local community to do so.  Grants have been provided and local community groups try to draw down money to cut some of the verges.  The reality is that 80% of the verges are not cut.  That costs us and operators with lorries thousands of euros worth of damage and only the damage to vehicles is covered.  The overgrowth at verges will definitely be the cause of deaths on our roads.  Such overgrowth is to be found throughout rural Ireland.  A closed period for the cutting of the verges seemed to apply in rural Ireland.  When I was driving on the motorway to Dublin at 7.30 a.m., a gentleman telephoned me about this issue.  I have been inundated with calls on it for the last pew days due to the very strong growth in vegetation in west Cork.  As I was travelling here this morning, I saw three machines cutting the verges of the motorways between Cork and Dublin.  Where is the concern for the protection of the wildlife on the route between Cork and Dublin?  We have to protect the wildlife in rural Ireland.  Such is the level of growth that we cannot get around our bins and we cannot pull out onto our roadways without taking the vehicle halfway across the road to check for oncoming traffic.  On our motorways, however, the verges are cut to keep the edges clear at any time of the year one wants.  What is the closed period for such cutting on the motorways?  I would like a review of this area to try to find a compromise that would suit everybody.  We have to protect our wildlife but, more importantly, we also have to protect human lives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#T00300"><p>Yes, the questions relate to hedge cutting and gorse burning.  The Heritage Bill was commenced by the previous Government.  I initiated it in the Seanad and it has progressed as far as Committee Stage.  I obtained agreement from the Government to progress the legislation and it will continue on Committee Stage. I am awaiting a date to go to the Seanad to continue with the Bill.  The proposal in the Bill is that the gorse-burning period would be extended to the end of March and that hedge cutting would be allowed from 1 August within certain conditions.</p> <p>  Under section 42 of the relevant act, local authorities are allowed to cut hedges at any time of the year for health and safety reasons.  The issue of whether they cut the hedges is a matter for them in terms of a programme which covers such activity.  There is hedge-cutting programme in the local authority area in Galway but there is none in my local authority area.  If there is a health and safety issue, local authorities can arrange to have hedges cut.  I understand the point Deputy Michael Collins was making.  As sure as the rain comes, the hedges grow halfway out into the middle of some of those small roads and that can present a danger.  I cannot understand why people cannot cut the grass, where it is not part of a hedge, around their property at the side of the road.  That could be done but, obviously, people want to cut the hedge and the grass at the same time.  I know what the Deputy is talking about in terms of road safety.  That issue will be dealt with in the Heritage Bill and I have to wait until I get a date form the Seanad to proceed with it.</p> <p>  Regarding the national heritage areas, NHAs, that we plan to de-designate, to be clear on this, that is being done to compensate for the loss of habitat.  In terms of the ones we are de-designating, we are going to redesignate most of the bogs which are in public ownership.  That will impact less upon on the turf cutters in terms of those bogs being in public ownership and belonging to the State on which there would be no turf cutting.  Those are the bogs that will be designated to compensate for the ones that we wanted to de-designate.  The current NHA network comprises 284 raised bogs and the new NHA network will comprise 290 raised bogs.  That was the thinking behind it and the Bill will proceed through the Oireachtas.  There were more than 3,000 active turf plots in the current NHA network and 3,000 people were impacted upon and there are only 500 in the new network, in the new areas that will be de-designated.</p><p>That means that 2,500 people will be allowed continue to cut their turf.</p></speech>

First, has a Heritage Council board been established?  It is my understanding that only a chair is in position since last November and that there is no board or committee in place to drive the work of the Heritage Council?  Second, regarding a national heritage plan, my understanding is that every heritage officer in each local authority must have an individual heritage plan.  Obviously, that is to draw down funds, but is there an overarching heritage plan or even a plan for a plan?</p></speech>

We are working with the Heritage Council on a new heritage plan.  That is in progress.  Regarding the board of the Heritage Council, it has gone through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process.  I have a recommendation on my desk, and in the coming week or so I intend to appoint the members to the board of the Heritage Council.  All of them have gone through the PAS process.  There is a list of names, and I have to do that.</p></speech>

What steps have been taken by the Department to ensure the upgrade of the N59 can progress?  As the Minister is aware, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, has not yet agreed method statements on the Maam Cross to Oughterard section - I understand this comes under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring - and in the section west of Maam Cross I understand it did not arrive at an agreement with the county council before it went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with the subsequent disaster in terms of An Bord Plean&aacute;la turning down the planning permission application even though the road was largely on line.  How much progress has been made in resolving that?</p> <p>  My second question is straightforward.  In the designation and redesignation of alternatives, are we talking about natural heritage areas, NHAs, only?  Is it a fact that it is nearly impossible, except for a natural disaster, to redesignate or dedesignate a special area of conservation, SAC, under European law?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned a &euro;2 million fund and the purpose for which it will be used.  If that is a national fund spread among 30 counties, among Dublin's four local authorities, and among Cork's two, taking account of the city and the county, that is &euro;66,000 per county.  Will the Minister not agree that in a county like Galway that stretches from Ballinasloe to Clifden, &euro;66,000 will do nothing?</p></speech>

We have a proposal for a greenway in south Kerry.  It is an important and laudable project but it is running into difficulty in that a compulsory purchase order, CPO, process has been initiated.  In recent days, unsavoury slogans were erected on roadsides, including where the Ring of Kerry cycle took place where 13,000 or 14,000 people could see it.  I am sad that such actions were taken that condemned our officials in Kerry County Council.</p></speech>

The CPO process is being initiated in Kerry.  I gather from the way the Minister of State spoke that the officials went down to speak to the people on the land and got agreement.</p><p>They got other stakeholders to talk to the landowners as well.  That is how we would have preferred our projects to be carried out.  Now, we are going down the road of the compulsory purchase order process and I do not know where that will finish up.  Who initiated or suggested that Kerry County Council should undertake a CPO?  Where did that come from?  Those of us on Kerry County Council were told that it came from the Department.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  If we do not have buy-in from landowners, then we have a problem.  Previously, I was in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and we ran into difficulty in Galway.  The project had to be suspended.  I am not a believer in the CPO process if an alternative is possible.  If we cannot get negotiation, we have a problem.  There may be certain times when we may need to use that option, but I am not a believer in it.  The best way forward is for communities to try to work this out for themselves.</p> <p>  I know I have said it already but the greenways have been one of the greatest successes, especially in towns in rural Ireland.  They have given the likes of Newport, Mulranny and Achill a major lift in tourism because of the numbers of people coming in summer and winter.  All I can say is that Kerry has a very good tourism product and this would add to it.</p></speech>

I am unsure how we can liaise with the officials and get them to deal with the landowners, but that is the way to do it.  I do not believe the CPO process is going to work and I am concerned about it.</p></speech>

There was a meeting on the matter attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, as well as other Oireachtas Members.  I can confirm that the experts from my Department are sitting down with the local authority experts.  They are trying to find a solution and move this forward.</p> <p>  I understand the frustration of Deputies.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, raised this at the departmental management meeting.  I realise all Deputies want to get the project progressed.  The relevant people are sitting down and they are to find solutions and work their way through what needs to be done.</p> <p>  De-designation is for national heritage areas only.</p></speech>

It would only apply if some natural disaster destroyed the SAC.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

De-designation of SAC is provided for under the EU habitats directive.  The basis for such de-designation is very narrow but a natural disaster is one of the possible reasons.  It is difficult, but, having said that, we are continuing to work with the EU Commission on the matter.</p> <p>  There was another question on the &euro;2 million fund.  I presume the Deputy was referring to the &euro;2 million under the built heritage investment scheme announced in October 2015.  It has already leveraged almost &euro;870,000 in private funding and 50 projects have commenced.  I am keen to see it operate on a multiannual basis because there are extraordinary benefits in investing in our heritage.  With that in mind as well as rural Ireland and towns and streetscapes, I will be making the case for another built heritage investment scheme.  It is great for local communities.  There is nothing like a heritage project to bring people together.  People get extraordinary value from these projects, so I am hoping to get the support of Deputies on that in the budgetary process.</p></speech>

The idea that it is all happening in town and villages is inaccurate; it is happening throughout the countryside.  I do not know what the hang-up is; everyone is talking about towns and villages as if everywhere else is in some kind of fantasy hinterland.  The townlands of Ireland are as real as the towns.  People are finding that every second building that has any heritage problem is being preserved but they are not being given the resources to preserve them.  They are frozen in time and impossible to renovate in any way because they have become too expensive with all the stipulations of conservation architects and so on.  I am simply making the point that I will support a &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million fund, but given the rate of designation the Minister is going to have to put her money where her mouth is.</p></speech>

An mbeidh an tAire St&aacute;it in ann teacht ar an airgead sin?  Gan an maoini&uacute; sin, n&iacute; bheimid in ann obair na Gaeilge a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart.  T&aacute; all&uacute;ntas breise d'&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta san &aacute;ireamh ansin, ar nd&oacute;igh.  Chomh maith leis sin, go sonrach, an f&eacute;idir leis an Aire St&aacute;it a r&aacute; liom an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aige breis airgid a chur ar f&aacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s le haghaidh na deontais bainist&iacute;ochta a thugtar do na comharchumainn agus na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobalbhunaithe?  Is it the Minister of State's intention to increase the meagre funding that is made available to community development projects on the offshore non-Gaeltacht islands?  Proper funding needs to made available to the development officers there.</p><p> T&aacute; &euro;644,000 curtha ar f&aacute;il mar bhuis&eacute;ad caipiteal le haghaidh na hoile&aacute;in, ach is l&eacute;ir nach gcaithfear &eacute; sin ar Inis O&iacute;rr i mbliana.  Is beag caiteachas a bheidh ar Inis O&iacute;rr ach ar r&eacute;amhphlean&aacute;il agus mar sin de.  &Oacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it tar &eacute;is tairiscint&iacute; a lorg ag an am seo, de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, is ar &eacute;igean go mbeidh aon chonraitheoir ceaptha roimh dheireadh na bliana.  An mbeadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s aige an maoini&uacute; seo a chaitheamh ar thogra&iacute; eile oile&aacute;nda, n&oacute; ar thogra&iacute; eile Gaeltachta, roimh dheireadh na bliana?  Bheadh s&eacute; sin an-&uacute;s&aacute;ideach.  T&aacute; go leor oibre le d&eacute;anamh.  Is f&eacute;idir go leor togra&iacute; a chur i gcr&iacute;ch ar na hoile&aacute;in agus ar an m&oacute;rth&iacute;r, ach an t-airgead sin a bheith ar f&aacute;il go ginear&aacute;lta seachas &eacute; a bheith coinnithe le haghaidh togra nach tarl&oacute;idh i mbliana.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfaighfidh an tAire St&aacute;it all&uacute;ntas mar a ch&eacute;ile an bhliain seo chugainn agus go mbeidh s&eacute; in ann dul ar aghaidh leis na c&eacute;anna ar Inis O&iacute;rr agus ar Inis Me&aacute;in.  T&aacute; g&aacute; le t&uacute;s a chur leis an bpr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la i nd&aacute;ilcheantar an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Ring, le haghaidh feabhas a chur ar Ch&eacute; R&uacute; an &Aacute;tha.  T&oacute;gfaidh s&eacute; thart ar cheithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig bliana sula mbeidh t&oacute;g&aacute;il ar bun ansin.  Is &eacute; sin an m&eacute;id ama a th&oacute;gann s&eacute; anois plean&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis na rialacha ar fad at&aacute; ann.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; C&eacute; an Rannaigh le d&eacute;anamh thuas i dT&iacute;r Chonaill.  D'fh&eacute;adfainn go leor togra&iacute; beaga eile oile&aacute;nda agus Gaeltachta a lua.  Is ceist ollmh&oacute;r &eacute; sin.</p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it mar gheall ar an gcruinni&uacute; a bh&iacute; againn inn&eacute;.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur f&eacute;idir leis a r&aacute; linn inniu, anseo ar thaifead na D&aacute;la, c&eacute;n chaoi a seasann muid i dtaobh na haersheirbh&iacute;se go h&Aacute;rainn.  An bhfuil aon dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta &oacute; shin maidir le comhaont&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh le &uacute;in&eacute;ir&iacute; an aerfoirt sna Mine?  An bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;achaint le hairgead a fh&aacute;il an bhliain seo chugainn le haghaidh an d&aacute; aertheirmin&eacute;al ar an gCloigeann agus ar Inis B&oacute; Finne agus le haghaidh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; aeir rialta a chur ar f&aacute;il go hInis B&oacute; Finne?</p><p> Bh&iacute; s&eacute; luaite in Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012, a thug an Rialtas deireanach isteach, go mbeadh gr&eacute;as&aacute;in Gaeltachta taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht; s&eacute; sin, in &aacute;iteanna ar n&oacute;s Cluain Dolc&aacute;in agus mar sin de.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a leith&eacute;id a chur i bhfeidhm gan airgead.  An bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist sol&aacute;thar ceart airgid a chur ar f&aacute;il do na pobail sin, ionas go mbeid&iacute;s in ann pleananna a leagan amach?  C&eacute;ard a chaitheadh a bheith ar f&aacute;il sna pobail seo ionas go mbeadh an st&aacute;das sin acu?  Iarraim ar an Aire St&aacute;it d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go gcuirfidh an St&aacute;t an t-airgead seo ar f&aacute;il leis na saor&aacute;id&iacute; sin a shol&aacute;thar.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta nuair a deireann s&eacute; go dteasta&iacute;onn airgead chun an strait&eacute;is a chur i bhfeidhm.

It is an absolutely fantastic project.  It is a North-South project and one which I believe should have progressed during the bad times.  The Shannon-Erne waterway was done in the 1980s, which were fairly tough too.  It is a project that Unionists and Nationalists on both sides of the Border on this island fully support.  Will the Minister be able to raise the capital?  She will not be able to spend it.  It is a slow spend anyway, because it is slow work.  However, I am bitterly disappointed, us having gone so far, that, as I understand it, there has been no progress in the past five years.  I am sure she, like me, would like to see this as her legacy and I am sure Deputy Smyth will support me in this particular demand.  </p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows that the Ulster Canal project is very close to my heart.  There were great plans for it but, unfortunately, they did not materialise.  I am delighted, therefore, that I got work started on it and was the first to do so.</p><p>Funding has been made available through the Waterways Ireland budget for the first part of the canal, which goes from Belturbet to Castle Saunderson.  There was a bit of a delay in one aspect relating to the contractor but that has now been resolved, so the process is moving.  It is my wish that the Ulster Canal would go to Clones and from there to Monaghan and Middletown.  I am happy it has started.  As has been said, if we had all the money in the morning, we could not spend it, and that is right, but I would like to think that we can do this on an incremental basis.  I will certainly put the case forward.  The Ulster Canal is mentioned in the Fresh Start agreement and I was very anxious for it to get its rightful place there.  It has been discussed at every North-South ministerial meeting and each sectoral meeting.  The work has started and I want to see it moved to the next phase.</p><p> Monaghan County Council has made an application for INTERREG funding, in conjunction with Waterways Ireland.  It is seeking to develop the walkway along the canal from Clones through Monaghan town and on to Middletown.  I really want to see it opened and I want to see the boats on it.  I was in Ballyconnell when they started work on the Ulster Canal and when the late Mr. Charles Haughey opened the project.  It made a huge difference to the town and I am very familiar with it.  I will be making the case for the Ulster Canal.</p></speech>

There is a canal running from Navan to Drogheda which is in bad repair and which does not come under the remit of Waterways Ireland.

The first priority is the existing waterways.  Waterways Ireland does a great deal of work on recreational activities on the waterways.  I recently attended the opening of a recreation-based facility for canoeing and so on in Ballyconnell on part of the Shannon-Erne waterway.  There has been a lot of investment in it.  Waterways Ireland is particularly good at collaborating with others.  There is no plan to extend the waterways system but I know the canal to which the Chairman is referring.  It has been brought to my attention.</p></speech>

The all-Ireland economy, spatial planning and infrastructural development would, therefore, become more important.  To a certain extent, in light of its current remit and structure, Waterways Ireland seems to be fairly limited in what it can do.  We discussed greenways earlier and the fact that they should possibly come within the remit of the Department.  Greenways, canals and waterways almost go hand in hand as tourism facilities are concerned.  Has the Minister made any effort to broaden the scope of the North-South ministerial bodies to take in more areas where they can co-operate to improve the lives of the people of Ireland?</p></speech>

I had a very good working relationship with the previous Ministers, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n and Michelle McIlveen.  If there are areas on which we can co-operate, as we did on the Famine commemoration last year, which was a huge success, I am happy to facilitate such co-operation.

That will be a huge benefit to the scouting centre there, which receives in the region of 11,000 visitors every year, mostly young people from various countries.  Those responsible for the project are absolutely delighted that they will get this additional facility.  Deputy Smyth would be very familiar with Castle Saunderson and what they do there.</p><p>It will probably be towards the end of 2017 before all the work is done on that project.  A bridge must be built at Derrykerrib.  The workers ran into some difficulties as they needed firm ground and then the opposite.  That said, I have outlined the plan.  I want to work with all of the various organisations involved, including on a cross-Border basis, to ensure we can obtain funding to progress to Clones.</p><p> I have spoken to Waterways Ireland about adding water to a portion of the canal to encourage water-based activities such as canoeing and paddle-boarding.  I have asked it to work with local communities and the local authorities.  This is important if we are to make progress.  Monaghan County Council has applied, or is in the process of making an application, for a greenway or a blueway along the route of the canal.  It is also a question of protecting the route because some parts of it pass through the North where there are issues that must be dealt with.  We were fortunate that much of the canal in the county remained in the ownership of the State, but there is not the same clear title to it in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, there are a number of issues that must be overcome.  One can rest assured that I would love to be in a position to sit on a boat coming into Clones.</p></speech>

The Leader programme provide will provide &euro;250 million to support the development of sustainable rural communities in rural areas in the next five years or so and I am confident that this funding which is decided on by locals at local level will be funnelled to the areas most in need.</p> <p>  There are a number of Votes that are well established and new funding schemes that will provide specific supports for rural communities in the coming years.  They include a town and village regeneration scheme and an allocation of &euro;4 million this year, supplemented by a further &euro;1 million allocated to the Western Development Commission.</p> <p>  I assure Deputies that my priorities in this area include the design and implementation of an action plan for rural Ireland, in addition to working with local authorities and other stakeholders to eliminate in advance delaying factors and to enable effective rural broadband delivery once a contract has been awarded under the national broadband plan in terms of procurement.  While the resource requirement for these tasks will largely be met in 2016 from within existing resources, work on these priorities is already under way.  I look forward to working with the committee to make progress on this agenda over the lifetime of the Government.</p></speech>

In so far as the 2016 Estimates are concerned, &euro;2.7 million will be spent under subhead E.8 to discharge existing commitments on the walks scheme.  There was a commitment to expand the walks scheme in A Programme for a Partnership Government and plans in that regard will be developed during 2016, subject to the availability of funding, with a view to rolling out an expanded scheme in 2017.  This is an important element of a broader commitment set out in the programme to provide for significant capital investment to take the Wild Atlantic Way to the next level, including an Atlantic blueway route and the Ireland Way, and to invest further in developing a nationwide greenway network.  My Department looks forward to playing a central role in that process.</p><p>In addition, I envisage &euro;3.5 million being spent on small-scale development and enhancement of existing rural recreation infrastructure.  Other ongoing issues in 2016 include the roll-out of the mountain access scheme, the implementation of the national indemnity scheme and the negotiations with other State agencies to agree a national outdoor recreation plan for public lands and waters in Ireland.</p><p> My Department was also assigned responsibility for acting on the recommendations of the final report of the post office business development group, including supporting the implementation of a basic payment account and enabling the payment of motor tax through the post office network.  The various Departments, including my Department, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are working together, along with NewERA, to develop the business case that will be brought back to Government shortly.  Funding of any initiatives in this area in 2016 will be met from within the overall Vote.  </p><p> The Tidy Towns competition organised by my Department and sponsored by SuperValu continues to be a well-recognised and successful way of encouraging community participation and volunteerism.  It attracts a large number of entries every year.  My Department also supports other related competitions like the Best Kept competition, which is a North-South collaboration involving eight towns from the South and six from the North in 2016.  Tullamore in County Offaly and Straffan in County Kildare have been entered into the Entente Florale competition, an EU-wide competition, while Letterkenny in County Donegal is participating in the Communities in Bloom competition.  The Minister and I will take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#JJ00200"><p>Has the Minister of State raised the issue of why so little was transferred to him in the first place?  For example, I understand that the so-called greenways scheme, which is actually about black ways because one is talking about cycle paths which are fenced on each side, remain with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The rural social scheme remains with the Department of Social Protection where, under the current Minister, there does not seem to be much of an appetite for it as does the farm assist scheme, which again seems to be anathema in the Department of Social Protection.  Rural transport remains in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  God knows where marine leisure remains.  When I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine whether he was responsible for it, I received a fairly vague answer.  Is it intended to give a real and wide remit to the Minister of State in respect of rural development?  I do not see anything relating to regional development, which I take to mean county towns and developing all parts of the country equally.  Can the Minister of State tell me whether it is intended to transfer more functions to him and to make this a real Department of rural development.  Perhaps the Minister can answer that.</p> <p>  My second question is addressed to the Minister.  I understand that she has responsibility for CL&Aacute;R, which used to run at about &euro;20 million per year.  She might tell me what the budget for CL&Aacute;R is this year.  I understand that she has inherited responsibility for the Western Development Commission.  I see that it has capital of &euro;1 million.  Is that right?  Again, would the Minister not agree that it would be a good idea to make possibly &euro;100 million available from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund because the Western Development Commission was quite successful in picking winners - enough winners to cover the losers?  Pension funds are 30-year projects and I have no doubt that the Western Development Commission would give it back with a profit to the State in 30 years' time if it was given the money.  Would the Minister not agree that in terms of developing business in the west from Donegal to Clare, &euro;1 million is a joke and an insult?  Would she agree with me that the remit of that fund should be extended to cover Kerry and west Cork because they are equally as rural as Connacht and Donegal?  In respect of Leader, could the Minister give me the breakdown between capital and current and the &euro;40 million?</p><p>My understanding is that current expenditure this year will just pay staff wages.  How much of the capital expenditure will relate to outstanding commitments under the old programme that might have to be wrapped up?  How much relates to the new programme?  I do not see any capital expenditure occurring in reality under the new programme this year.  When will it go live?  There is huge discontent in the whole Leader family over the reduction in funding and the total uncertainty over whether they were meant to be in with LCDCs or not.  Generally there is considerable dissatisfaction with how the Government has rolled out Leader.</p><p> The Minister of State had responsibility for tourism and is now the big hope for rural development.  What is the thinking in Government behind the decision to take land from a farmer, black-top it - effectively build a road - put two fences up and do it on a concessionary basis that can be revoked on either side at any time?  On the one hand, the Department is investing millions of euro and, on the other, the farmer or landowner is not getting any compensation.  If we are going to build these roads, which are called greenways for some reason but which are actually roads with permanent infrastructure, would the Minister of State agree that the land should be bought by agreement from the landholders at the market value as if it was for the purpose of building a road on which motor vehicles would travel?  One would never think of taking land permanently from an urban dweller, even if it is only five feet from the front of a front garden, without fully compensating them for the market value of the land plus disturbance money and also restoring all the walls and fences to a very high quality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-05a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RGS2016070500002#KK00200"><p>The Deputy is correct on the greenways, farm assist scheme and the rural transport scheme.  When I attended the first meeting with the Taoiseach and the Cabinet subcommittee, I made the point.  When the Deputy was a Minister in the past, he had the same problem.  I have made a strong case on the greenways.  That is not decided yet and I hope I will have responsibility.  If we have responsibility for the walkways and the other schemes in place in our Department, we should have the greenways as well.  I have worked with the Taoiseach on this and we will hold discussions and meetings in coming weeks with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will know from his dealings with Secretaries General and assistant secretaries, nobody wants to let any powers go or let any budget go.  However, I believe this should be in this Department.  I also believe that many of the community schemes the Deputy mentioned should be in this Department.</p> <p>  I would not agree with him on the farm assist scheme, which should be handled by the Department of Social Protection.  I have been talking to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, about that scheme and I know he is looking at it.  We need to simplify that scheme and assist farmers in need of it.</p> <p>  The rural transport scheme is not coming with us and, again, it should be with us.  If we have responsibility for rural development, we should have it.  I am sure it will be considered at Government.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about the farm programme.  This year, there are 100,000 in the programme.  That scheme was suspended previously and it has been kept open every year with a very small budget.  I intend to develop that scheme this year and next year.  I will go back to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Department looking for further funding.  If there are any savings within the Department, I intend for them to go into the CL&Aacute;R programme, which is one of the best schemes the Deputy introduced.  It has assisted rural areas and is very badly needed now.</p> <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke earlier about group water schemes.  In the past, where the local contribution was difficult to get, it was topped up by the CL&Aacute;R programme.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v introduced some very good schemes in that regard.  I will look at those schemes again.  I have asked my officials to draw up plans immediately for any savings or any further funding we can get this year.  I hope we will be able to divert funding from other schemes where money is not being used.  Previously there were class two and class three roads and that worked well.</p><p>The flashing amber scheme outside schools was brilliant.  We want to examine the local improvement scheme in the context of roads, an issue that was raised with the councillors yesterday.  I also want to examine small group sewerage schemes and a few other schemes that I have in mind to put in place.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about compensation for farmers and I agree with his comments.  In my previous Department, the goodwill payment was suspended for five years but I put the scheme back in place last year because it works.  The National Roads Authority experienced little disruption in taking land from farmers.  In addition to them getting compensation for their land at the going rate, they received a goodwill payment of up to &euro;5,000 in some cases.  The payment has been reduced but the old funding was allowed to remain for some of the older schemes.  The top-up is now &euro;3,000 per acre.  With regard to greenways, if we are taking land off farmers, they will have to get the going rate where possible.  If the land is in public ownership, that is a different ball game but we should consider a scheme in the future, when resources permit, for people who co-operate with the State and make their land available.</p></speech>

The fund always has to generate a commercial return but the basis of the WDC's venture capital fund is a commercial return.  There are swings and roundabouts.  One wins some and one loses some but one can win big.  Will the State stop always thinking in billions of euro for cities and thinking in thousands of euro for rural areas?  Will the Government realise that, despite perceptions, rural Ireland gets the thin of the wedge financially under many schemes?</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State agree that two issues relating to broadband need to be addressed in the context of rural Ireland?  Fibre, not some radio solution, must be provided to every premises in the country.  A scheme is being developed in France - which, therefore, must comply with state-aid regulations - where, in areas of difficult topography in which telecommunications companies do not provide 100% coverage, the state will provide the basic infrastructure, such as the towers, and connect it before letting it out to the companies, which will then put the equipment in the towers and provide the service.  Unfortunately, because of the licensing agreement in this State, telecommunications companies only have to cover 27% of the landmass and do not have to provide 100% coverage.  Would the Minister be willing to ensure universal coverage in that way?</p></speech>

On the WDC, &euro;5.6 million in seed capital funding is available.  I will listen to the commission's proposals next week.  I have received a submission and I will not respond until I meet the representatives next week to discuss their proposals.  The commission has played a major role in the development of the west and I will give serious consideration to the proposals.  I am worried about the number of agencies that we have dealing with rural development, which is something I will examine as well.  I did not realise so many agencies deal with the same problem and I am sick and tired of duplication.  I will examine this issue seriously and if I have to make decisions on it, I will not be afraid to do so.</p></speech>

We are already 15 minutes into his slot.  We will proceed to the next question.</p> <p>  Regional development was an obvious major issue for the State in the last election.  It is a major crisis across the State because we have such a concentration of development in the Dublin region with a lack of development in the other regions.  This is causing major headaches for people living in Dublin because services are hard to come by and difficult to access.  However, in the rest of the regions, we have a massive depletion in services and in population.  To many the Government&rsquo;s response to this and the budget allocated to it seems to be an empty husk.  If one looks at the size of the problem and the Government&rsquo;s response to it, it is not comparable in any way.</p> <p>  The spatial plan is happening within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This will be the first spatial plan since 2002.  To a certain extent, we are travelling rudderless in this regard.  What work is the Minister&rsquo;s Department doing with regard to the spatial plan?  The plan is the blueprint for future regional development.</p></speech>

I will be shortly developing an action plan for rural Ireland and I will be happy to take on Deputies&rsquo; suggestions for it.  All the different Departments will feed into that plan.  The Action Plan for Jobs is successful.  It sets targets, is measured and is reported on every month.  It will be the same for an action plan for rural Ireland.</p> <p>  There are 200,000 jobs planned over the next several years.  The target is to have 135,000 of those located in rural Ireland.  There will be a real focus on the regions.  I, along with the Deputies here, want to see Enterprise Ireland, which does great work in rural areas, and IDA Ireland present rural Ireland as a place where we want to do business.  There is much energy and enthusiasm and there are many skills in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

In other words, investment made not on the basis of a current demand but demand in 20 to 30 years time.</p><p>That means that the response of the Government must alter radically to the need for investment and development.</p><p> I have some specific questions about the document.  A fall in the number of post offices is being planned for.  The post office is a key element of the viability of rural settlements, an issue which has been the subject of controversy in the past while.  The Minister might address it.</p><p> The document also appears to show there has been a radical fall in the number of villages benefiting from enhancements, from 1,300 to 199.  </p><p> The Minister might address these two issues.</p></speech>

I have some ideas, but I want to work through the local authorities.  The best approach is to get them to engage with local communities.  I want the town teams to come forward with proposals on how they can improve their towns.  That is a collaborative way to do business, to have a bottom up approach to find out what people living in towns and villages need because they know more about them than many of us do.  They know what will improve and regenerate them.  It is very important to have chambers of commerce in towns.  Having an active chamber means a great deal to a town which reaps the benefits.</p></speech>

He told us that the group intended to finish its work by October this year.  A number of recommendations will be made to the Government soon.  We are looking at network renewal, the basic payment and motor tax issues.  These are measures that can enhance and support rural post offices.  The group is examining every aspect of the operations of rural post offices.  That will not be an easy task, but we will divide them into three or four categories, including bigger post offices, those in cities and towns and those in rural areas.  We will examine the possibility of providing for reskilling and retraining those who have worked in post offices for many years.  We will also try to get the communities involved in poviding community hubs, including the local shop, the post office or other services provided in the local community.  We are examining these issues and committed to having some recommendations, particularly for the Government, in the near future.  As the group has committed to finishing its work by October, we will have plans and announce what we intend to do.</p></speech>

Why is a compulsory acquisition order required in respect of  the areas involved in Kerry when that was not the way it was dealt with for the other greenways?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the amount of funding the Minister said is available for the Leader programme.

I am also concerned that it will be mainly administered by the local community development committees, LCDCs, rather than Leader partnership companies.  That is a big cutback for rural areas compared to the bottom-up approach we had with the partnerships.  The populated areas, with which I have nothing against, will probably benefit more than the rural areas under the LCDCs.  That is the legacy the former Minister, Phil Hogan, left us and we cannot blame him entirely because he was supported by the Government at the time.  That is what has happened.  We have been asked by the partnership companies to inquire if they could get a separate fund - it would not be the Leader fund - whether some of it would come from Europe or wherever.  Rural communities will be left behind as we move forward.  That is the way I see it and I have to represent the people who are concerned about it in rural areas of south Kerry such as Sliabh Luachra, Annagh and Duhallow who have given great value for the money they received over the years.  They represented east Kerry, Gneevgullia, Rathmore, Ballydesmond and Knocknagree and they really helped rural areas that were struggling.  The partnership companies will now find it difficult to even survive.</p> <p>  I would like to hear what the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will say about the CL&Aacute;R programme.  CL&Aacute;R funding was especially valuable for class 3 roads, as we call them, in respect of which there was no hope of ever getting funding.  They are public roads in the charge of the local authorities but they are not getting adequate funding to maintain those roads.  Those roads are now in a desperate state.  I received a request from a postman as late as yesterday inquiring if a digger could level the middle of the road because his van is getting stuck on his way to deliver letters to the locals.  That is a sad reflection of how far backwards matters have gone in rural areas.  CL&Aacute;R funding would be really appreciated if the Minister of State could progress it and I depend on him to do that. </p> <p>  I do not know under which Minister's remit this comes, but discretionary funding used to be provided for local roads.  The practice of providing such funding ceased in the past four years.</p><p>This committee is discussing ways and means of helping rural Ireland.  Not all of the class three roads were designated for the CL&Aacute;R programme, but these roads are getting no funding now unless there is a community involvement scheme where residents contribute 15%, 20% or, in some cases, 25% of the funding.  That does not suit for a link road because it means that people from outside are using the road and the locals do not see how it is right that they must contribute for a road which others are using.  When the allocation of discretionary funding came to Kerry County Council it gave each councillor a chance to nominate two roads that were in a desperate state.  The people concerned are paying their motor tax, insurance, property tax and, most likely, they are paying for their water, be it from pumps or in a group scheme.</p></speech>

I hope that people such as the Deputy and community groups would work with the local farmers to try to encourage them to make their land available.  I do not like the compulsory purchase option but in some cases it might be necessary.</p> <p>  The Deputy is quite correct about the CL&Aacute;R programme.  In the past, the class two and three roads and even the local improvement scheme, LIS, roads were subsidised by the CL&Aacute;R programme.  With regard to the LIS roads and the local contribution that was being provided, Kerry County Council must not have been treating the Deputy right because we re-introduced that scheme approximately three years ago when I was a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The council was allowed to use up to 15% of discretionary money from the overall budget it received to give to councillors for LIS roads.  It happened in some counties.  Some of the county managers or chief executive officers of local authorities did not wish to do it, but the discretionary grant is still there.  One can take a percentage of that money and use it for discretionary or LIS roads.</p> <p>  I will conclude on this note.  The local authorities have discretionary money.  Some of them were very good and used that discretionary money on roads.  Some of them used it for travelling all over the world or for other schemes they had when they could have put it into roads.  That is something the Deputy might discuss with his colleagues in the county council.  The discretionary scheme is in place for the LIS roads so the Deputy should check how much of its discretionary money Kerry County Council put towards the roads.</p></speech>

It is like the loaves and the fishes in that one must have the power to multiply.  That would mean funding for our county roads and local roads would have been reduced, and the massive volume of traffic is from local areas into towns.  I did not talk about the local improvement scheme.  We are told, and I must believe our county manager, that there is only funding for five local improvement schemes each year notwithstanding the fact that 168 are sanctioned and there are 500 on a list waiting to be assessed.  Clearly, the funding has been cut back-----</p></speech>

I referred to the post offices and, in fairness, the Minister clarified it quite well.  I have a worry, however.  The Minister spoke about bringing in communities to run post offices.  That would be a serious move.  Running shops is one thing, but running post offices would be quite a serious move.</p><p>The judging of the funding of post offices is on their activity.  There is no comparison between a post office in Dublin and a post office in Schull in west Cork.  Something must be done to bridge that gap for rural communities.  The Minister is trying and working on it, and I appreciate that.</p><p> I have seen the benefit of the rural social scheme, RSS, to the local farmer and fisherman.  It is under the Department of Social Protection and I urge the Minister to consider seriously trying to bring that scheme under her brief.  Deputy Humphreys is the Minister for rural affairs and it is most important that the RSS comes back in under Deputy Humphreys' brief.  It is built for rural communities.  It is not a community services programme, CSP, community employment, CE, scheme or T&uacute;s.  It is a supplementary income for low-income farmers and fishermen and it must come under the Minister's brief in the future, if she could work towards that.</p><p> The town and village enhancement scheme is a great idea.  No doubt it is a fabulous idea.  Anything that helps local towns and villages is a fabulous idea.  We have seen how rural areas especially have been decimated.  The idea of living over the shop must be looked at.  We are talking about building houses here and there, and nobody looks at the local town and village.  In my local town, there might be facilities to house 250 or 300 people, but there are only 15 people living there.  Something needs to be addressed there.  It might not always suit people to move from wherever but if one is living in a crammed up hotel, an attractive option might be a town or village that provides a huge school, a community centre etc.  That should be looked at.</p><p> My only concern is that sometimes the local authorities tend to look at the bigger towns and villages and the smaller ones without strong active community groups tend to fall between two stools.  That needs to be looked at in order that every rural community is looked after.  I attended a meeting in Macroom some months ago.  I was on the radio the next day talking about the meeting where I stated that I met only one car on my one hour and 20 minutes journey from Macroom to the parish of Goleen.  It tells me that rural communities are dead.  They need a bit of life and maybe this town and village enhancement scheme is the way forward.  If it is, let us all work together to see whether we can make that happen.</p><p> I have two questions on Leader funds.  How much of this &euro;40 million will be used in administration and are there still payments to be made which will come from this &euro;40 million?</p></speech>

I want to get this moving.  That is the main thing.  I want to see the funding out in the communities because that is where it needs to be.  I am attending an event in Virginia in County Cavan on Friday and I will be signing the contracts there for at least 18 of the agreements with the local action groups, LAGs.</p> <p>  Leader is governed by EU regulations.  It provides for the development and implementation of publicly funded local government strategies by partnerships of key public and private actors, the local action groups.  There are different local action groups throughout the country and the first 18 agreements will be signed on Friday.  That funding is in place and I want to see the LAGs facilitating the applications and getting the money out.  There are many projects because people have been waiting for this.  There are many people with different ideas and who want to set up businesses and do different things.  I want to see that rolled out as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  To be clear, the &euro;40 million is for this year.  There are some administration costs of between &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million in total for this year.</p><p>That is for closing off the old Leader programme and also starting the new programme which will begin shortly.  The Leader programme is huge in rural Ireland.  It has been great up to now and many powerful projects have been funded.</p><p> I want to see how we can incentivise people to live in towns again.  There is nothing more evident than that when we are out canvassing.  When we knock on doors, there is nobody there because nobody is living in town centres.  They have all moved out.  I would like to see some change in this regard.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance about this to see how we can incentivise young people and owner-occupiers to come back into towns.  A number of years ago, the trend was for publicans and shopkeepers to build fine houses in the suburbs and they moved out, so there was nothing happening in the middle of towns.  I want to see how we can get people back in, however, because people bring business and that is it at the end of the day.  That is something that I certainly want to work on.  The town and village renewal scheme will be targeted at populations of less than 5,000.</p><p> I think I have covered most of the issues.</p></speech>

However, there is a special Cabinet sub-committee and I will raise the issue of the rural social scheme there.  That sub-committee holds to account every Department that relates to rural Ireland.  They will be asked the relevant questions concerning what they are doing for rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach chairs that sub-committee, which is a very good one.</p> <p>  A sub-committee was established for the 1916 commemorations, which worked well and made things happen.  Even though some things might appear to be under my Department's aegis, I attend that sub-committee with the Ministers of State, Deputy Ring and Deputy Kyne.  We want to know what these Departments are doing for rural Ireland and how the rural social scheme is working.</p> <p>  The other day, we handled the issue of rural post offices, which was raised.  We got a commitment that staff of the Department of Social Protection will explain what is happening in that respect.  Every time they get a form for a payment, they will ask the applicant if they want to collect the payment in their local post office.  Those are the kinds of things that can happen at the sub-committee.

At the outset, he said there is a big task in hand in bringing post offices back in order that they are at the forefront of our communities and towns.  It is a simple no-brainer.  They have been allowed to fall behind because they have not been given an opportunity to function or provide services.  If they were given that opportunity, people would avail of those services which are so important for the social fabric of rural areas.</p> <p>  We spoke about broadband and, at the risk of repeating myself, I do not know how rural post offices will function unless they all have broadband.  It is a basic requirement and it should be a simple job to provide it if the commitment is there.</p> <p>  The Minister of State also said that some local authorities were not using their discretionary funds for local improvement schemes, LIS.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referred to this matter too.  As a former Fianna F&aacute;il councillor on Cavan County Council, I voted against it for the simple reason that our roads have been, and still are, atrocious.  It would have been inconceivable to consider taking money out of our main roads budget to put it into local improvement schemes.  My grand-uncle, the late Paddy Smith, introduced the LIS in the first place.  It was always a stand-alone scheme, but I would like to see it being brought back.  I am making the point, however, that it is not that simple for local authorities.  If main public roads were in disrepair, one could not possibly justify taking money out of those road schemes to do lanes.</p><p>I spoke to the Minister yesterday - we had a very good meeting in Monaghan - about the rural economic development zone, REDZ, scheme.  As a new Deputy, it was new to me and I had not heard of it before.  In her address yesterday, she mentioned that Castleblayney is one town that availed of the scheme.  Will she give an overview of it for Cavan-Monaghan, if I can be parochial?  Are there other towns that can avail of it or what opportunities have there been for such towns?  I must have missed the boat there as it sounds really interesting.  In my time on the council, I was extremely passionate about main street rejuvenation and it sounded really brilliant.  I did not hear of it happening anywhere in Cavan but perhaps it was just a pilot scheme for Castleblayney.  Will the Minister speak a little about it?</p><p> With regard to the town teams, Cavan County Council held its first town team meeting some weeks ago in Virginia.  It is probably not the fault of the council or business people but as somebody who is extremely passionate about rejuvenating our main streets and bringing integrity to them, I was extremely disappointed with the process.  The people at the coalface of main street rejuvenation were not present.  I brought that up with council officials afterwards, who said the individuals in question had been invited and knew about the event.  It was a lost opportunity in Virginia specifically.  There were people there involved with the Tidy Towns scheme and various other community groups, which is great, but business people must be there.  They pay the rates and have road works outside their doors, so they cannot get customers in during the day.  These are the people who we need to engage with local authorities.  Unless there is a real emphasis on getting business people around the table, there will be a real question mark over whether the town teams can achieve anything.  The one in Cavan town had more business people attending.  If the Department is going to push the town teams, I would like more business people to attend these meetings.  Perhaps they should happen during the day.  The people who matter were not present but they must engage with their local authorities.  What types of projects are envisaged in the context of a town and village rejuvenation scheme?  I will say no more and give the Minister all that time to answer.</p></speech>

The local improvement scheme was suspended by people who did not have an understanding of rural Ireland and at least I fought to get it reopened.  I was delighted to that it was reopened by the Department.  I know we could not put in the amount of money that was required, but at least the scheme was reopened and local authorities now have an opportunity to access it.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about post offices.  There are 1,130 rural post offices and 51 are owned by An Post.  The rest are privately owned.  One of the issues considered was other services being used.  Almost 50% of these were co-located post offices, which means there were shops or other businesses in them.  Mr. Bobby Kerr and his committee are also considering including in new recommendations issues such as broadband, meaning the post office will be able to sell broadband.  As the Minister said, we had discussions with the Department of Social Protection.  It sent out its letter but that is being changed as there was really no mention of the post office.  That is now happening.</p></speech>

The pity was that the locals were not using them.  Perhaps this committee and the Department should examine, in the new year, ways of putting a campaign together to encourage people to use local post offices.  If we do not use them, we lose them.  We certainly need people to be able to use them.</p></speech>

It is crazy that somebody from Mayo or Monaghan has to go to Dublin.  Kerry people are not so badly off as they can go to Cork.

We want to work with local authorities and chambers of commerce as that is very important.  We must work with business people.  I have said before that a good chamber in a town makes a huge difference.  We have asked them to set their priorities.  They choose what they think will be of most benefit to their towns and submit their applications.  Last year, we allocated &euro;2 million and offered up to 50% of funding for submissions.  It was broken down into a number of different categories.  There were three flagship projects and a number of other projects nationally.  The one in Castleblayney was very successful.  It involved the improvement of signage into the town and the improvement of shop fronts.  It was not a great deal of money for each shop owner but it certainly improved the appearance of the town.  The project also got people together to look at broadband for a business park to see how that could be developed and brought along.  Two weeks ago I launched another projected funded by REDZ in Tubbercurry.  A company had vacated an old building, which the project then acquired.  The local chamber played a huge role along with the local authority and Leader company.  They came together and acquired the building which is now full of offices for start-up businesses.  There are hot-desking facilities and high-speed broadband.  Those are the types of projects which have been carried out and I would like to see us roll out something from that base as quickly as possible by inviting local authorities to go to the community to identify priorities and apply for funding.</p></speech>

I am just providing examples of where people came together and saw what they needed to do.  In fairness, I have yet to see a good project refused funding.  Ideas were put together, applications were made and we were able to support them.  I want to see more of that.  Again, it is about working on a collaborative basis.  I have great faith in local authorities because they know what is happening on the ground and can work with local communities, identify the priorities and submit the applications to central Government.</p></speech>

I did not realise the meeting would go on this long and I had another meeting planned.  We are hearing a lot about Cavan-Monaghan here so I am going to be little parochial and mention Kildare.  I have a point rather than a question as to the basis on which money is assigned to Leader programmes and the deprivation element.  In Kildare, we received one of the lowest allocations in the last tranche of Leader funding.  There are areas of Kildare which have plenty of deprivation.  At times, we struggle because we are perceived to be the horsey county in which everyone has a horse and people think we are grand because we are right beside Dublin.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will always tell us about the bad land in poor Connemara but there are plenty of areas in Kildare which have difficulties.  Athy was a RAPID town and there is rising youth unemployment there.  I have concerns about the whole mechanism by which funding is decided and I am determined to see an increase of Leader funding for Kildare.</p><p>Despite its population of 210,000, the county received less money than County Leitrim.  Fair play to Leitrim but Kildare has a much larger population and has plenty of good projects that could be funded.  </p><p> As I stated, I had to leave the meeting briefly.  I apologise, therefore, if I repeat questions asked by other Deputies.  What role will local authorities play in the roll-out of rural broadband?  This area offers significant potential for local authority involvement and I am aware the Minister plans to engage with local authorities in this area.  I ask her to elaborate a little on that. </p></speech>

South County Kildare pays a price for having Intel and Hewlett Packard located in the north of the county.  I am not arguing with the Minister but pointing out that County Kildare was definitely the poor relation in terms of Leader funding.</p></speech>

In the meantime, I want to ensure that once the plan has been agreed and signed off, every county will be broadband ready.  I will work with local authorities on this matter.  I will meet representatives of the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, shortly when I will ask that every county produce a broadband plan.  This will mean counties will know precisely what they need to do regarding way leave rights and development levies.  A number of issues need to be addressed in this regard.</p> <p>  We must also educate people on the benefits of broadband because many people do not realise how important and useful it is.  Every county will be asked to report to a regional action group on what it is doing.  This is being done to ensure counties do not have obstacles in place that would prevent the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  We will also ask commercial suppliers to improve the services they are providing.  One possibility is to have business clusters.  I am aware of cases where two businesses located within one mile of each other are each paying large sums to different broadband providers.  Perhaps businesses could come together to form a critical mass which would allow them to negotiate better with commercial providers.  We can do some work on this.</p> <p>  We also intend to pursue community hubs to enable communities to secure high-speed broadband.  I will be pleased to listen to any suggestions Deputies may have on this issue.</p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, and I will co-chair a mobile coverage and broadband task force which will identify solutions to improve mobile reception.</p></speech>
