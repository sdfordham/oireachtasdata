However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>At the request of the broadcasting services, witnesses and those in the public Gallery are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are either turned off completely or switched to flight mode.  Mr. Cussen's opening statement will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, has announced that she proposes to appoint Mr. Oliver Cussen as chairperson of the Grangegorman Development Agency.  The agency is a statutory agency established in 2006 to redevelop the grounds of the former St. Brendan's Hospital in Dublin city centre.  Its functions range from planning and constructing the redevelopment to handing over the new facilities on completion.  Today we have an opportunity to engage with Mr. Cussen.  As part of the programme for Government, when public appointments are made, in particular of chairpersons of State agencies, the Oireachtas has an opportunity to engage with those chairpersons before they take up their positions.  This brings about more openness and transparency in respect of public appointments.  This meeting is being held in public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Cussen" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#C00200"><p>I am very pleased to address the Chairman and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection as chairperson designate of the Grangegorman Development Agency.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm bheith libh agus deis agam gn&oacute; na Gn&iacute;omhaireachta a phl&eacute; idir an obair at&aacute; curtha i gcr&iacute;ch go dt&iacute; seo agus an cl&aacute;r oibre at&aacute; amach romhainn.</p> <p>  The agency is charged with developing the grounds of the former St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, a 73-acre site, at Grangegorman in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city in order to create a major education, health and public resource.  Therefore, the key stakeholders are the Health Service Executive, HSE, Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, and the local community.  The significance of this development is reflected in its inclusion as a strategic objective in the current and previous development plans for Dublin City, its inclusion in the National Development Plan as a key objective for higher education, its inclusion in Transport 21 as a key enabler to support the construction of Luas cross-city project and its inclusion as a flagship project in the national stimulus programme announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in July 2012.</p> <p>  On completion, the project will contribute to educational, social and economic development locally and nationally.  It will yield significant operational efficiencies for organisations such as DIT and, in the process of construction, create significant employment opportunities.  It will also be a major driver for urban regeneration in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city. </p> <p>  It is perhaps worth noting the milestones passed to date and upcoming milestones.  In May 2013, patients and staff from St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital relocated to a new state-of-the-art replacement building, the Phoenix Care Centre.  There is already feedback that this facility, with its modern design and layout, is having a positive effect on patients and other users.  Recently, the first phase of the site infrastructure and public realm SIPR was completed.  This consists of the laying of all critical utility services, major earthworks and development of the public realm, including paths, roads, green areas, lighting, seating and bike parking.  A new surface water pipe connection to Smithfield has also been provided, as required by Dublin City Council.  As of September 2015, all of the outdoor sports facilities are complete and the all-weather pitch, tennis courts and informal play area are all in use, while the GAA and soccer grass pitches will be ready for use next season.  A new playground and jogging and walking track have also recently opened, and I am told they are proving very popular with the local community.  The first 1,000 DIT students came to Grangegorman in September 2014.  They are located in five of the protected structures around the site, which were refurbished to the highest standards, and some now form An Cro&iacute;, the cultural heart of the site.  The first new DIT building is nearing completion.  The new greenway hub will create specialist research facilities for the environmental sustainability and health institute, ESHI, as well as incubation space for new companies.  It is due to be handed over to DIT shortly.  A new primary care centre is also being constructed for the HSE.  This facility will deliver a range of health services including general practitioner services, occupational therapy, community nursing and counselling.  It is due for completion in mid-2016 and will provide a significant new health service for the community around Grangegorman.</p> <p>  The next phase of the delivery of DIT services is through the construction of two major quads, the central and east quads.  The central quad will be home to ten schools from the College of Sciences and Health, the College of Engineering and Built Environment and the College of Arts and Tourism.  The east quad will accommodate the majority of academic activities and facilities required for the College of Creative and Cultural Industries.  Both buildings were granted planning permission in July 2015.  These buildings will bring 10,000 students, over half of DIT's student population, to Grangegorman.   Other projects include the new primary school, which is at early design stage, a community nursing unit, which is at feasibility study stage, the academic hub, including a co-located DIT and public library, which is at the very early stages, and student accommodation, which is at early design stage.  I have dealt with the quality of the planning and design in some detail in my submission and may move on from those instead of citing them in detail on this occasion.  I am happy to come back to them if anybody wishes to ask me any questions. </p> <p>  The site is being developed on principles of sustainability, as would be expected and required in the world we live in now.  Protected structures dating back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century are being brought back into use alongside new buildings. </p> <p>  A very important initiative has been the implementation of the Grangegorman local employment charter, which many committee members will be familiar with.  The charter aims for 20% of new construction jobs to be filled by local people.  At the height of construction there were 350 construction workers on site, 50 of whom were from the local area.  Employment has been created and more will be created in areas such as direct labour in construction, as well as in indirect supporting professions such as architecture, engineering, and conservation.  There is also a multiplier effect in areas such as concrete manufacturing and providers of equipment, fixtures and fittings.  The employment charter was developed under the guidance of the labour and learning forum, LLF, which is chaired by former Secretary General of the Department and Education and Skills, Ms Brigid McManus.  Other areas of focus for the group include local education opportunities and exploring opportunities for co-operation and synergies between the project and local businesses.</p> <p>  The LLF, in collaboration with DIT and local community groups, has been awarded a grant of just over &euro;940,000 from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Atlantic Philanthropies.  This area-based childhood, ABC, programme will fund an exciting series of activities from 2015 to 2017 to help improve outcomes for children up to six years of age and families living in the Grangegorman area.</p> <p>  Another significant but less tangible area is the importance of public art.  A positive outcome of the project is the recent launch of &ldquo;...the lives we live&rdquo;, the Grangegorman public art programme, which has raised the profile of the project significantly.  The programme of public art will be rolled out over the coming years and will encourage relationship building between the art community and the local community.  It has already raised the profile of the project.</p> <p>  Another important dimension of the way the project has worked is a positive element which I have inherited.  Throughout the life of the Grangegorman project communication has been a central feature.  There are two formal stakeholder groups, the consultative group and the community liaison committee.  The consultative group is made up of all stakeholders on the project and meets once a quarter.  The community liaison committee is made up of all community representatives who are involved with the project and has a more local focus.  It also includes representatives from the HSE, DIT, local garda&iacute; and the city council.  It meets once a month to discuss any current issues.</p><p>The newly appointed board, all of whom, bar one, I have met, has a wide range of competencies and a deep knowledge of key stakeholders.  As chairperson I will seek to facilitate the board to the greatest extent possible to deploy this expertise and experience to progress the project over the next three years.  The agency has a highly qualified and motivated staff.  An important role for the chairperson and the board will be to keep the strategy under review, as appropriate; maintain the direction of the project; support the executive in implementing the strategy and ensure accountability for the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the agency in getting this important work advanced as quickly as possible.</p><p> I approach the job with humility and an openness to learn from the experience and expertise of all those involved in the project to date.  This is combined with a firm purpose to maintain the momentum of the project, building on the robust physical and strategic planning framework in place, the strong relationships with key stakeholders and the expertise and experience at board and executive level.  As chairperson I will call on my experience of the education sector during my time as an assistant secretary in the Department of Education and Skills, coupled with subsequent experience in a number of senior positions in the Dublin Airport Authority during a time of major infrastructural transformation, and service on boards in Ireland and overseas.  </p><p> This is a wonderful project that will provide 73 acres of integrated public facilities, a major educational, health and community resource that will serve Ireland well into this century and beyond.  It is now at a critical juncture, with a lot of major construction yet to commence.  It is important that as we approach the ten year anniversary of the agency, the vision set out at the beginning continues to be realised.  It would be a key goal for me as chairperson to ensure this vision is progressed significantly over the next three years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#D00200"><p>I join with the Chairman in welcoming Mr. Cussen to this meeting.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in his new role and to thank him for his overview of where the project currently stands.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Cussen would outline if a timeframe has been set for his tenure as chairman of the agency and, if not, his desired tenure in that regard?  On the work remaining to be done, which is very substantial, in Mr. Cussen's view how many years will it take for the educational part of the project, in terms of the relocation of the DITs and students on to the new campus, to be completed?  He might also outline the position in regard to the health and community aspects of the project and say whether in his view there has been sufficient commitment in relation to the budget that will be required in terms of delivery of the project?  </p> <p>  I again wish Mr. Cussen well in his work on what is a very exciting project, which is radical in terms of the amalgamation of the DIT colleges and the delivery of a hub in the area concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#D00300"><p>I reiterate Deputy McConalogue's remarks and wish Mr. Cussen well in his appointment.  My only question for Mr. Cussen is in regard to one of the upcoming projects, namely, the primary school.  I understand an Educate Together primary school has been earmarked for the site, which initially was to be a 16 classroom school but has now been increased to a 24 classroom school.  There is considerable discomfort among some parents in regard to how this will impact on other schools in the area.  According to some of the parents to whom I spoke about this issue this morning, there was very little consultation with them on this increase in the size of the school.  Given Mr. Cussen's reference in his opening remarks to the local community being one of the key stakeholders, on what basis was that decision made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1031" speakername="Michael Conaghan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#D00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Cussen.  This is probably one of the most exciting educational projects of our time.  Its potential is still hidden.  The work of the old institutions that sat on the site, rather than being cast aside, is being built on to develop programmes of work to address the challenges of this century.  The old vocational education committee structure founded in the 19th century was very innovative in terms of address of the challenges of the industrial revolution and the educational responses to it in terms of training people and bringing them to new realms of skills.  As I said, this is the most exciting project to come on stream in a very long time.  I wish it every success.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity provided by this meeting to discuss the liaisons between the old and the new, old skills, new skills and so on.  It breaks down all the old barriers of class and academic versus technological expertise.  It is a significant project which must be supported.  We must do all we can in terms of funding and so on to ensure it is a success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#D00500"><p>I welcome Mr. Cussen.  As outlined by him this project is without doubt one of the most exciting this country will see for many years to come.  I hope Mr. Cussen will forgive my impertinence but we are in public session and I believe the public has a right to know a little more about Mr. Cussen the man.</p> <p>  I am aware of Mr. Cussen's former position in the Department of Education and Skills.  I know also about his involvement in the Dublin Airport Authority project, which was a major construction project.  I note Mr. Cussen's reference to his membership of boards both in Ireland and overseas.  This project is unique in so far as it brings together a number of different Departments within the government structure, namely, the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Justice and Equality and the community, which is exciting.  However, as Mr. Cussen will be aware, Departments do not often get on well together.  As chairman of the agency, Mr. Cussen will have to deal with many barriers in that regard and find ways to deal around them.  As I said, I think the public has a right to know a little more about Mr. Cussen the man.  I would appreciate if Mr. Cussen would address those issues.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#D00600"><p>I am interested in hearing Mr. Cussen's response to Deputy O'Brien's question.  I do not know anything about the local issues surrounding this project but I am familiar with similar tensions in my own community in the context of schools competing with each other.  Often the schools that lose out are the ones that do the most for the disadvantaged.  I do not know if that is the case in this situation.</p> <p>  The Oireachtas Library service produced a paper on schools, in which it examined an issue previously examined by this committee, namely, school choice and segregation.  The document produced by the Library service referenced an ESRI study of 2012 which found that the people who are most likely to exercise choice are people who are in the professional classes and middle class and that they are more likely to choose multi-denominational schools.  Another aspect of the study was that emigrants are more likely to choose multi-denominationl schools, except when controlled for class and socioeconomic background.</p><p>I was employed initially by the vocational education committee, and was deployed to the DIT but when the DIT became a distinct body separate from the VEC, I was no longer linked to the VEC.</p><p> The DIT always had a strong relationship with the State education sector and the vocational education committees, now the education and training boards.  I was surprised in the case in question that it would be an Educate Together school.  We have great Educate Together schools in my constituency.  I think the agency needs to be aware that what matters to people locally is those enrolling in the school.  Are the most disadvantaged people from the local community enrolling in the school?  How does the socioeconomic background of pupils compare with those of other schools in the area?  One does not want to end up competing unfairly with other schools.  I know this is not exactly Mr. Cussen's area but as part of the whole overall project, Deputy O'Brien has raised an important issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#E00200"><p>I know the three Educate Together schools that opened this year are under the patronage of different bodies.  One is under an education and training board, another is under the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS and the third is under the Joint Managerial Body, JMB.  I do not think Educate Together can be patrons <i>per se </i>of a given school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#E00300"><p>Educate Together can be patrons in its own right, but it is starting to work in partnership with other agencies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Cussen" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#E00400"><p>I will try to deal with all the points briefly, and if members think I have dealt with an issue too briefly, including the important question of who I am, they should come back in.  I will deal with the issues in the sequence in which they were raised and will come back to that important point made at the end.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about the term of my tenure.  As I understand it the tenure, subject to the outcome of today's proceedings, is three years.</p> <p>  On the question of how long it will take to complete the project, there are some issues, including a significant legal case which is before the courts on the construction of the two quads I mentioned.  Subject to that being built within a reasonable period, it is planned to have 10,000 students on the campus in 2018.  The figure of 10,000 is about half the DIT student population, including full-time and part-time students.  By 2020, the business and other schools could be in place, but Bolton Street and other issues will arise.  Bolton Street is quite close to the site, there may be issues on how it will be dealt with and it may be possible to integrate it into the development.  I am speculating out loud but I do not have the detailed knowledge.  One would hope that in the early 2020s that most of DIT would be located on that campus.</p> <p>  I am not aware of a problem with funding but Deputy McConalogue might well say to me that I will quickly become aware of one in the sense that funding is always an issue.  In this case, however, which everybody has mentioned is an exciting project, DIT has great potential to use public private partnerships and other mechanisms to fund the buildings without compromising in any way the integrity of the project.  For example, planning permission was granted for the two quads in July 2015, which are public private partnerships and will go ahead as there is no upfront capital outlay by DIT and the rent over a number of years will pay for it.  Likewise in the strategic development zone there is a plan to provide 2,100 beds in student accommodation, which also can be structured financially in a way which minimises the capital call on the State because of the ability to draw in revenue.  This is not unfair or improper revenue but is revenue generated from what students pay for accommodation.  I hope that for a relatively modest level of capital in total a significant return can be generated because of the ability to fund the project in different ways from public private partnerships or direct revenue from students and so on.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien raised the question of the primary school, which I know is a significant issue for the local community, particularly the proposal to go from 16 to 24 classrooms.  I note the points raised by the Chairman about choice, the impact on other schools and the social background of people who choose to go to one kind of school as opposed to another.  As I understand it, the school is on the Grangegorman site.  It has been assessed by the Department of Education and Skills and the preferred option in terms of the overall facilities and services that can be provided is for a 24-classroom school.  I am very conscious, even from my brief period in the area, that there is very significant concern locally about the impact, especially on the other local schools and how it might affect the existing pattern of schooling in the area, as mentioned by the Chairman and Deputy O'Brien.  The proposed change in size from 16 classrooms to 24 classroom must go through the planning process.  I think as part of that process there will be further consultation with the local community and further investigation of the types of issues raised by members and what the actual impact will be.</p></speech>

I am afraid that I cannot say much more at this time as I am not sufficiently familiar with it.  What I know, and the Deputy is quite right to point out the need for consultation, is that it clearly requires more consultation and more explanation of how the project will work and why it is going a particular way in the context of the planning application.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Conaghan's views.  To respond to Senator Craughwell, I will outline my background.  I was in the then Department of Education and Science from 1990 to 1998 as an assistant secretary in charge of higher education, further education, the institutes of technology, which are part of higher education, the European Structural Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the EU Presidency.  I was also involved in two major White Papers, in 1992 when the then Minister was the late Seamus Brennan and a subsequent White Paper when Ms Niamh Bhreathnach was Minister.  At that time I gained a great deal of understanding about the DIT and its deep links with Dublin city in particular.  One of the jobs I had at that time, with the Minister, was to bring in the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 which set out the objective of bringing the DIT colleges into one entity.</p><p>There was going to be a major problem because the institutions being brought together were different even though they nominally go under one name.  What I did get from that was a deep understanding of how DIT existed in Dublin city.  Without any disrespect to the universities and others, it was very anchored in the city.  In particular, the apprenticeship programme had a huge impact over many years.  It was one of those very pleasant occasions when men and women returned from the championships with many gold medals.  They were really performing at the upper end.  There was a particular anchoring there.  It is a particular strength of DIT.  I have always had the view that there has probably been too much desire for all educational institutions to become universities.  I know there is a process in place with DIT and other institutes of technology which moved in that direction.  It must go through a process, and it is excellent.  However, the anchoring of an institution - the Deputy mentioned the Industrial Revolution and other things - is a very important feature of DIT as I understood it at the time.  It involves bringing the institutions together in one location and maintaining that kind of environment, particularly when it is anchored in one place and interacts with the local city community in a modern context.  It is very important not to lose that.  I can return to this issue if the Deputy has any other questions.  </p><p> Will I deal with Senator Craughwell's issue about who I am and what-----</p></speech>

He mentioned the legal issue that he cannot discuss.  As we bring these various groupings together, there is always a tendency to rush towards the High Court to resolve problems.

I was looking for experience in that area.</p></speech>

I recognise the absolute importance of working together with a consensus approach.  That would be my personal preference.  I would balance that with the belief that at certain times you just have to get ahead and get things done, but that is not about steamrolling over people; it is about explaining to people in the structures that are there.  You go through a decent process and genuinely listen to what they have to say.  Eventually, you may have to say that we cannot deal with everything but on this occasion we dealt with the following, and move on.  There will be future issues whereby other things might happen.  It is like political work.  You win some, you lose some.</p> <p>  The reason I mentioned the Green Paper and the White Paper was because of a critical aspect in which I was very closely involved, along with other officials from the Department, and the issue on which responsibility fell to me to lead the process was a thing that none of the members probably remember.  This was the national education convention, which was held in Dublin Castle as long ago as 1993.  Every time I mention it, I know how old I am getting.  It lasted for a week and was not a major new thing on the landscape.  The purpose was a firm wish of mine to bring teachers, parents, the managerial bodies and everybody involved in education together to sit around a table like this.  One would say it was a trite observation that relates to the importance of these consultative bodies, but it is amazing how people say different things when they must say them in front of partners.  They are not being dishonest, but if a teacher says something about parents, he or she must balance it better.  It is not that it is wrong, but when I was in the Department of Education, I would sometimes say to myself "Sure they just come in here and give out about someone else, then they go and we have the problems.  Why don't you give out to the people directly, more or less?".  It did lead to some real progress.  I am not for a moment saying that people do not retain their entrenched positions as a result of this, but one of my strong feelings is that there needs to be more consultation.  </p> <p>  I am also on the board of Crosscare, a Dublin diocesan charity that works in large areas of the inner city in Dublin.  The main people who do the work are those on the ground.  It does give you a sense of the key issues that are facing people.  I was chairperson of a secondary school for three years.  God knows, there was a lot of consensus building in that.  I thought it was probably the toughest job ever.  There was no chance of getting anyone to agree on anything.</p></speech>

It is a flagship project.  I first heard about it when I was on Dublin City Council.  I remember Mr. John Fitzgerald being appointed as chairman of the Grangegorman Development Agency.  It is a brilliant location because it ticks all the boxes relating to education, health and community.  Deputy Conaghan and I have sat on many regeneration boards, some of which did not work out.  The most important thing for any regeneration is information and compromise, because if you cannot combine these you will never get anything done.  A willingness to bring communities on board and to work with the people who live in the area is a major factor in the regeneration of any site, be it large or small.</p> <p>  Mr. Cussen spoke about student accommodation in his opening remarks.  I live beside Inchicore College of Further Education.  Deputy Conaghan taught there for many years.  I know the difficulty a lot of students have in trying to find accommodation when they come up from the country, so I am glad to hear about the student accommodation.  Mr. Cussen mentioned a figure of about 10,000, which is a lot of students.  If I heard him correctly, he spoke about 2,500 students being located on the site.  This is one of the main pressure points of any education system, particularly on a site where you have to put so many students together.  Perhaps something else should be added, looking at the population and the number of young people going back to education.  Accommodation is a major factor in any regeneration.</p> <p>  I have listened to what has been said.  For me, regeneration is about the people who live around the site as well.  I am glad to hear that people from the community are already involved in the construction and I hope this continues into the future.  With any new site - I am talking about the development of the national children's hospital, where I live - there are expectations around development.  It brings a new excitement to young people about being able to get involved in health and helps them to look at other avenues they may never have thought about previously.  When I look at the area I represent in the north inner city, it is similar.  There are many people who may not have had the education they needed to advance into work and education.  All of that seems to be changing.  This must be part and parcel of a new development.</p> <p>  I will finish off with the topic of new schools versus old schools versus DEIS schools.  It is something I have spoken about numerous times here and locally.  Parents have a choice to send their children where they wish.  In the changing society in which we live, where not everybody is channelled through religious schools, there is a huge need for Educate Together schools across every community.  The question of whether this should take away from the local DEIS schools or primary schools is another issue.  I have been criticised for saying this, but I would not be a politician if I were not criticised.</p><p>My children went to a school with nearly 700 students but that school now has 243 children in it.  That is not because the teachers or the school building has changed but because it was designated as a DEIS school.  I say that with my hand on heart.  It segregates children.  Schools will then only take pupils from a certain area, which ruins education for an entire community.  In my time, when my children went to the local school, children came from all across the parish but now in the DEIS schools in my area, children are segregated from where they come from.  That is the biggest problem about a DEIS school.  I know it may not relate to what Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has said but we must be very sensitive in building new schools, whether they are Educate Together facilities or whatever.  We must be sensitive as we must consider the population mix in trying to help.</p><p> I have always said this and I will keep saying it.  Children play together on the street but they are not educated together, which is a very sad reflection on how DEIS schools reflect on communities, especially where I live.  I know I have gone a bit off the business but it is nice to meet the witness.  I thank him for coming before the committee.</p></speech>

Will he comment on whether that should be longer or if it is an appropriate amount of time?  This is the second time we have had a session to appoint a chairperson to the agency in this D&aacute;il term.  It strikes me that three years could be quite short in a project like this where continuity in a process involving different partners and the role of the chairman in pulling it together and driving it forward is important.</p> <p>  There is a wider issue.  This is a tremendous project and it is very exciting.  On 21 October 2015, Marty McFly and Doc Brown went back to the future in the film of the same name.  I wonder what third level education will look like 20 or 25 years from now, particularly with regard to infrastructure and the campus on which we will place 20,000 people.  That is very much needed today but how will it look in 20 or 25 years?  Will that big campus model be the same?  The witness may not be able to answer but it is interesting.</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting but I heard most of the contributions, including that of Mr. Cussen, on the monitor.  Like others, I welcome him and wish him well in what is to be a very exciting project.  Others have referred to the amalgamation of a number of institutes of technology and I represent a community that is very fortunate to have the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, on its doorstep.  It is held in very high regard within the community because it has transformed educational opportunities in an area which is almost exclusively working class.  I listened to Deputy Catherine Byrne speak about discrimination in education but all of us in the room know that if we were to base the percentage of those who participate in third level education in this country on those from working-class communities alone, the percentage would collapse.  In the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, for example, one in every five students is local but before it opened, the number of children from working-class families attending third level education would have been in single digits.  It has done wonderful work and there is a great staff, which accounts for the progress that it has made.  The institute of technology in our community brings a sense of pride, as it has changed the opportunities available.  People are loyal to it.</p> <p>  It is one of the colleges, along with Blanchardstown, that will be part of the project under the witness's domain.  Within the college and outside it - I include myself in that sphere - there is concern about the identity of our institute being eroded.  There is a strong feeling in that regard.  That is understandable and it is the nature of human beings that any sort of change tends to lead to instinctive concern - I do not want to say "fright" - and we can see that in political life.  The concern about retaining identity and the name is both within and outside the college.  There is also concern about those who work in the college and any threat to their employment.  I understand that is not an issue but it has been raised by a number of people within the college.</p></speech>

That may not be within the witness's remit although there is probably an overlap.  It would great to hear anything he has to say about that issue and the other questions.</p></speech>

There is a good programme of work and if we can get that much done in three years, we would do a good job.  Certainly the work will not be done in three years - far from it if there will be 10,000 students - but without sounding too precious, I view jobs like this as a stewardship and as a personal issue.  One is given responsibility for a period, which in this case is three years, and we look to do the best we can with it.  I mean this in the sense of progressing the project as much as possible and laying a solid foundation for the future for whoever is following.</p> <p>  I will come back to the question about "Back to the Future" because I really do not know the answer.  With regard to Deputy Byrne's question, student accommodation on the site is a very important aspect and there has already been a very significant study done by a consultancy firm working with Grangegorman to examine the impact of students, the way they will integrate and benefit the area and potential problems that sometimes are not as welcome with students.  Suffice it to say, there is much advance planning already going into the social and other impact of students, mainly positive but also with some of the negatives.  The initial plan is there will be 650 students on site by approximately 2018 and after that subsequent blocks will be built, bringing the number to approximately 2,000.  It would not come all at once and there would be a process of adjustment.</p> <p>  Employment opportunities are very important and it is vital to take the chance to get local people employed.  The single biggest problem very often is getting a job, getting started and gaining experience.  The process can go well after that once experience is gained, and this could be significant for a local area.  Deputy Byrne commented on DEIS and other newer schools, referring to educational opportunities.  I agree completely with the Deputy and without making any comment on the specifics of DEIS schools versus other schools, it is very bad for children's development if they get a sense that they are being stigmatised.  This might be in them thinking in some ways that they are in a place that is not as good as where somebody else is.  Very often children can rebel and not bother with the system because the idea is it is for so-called toffee-nosed fellows or girls somewhere else.  That is a perception and I do not mean pupils are toffee-nosed in any school.  I am very interested in the work being done by the labour and learning forum.</p><p>A huge educational institution is being established there now and we need to try to maximise the potential to get children and adults from that neighbourhood to take a different view of education.  Not only should they be encouraged to take a different view but they should be given options and opportunities to avail of the benefits of it.  In that way, we could build up confidence in the institution.  If people remain outside of it, we will never build up confidence.  We must get them involved in it.  Some achievement leads to more achievement. It is critical that people get their foot on the rung of the ladder so that they can then make more progress, rather than continually feel they are excluded.</p><p> Deputy Maloney raised important points about the IT in Tallaght.  That is outside of my remit.  I am not in the Department of Education and Skills or involved in the process of bringing DIT and IT Tallaght and Blanchardstown together.  I sympathise with the point made.  When I was in the Department, creating the institutes of technology in their current form - I was involved with the VECs before that over many years - I fully understood the importance of local participation and identification with an institution.  The fact it is on their doorstep leads people who would not have thought of doing so previously to attend the institution.   </p><p> Deputy Byrne made the point that it is a long way to Belfield from the north side of the city.  I go to England frequently, but I have a brother who, much to my shock, has never been outside of Limerick, even outside of his own small area in Limerick.  It is amazing how we take it for granted people move around.  One of my colleagues from Grangegorman said to me there are people who see moving across the river as a major issue, because they live very much within their community.  More power to them, there is nothing wrong with that.  The point about the importance of the locality therefore is significant in terms of local identification.  This is balanced against the need to create higher education institutions that meet all the international standards and benefit students in that way.  The institutions need to be a bit larger in the context of research and teaching quality and all of that.  Hopefully, the amalgamation process will find a way to blend both so that we get local involvement and identification along with the benefits of a larger, central structure.</p><p> The Chairman made a point about workers.  My previous involvement in that regard relates to when people were moving from VECs to ITs and the significant negotiation on that move.  I do not think any jobs were lost and ultimately we achieved a successful, negotiated outcome to the changing conditions, moving from one employer to another, that is, moving from a VEC employer to a board of an institution of technology.</p></speech>

The only fear of the technological university staff is that Grangegorman will become the centre for levels 7, 8 and 9 and they will be relegated to dealing with lower levels.  However, I doubt Mr. Cussen's office can do much about that.</p></speech>

While I appreciate the point being made, it would be futile for me to comment on it further.  However, I appreciate and understand the point being made.  Certainly, the VECs would have made a similar point in the early 1990s, that they were losing the sense of locality to colleges which were somewhat more aggregated.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mobile telephones should be switched off completely or switched to airplane or flight mode because they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  This part of our meeting is being broadcast live on UPC channel 207, eVision channel 504 and Sky channel 574. </p><p>Today we are looking at the role, remit and activities of the Ombudsman for Children in regard to schools and their boards of management.  Complaints in regard to schools are made in the first instance to a school or board of management.</p><p>However, a person under the age of 18 years or an adult, on behalf of such a person, may, in certain cases if they are unhappy with the response to such a complaint, make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p> To help us with our discussion on this topic I welcome Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, who is accompanied by his officials, Mr. Padraig Walsh, Dr. Karen McAuley and Ms Nuala Ward.  Dr. Muldoon will discuss his role in regard to schools and their boards of management.  I congratulate him on his recent appointment and invite him to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#J00200"><p>I realise the presentation I submitted to the committee was probably too long so I will not read it all but will shorten it for the purposes of the meeting.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to meet the committee today.  After working for nearly 20 years as a psychologist, the majority of it spent in the area of child protection, and two and a half years as director of investigations at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, I was deeply honoured to be chosen as Ombudsman for Children.  I received my warrant of appointment from President Higgins in February of this year and I welcome the opportunity to make my first appearance in front of this committee to discuss the role and functions of my office.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and monitor the rights of children in Ireland.  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  The one that may be most familiar to the members of the committee is my statutory function to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children in regard to the administrative actions, or inaction, of public bodies that have had, or may have had, an adverse effect on the child or children concerned.  In carrying out this function, my office observes fundamental ombudsman principles: my office is independent and impartial, acting neither as an advocate for the child nor as an adversary of the public body complained against; we respect local complaints procedures and seek at all times to promote the resolution of complaints at a local level; and we endeavour to achieve systemic change through our complaints and investigations function by considering the root causes of complaints we receive.<br/><br/>My investigatory remit, as provided for under the Ombudsman for Children Act, also comprises two unique elements, which reflect two fundamental children&rsquo;s rights principles as recognised under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  First, in the performance of my complaints-handling function, I am obliged to have regard to the best interests of the child concerned.  Second, I am obliged, in so far as practicable, to give due to consideration to the wishes of the child, in accordance with her or his age and understanding.  In this regard, my office has developed considerable expertise in engaging directly with children and young people when examining complaints made by them or on their behalf.<br/><br/>In addition to examining and investigating complaints, I have a complementary statutory remit, which is broadly concerned with promoting and monitoring the rights and welfare of children.  The Oireachtas conferred a range of functions on the Ombudsman for Children in this regard under section 7 of the 2002 Act.  These positive obligations include encouraging public bodies to develop policies, practices and procedures which are designed to promote children&rsquo;s rights and welfare; advising any Minister on matters relating to the rights and welfare of children, including relevant developments in legislation and public policy; consulting with children and highlighting issues relating to their rights and welfare that are of concern to children themselves; and promoting awareness among members of the public, including children, of matters relating to children&rsquo;s rights, including the principles and provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<br/><br/>In respect of the functions of the office to advise on legislation and public policy, members of the committee will be aware that the office has provided independent advice on a wide range of legislation affecting children since its establishment in 2004.  Given that matters concerning education are a key focus for the work of the committee, I will highlight that the office provided advice on the then General Scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013. <br/><br/>Through our rights education programme, the office has engaged with primary and post-primary schools throughout the country and facilitated thousands of children and young people to explore and develop their understanding of children&rsquo;s rights.  In addition, we have developed a seminar programme for postgraduate students pursuing qualifications in social work, social care, education, and child protection and welfare, in which hundreds of students from universities and ITs in different parts of the country have participated.<br/><br/>The office&rsquo;s different functions inform and support each other.  Work undertaken in accordance with one particular statutory function may trigger complementary work under a different function.  Similarly, where there is an obstacle to tackling a children&rsquo;s rights issue &ndash; due to an exclusion to the Ombudsman for Children's Office investigatory remit, for example &ndash; we can use another function to address the problem.  This is what we did in regard to St. Patrick's Institution where we engaged the young people about how they found the place and the concerns they had.  This was done when the Office of the Ombudsman for Children had no investigatory remit, prior to July 2012.  My intention in setting out this example is to demonstrate that a broad mandate that blends different functions can offer a range of options to address children&rsquo;s rights issues; this is a very important aspect of the strong and robust mandate that the Oireachtas has given my office.<br/><br/>My office is handling approximately 1,600 complaints a year and while we saw a slight fall, of 5%, in the number of complaints received in 2014 over 2013, we still dealt with 9% more complaints than two years ago.  The majority of complaints last year were in regard to education, 47%, and the next most significant proportion of complaints received related to family support, care and protection, 25%, that is, the area for which the Child and Family Agency has a remit.  The vast majority of complaints, 75%, are brought by parents on behalf of their children.<br/><br/>The complaints received range in levels of complexity and we maintain our focus on seeking to resolve each one within the local procedures mechanism and as quickly as possible.  It is important to realise that the office uses various mechanisms to resolve issues before escalating to a full investigation.  In regard to education complaints, my team has engaged with parents, children, principals, boards of management and patrons throughout the country in various ways to assist both parties move forward to resolve matters in the best interest of children.  However, when the issues raised are of a more complicated nature these may be more difficult to resolve locally and, therefore, could require a full investigation to achieve a resolution.  Examples of issues, from all areas, not just education, we have investigated previously include the handling of child protection notifications by a social work area; the refusal of a section 10 payment to a family; access to support for a preschool child with special needs in the early childhood care and education scheme; resource allocation for children with special needs; and the admission policy within a school.<br/><br/>As evidenced above, education accounted for the highest proportion of complaints received in 2014 and that has been the case for many years.  I have looked especially closely at the issues and outcomes in this regard.  It is clear to me that the concerns raised consistently, by my office, over the years in regard to the complaints architecture within education have not been heeded.  To date, the Education Act 1998 still represents the key legislative framework in which we seek to determine how schools operate.  Successive governments have failed to implement fully the provisions of section 28 of that Act which sets out how grievances and concerns of a student may be dealt with and remedied.  Part V of the Teaching Council Act 2001 is designed to examine teachers' fitness to practice and this too is still to be commenced, meaning that two major elements of the complaint structure for the general public are only available in theory.<br/><br/>Parents are entitled to expect to be able to raise concerns about how their children are being taught and to assume there is a standardised complaints system within all schools, however neither of those is available to them at present.  While the Office of the Ombudsman for Children was set up with the expectation that it would be one part of the complaints landscape in regard to schools, it has <i>de facto</i>become the only element available to many parents.  That is not good enough.  I urge this committee to seek to have both of those missing elements brought into being as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The top three issues in respect of complaints received by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children are first, the handling of allegations of inappropriate professional conduct - I have dealt with this in a previous paragraph in regard to commencing Part V of the Teacher Council 2001; second, the handling of bullying - the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has engaged via our education and participation unit with children and young people around this issue to determine their views on how it happens and what needs to be done to stop it.  This resulted in the publication of our Dealing with Bullying in Schools: A Consultation with Children and Young People in 2013 which fed into the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools, issued by the Department of Education and Skills later that year.  While I welcome the introduction by the Department of Education and Skills of new anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools, I have concerns regarding the monitoring of implementation of the procedures in schools.  It would appear that no agency is tasked with examining schools&rsquo; annual reviews or any trends or anomalies that may emerge from them.  As a result it is not clear how the State will fully track progress at a national level in regard to how different forms of bullying are being tackled in schools.  It is for this reason I have recommended in my report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, of April 2015 that the State should build on the monitoring framework contained in those procedures by examining the annual reviews by schools of their implementation of the procedures.  For my part my office will continue to promote positive communication within schools and between parents and schools when we are dealing with such complaints.<br/><br/>The third issue is complaint handling, decisions and policy within schools.  As stated previously, the complaint handling structures in the education sector are incomplete.  It was originally envisaged that in order to bring about higher standards and consistency in schools, and complaints handling lacked practice, the Minister for Education and Skills would prescribe procedures for schools to deal with grievances raised by students or their parents, as well as the remedial action to be taken in response to those grievances.</p><p>These provisions never came into operation.  Thus, in my recent report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, I included a recommendation that the State "ensure that a comprehensive and consistent complaints handling framework is put in place in the education sector".</p><p> Through the course of its examination of complaints in the education sector, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has formed the view that the degree of autonomy afforded to Irish schools has operated in such a way that the State has not been able to exercise responsibility and oversight in the manner required of it as a duty bearer under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The office has observed this systemic problem in investigations relating to admissions and child protection, for example.  For this reason, in my alternative report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in April of this year, I recommended that the State "recalibrate the balance between schools' autonomy and oversight by Central Government in order to ensure that the State assumes an appropriate level of responsibility for advancing and protecting children's rights within the education system".</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  I will be pleased to address any queries they have on these or other aspects of my role and functions as Ombudsman for Children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#K00300"><p>I welcome the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, and his team and thank them for making themselves available.  I congratulate Dr. Muldoon on his promotion since I last spoke to him in his office.  He will be aware of my strong views on his role with respect to schools and their boards of management.  I remind colleagues that it was this week 12 months ago that the joint committee discussed this issue with departmental officials, trade union representatives and other stakeholders.  Members were aghast at that meeting when they learned from officials that neither the Department nor the Minister has any role or function in addressing parents' complaints or grievances arising from decisions taken by school boards of management.  Most members will recall that this point was clarified in stark terms by departmental officials at the meeting.</p><p>As a result of the meeting last October, I published legislation seeking to extend the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to cover issues and grievances held by parents, teachers and other school staff.  There is no avenue for appeal when grievances arise.  This morning, I introduced First Stage of a Bill proposing to amend the Education Act.  I noted that one has a right of appeal when one is given a parking ticket, whereas there are no mechanisms in place to deal with grievances that arise from decisions taken by school boards and authorities in the education sector.  These decisions affect our single greatest resource, namely, our children, yet they are not subject to any appeal mechanism when people have grievances about them.  </p><p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his comprehensive opening statement.  He quickly got to the nub of the issue when he admitted that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is the only show in town in this matter as no other avenues of appeal are available.  With respect to his office, however, the problem has always been that it does not have powers of compulsion or direction.  It can encourage and suggest but it does not have powers to direct or compel.  For this reason, I am seeking the establishment of a dedicated education ombudsman who would have the powers to direct schools to behave in accordance with natural laws and justice.  It is to our great shame that we do not have such a mechanism in place in 2015, despite a budget of &euro;8.2 billion being provided for education every year.  </p><p>It suits the Department of Education and Skills not to have an ombudsman for education as the current position reflects the wishes of many of the vested interests in education.  My Bill will receive greater opposition than anything else I will do because it upsets the <i>status quo</i>and vested interests.  It suits people to have a closed shop in which boards of management say and do what they like without anyone being able to hold them to account.  We saw distasteful and incorrect practices in Rehab and other boards.  I hold the Ombudsman for Children in high regard and I compliment his office on the work it does for a group of children who are very close and dear to my heart because I have the privilege of sharing my home with some of them.  I refer to children in State care.  The Ombudsman for Children has blazed a trail in highlighting this issue which is one that nobody wants to speak about or address.  I commend his office on taking on that issue and numerous other issues.  </p><p>The annual report of the Ombudsman for Children refers to the case of a pregnant teenage girl whose application to be enrolled at a local school was refused because of her pregnancy.  After having her baby, the school refused again to enrol her because its ethos precluded it from educating a single mother.  These decisions are an indictment of all of us.  We should hang our heads in shame that a publicly-funded school made such a decision.  As Dr. Muldoon noted, the school which refused a pregnant girl an education and subsequently refused her entry again when she became a young mother did not have a board of management.  A single person acts as its owner.  When the Office of the Ombudsman for Children contacted the Department on the matter of policy direction for schools, it found that the Department does not have legal  powers to instruct individuals to follow a particular course of action with regard to individual complaints, despite being the paymaster.  This is an appalling scenario.  Who is in charge of the education sector when something goes wrong?  While I accept that a great deal of good is being done in education, someone must take responsibility when things go wrong.  There are many aggrieved parents. </p><p>In fairness to the Ombudsman for Children's office, it did what it could.  For example, it wrote to the school seeking paperwork on the case to which I referred.  The school did not comply with this request and subsequently did not engage when the office sought a meeting.  It also refused its request that it apologise to the girl in question and made no effort with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to rectify the matter.  I am appalled by this case.</p><p>This example shows that, unfortunately, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children does not have the powers needed to direct a school to have an enrolment policy which treats people in a natural, open and just manner.  The absence of such a policy is the reason I am determined to see the introduction of an ombudsman for education which would have real teeth and powers to get to the nub of this issue and be able to compel rather than encourage schools to do the right thing.  I do not mean in any way to be derogatory towards the role of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children but if a parent were to contact with me a grievance, I would be more inclined to advise him or her to ring Joe Duffy than to contact the Ombudsman for Children.  I am not being facetious when I say this but the Dr. Muldoon does not have powers to compel or direct people who are misbehaving to behave.  All he can do is suggest and recommend.  If a parent complains on &quot;Liveline&quot;, he or she may or may not get more satisfaction.  That is my difficulty.</p><p>I appreciate the number of references Dr. Muldoon made to the failure to heed concerns his office had consistently made over the years regarding the complaints architecture in education.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a budget of &euro;1.2 billion, is subject to the Garda Inspectorate, Policing Authority and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  How many of us interact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  We may do so once or twice in a lifetime but parents interact with the education system daily without having available to them any means or vehicle to have a complaint addressed.  While the Ombudsman for Children may accept a complaint, he does not have the power to compel people to do the right thing. </p><p>Does the Ombudsman for Children support my proposal for the establishment of an ombudsman for education?  Will he quantify the number of complaints his office has received since its inception in 2004 that related specifically to educational matters and the number of these which were subsequently investigated?</p><p>I thank the Chairman for showing such latitude.</p></speech>

This is an issue he has been trying to resolve for years and he has been a very vocal advocate for extending the powers of the ombudsman.  The Bill he published today provides for the establishment of an education ombudsman.</p> <p>  We also need to remember that there is legislation in place which allows schools to discriminate on the basis of religious ethos - for example, if someone is a single mother.  If we are to be serious about it, while establishing an education ombudsman is part of the solution, we also need to remove the discriminatory legislation that remains on the Statute Book.  That is how the Department can start to rectify this issue.  If this legislation did not exist, the school in question would not have been able to deny that single mother a place based on its ethos.  That is not to take away from the proposals of Deputy Daly.  There is still a need for an education ombudsman and I fully support the proposal.  There are other areas that we also need to look at; the matter is not only relevant in this area.  We have had a lot of discussion about enrolment policies and people not being allowed into over-prescribed schools based on religion, and again, it is down to pieces of legislation which have absolutely no place on the Statute Book in this day and age.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#L00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and join in congratulating Dr. Muldoon on his appointment as Ombudsman for Children.</p> <p>  There is undoubtedly an issue regarding oversight of our school system and the mechanisms for appeal and redress that are available to those who are unhappy with the decisions of boards of management.  It is certainly long past time - Dr. Muldoon referred to this in his comments - that systems were put in place at Department level to deal with that.  </p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing Dr. Muldoon's response to the suggestion put forward by Deputy Daly on the need for a specific education ombudsman.  What does he believe might be the differences between the role of the proposed education ombudsman and that of the Ombudsman for Children?  Would Dr. Muldoon welcome the powers in his own office?  Does he feel his own office would have the capacity to deal with what Deputy Daly is proposing?</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills, as the paymaster and the body which sets policy and, in theory, runs the education system, must actually put in place appropriate appeals mechanisms for those who are unhappy with decisions that boards of management or schools might make.  Ultimately, an ombudsman is the final recourse after appropriate appeals have been made, and should certainly not be the first recourse.  There are definitely levels missing from the process at the moment.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to embrace this.  Currently the choice is either to go to Dr. Muldoon, who can comment on matters but does not have binding powers, or to go to the courts.  I do not think that is an acceptable recourse for ordinary parents who have their kids' education and interests at heart.  I would be interesting in hearing Dr. Muldoon's feedback on what needs to happen at the Department and on Deputy Daly's proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#L00400"><p>I add my congratulations to Dr. Muldoon on his appointment and thank him for coming in today.  I commend Deputy Daly on his very passionate contribution.  I wholeheartedly agree - as the song says, "You took the words right out of my mouth."  I know Deputy Daly was a teacher in a former life.  I think everybody across the education field would feel his frustration.  Some 47% of the cases the ombudsman deals with are education-related.  I have come across it as well.</p> <p>  Whom do schools answer to?  I have brought queries and complaints up the chain of command in instances when parents have gone to principals.  I know of one case in which several letters were completely ignored by a principal over the space of nine months.  I advised the parents to bring the matter to the attention to the board of management, which they did.  They got two communications from the board of management, both containing conflicting reports.  They were then told by the Department that they needed to take the matter to the religious order.  The bishop said "Sorry, that is not my remit; you need to go to the trustees of the school."  Parents are just chasing the whole time in these situations.  They went to the trustees of the school, who at first were very hesitant to meet with them.  The trustees agreed to meet, but in a public place, and then they came armed with other people.  Of course nothing the parents said was taken into consideration.  The trustees walked back out and totally backed the principal, having admitted that what had happened was wrong.  It left the parents not knowing what to do.  They did not want the matter to blow up into a major case.  They just walked away and said "Education system?  Forget it."  All I can say to those parents is that I completely agree because from the top down there is absolutely nobody to whom the schools will answer.  It is even the way the board of management is structured - if it is a religious school there will be representatives from the religious order and it is all very carefully done.  I totally agree that we need somebody to whom schools are completely answerable.  I am saying this as somebody who has been in the education profession, as a mother and as a public representative who has dealt with cases like the one I have described.</p> <p>  There is nothing more soul-destroying than for somebody to go through all the correct procedures, trying to get a better solution for our young people, only to have it thrown back in his or her face, or for someone to have the powers that be within a school turn around and say "We are not answerable to anybody.  We are not answerable to the Department or the Minister.  We do what we do ourselves."  If there is a grievance, it has a knock-on effect on pupils too.  If they see that nothing can be done for them, they tend then to go inside themselves.  We can have all the bullying policies we like but if something is not seen to be done those policies are futile.</p></speech>

There can be no doubt as to Deputy Daly's commitment.  As an educator and someone who managed a school himself, it is particularly poignant that he raised this matter today, and I am impressed by the way he spoke.  I could not support him more if I tried.  Deputy O'Brien is right, though.  We need to go further, because some of the legislation we have facilitates the type of nonsense that goes on in our education system.  We have here many people who have worked in the education system, including myself.  I certainly want enforceability of decisions.</p> <p>  There is a problem which I encountered this last year during the exam term.  The leaving certificate examination is the make-or-break point for a young person of 17, 18 or 19.</p><p>It can determine their future life, where they are going or where they are not going.  Sometimes we have requests for extra facilitation because a student has a particular diagnosis or whatever.  If such a request is refused, one must go through the appeals mechanism and work one's way up the line.  In some cases, the fault for any delay lies very much on the side of the student or parent for not raising the issue much earlier in the year.  Sometimes it is a case of tardiness on the part of the school in not driving the matter forward.  If the decision is that the requested facilities will not be provided, it may be too late for an appeals process to kick in.  Where there is doubt and a time constraint, we should favour the student, not the Department.  We should put the facilities and mechanisms in place to allow students to take the examination with whatever supports they or their professional advisers deem necessary.  If we afterwards find we made a mistake, it is a bit like hanging and one cannot go back and change it.  On the other hand, if we make a mistake by not providing the facilities that were, in fact, required, then we are in serious trouble.</p><p> On the question of the power of principals, I have a difficulty with a situation where the board of management has a very dominant principal and it is his or her ethos rather than the school's ethos that finds its way through the system.  For all intents and purposes, such principals become the gate blockers or gatekeepers who can prevent certain actions being taken.  I am not saying this happens all the time, but it does happen from time to time.  Judging by what I have heard today, Deputy Jim Daly will have no difficulty in getting his legislation through the Oireachtas.  At least I hope that will be the case.</p></speech>

What this case illustrates is that we really are a nation with two sets of standards.  We apply particular standards to one issue but all those nice principles go out the window in another area.  We must deal with those types of situations urgently.  One of the outcomes I see through Dr. Muldoon's office is that schools will be subjected to additional inspections.  We are all aware of cases where a board of management - or, in the case of the particular school to which I referred, a person acting as <i>de facto</i>board of management - can essentially run roughshod over the system.  I agree with Deputies Jim Daly and O'Brien that the funding agency which should be taking responsibility is the Department of Education and Skills.  We are pumping tens of thousands of euro into schools but one person can make a decision, which the board of management, if there is one, will uphold.  By the time the appeals process has been gone through, we have wasted the ombudsman's time and that of parents, legal advisers and all the other people involved.  It makes no sense that staff should be penalised by way of the imposition of more inspections because a board of management or an individual made a decision, as in this case, not to allow a young pregnant girl into the school.  What sort of a nonsense outcome is that and who thinks up such things?  It beggars belief that it goes on.</p><p>I agree with Deputy Jim Daly that for every outcome in the ombudsman's office, there should be some form of compellability to force the organisation or individuals concerned to do the right thing and, where they do not do so, there should be recourse to the courts.  I am not sure whether Deputy Jim Daly wants the proposed ombudsman for education to come in under the Ombudsman for Children or to have a separate office entirely.  He might clarify that for us.  In either case, the new ombudsman must have that compellability function, that is, the ability to bring these people before the law and force them to adopt the recommendation which, after all, the ombudsman's office is highly skilled and well tasked to make.</p></speech>

I was touched by Deputy Jim Daly's presentation.  My background is in primary and teacher education and I have always been intrigued by the fact that teachers are paid by the Department of Education and Skills but hired by boards of management.  Until we change the legislative structure underpinning that, we will not solve any of the issues we are discussing today.  Will Dr. Muldoon comment on that?  My experience is that boards of management are very autonomous but they are not, and should not be considered to be, infallible.  Let us face it, all of us who are paid from the public purse should be open to scrutiny.  I had a lot of experience dealing with admissions and cases where there is no school place available for a child.  Sometimes it is like dealing with a closed shop.</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Jim Daly's question, does Dr. Muldoon agree that we need a new ombudsman for education?  Or does he see his role, responsibilities and remit being extended to deal with that?  Dr. Muldoon described his office as an independent human rights institution whose function is to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children, particularly in respect of health and education matters.  I would like Dr. Muldoon to clarify the extend of his remit.  At this time, the parents of more than 100 children are very concerned about the alleged adverse effects of the HPV cervical cancer vaccine on their children's health.</p></speech>

In a similar vein, we have heard of cases where children have been misdiagnosed by a teacher or psychologist attaching to a school as being autistic when, in fact, they may more accurately be described as suffering a syndrome that is not yet named.

We do not have all of that information completely up to date but we are close.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nuala Ward" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#M01300"><p>I do not have the figures for 2004; we only brought the data for 2014.  It is very important for the key message to go out today that we are effective in managing complaints about education.  As Dr. Muldoon mentioned, in 2014, 47% of complaints to our office were to do with education.  It is important to emphasise that these queries do not relate solely to schools; we are involved wherever children talk to the education sector.  For example, we deal with complaints in respect of the National Council for Special Education, the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills.  That strong systemic approach is a key strength of our office and of the legislation.</p> <p>  Three quarters of the complaints concerning education are to do with individual schools.  There might be a perception that all we do is conduct investigations but, in fact, they make up a very small part of our work.  We strive for local resolution, which is the key role and function of an ombudsperson.  The majority of such cases receive a service from us, but the service will vary depending on the need.  Some parents contact us because they simply do not know where to go or, for instance, they are seeking advice and support in advance of a meeting with the board of management which they may find intimidating.</p><p>That type of support is a key part of our role, and that occurs for 62% of complainants who come to our office.</p><p> Sometimes issues become more complex.  That still will not be an investigation but we spend a lot of time working directly with parents, boards of management and children to try to seek a local resolution.  That is the best outcome because it is fast and effective, and must be in the best interests of children.  We have travelled throughout the country and engaged with people.  As members can imagine, when complaints are made we are talking about a very human relationship and therefore emotions can be high by the time we have been asked to step in.  We have found that, in many ways, our impartial role can be a very powerful agent of change.</p><p> Of the 37% of those cases in which we were more involved and active, we found that we were very effective in seeking local resolution.  That could be a child coming back into school or mediation, where the two parties have agreed to come together.  All of those are powerful resolutions, and they are timely for children.</p><p> It is important to note that at this stage we can also make encouraging suggestions.  I hear what the member said about powers of compellability but we have been very effective in getting boards of management involved.  After we have done this work with them they have changed policies and learned from the process.  They do not want to make the same mistake again.  They have amended their bullying and complaints policies and circulated the complaints procedure.  They have made many important changes that not only affect the individual child but all children in the school, and future children who will be placed in the school.</p><p> We had three investigations in 2014, which were complex issues.  As they are ongoing it would not be appropriate for us to talk about them now, but some of the investigations we have published in the past are those in which we have advocated for more systemic changes for children.</p></speech>

Many of the questions come together in terms of whether our remit is sufficient.  It is my belief that we do have a sufficient remit across the education system.  We have overall responsibility for interaction with the Department of Education and Skills, although the system is probably not linked the way it should be.  Members will see that I highlighted in the presentations the two elements of the architecture of complaints.  I am a psychologist, and everyone here is a social worker or a lawyer.  All of us have professional oversight bodies that examine our conduct.  That has not happened in regard to teachers.  It is a big drawback that there is not an element of independent oversight with regard to professional conduct.  That is something no ombudsman will ever get to work on because part of the fundamentals of ombudsmanship is that one does not work in the working-----</p></speech>

It will not stop all the complaints we get because they would be dealing with certain levels, but I believe that will make a structural difference to the way we work.  Also, consistent, clear and comprehensive complaint handling available in all schools across the country would have made a huge difference; that is section 28 of the Education Act.  That would change the way we would deal with complaints.</p> <p>  As regards compellability and having real teeth and power versus encouragement, as the Deputy stated, if we go back to the starting point, the essence of ombudsmanship is to work on the element of encouragement because we are supposed to be an alternative to courts.  As Deputy McConalogue stated, there are two choices; go to the Ombudsman or go to court.  We want to avoid the need for people to go to court because that is very much dependent on funding.  We are a free alternative to court and offer an impartial and fair assessment of the issues and concerns.</p> <p>  In terms of compellability, as has been seen in many other countries around the world where they did not use the ombudsman system, if the process is made compellable people automatically start "lawyering up".  It goes from a complaint that could be worked on, negotiated and fixed at a local resolution level straight to a court scenario and the parent who does not have that sort of funding is automatically disadvantaged.  Our job is to fight for those people in that situation regardless of their financial setting.  We seriously disadvantage young people and children in that situation.  I guarantee that the boards of management the member is concerned about are the ones who will quickly go to lawyers.  That is one of the major drawbacks.  It means that we have to work a little harder on relationships with individual boards, schools and the Department of Education and Skills.  We are constantly working with the Irish Primary Principals' Network, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, and the various agents that work within the education system.  We try to create relationships to allow us facilitate change and local resolution, where necessary.  That takes a bit longer.  It may not be as high profile as a strong-hitting court case but it creates a great deal of energy and results in many changes that we will never be able to publicise.</p> <p>  The real strength of ombudsmanship is that moral suasion that comes to bear.  Some of the biggest changes that happened around the world were done in that scenario rather than in a court case.  In terms of many of the Department of Education and Skills interactions, one of the biggest fears is that it will end up in court.  The only time something gets changed is that fear of court, and that is something we want to make sure does not happen.  We want the changes to happen on the ground and as my director stated, we make many small changes throughout the country.  From my point of view, therefore, that is where we are at now.  I believe we have the remit and the facilities to do it.  The system we oversee needs to change.  That is where there is a real gap in terms of the board of management and, as people have asked, who deals with that board of management?  We can deal with the boards of management in terms of the way they administer their schools and work on their policy and procedures.  We can make sure they have the right policies and procedures and that they are fair and used in the right way, but we cannot necessarily follow through on how they spend their money and deal with certain decisions.  That is a drawback that needs to be examined.</p> <p>  In my presentation to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, I said that there needs to be a recalibration in terms of the autonomy of schools and the responsibility of the State in that regard.  I am not quite sure how that will look.  This might be the start of a conversation that will allow that to happen but there is a sense that, where necessary, we can go to the Department of Education and Skills and tell them we believe there has been a failure but they will tell us they cannot do anything about the board of management.  My suggestion is that the education ombudsman would have no difference in that regard.  My sense of that is that the system is flawed.  I think that covers Deputy McConalogue's questions and I will try to cover the other questions also.</p></speech>

As stated earlier, the State Examinations Commission came into our remit in the middle of 2013 so we have been working on that.  That has been a high profile issue for us on which we have been working directly with the commission.  We believe improvements need to be made within the commission in the way it deals with complaints.  Our sense is that in terms of the appeals that take place, as the Senator said, there is not clear communication with the parents on how it should happen and what needs to occur.  When they are done under the pressure of being three days away from the first examination, everybody is at a disadvantage, especially the child.  From our point of view that is a clear indication of where the best interests of the child could be easily worked on earlier than that, and there needs to be some way to make sure that happens.  We have dealt with approximately 60 complaints in a period of time.  From January onwards we anticipate these sort of issues will arise in that scenario and it is very unfair because those young people are geared up for the most important element of their lives at that stage and it makes a huge difference if they do not have the support they felt they were sure of or that they had in the junior certificate.  We can certainly work with the commission to improve that scenario as much as possible.</p></speech>

That takes on our approach of trying to link in with other agencies involved, whether it is NEPS or CAMHS.  It shows the full spectrum of what we do at times in trying to ensure that principals who are doing a good job of trying to advise and support families have accurate information.  It is an ongoing thing.  Two complaints are never the same in that area, but it is something that we are involved in.  There are items that may never make it as far as an investigation but if, on examination, there is a lack of clarity between mum and dad and the school, or there is no meeting of minds on an issue, that is where clarity can sometimes be brought to bear.  There may never be an investigation.</p></speech>

I will then take supplementary questions.  I know that Deputy Jim Daly wants to speak again.  It is important for this to be said at the committee.  I know a lot of people through politics, people who are on school boards of management.  I have been on one myself for a local community school.  There has been a democratic and legal tradition whereby elected representatives were appointed to school boards of management.  It is part of the whole VEC and education and training boards structure, whereby there was a notion of democratic accountability, and that schools were for the community.  I know a lot of people on school boards of management and they are thoughtful and they put a lot of work into it.  They do a lot of soul searching when particular dilemmas come up before them on school boards of management.  We need to recognise that while one gets bad cases, there is so much good work done also.  If I was asked whether it should be autonomous or State-controlled, I would say that the answer is somewhere in the middle with democratic accountability.  Many schools do not have that.  It is in the VEC sector - now the education and training boards - but one does not have it in the majority of other schools.  That is what I feel.</p> <p>  I have a question about Mr. Walsh's presentation.  He said it would appear that no agency is tasked with examining schools, annual reviews or any trends or anomalies that emerge from them in the context of bullying.  What about the schools inspectorate?  I would have thought it would have a remit with school reports.  Am I correct there?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#O02600"><p>I have another point.  We looked at the issue of school admissions that Deputy O'Brien raised.  I personally think that there are constitutional issues, and that is our advice.  There are a lot of soft barriers.  In his submission, Mr. Walsh mentioned that and the parental rule, which constitute blatant discrimination.  When an audit of enrolment policies was done by the Department and the ESRI, they found that the soft barriers were as big an issue - things like the "first come, first served" policy, which is in the legislation.  Very often soft barriers can be the real issue.  Are Travellers more likely to be stopped from going to school on the basis of a "first come, first served" enrolment policy than by the parental rule?  The latter rule is in so few schools.  Very often, soft discrimination can be hidden but is more prevalent.</p> <p>  I am not familiar with the case that was mentioned.  Obviously, it is a damning indictment of the system that someone could be refused a place on that basis and that a school could get away with that.  However, was it because of the framing of the legislation around a school's ethos and being allowed to organise education around the religious ethos?  Was that the crucial issue?  Most schools are the opposite of that.  I know of so many cases in which schools have gone out of their way to keep people in the education system.  It is very bad that a school would get away with that, but I wonder what the crucial factor was there if they got away with it.  </p> <p>  Does anyone else want to come in at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015102100002#O02700"><p>I will be as brief as I can.  I thank Mr. Walsh and Dr. Muldoon for their responses.  I wish to echo what the Chair said and I did not introduce that in my opening remarks.  The amount of appreciation across the sector for the voluntary nature of boards of management, the time commitment and dedication from us as parents is enormous.  It is voluntary, but the issue I am getting at is that there could be a bad apple in the bag of a hundred.  Grievances carried by parents are difficult to listen to, and they feel frustrated.  I absolutely concur with the Chairman on that.</p> <p>  I am not surprised that the Ombudsman for Children is not supportive of an ombudsman for education.  The Department is not supportive either, nor is the Teaching Council.  I do not think the Minister or the unions would be that supportive, although I cannot speak for them.  That does not derail me from where I am going, however.  As a legislator my job is to legislate and I do not react to the say-so of the more permanent government.  My job is to legislate where I see a need to do so, and I will continue with that.  Saying that the Ombudsman for Children can deal adequately with what I am raising here is the equivalent of saying that the Minister for Children is responsible for the Department of Education and Skills.  I do not think one can say that.  Education is difficult and complex, and there are many avenues to it.  It has been built up over many decades with archaic structures in place which are difficult to understand.</p> <p>  I have been closely associated with a number of constituents who have contacted the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, and people who have come to me since I raised this issue.  They have found some of the language used by the office to be difficult.  I explained this before when I met with Dr. Muldoon.  Much of the language used by his office can be off-putting.  An ombudsman for education would be far more approachable than the Office of the Ombudsman for Children because of its very limited remit.</p> <p>  I asked specifically for numbers as opposed to percentages, which is what I sought from Dr. Muldoon's office.  I appreciate if he cannot give them to me today, but I would appreciate it if he could do so in future.  I would like to know the number of complaints that were education-related, since the inception of the office in 2004, and the number of these that went on to investigation.</p><p>I am referring to numbers rather than percentages because my issue is that, for a variety of understandable reasons, the Ombudsman for Children does not investigate many of the complaints.  Many parents receive letters saying it is not appropriate or whatever. </p><p> Boards are voluntary in nature.  When I was a principal I was told by a union official that there were three requirements for the chairperson of the board of management, namely, that he or she was Catholic, GAA and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I know that is an antiquated view, but it is still relevant in a small number of places.  That was the mindset once upon a time.  That is not to say that there is anything wrong with being Catholic, GAA or Fianna F&aacute;il.</p><p> Teachers are often the victims of decisions taken by boards of management or are bullied by other teachers.  That is nothing to do with the Ombudsman for Children.  I am anxious to see their rights vindicated.  An ombudsman for education would further protect the reputation of a teacher.  I could allege that my child is being bullied by a teacher, and there is no avenue to appeal that claim or make a complaint.  Such a teacher would never be vindicated and the charge can stand. </p><p> If I cannot get the numbers for which I asked today, I would like them at some stage.  I again thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I can reassure Deputy Daly in that I do not think the teaching unions would have any difficulty whatsoever with an education ombudsman, provided he she did not stray into the area of teacher discipline.  We have the Teaching Council to look after that.</p> <p>  That brings me back to Dr. Muldoon's office and its engagement with various groups.  He mentioned he engaged with the IPPN and the NAPP.  Having been involved in the drafting of school policies in the early days, I was always concerned about the fact that there are recommended templates from an office such as the ombudsman or elsewhere.  My experience has been that boards of management usually rubber-stamped a policy that was put in place by staff.  That was great if staff were discerning, well up to speed and prepared to share.  Indeed, most of the policies with which I was engaged were the result of shared knowledge across the sector.  I am concerned that standards are not in place.  If the Ombudsman for Children is not engaged in that process I would like to see him so engaged.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned section 5 of the Teaching Council Act.  I would hate to think his office was starting to dabble in that because we have enough trouble with section 5, in terms of allowing those who are allowed to engage with the area to deal with it and be damned. </p> <p>  We recently passed the Gender Recognition Act.  Only two weeks ago I was approached by teacher who asked whether I knew the school would be admitting a boy who has become a girl.  I pleaded ignorance for a few minutes.  The person concerned said she would not go to the toilet, nor would anybody else, while he was in the school.  It always strikes me that we close the door after the horse has bolted.  Surely processes and procedures should be in place to deal with such issues.  </p> <p>  Does Dr. Muldoon's office have any role in preparing for legislation he knows will be passed in order that we have policies in place to protect children?  We have agreed that gender recognition can be dealt with for those to aged as young as 16, I understand, with medical and parental support, etc.  That means children as young as those of junior certificate age are having to cope with these things.</p> <p>  I refer to direct provision, which Deputy Daly mentioned.  If the Ombudsman for Children had the power of enforceability we would never have encountered the refusal of education to children in direct provision some years ago.  I support Deputy Daily on the notion of an education ombudsman.  I am not so sure that I want such an office to operate outside the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, but I support the concept and would do everything I could to support such a proposal as it made its way through the Houses.</p></speech>

The Chairman said Dr. Muldoon's role needs to be somewhere between democratic and making people accountable.  I take his point that he does not want a court-based approach.  This is about helping the child, and the child will lose too much time in resolving an issue that affects his or her life if there is a court-based approach which could take years.  Children learn at critical times in key stages in their development.  What approach would Dr. Muldoon advocate based on the current democratic approach, which involves encouraging, cajoling, advocacy and compatibility?  Can the committee to anything to deliver a midway approach?</p></speech>

I would recommend to legislators those elements of support for a system that allows the board of management to report within the system and Department of Education and Skills systems in a different way.  I called it a recalibration of autonomy.  I am not quite sure what it looks like, but it could possibly involve a change of direction.</p> <p>  As Deputy Daly said, it has taken a long time to build up the current system.  To redirect it in a way that creates a little bit more oversight is something legislators need to examine and the Department needs to discuss.  I have not had any discussions with the Department but it is something that needs to come into play.  It is important that we start thinking about how that happens.</p> <p>  I do not want to put out any direct suggestions at this stage, having not had any discussions with some of the parties directly around the issue, but things are moving in that direction.  Once the system is in place, I will have oversight of it.  While I may not necessarily be compelling a board of management directly, if somebody in the Department of Education and Skills has oversight on a board I would have interaction there.</p></speech>

My contribution was never to highlight otherwise.  It is a very effective office and it has never been my issue or contention that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is not doing its job.  My contention is that it is not responsible for the ills that exist within the education system, but neither is it the solution.  That is in no way a reflection of the calibre and execution of Dr Muldoon's duties within his office.  I want to clarify that point.</p></speech>

It is important, as the Deputy presents our argument, to point out that the failure to reach an investigation level is not the same as a failure in our office to carry out a proper examination of a complaint.</p> <p>  People like their issues to be investigated, but we conduct a lot of examination and other stuff before reaching that level.  It is important to put on record that while 95% of our cases do not meet a level of investigation, a large amount of work is done before that and many cases are resolved.  That is part of the way we work.  Not reaching an investigation level is not the same as a case not having been worked on by our office.  May I continue?  Is there a division?</p></speech>

Our understanding in respect of anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools introduced in 2013 is that they include a requirement for schools to undertake an annual review of their anti-bullying policies.  An increased focus by the Department of Education and Skills inspectorate as regards promoting positive whole-school cultures and examining how schools are dealing with bullying is envisaged.</p><p>From our perspective, we are concerned that there is no agency or mechanism in place that is tasked with examining schools' annual reviews of their anti-bullying procedures.  While there is an internal review mechanism within schools and a broader review by the inspectorate in the context of the whole-school evaluation, we believe there is need for the establishment nationally of an annual monitoring and review mechanism that could address any issues or anomalies that may arise.</p><p> In regard to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, we agree, based on our experience as an office over a number of years, that there are soft barriers in existence relating to enrolment.  This was one of the reasons the office initially welcomed publication of the then general scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  Having reviewed the subsequent Bill published earlier this year, we are satisfied that a number of our concerns have been addressed.  We welcome in particular the retention in the Bill of the section 29 appeals committees.  However, we have a number of outstanding concerns which I think some members of the committee share, one being the past pupil criterion issue mentioned earlier.  We are of the view, for reasons that may be similar those of the committee, that the past pupil criterion should be removed as a possible derogation in cases of oversubscription.</p><p> Another of our concerns, which was also touched on earlier, relates to section 7 of the Equal Status Act.  To be helpful, I would like to clarify our view on this issue.  In our submission on the general scheme of the earlier Bill we recommended that section 7 of the Equal Status Act be amended to provide that in general no child should be given preferential access to publicly funded education on the basis of religion.  We appreciate that there may be constitutional barriers to making this an unqualified provision due to a prospective tension between Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution, as referenced in the committee's report on the general scheme of that Bill.  We suggested in our submission that this be addressed by way of amendment of the Equal Status Act to provide that a derogation could be granted to a denominational school where the operation of that principle would give rise to a situation where the school student body would no longer reflect the school's denominational character.  Like the committee, we are conscious that given the constitutional framework within which the Bill and subsequent Act will need to operate, there may be an impediment to progressing change through an amendment to the Act.</p></speech>

The use of the inspectorate was more about ensuring the policies were in line with what they should be in that situation.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked about the possibility of our assisting with templates.  It is an issue we have examined.  We are in the early stages of trying to devise a child-friendly administration scenario which may result in the development of tools that can help various administrators.  We are always trying to create policies that are child-friendly and child-appropriate and will look at the issue raised by the Senator in that context.</p> <p>  In regard to the issue of gender recognition and the transgender child, we agree on the need for appropriate training in all schools in the context of the huge change in culture for everybody in that regard.  While the number of children involved in this regard is not high, it is important that schools are prepared when this issue presents for them.  Damage can be done if the appropriate training is not in place in a school at the time the issue arises.  We will be encouraging that sort of support for teachers and hope they will get it.</p></speech>

The point I was making is that in my view the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is in many cases too narrow.  For a parent to take up an issue with the ombudsman requires him or her to have been seriously aggrieved.  Many parents who have been aggrieved never think of taking up the matter with the ombudsman such that those who have done so must have been seriously aggrieved.  It is my contention that many parents do not get what they consider to be a satisfactory outcome.  Grievances can be real or imagined.  The point I am getting at is that the ombudsman's office is a suitable cover for the Department.  In reality, the system is not working as well as it should be, although that is no reflection on Office of the Ombudsman for Children.</p></speech>

I welcome back to the committee Ms Noelle O'Connell who is the executive director of EMI.  Ms O'Connell will talk to us today about the performance of Ireland's Parliament and Government's in regard to participation in the European Union.  Members will also have an info-graphic in front of them outlining the various response rates at various institutions of the Parliament, the European Council, Commission, Oireachtas, etc.  We will have a chance to discuss that in our first session.  We will then have a separate session where we will discuss the response to the country specific recommendations of the European Semester.</p><p>We will kick-off with Ms O'Connell but before I ask her to make her opening remarks, I would remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.

My presentation today will focus on our 2014 report.  This fifth accountability report has been collated into a detailed info-graphic.  In addition to our 2014 work, the info-graphic of the 2010-2014 period also enables us to compare and contrast our findings over the past five years and better enables us to draw some overall conclusions.  We do this as part of our ongoing efforts and mission statement to shine a light on Ireland's engagement with Europe at a number of different levels.  For over 60 years, we have been dedicated to promoting the economic, political and social development of Europe, ensuring transparency and accountability at all levels of Ireland's relationship and engagement with Europe.  Hence, these are four years of our accountability reports and last year's info-graphic.  Cognisant of the time constraint, I will do my best to distil down our five years of accountability in a short address.</p> <p>  Similar to my previous presentations before the committee, I would preface my remarks with something of a health warning and caveat.</p><p>Our reports rely solely on quantifiable indicators that are available in the public domain.  We acknowledge that they cannot definitively and fully analyse the overall quality of the engagement measured.  For example, we acknowledge that analysing the daily activities of MEPs in the Parliament does not allow for a complete analysis of their engagement with the European parliamentary process since much of the work of MEPs is ongoing.<br/><br/>We believe that applying this caveat is a necessary precaution.  However, it is no reason not to monitor and comment on data that is publically available.  European Movement Ireland believes that scrutiny is vital in promoting transparency and accountability at the highest levels of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU and I hope the findings of our accountability report and my presentation today are beneficial to members, both as committee members and parliamentarians.<br/><br/>Turning to the accountability report, members will see that for 2014 we have split the report into two substantive sections looking at the European Council and the Councils of the EU, the European Parliament and the Oireachtas.  The first section is a summary of our 2014 analysis and in the second part of the info-graphic, we share our reflections on the 2010-2014 findings and draw an analysis over the five-year period.<br/><br/><b></b>I ask members to first look at the European Council and the Council of the EU<b>.  </b>We found that the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, attended all eight meetings of the European Council in 2014.  Members will see that a 100% attendance rate by the Taoiseach and his predecessor, Brian Cowen, is consistent across the 2010-2014 period for a total of 34 Council meetings.  European Movement Ireland welcomes this record as evidence of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to high level EU engagement.<br/><br/>Attendance by Ministers at meetings of the various Council configurations of the EU increased steadily from a 75% initial finding in 2010, peaking at 99%, the highest ranking of all the member states in 2013, coinciding with Ireland holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of Europe.<br/><br/>On the basis of published information available to EM Ireland at the time of our 2014 report publication in May of this year, we found that Irish Ministers attended 72 of the 85 Council of the EU meetings in 2014, with an overall average attendance of 84.6%.  There was very little separating the member states' attendance at the various Council meetings in the middle section of the rankings.  In some cases, for example, just one meeting may have been attended by Ireland at Secretary General or Permanent Representative level but that is not recorded as ministerial attendance for the purpose of our accountability report.  We acknowledge and preface our remarks by indicating that ministerial absences from meetings were impacted on by conflicting domestic obligations, including Cabinet meetings and Oireachtas business associated with the budget.<br/><br/>A closer scrutiny of ministerial attendance goes into some detail in terms of the various Council configurations but in summary, we believe the picture is quite positive.  With more than 400 meetings of the various EU Councils over the past five years of our reporting period, the average attendance by Irish Ministers at those meetings stands at 88%.  <br/><br/>As members will know, our accountability report is an organic and evolving process and we always welcome feedback from our stakeholders and members of the public on how we progress with the report.  Based on feedback from our initial year in 2010, we got feedback, guidance and advice on how it would be useful to compare Ireland's findings with the rest of our EU member states.  That was a new indicator that we tracked in 2011.  Averaging out Irish ministerial attendance over four years, in comparison with the rest of the EU member states, Irish ministerial attendance for the four years from 2011 stands at 91%, which compares to a German average of 87%.  Denmark stands at 89%.  I felt it was useful to put that in context for members.  We will continue to monitor ministerial attendance and we would be hopeful that this average continues to improve.<br/><br/>Turning to the European Parliament, regarding the performance of Irish MEPs over the five-year reporting period, European Movement Ireland tracked monthly plenary attendance and the number of speeches, written questions, opinions and reports issued by Irish MEPs.  <br/><br/>A caveat must be applied to the analysis of the 2014 findings since the European Parliament elections were held in May 2014 impacting on the ordinary functioning of the European Parliament and levels of national representation.  To better reflect this we divided the findings into 2014 A for the first half of the year when Ireland had 12 MEPs, and the latter half of the year from July onward when Ireland returned 11 MEPs.<br/><br/>The five-year findings show average attendance by Irish MEPs at monthly plenary sessions increased from 84% in 2010 to a high of 93% in 2013; 2013 was a very good year.  Attendance held steady in the first half of 2014 but decreased to 76% in the latter post-election half of 2014, which was among the lowest attendance by member states in this period.<br/><br/>The number of speeches by Irish MEPs fell from 944 in 2011 to 200 in the latter half of 2014.  That downward trend, mirrored in the 2014 figures in particular, is reflected across written questions, opinions and reports issued but again members should note that in 2014, the Parliament was not in full legislative mode.<br/><br/>It is also encouraging that already in 2015, based on our preliminary research and findings to date, the published data at the end of September are indicating an increase across the majority of these metrics, which is something we welcome.  Up to the end of September, attendance by the Irish MEPs stood at 83%, with 758 speeches delivered, which already exceeds the entire number of speeches given last year.</p></speech>

If the Chairman wishes I can provide further details subsequently.  We are not at the stage of formally writing the 2015 report but this is what our preliminary indicators are showing.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind the life cycle of the Parliament and the gestation periods of parliamentary reports, we would like to see Irish MEPs aim to publish one, if not two, reports during their parliamentary tenure.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of the Oireachtas committees,<b></b>according to the Programme for Government 2011-2016, all Ministers should appear before their respective committees or before this committee prior to travelling to Brussels for meetings of the Council where decisions are made.  European Movement Ireland is very supportive of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to bolster its democratic accountability in this regard and its engagement in terms of prioritising Ireland's relationship with Europe and the EU.<br/><br/>Having examined the minutes of all Oireachtas committee meetings in 2014, we found that Ministers had a 51% rate of pre-Council briefing attendance.  That level may appear to be quite low but it represents a year on year increase on 2011 when we had rates of just 36%, albeit solely for General Affairs Pre-Council briefings, to 46% in 2013.  Attendance at the individual committees ranges from 100% for General Affairs before this committee, 80% for ECOFIN before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, noting that the only two briefings of ten missed by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, fell either side of budget 2015, to no pre-Council briefings out of a possible four for education, youth, culture and sport, EYCS, before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the demands on Ministers&rsquo; time or where, for example, Oireachtas committees have agreed alternative arrangements with Ministers over the frequency of these briefings, EMI advocates for better compliance with the systems that have been put in place to ensure Oireachtas scrutiny of matters before decisions are made in Brussels.  We are seeing a steady but slow upward trend in pre-Council briefings by Ministers.  We welcome this metric and would like to see it continue and improve in the coming years.<br/><br/>In terms of the attendance rate at this Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the accountability report does not provide an analysis of attendance by individual members.</p><p>Rather, we looked at the attendance of all members at the 29 meetings last year and arrived at a composite average of 61%.  The average attendance has varied from a low of 59% in 2010 to a high of 71% in 2011.  Over the five-year period, attendance has averaged at 63%.</p><p> We recognise that members&rsquo; workloads and competing priorities can impact on their ability to attend all committee meetings.  This is something that Deputies and Senators regularly highlight to me each time we present the accountability report to this committee and we are very cognisant of it.  However, in considering important EU developments and initiatives affecting Ireland, ensuring that EU legislation and proposals are properly scrutinised at a domestic level and in holding the Government to account in our relations with Europe, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs plays a key role in informing debate on the European Union in Ireland.  So it will not come as a surprise to its members that we are advocating a high attendance rate by its members.</p><p> From the findings of the 2014 report and the full reporting period from 2010 to 2014, we can conclude that Ireland is doing quite well in some aspects of its engagement with Europe and has room to improve in others.  For example, attendance by taoisigh at the European Council for 34 meetings over five years could not be better, standing, as it does, at 100%.  The attendance and engagement of our elected representatives at the other European and domestic fora is steady, particularly when the various contexts impacting performance is acknowledged.  This is something Deputies and Senators have highlighted to us over the years.  We argue that there is always room for improvement and we continue to hope for an upward trajectory and trend.</p><p> Our accountability campaign is a vital part of European Movement Ireland's mission to lessen the democratic deficit and knowledge deficit in Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Europe.  We have tried to distil and present last year&rsquo;s findings in a detailed infographic rather than a 100-page report that might not get as much readership and traction among the public that we would like.  We have used the infographic in an effort to communicate the information in as clear and accessible a manner as possible.</p><p> As members of the committee will appreciate, the process behind the reporting is challenging and labour intensive.  For example, in tracking members&rsquo; attendance at this committee throughout the 2010-14 reporting period, members of the European Movement Ireland team have physically attended and reported on more than 156 committee meetings.  In that same period, we have tracked 3,759 speeches and 2,860 written questions in the European Parliament.</p><p> We rely solely on information and data that are available in the public domain, which inevitably throws up a number of difficulties.  It does not allow for a fully qualitative analysis of the engagement in question or reflect the inevitable conflicts that arise in the schedules of elected representatives and we are careful to acknowledge this in contextualising our findings.</p><p> We are also restricted by the delay with European institutions publishing their data.  Consequently, we can only stand over our findings as being accurate to the best of our ability at the time of publication.  We are often frustrated by the subsequent release of relevant data after we have gone to print.  In scaling up our accountability reporting we had hoped to publish biannual reports in line with each EU Presidency term.  However, this will not be possible until the various bodies start publishing their data in a more consistent and timely manner, thereby better enabling us to fulfil this project in terms of the streamlining of information being made available to the public.</p><p> We are at an important juncture of EU relations with many sectors interested in the various developments and outcomes.  In advance of - I can now say - next year's general election, European Movement Ireland recommends that all political parties give strong consideration to European policy and European issues relevant to Ireland in drafting their election manifestos.</p><p> European Movement Ireland is very proud of our accountability project.  We will do our best not to be deterred by the challenges I have outlined.  We hope the members find the reports provide added value and assist them in their committee work.  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for giving us the opportunity over the past five years to present and report on our accountability campaign to this committee.  I acknowledge the work the committee is doing in trying to promote and develop that connection and engagement between Ireland and Europe.  European Movement Ireland is very supportive of the work of the committee in that regard.  I look forward to continuing to report on some aspects of our accountability report next year.</p></speech>

It is helpful in pointing in a particular direction, but it by no means gives the overall picture.  When material like this is put in writing it can be used in a positive or negative way.  I will highlight certain aspects.  Attendance at this committee is reflected, which is fine.  While obviously it is not European Movement Ireland's intention, it does not provide the full picture.  I can come to all these meetings and spend my time responding to my constituents and can have a full attendance.  It looks good when it is presented in just that amount of information, but it is in no way reflective of the participation thereafter.  We are all the same in terms of how things are presented in the media - we are lazy.  We take the headline and we accept it from there.  In terms of outputs, reports and participation, has European Movement Ireland considered any methodology that might use the data it has collected, but present an opinion rather than just presenting the raw data?</p> <p>  Ministers are expected to attend various meetings in Europe.  Sometimes they will make a judgment that it is not in the country's best interest to be there owing to another competing interest elsewhere.  Cost may also be a factor.  If a Minister attends 100% of the meetings, it seems great, but at some time there will be a freedom of information request over the cost.  The Chairman knows this well, as he is a very good attender at important meetings.</p></speech>

It is good to have the presentation.  Deputy Dooley has raised some interesting points about a qualitative view.  His latter point highlights a great dilemma for people in public life over the past five years.  Particularly at the time of the recession we had the question of the cost factor.  It was a huge dilemma for all of us presented with an option to travel somewhere.</p><p>We constantly weighed up the importance to Ireland of being there against the potential of it being misconstrued by certain members of the public.  While I presume it will become less of an issue in future, it was a major dilemma for us in recent years and Deputy Dooley was right to raise it.  A number of us would have shied away from particular events on that basis.</p><p> I will be brief, as there is no need to go on about this issue indefinitely, but it merits saying in response to the report that the Irish engagement is of a high quality at all levels from the Government to our MEPS.  Our Civil Service engagement is also effective and professional.  As a geographically peripheral island and in the worst of times, we can be proud of engaging so wholly with the European project.  We stand up well.</p></speech>

The report is clear and concise in its stats and graphics.  Last year was an election year and the number of MEPs was reduced to a smaller contingent of 11.  If someone is out sick, which I understand is the case at the moment, our attendance is skewed disproportionately.  Perhaps this might explain the findings or maybe there should be an addendum denoting it.</p> <p>  There seem to be discrepancies in the number of speeches corresponding with the number of MEPs.  The number increased in 2011 to 686 but fell again in 2012.  Was there a reason for this?  The number of written questions fell from 1,067 in 2010 to 384 in 2013.  What was the reason for this?  Were extra research staff available to MEPs?  Was there a change in procedures?  The number of opinions fell from nine in 2010 to three in 2013 and zero in 2014.  What was the reason for this?</p></speech>

We made the same remarks last year about how these reports present certain data.  We are all familiar with how people in certain fora come in, sign on the dotted line and go back out the door again.  There is an issue with quantitative and qualitative research.  I raised this matter with the witnesses last year.  It is important that more effort be invested in a qualitative analysis of contributions, be it at European Parliament level, Council level or wherever.</p> <p>  My colleagues have referred to the issue that we all face with the way that travel on behalf of this committee is presented.  Perhaps the witnesses could have a role in shaping public opinion.  They should consider this.</p> <p>  The report does not track the qualitative output of this committee, including our reports.  I am proud of some of our initiatives, for example, our Brexit report.  We were not simply following up on something that was part of the standardised agenda.  We took the initiative off our own bat.  I compliment the Chairman and the executive in that regard.  The overall infographics do not reflect the quality of the output.  The witnesses should consider this.</p></speech>

That was unprecedented for us, but it is not reflected in this report.  That said, the general consensus is that this is a worthwhile document.  A bit of qualitative analysis with it would be most helpful, but that is an issue that Ms O'Connell can answer today and European Movement Ireland can develop in future accountability reports.</p></speech>

Regarding members' points about the qualitative analysis, we have been conscious of that challenge since we first started doing this in 2010.  To that end, we publish a detailed report every year, on average 80 pages long, in which we try to flesh these matters out in greater detail, outline some of the methodologies around the indicators and highlight the extra reports and meetings of this committee.  I have had the opportunity and honour of presenting before the committee on the future of Europe, Europe week, Ireland's 40 years and so on.  We acknowledge that more is happening.  The challenge that we face is one of where to draw the balance and communicate the information in as accessible a manner as possible while recognising the committee's valid request that we not lose sight of the qualitative framework.  I will take that request on board.</p> <p>  In undertaking the accountability project for the past five years, we have reached the point of being able to assess what has worked and what has not.  For example, we used to consider the number of consultations that Ireland submitted as part of the European Commission consultation process.  However, we found that many Directorates General were publishing their findings after we had gone to print.  The figures that we were presenting based on our research were correct at the time of going to print, but they did not present the whole picture.  As such, we decided to focus elsewhere.</p> <p>  Taking on board members' comments on metrics and the point that a number of them raised about the cost factor, we, as an organisation that was founded 60 years ago to promote and develop Ireland's engagement with Europe, believe it to be vital that Ireland is represented at the table.  The primarily upwards trajectory in the past five years has been encouraging.  Based on a rough snapshot of the infographics, there has been a welcome increase.</p> <p>  Deputy Kyne asked about discrepancies as well as the variance in the number of written questions and opinions.  For many reports and opinions, it is a question of timing.  Some years, more are published and come to fruition while other years see a decline.  When we asked for our former President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox's take on the accountability report, he had an interesting view.  He stated that his experience of the parliamentary question procedure had led him to conclude early on that it was less effective to follow up questions in depth than it was to write letters to the relevant Commissioners or Commission or Council staff.  MEPs have fed this view back to us.  Sometimes, it is more effective to pick up the telephone.  I do not have to elaborate on that for the committee.  Attendance figures and raw data are static and we acknowledge that they are not dynamic measurements of engagement, standing, impact, influence and outputs, but measuring them is none the less important.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Ginnell" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015102100002#F00500"><p>I apologise for our late arrival.  I understood we were due to come before the committee at 1.15 p.m.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, our focus is on the 2015 country-specific recommendations which Ireland received from the European Commission in May.  As members may be aware, there are four country-specific recommendations for Ireland.  Country-specific recommendations form part of the wider European semester process, which involves, for example, monitoring the Stability and Growth Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy.  Overall, the Better Europe Alliance believes that the recommendations present a disjointed approach and continue to reflect an EU semester process driven by economic or fiscal goals which can undermine the achievement of a balanced economic, social and environmental approach under the Europe 2020 strategy.  Since the commencement of the Europe 2020 strategy in 2010, consistent poverty rates in Ireland have risen from 4.2% to 8.2%.  In 2013 there were 376,000 people living in consistent poverty.</p> <p>  The absence of any comment on the fact that Ireland will fail by a substantial margin to reach its Europe 2020 target for reducing greenhouse gases must be considered a serious omission from the country-specific recommendations.  However, there are some elements of the recommendations on taxation, the tapered withdrawal of income supports, accessing employment and child care which, if implemented in a positive manner, could bring about improved outcomes.  </p> <p>  In general, the Better Europe Alliance believes that a balanced approach must be reflected throughout the whole of the European semester and Europe 2020 processes.  This means that no action should be taken which would result in the social and climate change targets of Europe 2020 being more difficult to achieve.  It also requires that the social and environmental impacts of decisions and policies be factored in to all decision-making processes.</p> <p>  I will deal individually with each of the four recommendations.  The first recommendations relates to macroeconomic goals.  The Better Europe Alliance is extremely alarmed by the statement that the Government is to make its expenditure ceiling in this regard more binding by limiting the statutory scope for discretionary changes.  Imposing restrictive expenditure ceilings runs counter to the Europe 2020 strategy vision of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p><p>Contrary to advocating the proposals in the country-specific recommendation that windfall gains from better-than-expected economic and financial conditions be used to accelerate deficit and debt reduction, the alliance is of the opinion that they should be invested in Ireland&rsquo;s social and physical infrastructure.  The alliance supports the proposal in the recommendation to broaden the tax base.  We also support the proposal to review tax expenditure, including value-added taxes.  The alliance is of the opinion that the production of an annual tax expenditure report as part of the budget process has the potential to contribute to greater transparency in Ireland&rsquo;s taxation system.  The alliance believes that, over the next few years, Ireland needs to increase its taxation levels so that they will be closer to the EU average.  Ireland&rsquo;s tax take as a percentage of GDP is 10% below the EU average.  As a core principle, the focus of taxation must be on strengthening the fairness and progressiveness of the taxation system, which must reduce inequality and avoid environmental harm.</p><p> The second country-specific recommendation concerns health.  The current narrow focus in the health recommendation on structural reform of financial systems, particularly within acute hospitals, while necessary, is a partial solution that does not address health inequalities, particularly for those on the lowest incomes, and the wider and historic problem of a neglected primary, community and continuing care sector.  This sector is failing the Irish population, particularly those who must depend on rationed, curtailed and, at times, residual service levels.</p><p> The objective of improving health outcomes, particularly among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, must be central to health sector reform. The cost of ill health and a non-functioning health service affects those in most need more profoundly than others.  Without investing in primary care, future expenditure will remain high due to continued reliance on the acute hospital system to diagnose and treat conditions that can be addressed within a primary care structure.</p><p> The third recommendation is on low-work-intensity households and it also addresses child poverty.  At present, the primary focus of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service is on people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment and, in particular, those in receipt of one in the short term.  As a consequence, the service is not geared up to engage with everyone of working age, regardless of the payment, if any, one is receiving, nor is the service geared up for people working in low-work-intensity households, including those on disability allowance, a one-parent family payment or qualified adults who, in the absence of a re-entry credit, become invisible in the system.  In addressing the issues facing jobless and low-work-intensity households, the quality of work available is a critical issue.  Little will be done to address the poverty that many in these households face unless they are supported in finding decent and sustainable work.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s labour market is very flexible, to the point of being precarious for so many people.  The spread of non-fixed-hour contracts is one of the drivers of non-voluntary part-time work and has been particularly notable in sectors where women predominate, such as hospitality and retail.  These contracts not only erode incomes but also damage work-life balance and discourage labour market participation.  The Government has commissioned new research into the area of precarious work, and it is important that the findings of this research be used to bring in stronger regulation.</p><p> We welcome the recommendation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in its political contribution on the mid-term review last year of the Europe 2020 strategy, which called for a job quality target to be introduced alongside the overall employment target.</p><p> With regard to early childhood care and education, the State must take the lead in ensuring publicly subsidised delivery of affordable, accessible and high-quality early years care and education.  Ireland currently invests less than half the OECD average, 0.8%, in this area, and there is a need for a clear pathway towards increased public investment in this essential social infrastructure.  The rewards of investment in this area include greater female participation in the labour force and also, crucially, better outcomes for children and reduced future spending in areas such as education support.  We welcome the measures announced in budget 2016 that will support progress towards the type of early childhood care and education system that we need.  This must be continued in the coming years.</p><p> The fourth country-specific recommendation concerns housing, and also includes a focus on SMEs.  However, our focus on this is the housing element.  The recommendation represents a missed opportunity to address serious structural flaws in housing provision in Ireland that pose a profound threat to social stability and future economic recovery.  Increasing rents that are not matched by increased levels of housing support put families at risk of poverty through a widespread practice of topping up housing payments and through increased risk of homelessness.  The delivery of the social housing strategy, however, is heavily reliant on regularising the position of households in receipt of housing assistance in the private rental sector.  In the context of the current insecure private rental market, however, over-reliance on this sector is a source of concern.  The country-specific recommendation focusing on securing a rapid resolution to the mortgage arrears situation risks compounding this issue, as buy-to-let properties, 30% of which are in arrears, will feature heavily.  The forced sale of these properties potentially puts large numbers of renting families at greater risk of homelessness.</p><p> With regard to our response to the four country-specific recommendations, I should have said at the outset that the Better Europe Alliance comprises 12 separate organisations.  Obviously, they cannot all be here, but we will try as best as we can to answer the questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

On his last point, I agree that we need action on mortgage arrears and to do our best to force the institutions to deal with individuals on a case-by-case basis to arrive at satisfactory solutions.  Much has been done by the Government in this area, but it needs to remain a priority.</p> <p>  In some respects, Mr. Ginnell will accept that the recommendations predate the budget with regard to early childhood education in that it will now be available for free right up to five years of age, at which time children enter primary school.  I am a complete believer in early childhood education.  It is probably the greatest mechanism for creating a fair society and equality of opportunity and for giving everybody a reasonable break.  Those of us who had the privilege of teaching at some stage in our careers, or of having trained professionally as teachers, will recognise that early childhood years are critical to a child's development into adulthood.  I presume the delegates have no issue with my saying that the recommendation on early childhood education has effectively been dealt with in the budget.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the recommendation with regard to people with a disability.  Tackling this will become a challenge for the Government.  It is a matter that we will have to address as times improve and as we start to rebuild a normal society.  I know from my clinic work that there are too many people with disabilities who cannot get suitable work in the marketplace.  This needs to be addressed.  I challenge the view that there is too much focus on the jobseeker's payment.  Bearing in mind that I am not saying this joint Oireachtas committee is not a party political forum, I believe the focus of the Government, the Department and the country on job activation strategies has been the right one.  I challenge the recommendation in this regard.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Ginnell's response on this.</p> <p>  I am not convinced that we have not addressed the primary care issue fairly well.  In my constituency, a number of new primary care centres, which I will not list, were opened.  Other centres were refurbished.  They are up and running, doing well and fulfilling a function.</p><p>I am not personalising this in respect of Mr. Ginnell but I do not accept the proposition in the report that primary care is by any means on the hind foot.  The focus of administration always has to be on savings and cutting waste without compromising front-line services but I challenge the view that primary care is not very central.  I look forward to Mr. Ginnell's response on this.</p></speech>

I have a question on the process of consultation on country-specific recommendations.  This is a response to the 2015 CSRs.  Will it also input to the 2016 CSRs?  Does the network have a role to play in this?  Is there a mechanism whereby it can engage with the powers that be who put these things together?  Reporting on the past is one thing but having an input into the future is more important.</p> <p>  Mr. Ginnell said that the budget had helped the situation with respect to child care.  Would he also agree that the budget has taken a number of steps to reduce the level of poverty for those most at risk of cuts, such as getting people out of the USC, increases in pensions and fuel allowance, the Christmas bonus etc?  We all accept there is a huge problem with housing supply, which is the main issue.  We have in the past had an over-reliance on the Part V mechanism whereby city and county councils could buy people out but it has not delivered what we hoped it would have delivered and that has led to a lack of housing stock.  Does Mr. Ginnell accept that the Government has a financial plan and that the money is available to build houses but that access to finance for developers and the private sector seems to be the issue, rather than the will of Government to increase supply?</p></speech>

I disagree with Deputy O'Reilly on the subject of primary care and help outside the hospital system, which is way below the European average.  It is also hugely expensive and out of the reach of people who can otherwise go to an accident and emergency unit.  It means very little to people who do not have private health insurance.</p> <p> The report calls for an increase in taxation.  Has there been any analysis on whether we should tackle tax avoidance or corporate tax, or impose a financial transaction tax or a tax on profits?  The report is unclear on how we should reform the tax system.  Everybody wants the tax system reformed but we are between 10% and 12% below the European average and the question remains of how we bring in a fair tax.  </p> <p>  Low pay is a huge problem and, according to statistics, 167,000 people are on very low income, namely, the minimum wage or slightly above.  Has the network considered a living wage rather than a minimum wage?  I know Social Justice Ireland has spoken on that subject.  Child care is still the most expensive in the European Union and we have done very little on child care in successive budgets.  Has a more detailed analysis been done on this and the other subjects to which I have referred?  </p></speech>

It takes up a substantial portion of the report, which is fair given the current scenario.   The level of rent increases and family homelessness were noted and since the report was drafted, a number of months ago, the situation has actually deteriorated.  At the moment there are some 700 families in homelessness, with a prediction for 1,000 by Christmas.  Mr. Ginnell mentioned the issue of supply but it will take at least two or three years to improve the supply of housing.  Has he considered supporting the concept of rent certainty, limiting the extent of rent increases to prevent people becoming economically evicted?  That is happening at the moment because, according to the most recent statistics, average rent increases in Dublin are in the region of 15%.  Would the organisation to which Mr. Ginnell belongs be prepared to row in behind that proposal?</p> <p>  Low work intensity households are an issue of major concern and are something we have struggled with as a country even since the Celtic tiger years, when we had the second highest level of low work intensity.  Other members have identified the high numbers of lone parents as the major issue contributing to low work intensity.  Does Mr. Ginnell feel that the recent measures will assist with this issue or not?</p></speech>

NABCO is an important housing association but how does one become a member of the Better Europe Alliance?</p> <p>  Two of the questions I wanted to ask have been touched upon.  Mr. Ginnell referred to structural flaws in housing.  Would he agree that there are more than just flaws in the system?  Is it not just that Ireland operates a ridiculous system of encouraging individuals, from garda&iacute; to nurses, carpenters and plumbers to electricians, to buy a house and rent it on?  This system seems to be unique in Europe and is an absolute disaster.  Senator Hayden asked about rent certainty.  Unless we can get rent certainty to prevent private sector landlords asking what they like at any time they wish we will continue to contribute to the housing crisis.</p> <p>  I disagree slightly with the comments on primary health care.  In Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot in my constituency there are the most fantastic primary health care centres, such as St. Michael's Estate and Thomas Street.  We are developing another on Curlew Road in the heart of Drimnagh and one on St. Agnes Road in the heart of Crumlin.  These primary health care centres are unspeakably wonderful, modern, patient-friendly centres so would Mr. Ginnell not agree that we are making positive moves in that area?</p> <p>  We are doing the best we can, given the economic uplift, in having a Low Pay Commission.  We have made structural changes there and since the REAs were deemed unconstitutional we have brought a new basic rate for approximately 50,000 workers in very low paid industries such as security and cleaners.  </p> <p>  This is a very important report and there is a complex range of issues to discuss.  Each of the bullet points would take a day to debate in depth so perhaps Mr. Ginnell can comment broadly on the issues I have raised. </p></speech>

We can therefore expect to see even more primary care centres developed over the coming years.  I ask Mr. Ginnell to reply.  Ms Deane or Ms O'Donnell may also want to reply to questions.  I ask that each take approximately five minutes.</p></speech>

Focusing on the unemployed and jobseekers is important.  Intreo offices are the main centres to which people go if they need support but the focus of those offices is on the short-term unemployed.  Anyone on a disability payment or a lone-parent payment who wants to obtain support to enter the labour market from an Intreo centre is not prioritised.  Our focus is on ensuring equality of access.  The Intreo service should be open to all people of working age who seek its support.  In the past two months, the Government selected two companies to provide supports for the long-term unemployed.</p> <p>  Our goal is to comment on the current country-specific recommendations and how they have been implemented.  This also helps in influencing future recommendations.  We engage, on an ongoing basis, with the European Commission staff in Ireland.  There are two semester officers in Ireland the focus of which is the European semester and engagement with stakeholders in the process.  They are key for us in engagement and influencing future recommendations.  For the first time this year, the Commission published a report in February which outlined what it sees as the priorities for the country.  That is a process in which we are engaged.</p> <p>  Deputy Halligan referred to increases in taxation.  The country-specific recommendation refers to tax expenditures - tax breaks in other words - and the need to examine those areas.  We have asked for an annual report on the value of tax expenditures.  Several areas were addressed in recent budgets but there are other areas, such as pensions, which could be addressed in the future.  We have other suggestions for this area which we have put forward in a longer document.</p> <p>  Compared to EU levels, Ireland does not fall behind in the context of income tax but rather in respect of social insurance.  The level of PRSI is way behind European averages.  In most other countries, there are higher levels of taxation at local level.  The new property tax in some ways covers that.  There are issues in that area which could be addressed.  It is stated that people on low incomes pay a higher rate of VAT.  It is about increasing levels of taxation but in a proportionate and progressive manner.  There is a detailed report on this which we can send to the committee.</p> <p>  On the differences between the living wage and the minimum wage, different members of our organisation would prefer those working would move towards a living wage, which is a higher hourly rate than the minimum wage, although the minimum wage will increase by 50 cent as recommended by the Low Pay Commission.  Both the living wage and the minimum wage focus on an hourly rate.  If someone is only getting five hours to ten hours of work a week, however, they will not have a weekly living wage.  There is an issue around contracts and precarious work conditions.  The Government has commissioned a report from the University of Limerick on precarious work conditions, which will hopefully highlight many of the issues which need to be addressed, alongside the hourly rate to ensure a balanced approach.</p> <p>  Regarding membership of the Better Europe Alliance, it is one of three national alliances established at European level.  Most of our organisations are members of a network at European level.  It is not a closed organisation and other groups can join this alliance.  There are currently 12 members of the alliance.</p></speech>

We are involved in continuing dialogue in respect of the 2016 country-specific recommendations.  This is about reform.  For the past two years, the recommendations have highlighted issues of significant concern to civil society organisations in this country, particularly early years child care and education.  I have no wish to be pedantic but this is not just about the labour market and plonking kids in child care settings.  Rather, it involves development outcomes for our most important citizens.  This country is coming from an extremely low, poor, underfunded and unknowing base.  There was a significant step-change in this regard in the budget.  The interdepartmental group consulted, listened and delivered on this in the budget.  It is incumbent on whoever is in the next Government that they continue to honour the options and commitments made in that report because it will be for the betterment of society and economy.</p> <p>  The lack of policy coherence was a concern around the child care country-specific recommendation.  We viewed it more than as a labour market facing mechanism in need of reform but also a measure that can help lone-parent families.  It must be remembered that many of the children in these families are living in consistent poverty, namely, material deprivation where they are not in receipt of things that everybody else takes for granted, such as birthday parties, heating, proper nutritious food, ability to go and participate in both school and society.  We have flagged the lack of policy coherence to date to parliamentarians and the EU.  One cannot have one arm of government saying it needs to get lone parents back into the labour market but then not offer them the supports which would allow them to upskill and be employable to future employers.  Our concern is the lack of policy coherence.</p> <p>  It is regrettable the two Deputies who raised primary care are not here to hear our response.  This country has an underfunded primary care system.  The country-specific recommendation is heavily focused on the financial and structural reforms of the HSE, Health Service Executive, in particular its accounting systems and activity-based funding.  We have to ask people to remember those who have the least access to timely interventions of care.  It is quite nice to talk about glossy health care centres opening up in the Dublin suburbs and elsewhere but we have got long waiting lists for services which other Europeans take very much for granted.  If one does not have access to critical intervention services at the right time, such as speech and language therapy, education and psychological services or community mental health services, one is really racking up problems which will take the lifetimes of future taxpayers to resolve.</p> <p>  We will continue to lobby for increased resources going into primary and continuing community care.  It is one matter to have good activity-based funding throughout the acute health system.  However, if the primary care system is not there to meet those leaving acute hospitals after successful episodes of care, we are going nowhere.  We will continue to flag that issue.</p></speech>

There are over 3,000 children waiting for their first appointment for speech and language therapy.</p><p>I echo Ms Deane's point that centres are not services.  We need a highly robust primary care service that is able to provide services.  The recent budgetary increases, for example, to fund the extension of the carer's allowance for 12 weeks beyond bereavement and restore the respite care grant, are meaningless without services.  Families who cannot afford to work or are unable to engage in low intensity or precarious work because to do so would risk the loss of medical cards and access to services is coming under more and more pressure.  </p><p> On activation and employment, a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities was launched recently after a wait of more than ten years.  The documents refer to those who were left behind in jobless households in the good times.  While we welcome the new employment strategy for people with disabilities, it is very much divorced from mainstream activation programmes.  For example, it is being overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality rather than the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Some of our most disadvantaged citizens, including people with disabilities, those who care for other family members, lone parents and Travellers, are subject to a system of apartheid.  This is the broad group of people we seek to represent as part of this alliance.  </p></speech>

The European Anti-Poverty Network supports the call by different homeless organisations for rent certainty.  As Senator Hayden noted, our report refers to the heavy dependence on the private rental market to provide housing, especially for people who are on low incomes.  The level of support provided to people under the rent supplement to pay for rent is causing many problems.  As the Senator correctly pointed out, our report is slightly out of date as new statistics were published last weekend on the increase in homelessness.  The housing organisations dealing with the homeless have clearly identified that people on low incomes who are in receipt of rent supplement are unable to afford rent and this is driving families into homelessness.  This issue must be addressed.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Government is discussing the option of increasing rent supplement.  However, this is being done on a discretionary basis.  I understand, for example, that approximately 4,000 people have benefited from discretionary increases in the payment.  A broader approach is needed because rent supplement levels are causing major difficulties for families.  Rent certainty would definitely help address the issue.  </p></speech>

Last week, I visited Berlin to meet parliamentarians from across EU member states.  One of the questions that arose was the level of engagement among member states on country-specific recommendations.  Believe it or not, Ireland is ahead of many other member states which have done very little in this regard.  It is thanks to organisations such as those represented today that we have an opportunity to debate the country-specific recommendations in public and analyse the issues they raise.  I have no doubt our guests will appear before the joint committee again to discuss similar issues.</p></speech>

He has come, at very short notice, to update the committee on the humanitarian work of Syria Civil Defence.  He is very welcome.  This presentation will provide the committee with an opportunity to receive, at first hand, an account of the situation on the ground which is very important for us as parliamentarians because there are so many atrocities happening in Syria.  I thank Ms Valerie Hughes, who is the Gallery, for her efforts to ensure that Mr. Habib could attend today's meeting and the Irish embassy in Ankara for ensuring that a travel visa was issued to enable Mr. Habib to get here in time.</p><p>We look forward to the presentation, which includes a short video.  The committee has taken a very keen interest in Syria and has had numerous meetings with many non-governmental organisations, NGOs, about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in recent months.  We are very concerned about it.  The media moves from story to story and what is happening in Syria is often left unreported and we only know what continues to happen there, at the expense of women, children and families because of people like Mr. Habib and the NGOs working in the country.  We are delighted to have Mr. Habib here today.  I will invite him to make a short presentation and then committee members will ask questions.</p><p>Before we begin today's proceedings, I remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference even in silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I would like also to thank the Irish people for their generosity in hosting Syrian refugees.  We, as Syrians, have huge respect for the people of Ireland, who historically supported the rights of oppressed people in the Middle East.</p> <p>  My name is Farouq Habib.  When the Syrian revolution began, I was working as a banker in a private Syrian bank.  My belief that my people have the right to live with dignity and freedom obliged me to join the peaceful movement to defend human rights in Syria.  Currently, I am working for Mayday Rescue Foundation, managing the training and equipment programme for SCD rescue teams in Syria and acting as a political adviser to their leadership.  The White Helmets is an organisation of more than 2,700 volunteers operating from 111 centres across eight provinces in Syria from the south to the north, founded on the values of impartiality and humanity.  It is currently the largest grassroots organisation inside Syria established for, and working on, a response to indiscriminate attacks on civilians, especially from barrel bombs.  It does this by conducting search and rescue operations, fire fighting and emergency evacuation, and carries out these tasks daily.  To this day, the teams have rescued more than 30,000 civilians from under the rubble.  Please see this video as a short testimony of our work.  It was made by one of my colleagues.</p></speech>

Many of the committee members have probably heard about this horrific weapon, which is specifically designed to impose mass punishment on civilian communities out of the regime's control.  These crude bombs, which are simply explosive-filled fuel barrels that eject nails, scrap metal and other random cheap but deadly shrapnel, take dozens of innocent lives every day.  These primitive, cheap and indiscriminate weapons have become a source of constant panic among Syrian civilians, especially when the regime fills them with chlorine gas.</p> <p>  While responding to these attacks, the search and rescue teams face twice the danger because as Qassem explained in the video, the Syrian Air Force has adopted a technique in carrying out its attacks, referred to as the "double tap", where the aircraft returns again to bomb the same location minutes later to kill rescue workers and first responders.</p><p>Now the Russians are using the same illegal tactics to kill first responders, in contravention of international humanitarian law.  The White Helmets, as a humanitarian organisation, demand that all parties to the conflict stop targeting civilians, although when we say "all parties to the conflict," we do not imply that the violations are committed equally by all of them.  The world knows who started the killing and who owns the planes, rockets, chemical weapons and security apparatus that have been responsible for tens of thousands of assassinations, detentions and cases of torture.</p><p> All the world heard about the terrorist actions of ISIS against the Syrian people; however, some people forgot about the mass killing perpetrated by Assad&rsquo;s dictatorial government.  While ISIS is theatrically barbaric, it has killed only a few thousand Syrian civilians.  By contrast, of the 250,000 to 300,000 people estimated to have been killed in the war, approximately 180,000 were civilians killed by the regime.  Let me say that again: the regime has murdered more than 180,000 civilians, mostly through indiscriminate aerial bombardment.</p><p> In the past two years, 109 White Helmet volunteers were killed in the line of duty; 105 of them were killed by the Assad regime and its allies, mostly due to the double-tap tactic that is deliberately used and that aims to hit the largest number of civilians and volunteers who gather to rescue and provide help after an attack.  Other than that, many health facilities, civil defence centres, ambulances and fire engines are being deliberately targeted and partly or entirely destroyed.  Just yesterday, Abdulrazzak Aboud, a colleague and rescue worker, was killed by what is believed to be a double-tap Russian attack on Sarmin village in Idleb.</p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, when the Syrian people started the revolution for freedom and dignity, they believed all the free world would support them based on our joint values and dreams of peace and justice.  This is what we expect from you and from all of our friends: to advocate for the legitimate rights of the Syrian people, by recognising our right to live under a civilised and democratic regime, with no dictatorship and no extremism; to put pressure on the UN Security Council to ensure the protection of civilians and create safe zones for them to enable the Syrian people to build an alternative; and to provide humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people in Syria, who are in a living hell in the areas out of the control of the regime - the regime which controls only 14% of  the Syrian territories and receives most of the UN aid.</p></speech>

The video and the presentation put the situation into perspective for us.  We are all aware that the situation is complex and that there are no easy answers.  However, as a Syrian and as someone on the ground, what does Mr. Al Habib believe needs to happen for the conflict to be resolved for the long term?  There are no short-term solutions.  Does he think international involvement is a help or a hindrance?</p></speech>

This is our main demand.  Because of the continuous killing in Syria and because of the lack of a political vision, people from all sides use violence to achieve what they believe are their rights.  We believe democracy can offer a platform and create a path for the Syrian people to live in peace, get their rights and get rid of dictatorship and extremism in Syria.</p> <p>  On whether international intervention can help achieve that, based on our bloody experience of the past years, it has not helped.  There was international intervention, even if all of the world has claimed it has not interfered in Syria.  Of course there was intervention.  The war in Syria has tended gradually towards being a proxy war between many regional and international players, and we as Syrians pay the price for that.  Now the crisis is spilling over, and I admit that we as Syrians are not able to end this catastrophe alone.  We need support from the international community, based on values and not only on the interests of states.  We need to stop all foreign fighters from being able to come to Syria.  When we say "all," I do not mean only Sunni fighters who come from Libya or Tunisia.  We also mean the jet fighters that come from Iran, the Hezbollah and Afghanistan.  When we call for a stop to the shipment of arms, we mean arms for all parties.  Until now, there has been no international pressure to do this.  All we have seen are resolutions from the Security Council and meetings and speeches.  The Security Council itself does not respect the resolutions it makes.</p></speech>

We all share his belief that the Syrian people have the right to live in dignity and freedom.  I have just a few questions.  How many volunteers do the White Helmets have overall and how many teams have been created?  Mr. Al Habib stated in his presentation that they operate in 111 centres and eight provinces.  What opposition groups are in control in those areas?  Do the White Helmets operate in areas where ISIL or al-Nusra operate, or are they in Kurdish areas?  Can Mr. Al Habib give us some sense of the extent of the areas they operate in?  What outside and international support have the White Helmets received, have they received training from other civil defence organisations or where do they get support from?</p> <p>  Mr. Al Habib spoke about the Russian bombing and the double-tap tactic.  We would all agree that the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime.  Is evidence being collated in regard to those war crimes, particularly in regard to Russia?  What does Mr. Al Habib see as the next step for the international community in regard to this?  I know Mr. Al Habib recently visited the United Nations and spoke there.  What message did he give and what demands did he make of the international community?</p></speech>

Its main aim is to provide assistance and rescue people, regardless of background.  The teams extend their activities to wherever they are allowed to operate.  At present, they exist in the eight regions from Dara'a to Aleppo.  This includes areas under the control of the FSA, the Free Syrian Army, and those under the control of al-Nusra.  There is one station in al-Baab, which is under the control of ISIS, and a station in Afrin, which is under the control of the Kurdish forces.  Therefore, we work in areas under the control of all of the non-Assad groups.  Most of the areas accept the work of the rescue teams because they are neutral and do not represent a political threat to them.  They just provide assistance, regardless of the background of the casualty.</p> <p>  The White Helmets do not exist in the regime areas because, from the first day of the revolution, the regime intended to prevent any attempt by civil society to build any alternative type of institution - not only search and rescue teams but also local councils, electricity stations or anything that would allow people to live sustainably.</p><p> We currently receive international support from the UK and Denmark governments in training and equipment.  We receive support from the United States through RTI to provide vehicles, ambulances and fire engines.  We received support from the government of Japan also.  Of course, we co-operate with other civil defence teams.  When we started, we did not have the experience, and we realised later that sometimes rescue teams can cause more damage to the injured people if they are not well trained in how to rescue and transport them.  We received training first from AKUT, the search and rescue organisation in Turkey.  We co-operated with the fire brigade in London, which sent us some of its used equipment.  Just last week we received an offer of co-operation with the chairman of the civil defence and we are always happy to co-operate with rescue teams worldwide that can help us.  We dream of the day when we will be able to provide assistance for other people in other countries.</p><p> The double-tap tactic is documented in so many videos.  I can send a web link to the committee, as just a week ago this happened during a live broadcast on al-Jazeera television at noon.  After the first attack, an al-Jazeera reporter was filming live how the rescue workers were trying to search for the injured people under rubble.  While they were broadcasting, another air strike bombed the same place and one rescue worker was killed.  His name was Issam al-Saleh.  I can provide the video and pictures, and there are many other related videos.</p></speech>

Initially, the Americans, the UK and various others offered practical support but it does not seem to be making any impact on the overall and ongoing struggle, strife and war that is taking place.</p> <p>  Some lessons have been learned from the past, as we know, particularly with regard to the Americans in Iraq.  The exit strategy did not exist, but when they left the country, it was left in a worse state than before.  There is a reluctance to repeat that.  Similarly, in other countries such as Libya, where there was an intervention on the side of the angels or the righteous, unfortunately it brought about tragedy as well.  There were more refugees, more strife and more loss of life.  Those events are ongoing.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses, who work on the ground, tell us what might make the most practical impact at this stage?  Who can intervene to bring about a ceasefire?  For example, we all support the objective of a democratic resolution.  Unfortunately, ISIS is not known for democracy, and that is another part of the problem.  Is there one particular issue to which we can lend ourselves that would be of help in bringing about a ceasefire?  Nothing will happen unless this happens first.  Will the regime capitulate, or is that likely?  I do not believe so on the information we have.  Does the international community have sufficient influence to bring about a cessation of violence on both sides?</p> <p>  This is a tragic issue and I do not know the answer.  It is appalling and it is going on before our eyes.  Arising from that is the refugee issue, and the free world has not covered itself in glory in that respect either.  The European Union and the UN must address that issue in a much more serious way than they have done so far.  We have discussed the matter here on many occasions.  I am depressed by the inability of the international community to make a meaningful contribution that would alleviate the problems described by the witness.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Farouq Al Habib" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015102100002#F00400"><p>As an individual, I am happy to accept any compromise that stops the killing in Syria.  Will accepting Assad, even for a transitional period, help to stop the killing in Syria?  I believe it will not help anyway because there are already tens of thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands - of armed men in Syria, and every one of them has a personal revenge to exact on the Assad family.  Assad became a symbol of killing.  I know, of course, that the leaders in the security departments in the middle levels might be more responsible for killing as they gave orders on a daily basis and tortured detainees.  Most of them are not known to the public and their names are not known.  Assad is a symbol now and as long as this symbol is in Damascus, nobody could convince thousands of armed men to lay down their arms, stop the fight and respect the transition.  Nobody would believe in it.</p> <p>  We have an example from when Ali Abdullah Saleh stayed in Yemen after what they called the transition.  He was able to blow everything and destroy the process because these family governments ruling the Middle East control the security departments that control the state.  Our states in the Middle East are not controlled by the Ministers that one sees in meetings.  In Syria, we know from experience that a security officer is much more influential than a Minister responsible for defence or the interior.  Those security officers are linked to the family that has ruled Syria for 50 years.  As long as they are there, they will be able to destroy the transitional process.</p> <p>  We receive support from the US, the UK and other governments, but what kind is it?  As rescue workers, we receive support to retrieve the dead and injured from under rubble after an attack, but we ask for help in stopping these attacks.  Before I go on a trip to attend a meeting, I ask my colleagues what kind of assistance we must seek to be able to conduct more operations.  They tell me they do not want to conduct more operations; rather, they want to stop.  Stopping the killing will not come with this type of assistance.</p> <p>  The Americans are not successful in interventions.  We have our experience in the Middle East.  There is already intervention in Syria and boots on the ground from Iran, jihadis and, recently, Russia.</p><p>While the free world stays silent and says it is against intervention, other countries which support dictatorship and are against human rights interfere anyway.  As the UK foreign minister declared three days ago, 85% of the Russian attacks until now targeted areas that are not controlled by ISIS.  What will be the end of this?  What will happen if the free world does not intervene and the others intervene and target the moderate opposition?  This crisis will not end if our friends leave us alone.  It will explode and continue to spill over.  The refugee crisis and extremism in Syria are symptoms of the original disease, which is dictatorship, atrocities and a lack of political hope.  As long as Syrian civilians do not have a safe place in Syria and civil society does not create an environment in which to build an alternative, extremism and the refugee crisis will continue.</p></speech>

How much UN aid is being given to the regime and how is the UN doing this?  That is one of the key elements.  I was talking to Robert Fisk, who would probably be the pre-eminent authority in media circles on the situation in Syria and the Middle East.  He has been an observer there for more than four decades.  When I asked him what the solution was, he said he did not know.  I asked him what would happen next and he said he did not know because the situation is the worst he had ever seen.  It is now more unstable than it has been at any time over the past 50 years.  There are too many actors and too many foreign interests with competing outcomes they wish to see.  There is nobody with any moral authority left because those who should have acted earlier have not done so and they continue to fail to act.  Could Mr. Al Habib clarify how UN aid is being given to the regime?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Farouq Al Habib" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015102100002#G00300"><p>Until February or March of this year when the Security Council amplified the cross-border operation, almost all of the UN aid went to areas under the control of the regime.  This allowed the UN to channel assistance without the permission of the Syrian Government.  Until now, the cross-border operations represented a small percentage of the total UN aid.  I do not have the precise figures but we know that a big portion of UN aid goes to refugees outside Syria.  Of course, we want our bodies and people who escape to have access to assistance but we know the most vulnerable people are those who are still inside Syria are under siege and are suffering indiscriminate bombardment.  The second part goes to the areas under the control of the regime.  We witnessed this ourselves.  Most UN employees prefer to sit in hotels and offices in safer places than those where massacres take place or in Lattakia because in those areas, there is electricity and clean water and no airstrikes.  Nobody would shell them.  For this reason, most of the projects implemented by the UN inside Syria are in areas under the control of the regime because it is a safe environment in which to implement projects.  Of course, it is easier but are the people who live there the most vulnerable people?  Of course, they are not.  The northern countryside of Homs, which is under siege from the regime and ISIS, has been under siege for more than two years.  As a result of this shelling, people escape from one village to another within the same circle of the siege.  They do not see the UN convoys for six or seven months.  They see them only twice or a maximum of three times a year because it is complicated, bureaucratic and too difficult.</p> <p>  On the other side, Syrian civil society organisations merged in the areas beyond the control of the regime.  They try to build an alternative and establish NGOs or associations.  It is too difficult for them to get access to international aid because they cannot be registered, have bank accounts or meet the bureaucratic requirements of the big UN organisations.  This is the real situation.  We hear about huge funds in Syrian Civil Defence meetings but only a small percentage reaches the most vulnerable people inside Syria.  </p></speech>

It is an opportunity for him to keep us all focused on this very serious international crisis.  I welcome the visitors to the Public Gallery who have certainly been playing their part in keeping this crisis at the forefront of our thoughts.  We have had ongoing discussions in this committee.  I am very impressed with the figures given by Mr. Al Habib about the amazing amount of rescues the Syrian Civil Defence has conducted with a relatively small number of volunteers.  Are there any other civil defence organisations working on the ground alongside the Syrian Civil Defence to rescue people who are injured and seriously incapacitated?  In light of the years of conflict, what are the facilities at the hospitals and treatment centres like once the Syrian Civil Defence has rescued people?  Is the Syrian Civil Defence involved in assisting relief agencies trying to get supplies and relief to many people who are seriously discommoded as a result of the bombing?  I know that relief agencies have been having serious difficulties in getting relief to the most needy.</p> <p>  We had discussions here some time ago about a peace charter.  What is the status of this in Syria?  Is there support for it or is there much active consideration among ordinary Syrians as to what final solution they would like to see?  Is the peace charter which was presented to us some time ago being actively pursued?  </p> <p>  Does Mr. Al Habib see any possibility that the crisis that is evolving in Europe, in respect of the number of refugees coming here, may put political pressure on or force EU countries to take a more active role in trying to broker a solution to the crisis in Syria?  What would be Mr. Al Habib's one big request to this committee and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to help resolve the appalling situation in his country?  I know that the involvement of so many other stakeholders such as Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia complicates the situation.  It is hard to see where a solution will come from in the short term.  What would Mr. Al Habib like the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to do, both in Europe and internationally?  </p></speech>

We ourselves do not operate health facilities or hospitals.  Our role is to provide the first response and to take the injured people to the field hospitals or to the other health facilities.  We are always happy, of course, to provide logistical assistance to the relief organisations because the Syrian Civil Defence has the ability on the ground to cross most of the lines and all checkpoints in the areas out of the regime's control.  Most of those areas allow the Syrian Civil Defence convoys to cross because of its neutrality.  Consequently, we had joint projects in the past with many non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to channel their assistance to the heart of each area.</p><p> The refugee crisis will put pressure on European governments, as well as on other governments.  We always want to tell our friends in Europe and other hosting governments that we need them both to provide assistance to those refugees who have arrived on their shores and to help us to solve the problem at the source because unless that is solved, there always will be refugees who will arrive.  Incidentally, those refugees arriving in those countries might not be the most vulnerable people who need the assistance.  Those people had some connections, some relationships and perhaps some money to be able to pay to the smugglers, to travel and arrive here.  While we thank you very much for the warm welcome and for hosting of our brothers and our friends who arrived in your countries, we need you to help us to solve the crisis in our country because there is no country like one's home country.</p><p> Honestly, I am not aware of the peace charter to which Senator Mullins referred.  What does he mean?  Does that initiative have another name and by whom was that peace charter submitted?  Is it linked to the Geneva track?</p></speech>

However, we trust Rafif Jouejati.  I believe she expresses our thoughts and our beliefs.</p> <p>  As to what we expect from the joint committee and the Irish Government, we are aware Ireland is not a member of NATO and that Ireland alone would not be able to find a solution in Syria.  However, we ask that Ireland continues to advocate for the same rights and values which we share, that is, the values of human beings in Syria and the rights of the Syrian people to live in democracy and freedom.  Ireland should put pressure on other states in Europe and the United Nations to take decisive actions if not to stop the crisis in the short term but at least to try to ease it and make it more difficult for the criminals who now act in Syria to continue their operations.  For example, we are surprised by how there has been no decisive action up to now to prevent foreign, non-Syrian fighters coming to Syria.  They cross the borders, as I stated earlier both from Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and other countries.  It is organised and public and nobody speaks about it or about the shipments of arms and the transfers of money.  We need Ireland to exert pressure to stop this and to pass on our message that dictatorship and continuous atrocities fuel extremism.  Extremism is a symptom, not the disease itself, and without building democracy in Syria, extremism and the refugee problem will not be solved.</p></speech>

Mr. Al Habib mentioned his role as a political adviser.  On the valuable and important work he does in highlighting the need to get humanitarian aid to those people in most need, members often have discussed the failure of the United Nations in many crises to be an effective world organisation or to bring about a satisfactory conclusion to many conflicts throughout the world.  Has Mr. Al Habib's organisation had an opportunity to speak directly to officials from or to some part of the United Nations?  At what international fora has Mr. Al Habib had the opportunity to make the presentation he has given to this joint committee?  Once again, in respect of creating awareness and getting out the message regarding the huge suffering and the horrors inflicted by the Assad regime in the mass murder of Syrian people, including civilians, it is most important to take every opportunity to highlight and to bring to the public's attention the desperate deeds of that regime because sometimes an individual crisis may not get the attention it deserves as there are so many crises throughout the world.  However, in respect of specific contact, communication or engagement with the United Nations or some of its constituent bodies, has Mr. Al Habib's organisation had that opportunity?</p></speech>

As I stated before the Deputy arrived, working with the United Nations is a slow bureaucratic process.  Regrettably, we believe most UN offices and teams are not able to adapt their internal policies and procedures to the hard conditions in which we work.  However, we had several meetings in the past with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, team in Turkey and in Jordan, while trying to co-ordinate with it.  Until recently, it was not legally possible for OCHA to provide direct assistance to the White Helmets because it is not registered as a legal entity anywhere.  This is because we operate in Syria and there is no government in our area with which to legally register.  Two weeks ago, we heard from OCHA that it now is able to co-operate with non-registered organisations.  Consequently, we submitted a file requesting to be added to its platform.  In any event, my point is there are many bureaucratic obstacles and it was easier for us to work directly with governments and agencies, such as USAID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Japan International Cooperation Agency as well as with international NGOs like Handicap International or others.  However, until now, we have not worked with the UN.</p></speech>

I will make a few brief points.  Can Mr. Al Habib pinpoint or give members a view as to when the breakdown in Syria happened?  Fifteen or 20 years ago, one would have thought Syria was doing reasonably well and there were not that many difficulties there.  What was the spark or the straw that broke the camel's back that caused these difficulties to break out in Syria?  I believe Mr. Al Habib also mentioned in his submission to beware the refugees who come here and perhaps not to take them at face value, because some of them may be here because they are well connected or whatever.</p><p>We hear on occasion that the groups fleeing are composed not of family units but mainly of young males between certain ages.  Will Mr. Al Habib give his perspective on that?</p><p> I am not saying that Mr. Al Habib goes easy on ISIS in his presentation, but he does not seem to be as critical of it as one might expect.  Here in the West we are very aware of the dramatic and barbaric incidents for which that group is responsible, as he did mention.  Does Mr. Al Habib see any future for the Assad regime or will it not, in his view, be part of the solution?</p></speech>

Syria was not okay ten or 15 years ago.  There was continuous killing and assassination, but the world was not aware of it.  For 50 years, the same party - the Ba'ath Party - ruled Syria, including 44 years under the rule of the Assad family.  During those decades, there were always assassinations of political figures.  Leaders of Syrian society were arrested and imprisoned, some of them for ten, 20 or 28 years, like Riad al-Turk, a leader of the Syrian Communist Party.  The suffering continued but people did not dare to speak out about the atrocities.  There was no Internet in Syria, no foreign media and no free press.  People did not have a chance to pass the message on.</p> <p>  Syrian society was boiling in silence until the Arab Spring arrived.  When we saw how the regime was changed in Tunisia in three days and in Egypt in three weeks, we thought we would have the same experience, that through peaceful protests we would be able to create a new destiny for our country.  We started peacefully - indeed, Bashar al-Assad himself admitted in one interview that the protests were unarmed for six months before the militarisation of the opposition.  Even now, there is still a moderate movement on the ground, on the civilian side and the miliary side.  Of course, it is not well organised because of the continuous killing and the catastrophic conditions.  One cannot imagine how difficult it is to arrange a meeting inside Syria.  How can one build a national institution under daily bombardment?</p> <p>  ISIS is, of course, an enemy for the Syrian people and for people like me.  I am wanted by ISIS and al-Qaeda, accused of being an agent for the West because I manage the funds we receive from Western governments.  If they arrest me, they will kill me.  Likewise, if members of Assad's security arrest me, they will kill me.  I was arrested and detained for two and a half months in Syria by Assad's security department.  I was detained in a branch called the "Palestine branch" in Damascus, because the regime accuses the opposition of being agents of Israel and all these conspiracy theories.  I was not released until my friends paid almost $20,000 as a bribe to the security officers.  Otherwise, I would not be sitting here today.</p> <p>  Assad is an enemy and ISIS is an enemy.  The important point, however, is that extremism in Syria is a symptom and it did not start with the revolution.  Assad released al-Qaeda detainees who were in Sednaya Prison in July or August 2011.  Now we see them as heads of armed groups.  They include, for example, Zahran Alloush, head of Jaysh al-Islam, the previous head of Ahrar ash-Sham, and most of the leaders of ISIS and the al-Nusra Front.  These people were detained in Assad's prisons when the revolution started.  He then released them, however, and by way of the continuous killing, he pushed the people to carry arms.</p></speech>

The big question for the international community, given the ineffectiveness of the United Nations and the veto used by Russia, is how we can get to an international position that will allow for a transition in Syria.  Is that not the kernel of the problem, that no progress can be made until there is a satisfactory transition mechanism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Farouq Al Habib" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015102100002#J00400"><p>It is the responsibility of politicians, not people like me.  The Syrian people do not believe the superpowers - the United States, for example - have done all they can do to stop the crisis in Syria and defend the Syrian people.  There is a huge frustration inside the country because of that negative position.  More pressure should be put on Iran, for instance, to stop sending fighters and arms to the regime.  Pressure should be put on Russia, not only because of Syria but also because of Ukraine and other countries.  There should be pressure on Lebanon to close its borders and prevent members of Hezbollah from crossing over.  There should be no partnership with dictators in the Middle East.  Aiming to fight extremism in that way will not work because it fuels extremism, gives more justification for the extremists and allows them to win support from the oppressed people.  Dictatorship is not a replacement for what is there.  When people lose hope in a political solution and these extremist groups offer a way to have revenge, it makes it easier for them to recruit young people, especially from poor environments and those who are not well educated.</p> <p>  The first step, therefore, must be to put pressure on to end dictatorship, not only in Syria but in the region.  Concerning my country specifically, the way forward is obvious for us.  First, we must stop the flow of non-Syrian fighters and the flow of arms into Syria.</p></speech>

The problem, however, is to do with the logistics.  How does one convince the Russians not to become involved, as they have already been well and truly established for several years now?  On the other side, we have the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and various other states with a different view, which is supportive of the revolution.  What happens unless troops are put on the ground and what are the prospects if that does happen?  I do not expect it to happen.  In my view, the experience of Iraq will be the deterrent that prevents the international community from becoming too deeply involved in any strife.  I absolutely agree with Mr. Al Habib's attitude to dictatorships, but the difficulty is that the experience has been that one dictatorship can be replaced by another, and that, unfortunately, has never changed.  In the international scheme of things, that is the way it goes.  Violence begets violence.</p> <p>  Deputies Timmins and Smith referred to the need to identify some type of compromise that will bring the violence to an end.</p><p>It will not happen otherwise.  The regime will not concede.  It is well armed with a good supply of arms.  There is a network across the Middle East.  There is a fear in Iran that it could go the same way as Iraq and that something similar could happen there.  I am deeply suspicious of anything associated with ISIS because its members are certainly not democrats.  They overran Iraq when the international community, in particular the US, decided it was going to withdraw, which was not the greatest decision it ever made.  Almost instantly after that it had revenue sources and oil wealth and it is the government now.  At the same time, it does not recognise government anywhere else.  It is a serious issue.  We discussed this matter in Luxembourg a few weeks ago at the Defence and Security Committee.  The issue is that the global community is trying to deal with the growing refugee issue that has been generated by this strife in this area.  The atrocities are growing on a daily basis.  The international community wants to do the right thing but what can it do?  What can it do so long as the violence continues?  The question has been asked before.  Will Mr. Al Habib hint at how there might be a compromise and a cessation of violence, at least for a while, in order to identify what the global community can do?  It would be willing to do something in those circumstances.</p></speech>

Mr. Al Habib has mentioned Lebanon and its borders that prevent Hezbollah from crossing the border.  I was in Damascus 20 years ago and I got the impression that it was a police state.  I went from Damascus to Beirut, across the Beqaa Valley, and all of northern Lebanon was occupied by Syrians and there were Syrian checkpoints.  Does Syria still occupy northern Lebanon?  What is the situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Farouq Al Habib" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015102100002#K00500"><p>I will reply directly.  There are no Syrian checkpoints in Lebanon because Lebanon is controlled by Hezbollah.  The Syrian army does not need to exist on the ground in Lebanon as long as its closest ally is able to conduct any action it needs in Lebanon.</p> <p>  How does one identify refugees?  I am not an expert in that regard.  Ireland needs to co-ordinate with other European countries to establish a unit for due diligence to examine the history of those refugees, for example to look at their Facebook or Twitter pages because we heard that some of those who were involved in atrocities in Syria, both from the extremist side and from the Assad security or army forces, decided to retire to Europe.  We need Europe to conduct due diligence and not offer them a happy life here after all the crimes they have committed in Syria.  </p> <p>  I do not trust the Russians, but if I did I would tell them that what they are doing is threatening their national security and the security of Europe.  Can they imagine the position of people who were already under siege by indiscriminate shelling by barrel bombs from the regime and suddenly the Russians attack them?  The first air strike by the Russians was on the northern countryside of Homs where there was a big battle against ISIS four months ago to kick it out of the region.  ISIS is no longer in that region.  The first air strike by Russia was on that area where there is no ISIS and which lost more than 100 armed men in the fight with ISIS.  They were bombed and on the same day the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow announced that it is a holy battle.  Can the committee imagine the reaction of the Muslims there?  It was of great assistance to the extremists to tell people that this is a serious campaign against Islam and Muslims and has nothing to do with extremists because the Russians bombed non-ISIS areas.  They bombed some FSA groups which were armed by the Americans and had been vetted and identified as moderate opposition.  They bombed the building of the local council in Tel Bisi which is a civil society organisation elected by the people.  These actions fuel extremism and jeopardise the position of counter-extremism.  It threatens national security in Russia and Europe.  Russia should be convinced that if it continues to support the Assad regime it will mean the expansion of extremism in Syria.  </p> <p>  We would be happy to have compromise.  Just before the Geneva II meeting, I was in Yabroud in the Damascus countryside and I met with fighters from an FSA group.  I told them that after the meeting in Geneva there might be a compromise with the Assad government, and asked them would they stop fighting and what they would do if the leader of their armed group rejected the Geneva agreement.  They told me that if the politicians in Geneva reached a compromise without Assad, because, as I said, he is a symbol, they would kill their leader if he stood against the agreement.  All of those young men are tired.  They are human beings like us.  They just want to go back to their families.  They have been forced to carry arms to defend their territories and they just want to go back home to see their children and their mothers.  We cannot have transition with the symbols of killing, from all sides, not only from the regime side.  All those who provoke the other side, either the leaders of the Syrian army or the leaders of specific armed groups and the opposition should be isolated from the transitional governing body.  The transitional governing body should be made up of people from both sides who are in the middle or close to the middle.  We cannot have those symbols.  There are tens of thousands of armed men and nobody can control them now if they are not offered an alternative, a way to convince them that they can have their rights and justice without arms.  This might be with part of the Syrian Government, by the way.</p></speech>

I ask the question in the context of what Mr. Al Habib has said.  I understand his position.  I am very supportive of Ireland taking in Syrian refugees.  I was instrumental in our local authority passing a motion to that effect.  Mr. Al Habib has made the important point that there should be due diligence.  My concern is that due diligence is not in place.  If anyone has evidence that people who should not be coming in are coming in there should be a mechanism to look at that.</p></speech>

At that stage there will be a process there for these people coming in.</p> <p>  Mr. Al Habib has created great interest among the members of the committee in today's session.</p><p>As I said at the beginning of the meeting, it was important for us to get a graphic account of exactly what is happening from somebody like Mr. Al Habib.  I admire the work he is doing for the White Helmets.  We must also pay tribute to the first responders, those people who gave up their lives to help others and those who continue to do so in these areas.  </p><p> I visited the Turkish border earlier this year with GOAL and met some Syrian refugees and orphans.  We heard the graphic stories of what happens when there is a bombing from the air and about the dreadful atrocities that result.  We have given millions of euro to help the humanitarian crisis in Syria, and will continue to do so because we have an excellent track record in humanitarian aid.  Ireland has long called for the implementation of the Geneva principles of non-violence, a transitional government and a constitutional process that protects the multiethnic population.  We have constantly called on the UN Security Council to uphold international law in Syria, and will continue to do so.  </p><p> This has been a very interesting meeting.  There were quite a lot of exchanges between Mr. Al Habib and members, and it is to be hoped he keeps in touch with us.  He should keep up the great work he is doing but, as he rightly pointed out, it is dangerous.  Many of his members were killed.  We will keep Syria very much to the forefront of our minds in the committee for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> As Mr. Al Habib said, the situation is complex and difficult, and there is no short-term solution.  Even if we discussed the issue for another day or two we would not come up with a solution.  In the end, no matter what conflict is happening people will have to sit down and talk because that is the only way it will end.  I thank Mr. Al Habib for the frank and open manner in which he dealt with the questions.  We look forward to keeping in touch.  On behalf of the committee I thank him for coming before us.  I also thank Ms Valerie Hughes.  </p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with some of those who made a written submission to the committee on the general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill.  I ask everybody to turn off mobile phones or put them on airplane or silent mode as they interfere with the recording system.</p><p>From the Victims' Rights Alliance, we are joined by Ms Maria McDonald and Ms Joan Deane.  From Safe Ireland, we are joined by Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson.  From Rape Crisis Network Ireland, we are joined by Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar.  From the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, we are joined by Ms Grainia Long and Ms Mary Nicholson.  From the Irish Penal Reform Trust, we are joined by Ms Deirdre Malone.  From the Children's Rights Alliance, we are joined by Ms Catriona Doherty.  From Facing Forward, we are joined by Mr. Niall Counihan and Ms Jacinta De Paor, and from the Dublin Race Crisis Centre, we are joined by Ms Ellen O'Malley-Dunlop and Ms Shirley Scott.  I welcome all the witnesses and thank them for attending.  I acknowledge also the people in the public Galley who are here to witness proceedings.</p><p>On the format of the meeting, I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members.  Members will be coming and going as other business is taking place in the House.  I have to leave at some stage because I have tabled a parliamentary question which is due to be answered in the House but I will return.  The Vice Chairman will take over when I leave.  Apologies in advance for having to do that but it is out of my control.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the situation regarding privilege.  They should note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded that under the rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The purpose of the meeting is pre-legislative scrutiny of this proposed legislation.  We have had quite a number of these meetings in recent years.  It has been an extremely useful and important process where individual citizens and members of various interest groups including non-governmental organisations and others like those the witnesses represent can have an input into legislation before it is even published.  Our experience has been that this process has a huge impact on legislation in that when it comes out of the process at the other end, it is much better.  It is a completely new reform.  I hear people talking about parliamentary reform.  This is one of the biggest reforms I have seen in my 19 years here, and Parliament appreciates the witnesses' time, expertise and work they put into this process.  I invite Ms McDonald to make a five minute presentation.  We are restricting the opening statements to five minutes because the question-and-answer session is very interesting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015102100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Victims Rights Alliance, VRA.  The VRA is an alliance of victim support and human rights organisations in Ireland, namely, Advocates for Victims of Homicide, the CARI Foundation, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, the Irish Road Victims Association, the Irish Tourist Assistance Service, One in Four, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, SAFE Ireland, Support after Homicide and Victim Support at Court.  The VRA was formed with one key goal: to ensure the victims&rsquo; directive is implemented in Ireland for the benefit of all victims of crime.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, the scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill 2015 endeavours to transpose the EU victims directive.  The directive provides for minimum rights, supports and protections regardless of the residential status of the victim.  It must be transposed by 16 November 2015.  The VRA has welcomed the publication of the Bill.  However, it must be strengthened if it is to comply with the directive and in its current format it is in breach of the directive.<br/><br/>Victims have been let down by the criminal justice system, as illustrated by the Guerin report and the Garda Inspectorate report.  A survey conducted by VRA members indicated that 72% of victims felt re-victimised by the criminal justice system and, as I will outline, the Bill does not go far enough to prevent re-victimisation.  First, head 16 of the Bill does not provide for protection measures required under Article 23(3)(b) of the directive, which states that measures must be made available to avoid unnecessary questioning concerning the victim's private life not related to the criminal offence.  This has not been legislated for and is in breach of the directive.  The inclusion of this measure is essential to prevent re-victimisation.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, EU law takes precedence over Irish law.  In addition, Irish law must be interpreted in a manner which is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  I draw the committee's attention to a recent judgment of that court in the case of Y. <i>v.</i>Slovenia in which it held and made clear that the rights of the victims must be balanced with those of the accused.  I will quote from that judgment, which states, &quot;a person&rsquo;s right to defend himself does not provide for an unlimited right to use any defence [and] the Court considers that &quot;cross-examination should not be used as a means of intimidating or humiliating witnesses&quot;.</p><p>It is imperative that this issue be legislated for.  Failure to do so will result in victims being re-victimised by cross-examination.  Consideration should be given to providing victims with legal aid when attempts are being made to cross-examine in such an instance.</p><p> Second, the use of intermediaries in court was first permitted under the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, which was introduced 23 years ago.  There is no panel of trained intermediaries and there are no guidelines on their use.  I understand that they have been used only once in 23 years.  The use of intermediaries is also provided for under this legislation to protect victims' rights.  It is essential that intermediaries can be used in practice.  In order to ensure this, additional guidelines will be required and additional measures will need to be implemented. </p><p> Third, information is key if a victim is to be able to access rights under the directive.  Head 4 of the Bill provides that certain information must be provided to victims of crime by the Garda.  However, according to the directive, this information should be made available at first contact and without unnecessary delay.  A significant number of victims never make contact with the Garda but they are still entitled to their rights under the directive.  Article 4 of the directive envisages that information should be made available by other bodies, such as the HSE.  Head 4 should be extended to the HSE so victims can be provided with information in order that they can access their rights under the directive.</p><p> It is all very well providing information to victims of crime but they must be able to understand it.  The directive is very clear that there is a right to translation.  The Bill, however, does not provide for the right to translation.  Head 19(3) states the Minister can make regulations for interpretation and translation.  However, according to case law from the Supreme Court, the Minister cannot make regulations when principles and policies concerning the right itself are not included in the legislation.  This change must be made to comply with the directive.</p><p> The Bill fails to provide for the right to victim support services.  Victims have a right to access victim support services, including counselling and shelters, free of charge for a period before, during and after any criminal investigation.  It is essential that this right be included in the Bill.</p><p> Budget 2016 included a welcome increase of 21% in the Victims of Crime Office funding to &euro;1.5 million.  An increase of 21% may appear significant but this amounts to an increase of approximately &euro;300,000 for 50 victim support organisations.  That is an extra &euro;6,000 per organisation.  VRA member organisations rely on volunteers. For example, Advocates for Victims of Homicide, Support after Homicide and the Irish Road Victims' Association have no paid staff and rely on volunteers.  They will struggle to survive in the longer term without paid staff.  The Victims of Crime Office does not provide for advocacy services.  VRA is one such organisation.  We have no funding and we will not be in a position to continue working together without access to funding.</p><p> The Garda will be required to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services under the Bill and the directive.  Head 6(6) of the Bill outlines a three-step test for referral.  First, the victim must consent to the referral.  However, the second and third aspects of the test are subjective in that the Garda will consider whether the victim's ability to consider a support service is limited and whether a victim might benefit from contact with such a service.  A victim has a right to access to victim support services under the directive and it should not be limited by whether a garda believes a victim may benefit from victim support services.  Consent should be the only requirement.</p><p> Head 30 of the Bill provides for grievance procedures.  The VRA is of the view that an office of a victims ombudsman or victims commissioner should be established to deal with victims' complaints.  A victims ombudsman could form part of an existing ombudsman&rsquo;s office to reduce costs.</p><p> One cannot underestimate the impact that the victims directive and the Bill, if transposed fully, will have on victims of crime in Ireland.  The members are the watchdogs of this legislation and I implore them to do as much as possible to ensure it complies with the directive.  It will change lives. </p></speech>

Today, we have released our annual national one-day census, which outlines the daily reality for 475 women and 301 children in Ireland.  In just one day, they sought protection from violence and crimes perpetrated against them by someone who is supposed to love and care for them, that is, a parent or partner.</p> <p>  What we know is that domestic violence destroys lives, families and communities.  I acknowledge all the victims of domestic violence throughout the country, including, most tragically and most recently, the late Garda Tony Golden, his wife Nicola, his three young children, his family and colleagues, the woman whose life he was trying to protect, her children and her family, all of whom are victims of crime.  Again, we extend our condolences to the Garda Commissioner and her colleagues on the loss of Garda Golden as he performed his duties as a guardian of the peace.  May he rest in great natural peace.</p> <p>  Domestic violence comprises a cluster of serious crimes, most of which are covered under our existing criminal codes.  The crimes we are talking about include murder, attempted murder, assault causing serious harm, assault causing harm, rape, sexual assault, threats to kill, stalking, harassment, child abuse and many others.  Our criminal code, however, does not cover coercive control and psychological violence, nor does it treat the "breach of trust" in an intimate relationship as an aggravating factor.  In fact, we have a justice system that often minimises the violence because, as we have seen in the media last week, it is regarded as "only a domestic". </p> <p>  When an offender is reported for committing a crime against his intimate partner, there is strong evidence to suggest he has a history of abusing her and possibly her children, but she is unlikely to be asked about this because we do not have systematic risk and needs assessment protocols in place to address domestic violence.  We know that since she is reporting the crime, she is at increased risk of greater and further harm from the perpetrator, but often he is sent home after a night in the cell and, at worst, she is sent home and requested to get a barring order or a solicitor, or both.  We know that if there are not sufficient and effective protection, support and deterrent measures put in place, the perpetrator is likely to attempt to harm her severely or even kill her or others, at some time in the immediate future or when the opportunity presents itself to him.  All this is when the victim has had the opportunity to break free from his control or she has the confidence to disclose the violence to anyone, be it a family member, friend or a first responder whom she trusts to help, protect and support her. </p> <p>  We know from our research that the criminal "incident" &mdash; the alleged crime &mdash; that the woman, or victim, reports may just have happened, or could be happening when she escapes from his hold to ring 999, or escapes on foot from her house or when a neighbour intervenes.  Alternatively, it may have happened in the recent past. Our justice system's current response is to attempt to address the reported incident, which now becomes a crime against the State, and the woman, as a victim, may be called as a potential witness.  Our justice system currently demonstrates a very limited understanding of the protective measures and supports that such women need in order to be safe and to prevent retraumatisation in the criminal justice system.  A victim of domestic violence is almost always at risk of further crimes from the same person if his opportunities to further abuse are not curtailed. </p> <p>  The women to whom I am referring are those who have reported crimes to the police, or anyone.  We know that 79% of women never tell anyone about serious physical or sexual violence committed by a partner.  This means eight out of every ten women in Ireland who have been raped or beaten by their partner have not told anyone.</p> <p>  We know that one in three women in Ireland experiences severe psychological violence from an intimate partner.  This is approximately 500,000 women living in Ireland in 2015.  Women need expert and dedicated support from our criminal justice system, as well as from specialist support services, in order to sustain their formal complaints throughout the process, in addition to maximising their protection from further exposure to criminality from the offender or accused.</p> <p>  Some important issues, already touched upon by Ms Maria McDonald, have been highlighted by us in the opening statement and submission.  We very much welcome the Bill but are very clear that, without effective and significant investment, cultural change and training, it will mean nothing on the ground for the realisation of victims' rights and safety.</p></speech>

The Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, has made a number of submissions over a long period.  Given that many of the issues we have raised have been taken on board, I propose to address some additional and specific issues.<br/><br/>An increasing number of survivors of sexual violence are reporting to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our statistics for 2014 show that 33% of the survivors in contact with rape crisis centres reported to the Garda.  This figure is higher than that recorded among the general population in the Sexual Abuse and Violence In Ireland, SAVI, report, although that survey is out of date.  The number of victims who report increases to 48% in the case of adult survivors who have experienced adult sexual abuse only.  While these figures show that an increasing number of sexual violence survivors are engaging with the criminal justice system, it should be noted that a significant number remain outside the criminal justice system.  This group also has rights under the EU directive.<br/><br/>The RCNI works to ensure all victims of sexual violence, including non-reporting victims, are supported and their needs met, not only by specialist non-governmental organisations but by all relevant State agencies as far as possible.  In the case of these victims, identified as a group with &quot;specific protection needs&quot; under Article 22 of the directive, this is an enormous challenge because of the intimate nature of the violence suffered and its devastating effect on its victims.<br/><br/><b></b>On the issue of a specialist approach for sexual violence victims, sexual violence survivors have, by definition, suffered trauma, often very severe, which impacts on many aspects of their lives.  The criminal justice process must, as far as possible, avoid traumatising these victims again.  It must also take account of the difficulties inherent in negotiating the system, for instance, giving statements, waiting for decisions and undergoing rigorous questioning on all aspects of the offence, including the most intimate and personal details, for people who are already traumatised.  This must be at the heart of the directive and Bill.  Many of the heads already deal with this issue.<br/><br/>On the issue of specialist training, the focus of Article 25 of the directive - head 20 of the general scheme - is on general and specialist training to increase awareness of victims' needs.  It is vital that the specialist element of the training of Garda sexual violence investigators is addressed and that this includes training from outside experts.  Adequate general training for first responders is also vital.  The legislation should include powers to make regulations governing training standards, provision, frequency and so forth, and very importantly, it should include principles based on the directive and related key documents shared across all agencies.  A shared vision, one which is founded on common elements in individual training programmes, is the foundation of successful implementation of this legislation.<br/><br/>On evaluation and monitoring of the legislation, an oversight model should be provided for either in the legislation or on a non-statutory basis.  It must be sufficiently flexible to react quickly to changing circumstances and sufficiently formal to ensure necessary changes are made quickly.  Such a structure should be based on the same shared vision as the training and should work to ensure shared best practice standards on the delivery of every element of victims' rights are created, ideally by informed consensus, and followed.<br/><br/>Speed is another important issue because we know from Rape &amp;amp; Justice in Ireland, a research report published in 2010, that delay is the greatest single factor in attrition from the justice system in terms of sexual violence survivors.  The wording &quot;without unnecessary delay&quot; used in the directive should be adopted with regard to providing information, doing individual assessments, informing victims of the carrying out of review and-or grievance procedures, and especially providing special measures during investigation.  Delayed responses are very difficult for sexual violence survivors to deal with and contribute significantly to attrition.  As such, speed is extremely important.<br/><br/>As Ms McDonald discussed the removal of unnecessary restrictions on directive rights, I will move on to the issue of resources.  The Bill should include an obligation on member states to ensure free victim support services, including specialist services, are made available to victims regardless of whether they report formally to the Garda.  Without such a clause, a victim's right to access these services cannot be defended through legislation.  For this reason, the directive will not have been fully transposed if such provision is not made in the Bill.  As the State funds victim support services, including specialist services such as rape crisis centres which are free of charge to victims, there is no practical reason not to include in the legislation a right of access to victim support services.  We urge members to consider the inclusion of such a provision.<br/><br/>I thank the joint committee for inviting us before it and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

This is important legislation for children as it recognises the unfortunate reality that many children and young people are victims of crime and that they are also holders of rights.  It follows the vote of the people in November 2012 to enshrine in the Constitution the protection of children as individual rights holders.  The new Article in the Constitution states, "The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights."</p> <p>  The focus of the ISPCC is on three areas in the Bill.  The first of these is the need to ensure the legislation endeavours to meet the spirit and intent of the relatively recent change to the Constitution to ensure it meets Ireland's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Second, we will focus on information and support to children, ensuring it is accessible, age-appropriate and specialist.  Third, we will focus on some practical measures to ensure culture change - a phrase we have heard used already in the new system - is driven and supported by professional development.</p> <p>  On the first point, as the national child protection and welfare charity, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is delighted that the Bill will move from a criminal justice system that is often narrow, minimalist and compliance-led in terms of its approach to the inclusion of children to a system that works proactively to ensure children who are victims of crime have their needs understood as well as met.  The key principle under which implementation should be judged is the culture change and shift in mindset in our criminal justice system.  This requires that steps are proactively taken to provide information in a child-friendly manner, that interviews are undertaken in a child-centred manner while ensuring standards of evidence gathering are met, and that sufficient resources are provided to have well-trained professional staff in the legal and courts systems and Garda to ensure cases involving children are progressed in a timely manner in order that the child victim has the best possible opportunity of recovering from an ordeal that could otherwise have a profound effect on his or her development.</p> <p>  The ISPCC, therefore, welcomes the preamble to the Bill which includes provision for the best interests of the child to be a primary consideration.  We also welcome the recognition that children require special protection measures.  However, we concur with the view expressed by the Children's Rights Alliance that the best interests principle should be included in the Bill's provisions rather than in the principle set down in the preamble.  This is an important point.  There should be no ambiguity regarding the centrality of children or our compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  If the Bill is to inspire culture change in terms of how we treat children in the criminal justice system, the best interests of the child must be a key driver.</p> <p>  Information and support is a critical area for the ISPCC and, I am sure, other organisations.  The UN Human Rights Council obliges states to take steps to ensure the recovery and social integration of child victims.  This is very important as it recognises that being the victim of a crime can have a profound psychological impact on children in the immediate and long term.  I will refer briefly to a recent example involving a young girl aged 14 years who was the victim of a house robbery during which she was bound, gagged and threatened for a long period while being the witness of violence to family members.  The girl returned to school within a few days of her ordeal and life was expected to go back to normal.  Although the Garda was involved in the matter, no discussion took place on support for the young girl until she started to struggle at school and her parents became concerned.  She could not stay at home alone and lights had to be switched on at bedtime.  When she was referred to ISPCC support services, we found during our work with her that while she spoke about the trauma she experienced, she spoke more about her feeling after the experience that she had been, to use her words, left "in limbo".  She did not receive any direct information from the Garda about her circumstances and was in effect left to one side after her statement had been taken.  She had many questions we could not answer and she believed the people who could answer them did not consider them to be significant or important.  This undoubtedly affected her recovery which took longer as a result.</p> <p>  In our experience, the voices and experiences of the child are often lost in an adult-orientated investigation.  All child victims should be provided with information that is age appropriate and, what is important, they should be provided with information regarding services which offer support for victims of crime.  Such information was not offered in the case I have outlined.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly about other examples of the lack of resources in the criminal justice system.  The ISPCC provides therapeutic support services to 500 children and families per annum.  Some of these children have been victims of crime and, without exception, our childhood support workers attest to the importance of communicating with children and helping them to understand what has happened.  This has a significant impact on a child's ability to cope, recover and build resilience following an ordeal involving crime.  Crime has profound effects on a child's mental health, stability and well-being.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Ombudsman for Children, on child abuse, referred to the establishment of the National Counselling Service, providing therapeutic services to adults who had been abused in childhood.  This consists of a network of service centres located no more than one hour to anyone in need.  However, the ombudsman stated that no equivalent free accessible counselling service is available to children affected by abuse.  The ISPCC, Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, operates a waiting list for our child and family support services.  We have anecdotal evidence that some children wait between six months and one year for a child psychologist.</p><p> The Bill&rsquo;s intention for children is dependent on whether adults working with children also recognise the centrality of a child-centred approach.  If children are to receive information in an age-appropriate way, if they are to be interviewed in a child-centred manner and if child-centred communication is to become the norm, then a brand new approach is needed.  We listen to 460 contacts annually from children.  Our volunteers and staff are trained in building trust and rapport in active listening and engagement techniques.  This takes time.  Garda&iacute; and legal professionals must step up, which means quite a culture change in how we work with children.</p></speech>

The trust welcomes the invitation from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to address it on the general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill.</p> <p>  Broadly speaking, the Bill is a positive step forward for the reform of law.  I endorse the comments already made on the need for resources, services, investment, training, support, specialist services and the centrality of the best interests of the child.  The protection of victims&rsquo; rights is not incompatible with or detrimental to the rights of accused or convicted persons, provided that the general principles of equality and non-discrimination, access to justice and due process continue to be supported.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust supports the Bill but has a small and limited number of concerns.</p> <p>  Our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights require that where we legislate for measures that may constitute an interference with the right to privacy, such measures must be properly assessed as to whether they are proportionate and necessary for the prevention of crime or to protect the rights and freedoms of others.  The recital of the EU victims directive states that the rights set out therein are without prejudice to the rights of the offender.  To this end, our submission highlights selected aspects of the Bill&rsquo;s general scheme, the first being victim personal statements which falls under head 9.</p> <p>  The inclusion of victim impact statements is already provided for in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  We call for the broader sentencing guidelines for guidance on the weight to be attributed to the victim personal statement.  We see a limited risk in that the highlighting of certain sentencing principles over others may inadvertently give rise to a failure to consider other equally important sentencing considerations, including proportionality, the circumstances of the offender and the offence, aggravating and mitigating factors and reintegration and rehabilitation.  This can be easily remedied with the insertion of the words "in accordance with the ordinary principles of sentencing" in the relevant section.  It is also vital to ensure the current express procedural protections set out, namely the exclusion of any prejudicial comment on the offender or comment on the appropriate sentence to be imposed and the service of the statement in advance, should be preserved in future iterations of the legislation.</p> <p>  Our second issue relates to heads 10, 18 and 25, provision of information to victims and families concerning release, escape, etc.  The provision of information throughout this process is absolutely essential.  The only question we raise is the conflation of information about release and the conflation of information about escape.  These are treated as the same in the directive where they clearly have different implications.  There is no doubt that where authorities know, or ought to know, of a real risk from an offender, all reasonable steps should be taken to protect any victims from harm, including immediate notification of the fact of release or escape from prison.  It would protect both victims and those who have served a sentence if there were a clear protocol in risk assessment and how it would be applied.  Where no risk of harm to a victim has been identified, we would urge the committee to consider countervailing factors, including risk of reprisal, impact on rehabilitation and reintegration.</p> <p>  Regarding parole board hearings, the general scheme provides for disclosure of information on related decisions.  It is unclear for what purpose such information would be disclosed.  If the disclosure were limited to the date, time and outcome of the hearing, that may be proportionate in appropriate cases.  In many cases, parole board hearings can include detailed information on medical, psychological and personal matters.  Like Canada&rsquo;s Victims Bill of Rights Act, we would hope the provisions of this Bill will not interfere with the discretion which may be exercised by any person or body authorised to release an offender into the community.  This is an important provision which would clarify the appropriate parameters of victim input and would honour the point that successful reintegration after imprisonment prevents recidivism and, ultimately, assists victims.</p> <p>  We welcome the important provision on restorative justice schemes in the Bill.  The definition of "victim" in head 2 is clear.  Between 2011 and 2014, over 3,500 assaults took place in our prisons.  There are also incidents in child detention schools and other secure facilities such as nursing homes.  How will the directive be effectively implemented to protect all victims, even those we may not immediately think of as victims?  There is no doubt that within our secure care facilities and other places of detention, specific attention will need to be paid to the introduction of measures to prevent secondary victimisation, retaliation or intimidation and avoid the creation of conditions of solitary confinement or prolonged isolation, which can be used as a measure of protection but can cause irreversible damage to those subject to such conditions.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the inclusion of IPRT at this hearing.  In the end, we all want the same, namely justice, equality, fairness, punishment that is meaningful and proportionate, and safer communities.</p></speech>

The alliance welcomes the publication of the general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill 2015 and the opportunity to be consulted today.  We commend the work of the Minister for Justice and Equality and her departmental officials in producing this important draft legislation.</p> <p>  The scheme of the Bill has many positives, including the presumption that all child victims need special protection measures, as well as the inclusion of a victim personal statement to be taken into account when sentencing the offender.  The proposals it contains are particularly important in that they place the rights of victims on a statutory footing for the first time.  We believe, however, that for the legislation to be effective, the heads must be amended to strengthen the protections for children to bring it in line with the rights afforded by the EU victims directive.  Significantly, the Bill fails to address the requirement under Article 8 of the directive for the mandatory provision of confidential victim support services free of charge both before, during and, for an appropriate time, after criminal proceedings.</p> <p>  In applying the directive, children&rsquo;s best interests must be of primary consideration in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  While the best interest principle is included in the preamble and in head 17, they are not sufficient to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or Article 1.2 of the directive.  It must be incorporated in its own right.</p> <p>  In 2006, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called on the State to ensure that victims of abuse and neglect have access to counselling and assistance with physical recovery and social reintegration.  In that regard, the committee will examine Ireland again in January.  Supports for child victims of abuse, neglect, murder and other crimes are often inadequate.  For example, there is no access to free counselling in all parts of Ireland for child victims affected by murder.  Yesterday, the only counselling service for child victims of sexual abuse in Ireland, the Children at Risk in Ireland centre, CARI, had a waiting list of 40 in Dublin and 50 in Limerick.</p><p>The startling reality is that this means that child victims of sexual abuse will have to wait between one year and 18 months for therapy and support and by this time next year some of those children will still be on that waiting list.  For victims of sexual assault under 14 years, there is limited access to specialist services, with just one State service, located in Galway.  Victims over 14 years can access specialist integrated sexual assault treatment units, however these are unavailable in most parts of Ireland.</p><p> It is in this context that it is of grave concern to the Children's Rights Alliance that the general scheme fails to transpose Article 8 of the directive, which provides that the victim shall have access to confidential victim support services.  There is nothing discretionary in Article 8 as it states it "shall".  This is a significant omission as the EU directive envisages that member states shall ensure that there is free access.  This omission is incompatible with Article 39 of the UNCRC.</p><p> The committee should ensure that any support services put in place should include specific victim support services which should be provided for children and their parent or guardian to meet them to prepare for court, upon arrival at court and to wait with them during the trial to improve participation and recovery.</p><p> Turning to the voice of the child, overall head 9 gives practical realisation to Article 12 of the UNCRC and the inclusion of a victim personal statement which shall be taken into account when determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence.  However, the proposed legislation fails to take into account the needs of children making the statement which is directly linked to the failure to transpose Article 8 relating to victim support services.  Children making the statement should have access to support services in circumstances where revisiting the crime could be traumatic for the child and may impact on his or her emotional recovery, and appropriate professional support may be required.</p><p> Turning to special protection measures, in all judicial proceedings children should be protected from harm, including intimidation and secondary victimisation.  In that regard, head 16, which set outs special measures during a trial, is to be welcomed.  Head 17 is also to be welcomed.</p></speech>

Facing Forward is a voluntary organisation without paid staff, established in 2005.  It is comprised of practitioners with expertise in restorative processes, mediation, conflict resolution, youth offending, criminal justice, law and trauma counselling.  We promote the use of restorative approaches in all areas of the criminal justice system, including with the most serious types of crime, taking into account the needs of all those impacted by the harm resulting from crime.</p> <p>  Facing Forward commends the Government's commitment to introduce draft primary legislation to implement this directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime.  We are focusing on the restorative justice provisions of the Bill which relate to our specific area of interest.  We consider it important that the rights and protections for victims contained in this Bill would be comprehensive and extend to all existing and future restorative justice programmes.  We have a number of queries about aspects of the general scheme as follows.</p> <p>  On head 2, interpretation, in its definition of a "victim", the general scheme contains a phrase not present in the EU victims directive, "perpetrated against him or her".  The addition of the underlined phrase appears to have the effect of excluding secondary victims or those who witness a crime, even if they experience harm and trauma as a result, potentially limiting their rights as victims.  International experience has shown that restorative justice has benefits for all those who suffer harm as a result of a particular crime, including those who witness serious crime.  Facing Forward proposes that this phrase be removed in line with the EU victims directive.</p> <p>  The current text of head 2 does not define "restorative justice".  In order to clarify the meaning of head 28 of the general scheme of the Bill, Facing Forward proposes that the definition contained in Article 2 (d) of the directive be included in head 2, as outlined in the presentation.</p> <p>  On head 4, information to be provided to victims, Article 4 of the EU victims directive requires that all victims be given information on "the available restorative justice services".  This requirement is currently omitted from the draft Bill.  Facing Forward proposes that this clause be included in head 4 of the general scheme.</p> <p>  On head 8, information to be provided on request to a victim where a complaint has been made, head 8 gives a victim who has requested such information the right to be informed "if it is proposed to deal with an alleged offender in relation to the offence alleged in the complaint otherwise than by prosecution before a court".  Head 13 excludes decisions relating to juvenile diversion and adult caution schemes operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We think that should be looked at for possible inclusion in the Bill.</p> <p>  Head 13 currently states that victims do not need to be informed about decisions on admitting those responsible for crimes to a diversion programme under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 and under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adult caution scheme.  Facing Forward understands Article 12 of the directive to apply to all restorative justice programmes and work in the jurisdiction without exception.</p> <p>  On head 20, training, the provision of training in this head is currently limited to the staff of statutory agencies listed in the schedule.  This provision does not cover the staff of non-governmental projects enabled by these statutory agencies.  Article 25 of the EU victims directive supports member states to encourage initiatives enabling those providing restorative justice services to receive "adequate training to a level appropriate to their contact with victims".  Facing Forward, therefore, proposes that the training provision needs to apply to staff and volunteers of non-governmental organisations working with victims, including through restorative justice processes.</p> <p>  As currently drafted, head 28 applies only "Where any agency or body listed in the Schedule to this Bill provides or enables any restorative justice service, [other than those provided for in the Children Act 2001 (as amended)],".  The schedule currently does not include the probation service, under whose supervision and funding both restorative justice services and restorative justice in the community currently operate.  Facing Forward proposes that all agencies currently "enabling" restorative justice programmes be included in the schedule to the general scheme and that some wording be found to include future new developments in restorative justice service provision.  Facing Forward also proposes that the safeguards in head 28 also apply to the restorative work done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na juvenile diversion programme under the Children Act 2001 in order to offer victims of juvenile crime the same rights with regard to restorative justice service provision as victims of other crime.</p> <p>  Article 12 of the EU victims directive states, "Member States shall facilitate the referral of cases, as appropriate to restorative justice services, including through the establishment of procedures or guidelines on the conditions for such referral".   Facing Forward proposes that this or similar wording be included in the draft Bill to consolidate the existing referral system for restorative justice work.</p></speech>

Some years ago, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the school of law at Trinity College co-hosted a conference called, "Rape Law - Victims on Trial?", at which, in her opening address, former President Mary McAleese stated that when a victim follows through with their case in the criminal justice system and the perpetrator is found guilty and given the appropriate sentence, that victim has done all of society a service.</p><p> The DRCC&rsquo;s submission to the committee is informed by the experiences of the men and women who access front-line services and also by the research and policy work delivered by the organisation.  Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar mentioned the SAVI report, the most comprehensive piece of research ever done on attitudes towards and beliefs about sexual violence in Ireland.  We need a second SAVI report as it is out of date.  The report told us that 3% of Irish men and 10% of Irish women were victims of rape, the second most serious crime in our Statute Book.  Translated into figures, that is 200,000 women and 60,000 men, a phenomenal number for a very serious crime.</p><p> Few would deny the far too often devastating effects sexual violence has on those against whom it is perpetrated.  Victims of this crime may be affected in many ways, including physically, emotionally, psychologically and financially.  They enter the criminal justice system by chance rather than by choice.  Indeed, their participation in and co-operation with the system is essential to the prosecution of perpetrators and to law enforcement's efforts to control sexual crimes.  Without the victims, it would not be possible to determine the facts of the case or administer justice.</p><p> The DRCC broadly welcomes the general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2015.  We look forward to its implementation and we hope it will be a force for change, not only for victims of sexual offences but for all victims of crime who engage with the criminal justice system.  As all my colleagues have said, it will not be possible to implement this Bill unless the resources are made available.  Far too often, we suffer from implementation deficit.  </p><p> There are a number of key elements which are of particular significance to those who avail of the services of rape crisis centres, which we would like to highlight.  For example, head 6 of the Bill requires garda&iacute; to individually assess all victims of crime in order to ascertain whether they need to access the special protection measures set out in head 16 of the Bill.  In order to ensure a reliable, consistent and transparent system of assessment, we believe specialist training must be given to those garda&iacute; who engage in this undertaking.  The DRCC would like to see specific reference made to victims of crime having the right to access victim support services, as my colleagues have said, similar to the provisions set out in articles 8 and 9 of the EU victims&rsquo; rights directive.  The DRCC would also like to see specific reference in head 16 of the Bill to the type of testimonial aids that are available to victims.  We would suggest that there be a positive obligation on prosecutors to request those special measures pre-trial. </p><p> The need for both general and specific training is paramount for all practitioners and professionals who come into contact with victims of crime across the board, and specifically for those who have contact with victims of sexual crimes.  We would like to see this reflected in head 20 of the Bill.  In particular, training is required to challenge and educate everyone in the criminal justice system on the adverse attitudes towards, myths about and perceptions of victims of sexual crimes which abide in society.  This will increase awareness and will go a long way to ensuring that justice is delivered.</p><p> We appreciate this opportunity to bring to the committee's attention the aspects of the Bill which we endorse and welcome and those aspects we would like to see changed and-or reinforced.</p></speech>

It is most helpful.  I also thank the Vice Chairman, Deputy Anne Ferris, for standing in for me and I apologise for having to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber for a few minutes.</p></speech>

People regularly say to us that victims are often completely forgotten about when we are dealing with the issue of crime.</p> <p>  Ms Doherty and Ms Long touched on the issue of child victims of crime and Ms Long talked about one particular incident.  There are horrific consequences for young children who witness or are victims of crime.  My question to the Children's Rights Alliance and the ISPCC is what are the two key things that can help them?  I do not want to hear about the legislation, information or details of the progression of the case in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grainia Long" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015102100002#F00400"><p>The first key practical thing will be putting the best interests of the child at the centre of the Bill.  That will make a big difference.  As an organisation, the ISPCC will need to use the Bill as a lever for change.  We want to require organisations that work with children through the criminal justice system to demonstrate that they have prioritised the best interests of children when undertaking interviews of children and in taking account of the views of children.  There is a reason the UN Convention states that key phrase really clearly.  Putting that in the main text of the Bill rather than just in the preamble could be a game changer.  That is the lever we could then use.</p> <p>  I would echo Ms O'Malley-Dunlop's point on implementation.  The Bill will stand or fall on just how seriously we take it.  If we do not take it seriously, it will just be another Bill with the best of intentions.</p> <p>  We listen to 460,000 children a year.  It still shocks me that we have to listen to that many children and there are many more who do not feel they can call.  We need to change how we think about children.  This is the first piece of really serious legislation for children following enactment of the children's referendum and the change to the Constitution.  It could be something that looks and feels very different from anything that has gone before.  That means providing for listening to and treating children differently.  We have set out some of the changes we need to make and hopefully I have given two practical changes which the committee could consider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catriona Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015102100002#F00500"><p>I thank Deputy McGrath for his question.  I would reiterate those points.  The best interests principle, as it stands in the preamble, is not strong enough.  It has to incorporated into the Bill itself in order for the legislation to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.</p> <p>  The second point, which I mentioned in my address, concerns the support services.  Ireland was already criticised on this issue in 2006 and we are going to be examined again this coming January.  At present, we are not compliant with article 39 of the UNCRC.  Everything else in the Bill will fall down if we cannot give those children support services.  It is all well and good giving them information and listening to their voices but if they do not have support services, it can become meaningless in some ways.</p> <p>  I know the Deputy asked for two points, but the last aspect I would highlight is training.  Training is of vital importance and has to take place throughout Ireland.  The Bill does not just apply to children in Dublin.  It applies to children in Donegal, Cork and everywhere.  In respect of support services, recital 37 of the directive states that the support services have to be provided within a sufficient geographical region.  That means they have to be extended throughout Ireland.  We cannot just have support services in one county.  I cannot emphasise that enough, along with the training issue.</p> <p>  I work as a barrister and am in court regularly, particularly on the northern circuit.  In Letterkenny courthouse, there are no facilities for victims.  There are no separate rooms; everybody is in the same place.  There are no support services for children who are in court as victims.  Support services and training must be extended throughout the island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015102100002#F00600"><p>Children are very often indirect victims of crime.  In an instance of domestic violence where the child witnesses the assault but is not actually abused himself or herself, the EU Commission has made it very clear that Ireland's current definition of "victim" is in breach of the directive.  There needs to be a change in order to provide indirect victims of crime with the right to victim support services.</p><p>In that context, currently under this Bill, children who would be indirect victims and witness domestic abuse, would not be entitled to victim support services.  Therefore it is important that this amendment is made.  I think Facing Forward has referred to that.</p><p> The second issue is that the directive is clear that children are automatically entitled to special protection measures.  One of those rights is that all interviews of children should be video-recorded.  The difficulty concerns when they can actually be used in evidence.  The Bill is unclear as to when that video recording can be used.  </p><p> Also, as soon as a child turns 18 they are not entitled to those special protection measures any more.  As we all know, however, they could be incredibly vulnerable.  The Bill does not state that there is an obligation on the garda&iacute; to engage in individual assessments to ascertain whether they have special protection needs.  I think therefore that this is hugely important.</p></speech>

We have come across that so many times, that they just feel completely lost in the process.  Whatever about access to supports, which is obviously essential, they are not even told about the processes that are happening.  The child that Ms Long spoke about earlier was a witness.  She was not the main victim, as such, so her statement was taken and that was it.  It is a case of ensuring that they also have the information available to them, even if they are not the complainant.</p></speech>

Therefore, all of the measures have to be interlinked because that child is at further risk.  That is quite critical.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015102100002#G00500"><p>I think Ms McDonald kicked it off there concerning the indirect victims of crime such as domestic violence, for example.  The direct victim is usually the mother or partner, but the indirect victims are often forgotten in the debate.  These are the young children who turn up crying in the classrooms on a Monday or Tuesday.  When they are teenagers they often turn to drugs and suffer massive low self-esteem.  These are the kids who often end up in Mountjoy or self-harming or abusing alcohol.  They are often forgotten about.  As part of the debate on this legislation we need to focus on those kids.  I hate using the term "indirect victims" because I have seen some of those victims.  By the way, I have seen some of those people who came from abused families abusing their own mothers when they became teenagers.  We have a major problem with those young people and we need to support them.  I emphasise that we need the practical supports for those young people.</p></speech>

We believe that victims who are traumatised as a consequence of sexual violence also need to have the special supports that are available.</p></speech>

I represent victims of homicide.  What we all forget when there is a homicide in the family are the other children who have not been physically harmed.  I am speaking about actual cases where children would have been very young when an older sibling was murdered.  When those children come into their teenage years, just like Deputy Finian McGrath said, horrendous problems arise for the family, yet there is no support.  I know one family in particular whose son is in dire straits.  He could not get access to a public counselling service, so the family has to pay for it.</p></speech>

We see too many children daily who only arrive at our door because maybe a social worker has, in an interview with a parent or another family member, triggered something in the child and they have spotted something.  A very foresightful social worker will refer a child to us.  For every one of those children there are many others who never get that opportunity.  Sometimes we cannot help the child because we have a waiting list.  Only recently we had a child who witnessed sexual violence in the home and only came to us by dint of two or three of the right people being in the right place.  On the face of it, this Bill could formalise institutionally the rights of children to access services.  Many children would be forever grateful if it is formalised in legislation because there are too many gaps.</p></speech>

The Children's Rights Alliance, CRA, has outlined a lot of the gaps there.  I wish to re-emphasise exactly how thin on the ground services are for children.  When we first started collecting data one thing shocked us.  When we looked at rape crisis centres collectively, which are essentially adult services, it turned out that we were the biggest provider of services to children, yet we are the providers of adult services.  They came to us because there was nowhere else to go.  Every rape crisis centre sees children from 14 years upwards and occasionally younger than that.  The CARI Foundation sees children from the start, principally the younger age category.  CARI is seriously under-funded, as all services are in the NGO sector in this area.  There is a huge gap.  The Children's Rights Alliance mentioned the sexual assault treatment units, but we only have one for the under 14s which is based in Galway.  We need national coverage in terms of children's sexual assault treatment units.</p> <p>  I wish to draw the committee's attention to the fact that we need services that are focused on older children, including teenagers.  There is a need to have something specific there because what they experience in terms of sexual violence, risk and perpetration is very specific, and we need that special service.</p></speech>

I apologise that I had to go to the Seanad Chamber and will have to go back at 11.30 a.m. for Seanad business.  I note that, overall, everyone is broadly welcoming of the Bill.  Almost everyone has mentioned resourcing as a huge issue of implementation.  Going through the heads of the Bill, it struck me it is vital that sufficient resources are provided in particular to the garda&iacute;, and to a slightly lesser extent to the DPP and the Courts Service.  That is because so many of the new protections and supports for victims will require quite intensive intervention, particularly by the garda&iacute;.  I note that a lot of contributors have touched on that.</p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions.  One concerns what Ms Maria McDonald from the Victims Rights Alliance raised on the re-victimisation and cross-examination of the victim.  I am interested to know what extra could be in this Bill.  I am looking at heads 16 and 26 which will provide additional protections.  We have been taking Second Stage of the Sexual Offences Bill in the Seanad, containing new provisions on personal cross-examination of victims, which are very welcome.  </p> <p>  Following the work done by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in 2001, we have a provision on legal representation where a victim in a sex offence case is being cross-examined about personal sexual history.  I am just wondering what else can be done.</p></speech>

I spoke to a senior prosecutor about this.  The issue is not that the legislation is not there but that they cannot really use it because they do not have guidelines for their use.  Therefore the judge really does not understand what intermediaries are and the prosecutors do not understand when they should be used.  There is a real fear around them breaching the rights of the accused person when they are used.</p> <p>  I have been informed of a way by which that could be prevented.  I did not get permission to say who it was, so I do not want to name anyone.  In effect, it is important that the legislation clearly outlines when intermediaries can be used by a judge to ensure that the accused's rights are not going to be breached.</p></speech>

What happens is if one gets a vulnerable child or somebody who has a disability or has a mental health issue, one knows what barristers are like when they cross-examine people and someone has a difficulty understanding.  What would happen is that the barrister would ask the intermediary the question and then the intermediary would ask the child or the individual that question, but in a manner where it is very clear.  It takes out all of the-----</p></speech>

The issue, however, is that they have only been used once and the difficulty is that there is no clarity on when they should be used.  It states that children and people who have mental health issues should be entitled to use them but it does not clarify when the court should allow their use otherwise.  From a defence perspective, there are concerns that this might water down the right to cross-examination.</p></speech>

It is missing in some key areas.  It is important to include details as to when access to information is given and when rights are activated right at the very start.  The Chairman referred to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.  At the moment the legislation restricts the right of the accused to personally cross-examine the victim in cases involving children and we are very clear that this should apply to all ages in sexual violence cases.

Both the prosecution and the defence would have known in advance that it would not happen but the victim is only told at the last minute.  During the past week I became aware of a case where people travelled from abroad for a case which was delayed.  There should be guidelines and something in legislation to ensure pre-trial procedures are completed well in advance.  There should be a pre-trial hearing two months in advance to ascertain whether or not a case will or will not happen.</p></speech>

We have not done a lot of work relating to children because the Joint Committee on Health and Children deals with that area.  It is all very interesting but, as Ms McDonald said, it is an EU directive and it is vital we ensure our law is tight enough and does not fall short of the directive.  I agree with Mr. Counihan about secondary victims.  I am sure secondary victims do not feel they are indirect victims but that they are victims, even though they may not have been abused themselves.  They feel it emotionally and psychologically.</p><p>I was interested to hear the piece on restorative justice.  The Chairman and I have done a lot of work on this over the past few years, mainly relating to perpetrators rather than victims.  It was good to hear that point referred to in the presentation.  I intend to go into all the statements again and to go through the Bill head by head to see what can be done.  I have a Private Members' Bill on sentencing in the lottery system and I hope it gets chosen for debate in the next few months.  It deals with the anomaly in sentencing with regard to damage to a person <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>damage to a property.  The sentence for damage to a person's property can be far greater than that for damage to a person himself or herself.  For example, if a person picked up a bottle and hit somebody over the head with it he or she could get a bigger sentence for damaging the bottle than for injuring the other person.  </p><p>I do not have a question as those I had have been answered and the witnesses have given a lot of clarification.

Are we comfortable that the method of recording the initial crime is what we need in respect of the effect on families?  Support groups have come in and received mixed information on this point.  The problem starts with the first responders, who do not fill out a standard template.  They do not even have a template and have not received training in this area.  The PULSE system is not sufficient and I have told the Garda Commissioner that the DASH system which applies in Northern Ireland is what we need here.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  They pick up people who have fallen out of the system but would it be better if it was done properly in the beginning and they had a profile of the different persons they were going to get and their circumstances from a correctly completed, standard template?</p></speech>

We are in the middle of research at the moment into risk assessment practice and investigation of crime.  It is clear that we do not have any protocols for the first responders, be they garda&iacute; or social workers, with regard to domestic violence involving adults and children.  Given the risk of further crime and the increased danger when someone first comes forward to disclose information, the focus of the responder needs to be on the protection and safety of the victim, the mother or the child, and on the recording of the evidence presented.  The research demonstrates that plenty of evidence can be collected without our being reliant on the primary witness, namely the victim, but this is not happening.</p> <p>  We were at the Garda crime victims' forum on Monday and there were very positive soundings from the Garda Commissioner on the progress they are making in this area.  SAFE Ireland is very happy to link up with the new protective unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it is a very complex area.  I would be loth to ask a garda to go to a scene and fill out a five-page form but I would love the garda to have an automatic checklist and to be equipped with the information already on the system and the history of previous incidents.  I cannot begin to describe how, on the ground, the basics are not being taken care of.  The policy in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not explicitly mention risk assessment but such an approach is implied and it is not being applied systematically across the country.  We only have small pockets of good practice.</p> <p>  We are also loth to focus just on garda&iacute;.  There is no linked-up system.  We have been working with one of our European partners in Austria, where there is an automatic statutory requirement for a garda to refer a case to the support service when he or she attends a scene.  The support service is then obliged to contact the victim and the victim can then opt in or out.</p><p>These are basic things but we do not have them in place.</p></speech>

CSO figures published in June and July last indicate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not categorising crimes correctly.  We are aware of many instances of crime against people who are blind not being defined as crime because nobody could collaborate the evidence.  Currently, in most instances, road traffic collision victims are not identified as victims of crime.  I will give an example.  When a road traffic collision occurs between two cars and one person is seriously injured as a result, the garda who arrives at the scene could record that incident as dangerous driving or drink driving causing death, which means a person would not be provided with information because he or she may not be deemed to be a victim in the circumstances.  We need to change the ethos and methodology used by the Garda in identifying whether a person is a victim.  The presumption must be that a person is a victim such that he or she can be provided with the information to allow him or her access his or her rights under the directive.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware from the Garda Inspectorate report that many cases involving sexual violence, in respect of which there was plenty of evidence that a crime had been committed, were downgraded such that the record indicated no crime had been committed.  The directive has to be applied across the country from Donegal to Dingle, from Galway to Dublin and everywhere in between.  It was stated that garda&iacute; do not have a checklist but they need to have one.  They must know what they are required to do and how important it is that the victim be retained in the system and given all necessary information.  Victims do not know what to ask for.  Garda&iacute; must provide the relevant information to the victim, whether that person is a victim of sexual crime, burglary or whatever.</p></speech>

The difficulty that arises in the context of this Bill is how garda&iacute; will do this consistently.  Ms Gleeson mentioned risk assessment.  In fairness to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it has changed its information technology systems such that cases in respect of which there is a risk of re-victimisation or domestic abuse are now flagged, but that is not enough.  We need to ensure every garda conducts the individual assessment in the exact same way such that no victim falls through the loop and does not get the protection measures he or she needs.</p></speech>

There is also a need for focus on prevention of re-traumatisation.  During our research on the criminal journey of the women who are going into the system, we learned that 90% of serious crimes, not including homicide and assisted homicide, are being dealt with in the District Court.  This goes back to the point about sentencing.  In one case which involved extreme violence resulting in a woman being incredibly badly beaten and in respect of which there were many witnesses, the sentence was a &euro;1,500 fine and a period of probation.  The system as a whole needs to be examined.  The protection measures in the court process are critical to the victim being able to stay in the process.  That is very important.</p></speech>

Putting procedures in place is great but if people are not trained by a particular deadline, that process becomes meaningless.  Head 20 is particularly important because it specifies that garda&iacute; should be trained, but nowhere in that head is a timeframe referred to within which that training should take place.  There is need for incorporation of a deadline in this regard.</p> <p>  Head 7 is welcome in that it provides that all victims should receive an acknowledgement of complaint.  Currently a person may believe he or she has made a complaint only to find out two weeks later following contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding an update on that complaint that there is no record of that complaint having been made.  It is in the context of rural stations where resources may be lacking that the training and acknowledgement is especially important.</p></speech>

Another important issue is joint interviews.  I know joint interviews take place in cases involving sexual abuse.  It is important there would also be a joint interview in cases involving child protection such that no child would have to go through the process multiple times.</p></speech>

However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in a place new victims office specifically relating to domestic violence.  As it is not appropriate for a victim of domestic violence to receive in the post a letter thanking them for having made a statement, this new system ensures there is face-to-face contact with the woman in a safe way.

At the moment everything is going in the direction of technology, which is taking some of the personal aspect from it.  Restorative justice is strictly about humanity.</p></speech>

We know little of the horrors in homes in Ireland.  As a country, we have grown up in recent years.  I commend this committee on raising domestic violence issues.  SAFE Ireland and our members have been working for 40 years, although I have not worked quite that long.  We do not know the half of it, but we are starting to lift the veil.  Once we lift the veil and start to get into the heart of violence in the home, we have the potential to heal violence across our society because it is from the home that we learn.</p></speech>

Looking more broadly, however, I do not believe it is possible to stand over that because what we are seeing is difference rather than more.  It just shows up in different ways, in different places with different levels of silence and silence in different places.  The members of this committee create legislation.  Law is social engineering, but the work we do in perfecting the justice system, perfecting the legal response, perfecting how the State vindicates survivors and holds perpetrators to account must be backed up and will be frustrated if we do not invest in primary prevention.  We need to engage in a very conscious way based on evidence.  We have evidence and we need to invest in primary prevention because this work will be frustrated if we do not.</p></speech>

I do not think society is getting uglier.  I think reportage is increasing.  We are lifting the veil as Ms Gleeson has said.  We are hearing more about what is happening.  It was happening behind closed doors.</p></speech>

The more we can teach children to talk about the issues going on for them and the more likely they are to call us and tell us, the better.  While it will sometimes feel as if we are hearing more, that is actually a good thing.  I would rather for us to be victims of our own success on this one.</p> <p>  We spoke a lot today about physical crime, so to speak.  We have a considerable amount of law to write on cyber and online crime.  That is a major issue, especially for children and young people.  I look forward to being back in this room with one of my colleagues to talk at length with the committee on this.  We are completely unaware of the laws we need on this particular issue.  So much of the Bill is about culture change that I wonder whether a review might be in order.  After two years the Bill will only have worked if implementation has happened and we have changed the mindset and culture.  In areas such as training and whether services are fully funded, it would be good to review this in two years.</p></speech>

We know that more people are coming forward and reporting the crime.  Until we have a second SAVI report and a proper comparison, we will not know whether there is an escalation in the prevalence or more people coming forward.  It is really important to have the research to follow up.</p></speech>

As Deputy Anne Ferris said, our sentencing laws are very questionable at the moment and we need to look at how we respond to serious crime.

The commissioner mentioned 115 complaints last year, 35 of which related to the Road Safety Authority.  The commissioner spoke about teachers with fluent Irish in Gaeltacht schools.  Do those teachers not have fluent Irish and the relevant qualifications given most primary and secondary school teachers have qualifications in Irish?

Is it something that just has not happened, the way things sometimes do not happen, or has it been refused?  There is a clear difference.

Did Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill analyse the reasons given by the remaining 30 that did not comply and did he produce a survey, or was this just an internal document for his office's use?

Mar shampla, t&aacute; ceann ag Suirbh&eacute;ireacht Ordan&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann agus deir s&eacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh iarracht urlabhra&iacute; Gaeilge le h&uacute;dar&aacute;is leordh&oacute;thanach a chur ar f&aacute;il do agallamh leis na me&aacute;in.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair d&uacute;inne rud mar sin a mheas - c&eacute;ard is "iarracht" ann - seachas f&iacute;ric&iacute; lom faoi l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; a bheas ann n&oacute; l&iacute;on na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute; siad s&aacute;sta a chur ar f&aacute;il a bheith breactha s&iacute;os go cuimsitheach.</p> <p>  Luadh an c&oacute;ras &oacute; thaobh caighde&aacute;in de.  Go bun&uacute;sach, s&eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist ansin n&aacute; seachas a bheith ag brath ar sc&eacute;imeanna teanga den chuid is m&oacute;, mar is iad na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga faoi l&aacute;thair an phr&iacute;omhuirlis at&aacute; ann maidir le dualgais teanga. in &aacute;it dualgas d&iacute;reach a bheith ann maidir le comhartha&iacute;ocht, st&aacute;isean&oacute;ireacht, agus f&oacute;gairt&iacute; taifeadta b&eacute;il.  D&aacute; mbeadh c&oacute;ras caighde&aacute;in leagtha s&iacute;os, mar at&aacute; th&eacute;is tarl&uacute; sa mBreatain Bheag, bheadh go leor bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; leis sin.  S&eacute;ard a chialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bun&uacute;sach n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; rang&uacute; ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; - mar shampla, go mbeadh Ranna i gcatag&oacute;ir amh&aacute;in, institi&uacute;id&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al i gcatag&oacute;ir eile agus &uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la i gcatag&oacute;ir eile - agus go leagfa&iacute; na dualgais ar na catag&oacute;ir&iacute; sin ag brath ar c&eacute;n chatag&oacute;ir ina raibh siad agus go leagfa&iacute; na dualgais is troime orthu si&uacute;d is m&oacute; a bhfuil teangmh&aacute;il acu leis an bpobal.  Ceann de na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; is m&oacute; a bhaineann leis sin n&aacute; go nd&eacute;anann s&eacute; an c&oacute;ras i bhfad n&iacute;os simpl&iacute; do na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; iad f&eacute;in agus don saor&aacute;nach freisin.  Go minic faigheann muide glaoch n&oacute; r&iacute;omhphoist &oacute; shaor&aacute;naigh nach mb&iacute;onn a fhios acu c&eacute;ard iad na cearta a bhfuil siad i dteideal mar braitheann s&eacute; ar c&eacute;ard at&aacute; aontaithe sa sc&eacute;im teanga.  D&aacute; mbeadh caighde&aacute;n com&oacute;nta ann do na heagrais seo, chuideodh s&eacute; go m&oacute;r le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; agus sin ceann de na molta&iacute; a rinne m'oifig maidir leis na ceannteidil ar an mBille.</p> <p>  Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh riachtanais post freisin, go mba cheart go mbeadh poist sainaitheanta ann le Gaeilge agus an g&aacute; at&aacute; ann dul i dteangmh&aacute;il leis an Roinn Caiteachais Poibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe faoi seo.  Is &iacute; sin an Roinn at&aacute; i gceannas &oacute; thaobh earca&iacute;ocht sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; agus mar sin de.  D&uacute;radh i Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge thiar i 2010 go mbeadh poist &aacute; sainaithint as seo amach i sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  B'in c&uacute;ig bliana &oacute; shin.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin tarlaithe ar aon bhealach c&oacute;rasach agus caighde&aacute;nach go dt&iacute; seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-soil&eacute;ir d'&eacute;inne a bhreathna&iacute;onn ar sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  S&eacute;ard at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag go leor acu, an Roinn Caiteachais Poibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe ina measc, a bhfuil sc&eacute;im teanga aontaithe aici le dearna&iacute;, n&aacute; go bhf&eacute;achfaidh siad air sa bhliain amach romhainn maidir le poist a shainaithint agus n&iacute;l aon phost sainaitheanta ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  Seo c&uacute;ig bliana anois tar &eacute;is &eacute; a bheith r&aacute;ite sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain go raibh a leith&eacute;id le cur i bhfeidhm.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil fadhb ansin nach bhfuil d&oacute;thain daoine le Gaeilge ann chun na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il agus caithfear dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb, ach beidh s&eacute; an-deacair dul i ngleic l&eacute;i ar aon bhealach cuimsitheach, c&oacute;rasach, caighde&aacute;nach mura bhfuil d&oacute;thain daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu &aacute; n-earcadh.  Caithfidh Ranna agus comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a aithint go bhfuil g&aacute; lena leith&eacute;id.</p> <p>  Cuireadh roint ceisteanna sa D&aacute;il faoi seo le dearna&iacute; freisin.  Bh&iacute; cuid de na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; do na Ranna an-&iacute;seal.  Bh&iacute; cuid acu ag r&aacute; go raibh beirt, tri&uacute;r n&oacute; ceathrar sa Roinn a raibh Gaeilge acu.  Bh&iacute; Ranna eile n&iacute;os fearr, ar n&oacute;s an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Eachtracha agus Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la agus an Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, ach bh&iacute; Ranna eile ina raibh l&iacute;on na ndaoine le Gaeilge an-&iacute;seal.  Chomh maith leis sin, nuair a cuireadh an cheist faoin m&eacute;id daoine a bh&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il uathu le Gaeilge bh&iacute; go leor de na Ranna c&eacute;anna ag r&aacute; n&aacute;r theastaigh duine ar bith, n&oacute; n&aacute;r theastaigh ach duine n&oacute; beirt.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin ag teacht leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; mise &aacute; chloiste&aacute;il i m'oifig &oacute; dhaoine at&aacute; ag glaoch isteach agus daoine at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh gear&aacute;n faoi easpa sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p> <p>  Luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir an t-imscr&uacute;d&uacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn maidir leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, at&aacute; curtha agam faoi bhr&aacute;id an chomhchoiste.  Ar bhealach, is ceann de na nithe is d&aacute;ir&iacute;re &eacute; seo go bhf&eacute;adfadh aon choimisin&eacute;ir n&aacute; aon ombudsman a bheith ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis: ceist oideachais do ghas&uacute;ir sa nGaeltacht.  Is deacair a shamhl&uacute; go mbeadh aon rud n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; sin.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil easaontas idir m'oifig agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna faoi seo.  Rinne muid imscr&uacute;d&uacute;.  Fr&iacute;theadh go raibh an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ag s&aacute;r&uacute; an Acht Oideachais faoi seo, go ndearnadh iarracht m&uacute;inteoir gan a nd&oacute;thain Gaeilge a bhr&uacute; ar scoil sa nGaeltacht a bh&iacute; ag teagasc tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p> <p>  Ag tagairt don cheist a cuireadh ar ball, ceann de na harg&oacute;int&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna n&aacute; go bhfuil chuile mh&uacute;inteoir c&aacute;ilithe le m&uacute;ineadh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge tar &eacute;is d&oacute;ibh imeacht &oacute;n gcol&aacute;iste oili&uacute;na, in ainneoin thuarasc&aacute;il chigir&iacute; na Roinne, a bh&iacute; ag tabhairt le fios go raibh fadhbanna m&oacute;ra ann ina leith seo.  Is rud uaf&aacute;sach t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo agus ar bhealach caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il faoin gcomhchoiste anois f&eacute;achaint c&eacute;ard ar mhaith leis a dh&eacute;anamh faoi, ach t&aacute; mo chuid dualgas comhl&iacute;onta agam.  Mhol m&eacute; go gcaithfeadh an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna a chinnti&uacute; nach dtarl&oacute;dh an rud c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s agus n&iacute;l m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil na molta&iacute; sin san imscr&uacute;d&uacute; curtha i bhfeidhm in a ioml&aacute;ine agus an dualgas at&aacute; orm anois mar Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga &eacute; sin a leagaint faoi bhr&aacute;id an chomhchoiste.  Is faoi na comhalta&iacute; at&aacute; s&eacute; anois d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist sin.  </p> <p>  Luadh chomh maith Eircode agus d&uacute;irt m&eacute; san &oacute;r&aacute;id go bhfuil cuing &aacute;irithe ag baint leis sin.  &Oacute; thosaigh mise sa bpost, n&iacute;or th&aacute;inig aon l&iacute;on gear&aacute;n gar don mh&eacute;id gear&aacute;n a fuair muid faoin gceist seo.  Bh&iacute; olc dubh ar dhaoine.  Bh&iacute; daoine an-churtha amach faoi, go raibh leaganacha d&aacute; n-ainmneacha n&aacute;r aithin siad ar chor ar bith &oacute; saola&iacute;odh iad in aon ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is St&aacute;it a bh&iacute; acu riamh &aacute; n-&uacute;s&aacute;id chun na Eircodes seo a chur chucu.  Fuair muid os cionn 60 gear&aacute;n maidir leis an &aacute;bhar agus is m&oacute;r an mh&eacute;id &eacute; sin don oifig.  Bhain siad le tr&iacute; &aacute;bhar faoi leith: ainmneacha a bheith aistrithe do Bh&eacute;arla c&eacute; n&aacute;r &uacute;s&aacute;ideadh an leagan Bh&eacute;arla riamh, seolta&iacute; a bheith aistrithe go Bh&eacute;arla sa nGaeltacht agus seolta&iacute; a bheith aistrithe taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p> <p>  Ceann de na ceannteidil ar an mBille n&aacute; go mbeadh dualgais reacht&uacute;il ann go mbeadh cead ag duine leagan Gaeilge d&aacute; ainm agus d&aacute; sheoladh a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  N&iacute;l a leith&eacute;id ann i reachta&iacute;ocht teanga na t&iacute;re faoi l&aacute;thair.  Mar gheall air sin, t&aacute; cuing ann &oacute; thaobh c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad gur f&eacute;idir a fhiosr&uacute;, ach &oacute; chuir an Seanad&oacute;ir an cheist, ba ch&oacute;ir a r&aacute; go bhfuil imscr&uacute;d&uacute; foirmi&uacute;il tionscanta agam anois leis an Roinn Cumars&aacute;ide, Fuinnimh agus Acmhainn&iacute; N&aacute;d&uacute;rtha mar gheall air seo.  N&iacute;l aon r&eacute;amhbhreithi&uacute;nas &aacute; thabhairt, ach feictear dom go bhfuil c&aacute;s le freagairt agus feicfimid c&eacute;ard a thiocfaidh as.  T&aacute; gealltanas &aacute;irithe sa sc&eacute;im teanga de chuid na Roinne, mar shampla, &oacute; thaobh logainmneacha sa nGaeltacht agus feidhmeoimid d&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin agus tiocfaimid ar thoradh ar an imscr&uacute;d&uacute; sin in am tr&aacute;th.</p> <p>  Luadh chomh maith ceist na bpoint&iacute; pian&oacute;is.  Is ceist &iacute; seo a ghoill go m&oacute;r ar dhaoine ar chuile thaobh den arg&oacute;int faoi &oacute;l agus tiom&aacute;int agus ar chuile thaobh den arg&oacute;int faoin nGaeilge.</p><p>Ghoill s&eacute; ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge gur mheas siad go raibh an Ghaeilge &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id, ar bhealach, mar bhata anseo.  Bh&iacute; go leor scr&iacute;obhtha sna me&aacute;in faoi seo agus b'fhi&uacute; c&uacute;pla rud a chur ar an dtaifead faoi seo.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, n&iacute;or bhain s&eacute; seo, beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r, le Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Bhain s&eacute; leis an Acht um Thr&aacute;cht ar Bh&oacute;ithre.  N&iacute; ch&uacute;is&iacute;tear n&oacute; n&iacute; chinnt&iacute;tear &eacute;inne mar gheall ar eolas tiom&aacute;na faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Tarla&iacute;onn seo faoin Acht um Thr&aacute;cht ar Bh&oacute;ithre.</p><p> An dara rud n&aacute; n&iacute; l&uacute;b ar l&aacute;r at&aacute; anseo, n&aacute; baol ar sin.  An rud at&aacute; ann n&aacute; go raibh dualgas soil&eacute;ir leagtha s&iacute;os i reachta&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re go gcuirf&iacute; leagan B&eacute;arla agus leagan Gaeilge den taifead a bh&iacute; ag teacht &oacute;n meais&iacute;n ar f&aacute;il ach mar gheall ar fhadhb riarach&aacute;in, n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; seo ag tarl&uacute;.  N&iacute;l an locht ar an nGaeilge mar gheall ar sin n&aacute; n&iacute;l an locht ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  T&aacute; an locht ar an gc&oacute;ras, ar an St&aacute;t.  Bh&iacute; dualgas soil&eacute;ir leagtha s&iacute;os, ach n&iacute;or cuireadh i bhfeidhm &eacute;.  Is &eacute; at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; anois n&aacute; go bhfuil rialach&aacute;n nua tagtha isteach, ag r&aacute; go mbeidh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  De r&eacute;ir mo thuiscint chomh maith, t&aacute; cead achomharc a lorg i gcoinne cinnidh na hArd C&uacute;irte.</p><p> Sin r&aacute;ite, go ginear&aacute;lta, feictear dom go mb&iacute;onn s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr nuair a chuirtear c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla - gur fearr a chuid&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin.  T&oacute;g mar shampla an Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute; le hUisce &Eacute;ireann faoi l&aacute;thair, ag cur amach na litreacha faoin deontas &euro;100.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge ar taobh amh&aacute;in agus an B&eacute;arla ar an dtaobh eile agus n&iacute;l aon arg&oacute;int n&oacute; cheist faoi mar t&aacute; s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il sa d&aacute; theanga.  Anois, deirtear linn maidir leis an meais&iacute;n seo &oacute; thaobh eolas tiom&aacute;na, go mbeidh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  An rud at&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach anseo n&aacute; go leanfadh muid treoir at&aacute; i bhfeidhm go m&oacute;r, i gCeanada mar shampla, go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; an tairiscint r&eacute;amhgn&iacute;omhach - go ndeirfear leis an duine at&aacute; ag f&aacute;il an taifid seo, "Ar mhaith leat &eacute; i nGaeilge n&oacute; ar mhaith leat &eacute; i mB&eacute;arla?"  M&aacute;s &eacute; go bhfuil siad chun &eacute; a fh&aacute;il i mB&eacute;arla agus m&aacute; chuimhn&iacute;onn siad air n&oacute; m&aacute; chuimhn&iacute;onn an t&eacute; at&aacute; &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il, ba cheart go dtabharfa&iacute; an rogha d&oacute;ibh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; leagtha s&iacute;os go dtabharfa&iacute; an rogha sin d&oacute;ibh.</p><p> T&aacute; tr&iacute; bliana caite anois &oacute; chuaigh sc&eacute;im teanga an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in &eacute;ag agus n&iacute;l ceann nua daingnithe go f&oacute;ill.  Ceann de na molta&iacute; a bheadh agam n&aacute; go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; for&aacute;il a chur isteach sa sc&eacute;im teanga - go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; an tairiscint r&eacute;amhgn&iacute;omhach seo.

Mar sin, n&iacute; thagann aon chomhlacht a th&aacute;inig ar an saol &oacute; shin faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta.  Is iad an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Sh&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht ar Bh&oacute;ithre agus Uisce &Eacute;ireann an d&aacute; cheann is m&oacute; i measc sin a thagann chun cinn.

B&iacute;onn muid ag brath ar deathoil na n-eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; sin agus go minic faigheann muid an deathoil sin.  Ach i gc&aacute;sanna eile go minic, mar gheall nach bhfuil dualgas ann, b&iacute;onn orainn a r&aacute; leis an t&eacute; at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh gear&aacute;in nach bhfuil an dualgas sin ar an gcomhlacht poibl&iacute; mar n&iacute; thagann s&eacute; faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta.  N&iacute; maith liomsa, mar Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, mar duine at&aacute; ceaptha le cearta teanga an duine a chosaint, a bheith ag r&aacute; sin.  &Aacute;bhar eile a th&aacute;inig chun cinn n&aacute; cead&uacute;nas tiom&aacute;na.  N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Sh&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht ar Bh&oacute;ithre faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta agus mar gheall ar sin n raibh an dualgas sin ann.  Bh&iacute; go leor fadhbanna faoi sin.</p> <p>  Chuir an Teachta ceist chomh maith faoi mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; le l&iacute;ofacht Gaeilge agus faoi c&eacute;n c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; ar cheart a bheith ann.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach bhfuil m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; c&aacute;ilithe ar aon n&oacute;s nuair a thagann siad amach &oacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; oili&uacute;na.  Sin arg&oacute;int a bh&iacute; ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  L&eacute;irigh scr&uacute;d&uacute; a rinne cigir&iacute; na Roinne go raibh fadhbanna m&oacute;ra ann &oacute; thaobh an caighde&aacute;n Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ag go leor daoine a bh&iacute; ag teacht amach &oacute; na col&aacute;ist&iacute; oili&uacute;na.

T&aacute; feabhas tagtha ar an sc&eacute;al &oacute; shin.  Cuireadh ceist orm faoiin scr&uacute;d&uacute; a rinne muid d&uacute;inn f&eacute;in agus faoi an raibh s&eacute; poibl&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; seo istigh sa tuarasc&aacute;il bhliaint&uacute;il, mar cheap muid go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh daoine ar an eolas faoi na caighde&aacute;in agus na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; at&aacute;thar &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il agus faoi an bhfuil &uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la, chomh maith le comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; eile, ag comhl&iacute;onadh na ndualgas at&aacute; orthu.  Fuair muid amach nach raibh ach p&eacute;ire as 32 go hioml&aacute;n g&eacute;illi&uacute;il, ach t&aacute; athr&uacute; beag tagtha ar sin &oacute; shin.  Anois, t&aacute; s&eacute; chomairl&iacute; contae g&eacute;illi&uacute;il go hioml&aacute;n agus c&eacute;imni&uacute; chun feabhais glactha ag 11 de na comhairl&iacute; contae, &oacute; 2014, ard&uacute; de 37%.  Is feabhas &eacute; sin.</p> <p>  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn mion teanga ann, l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an staid&eacute;ar go ginear&aacute;lta go bhfuil s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an teanga sin feice&aacute;lach.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil comhartha&iacute;ocht, st&aacute;isean&oacute;ireacht agus f&oacute;gairt&iacute; taifeadta b&eacute;il chomh t&aacute;bhachtach, go gcloisfeadh agus go bhfeicfeadh daoine an Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh s&iacute; mar chuid n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha den saol poibl&iacute; d&oacute;ibh agus iad ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an St&aacute;t.

Conas is f&eacute;idir sin a athr&uacute; ionas go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; &eacute; sin go huathoibr&iacute;och?  An dtarla&iacute;onn sin sa Bhreatain Bheag agus an bhfuil gach comhlacht a fhaigheann maoini&uacute; ansin cl&uacute;daithe ag an reachta&iacute;ocht ansin?

B'fh&eacute;idir nach raibh s&eacute; go dona roimhe sin.  T&aacute; an sc&eacute;im teanga ann, dar nd&oacute;igh, ach bheadh s&eacute; sin ag aon Roinn.

No. 7 is engagement with the chairperson designate of Sport Ireland.  The purpose of this morning's meeting is to engage with the chairperson designate of Sport Ireland, the body charged with the merged functions of the former Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority, to discuss the proposals to take, if and when appointed to the role, and his views on the challenges currently facing the body.  We are all by now very well aware of the Government decision in May 2011 which put new arrangements in place for the appointments of persons to State boards and bodies.</p><p>Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet with the chairperson designate, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, and to hear his views.  We trust this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Kieran Mulvey, whom most members will know well from previous appearances before the committee.<br/><br/>I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements witnesses have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I look forward to my engagement with the committee today and I hope that members will, on the basis of what I have to say, endorse my appointment to this critical role in Irish life.  I was very privileged to be appointed chairman of the Irish Sports Council and I humbly acknowledge the honour that has been bestowed on me by the Government, and will I hope be bestowed on me by this committee, in being appointed to the chairmanship of Sport Ireland.</p> <p>  As members will be aware from their deliberations on the act leading up to its report of March 2014, the proposal which arises is the merging of the Irish Sports Council with the National Sports Campus Development Authority and the creation of one statutory body, Sport Ireland.  That has to be a welcome development in the context of maximising synergies and resources and enabling concentration on the development of sports in Ireland, at local and national level and through the national governing bodies.  It will also utilise the physical capacity and capability of the national campus itself, which is a hallmark development for the positioning of national sports in one campus and should add value to that effort.  </p> <p>  Sport Ireland will be a composite of four bodies, including Coaching Ireland, the Irish Institute of Sport, the high performance section of the Irish Sports Council and the campus.  Creating synergy is important and has already been achieved through Coaching Ireland and the institute of sport working under the Irish Sports Council.  The new board will focus on developing potential within the one entity.  I do not think it will be difficult to achieve as both the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority have worked very closely with the Department and Ministers over the past number of years.  It is not as if it is a shotgun marriage - it is a joint venture that has the support of everybody involved.  It is positive that we have worked in tandem in the past and hopefully we will do so as one entity in the future.</p> <p>  Since my appointment as chairman of the Irish Sports Council, I have made it a point, subject to the time available, to visit as many NGB occasions as possible, be they conferences, special events, dinners or award ceremonies.  I think I have got to most of them, even the Irish Amateur Boxing Association and its national competitions.  I have established a very good working relationship with the chief executives, the presidents and the honorary officers of the boards of those organisations.  I have met them individually and collectively and listened to them on the subject of their funding arrangements for each year.  Despite some difficulties, 99% of the time spent there constitutes a good working relationship among the campus, the Sports Council and the NGBs.  Of particular importance to me have been my relationships with the Olympic Council of Ireland and its president, Pat Hickey, Paralympics Ireland and its chief executive, Liam Harbison and Matt English of Special Olympics Ireland.  These are very important bodies that do very important work, both nationally and internationally, on behalf of athletes of all capabilities.  That is important because dysfunctional relationships among individuals and organisations have riven sport in the past, leading to unseemly rows about certain issues, although thankfully this is not happening at the moment.  </p> <p>  Managing the situation over the past five years has been a challenge with the restraints in public expenditure and cutbacks in sport.  Particularly important aspects of that have been the continuation of the sports capital programme, which has been a vital component to NGBs, and the effective and generous use by the Department and the Minister of dormant accounts for equipment.  That has put Irish sport and the NGBs in a good place, both from the point of view of facilities and equipment, and we are getting a payback from those organisations for the investment of a considerable volume of taxpayers' money over the period.  We cannot have much of an argument with the various sports for the return they have made on the taxpayers' investment, through the Government and the Oireachtas.  They are largely excellent people of calibre, integrity, ability and achievement.  </p> <p>  At an international level this success has been reflected in medalling, which has been a feature in international competition in the past five years.  This is the pinnacle which enables us to wrap the green flag around us and we enjoy seeing podium finishes for our athletes and teams and the tricolour alongside the flags of other nations of the world.  To use a phrase which may be a bit unfortunate in the current circumstances, we box above our weight in a multiplicity of sports.  One of the excellent features in sport in the past number of years is the extent to which, outside our own national sports, participation levels have increased.  We are now getting back into sailing and, hopefully, rowing has come of age.  We are bringing though individual athletes in track and field to follow what John Treacy and Senator Eamonn Coghlan achieved before them.  We have identified and brought forward really good junior talent, particularly through the women in sport programme, without which we would not have Annalise Murphy or Katie Taylor to set an example of excellence.  There are hundreds coming through the system.  </p> <p>  The high-performance endeavour and special programmes such as women in sport are bearing reward for the nation, not just in our national sports of Gaelic Football, Hurling and Camogie but also in minority sports such as cricket, hockey, equestrian sports, sailing and judo.  Merging athletes such as triathletes and modern pentathletes are now featuring at international level, having had little or no participation or excellence in the past.  The one great sadness of the Olympic Games in London was that we had two fourth places.  We were so close to additional medals and those athletes have continued to perform at world level.  The Irish Institute of Sport has been a marvellous development.  Coaching Ireland, based in the University of Limerick, is also an outstanding organisational arrangement for developing coaches in all the disciplines.</p><p>Those who participate in our main field sports now perform to a level not achieved before.  The numbers are on an upward trend and, according to the ESRI's Irish Sports Monitor assessment, we have almost reached parity in terms of female and male participation in sport.  We hope to have this parity within the next two or three years.</p><p> The functions of Sport Ireland have been laid out and I will now discuss its targets for the next four or five years.  These include: ensuring the board and executive operate effectively; that the interchange with, funding for and arrangements in respect of national governing bodies are brought forward and that targets in respect of participation, winning medals, coaching and success which can be achieved but which are both realistic and challenging are set for them.  The national governing bodies will, therefore, be very important.  Sport Ireland must also ensure the facilities, coaches and high-performance directors are in place and that local sports partnerships are structured and funded to bring about synergies between sports.</p><p> The committee's report dealt with the facilities in which the State has invested and I am very glad of this.  The State has provided billions of euro for physical facilities for all sports throughout the country.  These must be shared and utilised appropriately and properly, and it is the same for third level and second level institutions, which must be utilised and maximised, with the agreement and support of all of the national governing bodies, to bring forward greater participation.  This is not just about people engaged in sport, it is also about wider community activity, including on the part of older and younger individuals who may not be involved in competitive sports but who are involved in leisure sports.  I hope we will make more effort in the capital sports programme to ensure that those high-cost and expensive facilities do not lie fallow and are utilised by local communities.  I appreciate there are ownership and leasing issues and that individual sports must take priority in the context of using their own facilities.  However, there are times when there is greater availability for local communities and other non-competitive training and coaching activities.</p><p> We all remember the controversy about what was euphemistically termed "the Bertie bowl".  However, the decision to acquire the 500 acres of land where it was to be situated was a far-sighted one.  My regret is that this is top-quality agricultural land and my heart goes out when I see it being dug up in order that buildings might be erected.  The land is strategically located in Abbotstown, which is located off the M50, and the facility there is tremendous.  It is probably the hidden gem of Irish physical sports development but it is coming on stream in leaps and bounds, with buy-in from the various sports organisations.  In addition, some 20 national governing bodies - including that of the FAI - have located their headquarters there and there are more to come on board, including Sport Ireland.  We are supposed to be accommodated in Abbotstown House, which is to be renovated.  If the yard is available and is restructured and renovated, Sport Ireland will go in there to show there is a physical location for all of the agencies.</p><p> I hope that in the next five years we will complete the indoor arena - the project relating to which is proceeding on schedule - and tender for and complete the construction of a velodrome, particularly as we have to win medals in the sport of cycling.  From the point of view of developing cycling in Ireland, there is a need for a velodrome and it is the next infrastructural project.  After this are two considerations I have heard from certain national governing bodies, particularly the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, namely, that there is a need for covered stadia, particularly in view of the nature of Irish weather, in order that training can take place on a year-round basis.  Perhaps we can examine this matter in the context of development.</p><p> There is a need for accommodation on the campus.  I am not sure as to the nature of the accommodation required but the project seems right for a public private partnership of some description, particularly in view of the proximity to Blanchardstown Institute of Technology, Connolly Hospital and Dublin City University.  In addition, there is a need for the IRFU, the FAI, occasionally the GAA, and hockey and other sports to be accommodated on the campus.  There may be a prospect for commercial development, perhaps a hotel or whatever.  The big issue regarding the future development of the campus is making it pay so it does not become a burden on the taxpayer and at least breaks even or makes a profit.  Perhaps we do not need all of the land.  I would need to be reassured about this.  There is pressure in the area for further business park expansion and for Connolly Hospital to be developed further.  Perhaps we could generate additional funding for public private partnerships which would not be a burden on the taxpayer as private money could be generated to build some of the facilities.</p><p> The committee is aware of the legacy issue regarding an outstanding legal case with Dublin Waterworld.  This matter is still before the courts and I do not wish to comment further on it.  It is an issue to which I must devote my attention immediately because it has proved to be an extraordinary drain on resources and has required major input on the part of the executive of the organisation.  We must resolve this matter, either through the courts or by means of another arrangement.</p><p> A meeting will be held later today with Cricket Ireland about developing Malahide.  We need a national cricket ground because 10,000 people will go to see the Irish cricket team play tests.  We want to be a test nation.  We have done a deal and signed a memorandum with Fingal County Council, under its chief executive, Paul Reid, and it is ready to go.  I hope the Minister can show some largesse because the project will cost approximately &euro;3 million to complete.  We cannot erect stands every time Ireland needs to play a cricket match.  It is an ideal venue and has North-South connectivity.</p><p> The North-South dimension with Sport Northern Ireland is important.  A meeting was recently held with Ministers and chief executives, and we have decided to have an annual meeting.  We will continue to share operations because we have all-Ireland sports and it is very important that we do not overlap and duplicate facilities which can be available on all of the island to everybody.  Everywhere is within driving distance now and one does not need to fly anywhere.  The more we keep our coaches and athletes at home, the better it will be for them in the context of increasing capability and creating additionality.</p><p> In broad scope, these are the areas I hope to develop.  There will be others which the committee will require us to address in our annual reports.</p></speech>

He has given a very clear outline of the challenges and opportunities that exist, as well as his vision for the maximisation of potential of sport in Ireland with regard to participation and at the high-performance and elite levels.</p> <p>  From time to time, the committee has questions about governing bodies.  My general question is whether Mr. Mulvey is happy with the governance of those bodies.  In recent days, the issue of boxing has arisen.  Mr. Mulvey mentioned it earlier.  I welcome the stand he took on "Prime Time" last night and I know the Minister has also been involved and has been working hard on the matter.  Have we lost the best boxing coach Ireland has ever had or is the situation redeemable?  If we have lost him, how did it come to this?  I raised this matter two years ago when concerns first began to arise.  Mr. Mulvey mentioned the synergies with Sport Northern Ireland and that there cannot be duplication.  Do boxers and athletes in Northern Ireland receive grants from both Sport Northern Ireland and Sport Ireland, while their counterparts in the Republic do not?</p><p>Is that still the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015102100002#G00200"><p>On the issue of governance, the sports council had to undergo a certain governance review in light of other developments.  That was conducted for us by the governance specialists in the Institute of Public Administration.  They made a number of observations we have incorporated and agreed, and that relates to a lacuna that existed in our organisation about what needed to be done.</p> <p>  We provide governance and code of ethics courses for the national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport.  The kernel of the issue is that without appropriate governance, transparency and accountability, everything goes for naught.  If they are not established, clear and understood, all the rest becomes tangential.  We need structures that are conscious of and conform to normal governance standards.  These organisations get substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and that must be accounted for.  That is a requirement and necessary.</p> <p>  With respect to the issue with the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, in my five years as chairman of the Irish Sports Council, it is my view that what we have been trying to manage over the past five years is a dysfunctional arrangement.  I am putting it mildly when I say that.  The history with the Irish Amateur Boxing Association is long and there have been problems in successive years prior to and during my time in this job.  It is around issues of governance and how the organisation is run at a national level.</p> <p>  I want to make a particular point regarding my interview last night.  It was not included in the publicised section but I made an issue about future funding and requirements around a review of engagements.  I am not threatening any boxer, coach or club; they will be protected by us.  I am saying we are not happy at the top level about how this organisation is being run and its engagement with the "head coach".  It does not even call him the director of high performance, which is the post for which we approved funding.  We are not happy with the way, since last February, negotiations - or no negotiations - have been concluded.  Gross disrespect has been shown to us and the Minister in this matter, and it cannot be allowed to go on.  The IABA is a totally funded body, with almost &euro;2 million going in between capital, equipment and day-to-day expenses.  It is not about the boxers, clubs or coaches.  We are delighted with the calibre of boxers and coaches and the social inclusion that the sport brings in our community.  We have a serious problem with the individuals leading this organisation.</p> <p>  How is it we have got to this stage?  How did it happen 24 hours before Mr. Billy Walsh departs to the United States to take up an appointment that puts him in direct opposition to Ireland in male and female boxing?  We are allowing the best boxing coach in the world to leave and all the organisation gave was one paragraph, saying in effect, "Thank you very much and good-bye, and by the way there is a load of other people ready to take the job".  I have never seen such crocodile tears in all my life.</p></speech>

We were so concerned about this at council level that I asked council to meet representatives in the IABA as a matter of urgency.  We met them at our request.  That followed a series of engagements going back to last February.  I met them on 20 August along with the chief executive; Mr. Paul McDermott, the high performance and NGB liaison officer with the sports council; Mr. Bernard Allen, vice chairman of the council, former Minister of State with responsibility for sport and former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts; and Mr. Liam Sheedy, who would be known to members in GAA circles and is chairman of our high performance committee.  We put the point to them as to how urgent and essential it was that this should be resolved, as Mr. Walsh had an offer from the United States, which he had not accepted or signed.  We needed to move.  I got so upset at that meeting that towards the end, I had to ask the directors present if they wanted to keep Mr. Walsh.  I got an answer of "Yes".  After that meeting, I consulted with colleagues and said it was the most unconvincing "Yes" I have heard in my professional career.</p> <p>  We then insisted that they would meet with us as a matter of urgency within the next 48 hours.  I cancelled other arrangements and scheduled at meeting on the Saturday morning in the Clayton Hotel in Leopardstown.  Over three or four hours, the meeting took place with Mr. Walsh present, along with the chief executive of the IABA and a board of directors member.  I thought the chairman would have at least attended but he did not.  I do not know the reason he did not.  I attended because I thought it so important.  We negotiated a deal over four hours and shook hands and that was to be brought back to the board of directors of the IABA for approval.  We were told on one day it would be done but on Monday evening we were told that a sub-committee had decided it would not be put to the board.  After that, the issue cascaded.</p> <p>  The Minister called us together in Athlone and I attended the meeting.  We heard all the good noises to the effect that the issue would be sorted out and Mr. Walsh would be given a new contract.  His permanent contract would be changed to a fixed-term contract.  Everything would be okay.  The Minister was assured, right up to the weekend, that everything would be all right.  It may be for another occasion but the issue was what they were asking Mr. Walsh to do on the non-financial side; there was no problem with the financial aspects, as we, through the State and taxpayers, would have been funding it.  I will give an example of a non-financial issue.  The high performance or head coach could not engage with the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Irish Sports Council or the media without the written permission of the chief executive officer.  We do not operate on that basis.  There are meetings on a weekly or monthly basis.  Imagine an organisation saying this to its chief coach.  Imagine Joe Schmidt being told he had to contact Mr. Philip Browne every time he selected a team, made a decision or talked to the media.</p> <p>  This is unconscionable and unacceptable.  I am sorry to be very strong about this but we are losing the best coach in this area.  I do not mind if there are other good coaches.  We have the best man, who has been poached by the United States with oceans of money.  It is not the first time Mr. Walsh has been approached.  What do we do on the eve of the Olympics?  We let him go.</p></speech>

Ordinarily, the witness would be able to leave meetings of this kind quite speedily but, unfortunately, because of what has come into sharp focus over the past number of days, as the Chairman alluded to, the issue is worthy of further discussion.</p><p> When somebody such as the witness appears before the committee, generally I ask what we can do for them as legislators.  Our role, in terms of sport or any other area, is to enact laws.  It is for the Government to provide funding but for us as mere parliamentarians our role is to draft legislation and improve legislation as it currently exists.  The witness has set out the background to the current situation in respect of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.  Effectively, it is giving the two fingers to Mr. Mulvey as chairperson of Sports Ireland, it is giving the two fingers to the taxpayers, it has already given it to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport so it somehow believes it is insulated from reality, authority and, more important, the paymaster, the Irish people.  That is appalling given the context in which we are  trying to develop our high performance sports.  </p><p> What changes would the witness like to see put in place to strengthen his hand as chairman of Sports Ireland to allow him go back to the individuals, the CEO, the chairman and the board of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association and to put him in a position to say it cannot continue to perform as it has been doing and if it continues to do so funding will have to be removed.  Who pays the CEO of the boxing association?  Who funds the chairman's trips around the world to various events?  I do not know if he is paid as an executive or remunerated through expenses.  It is a classic case of the green blazer brigade exercising authority for the sake of it to protect its own castle.  It is continuously poking the finger in the eye of the taxpayer.  It is damaging the reputation of Ireland abroad, that a person of the calibre of Billy Walsh moves to the US.  I have listened with interest to what he has had to say in the past couple of days.  My heart goes out to him.  He is imbedded in Irish sport and his heart is in it.  I am taken by what he said that from the age of seven years this was the job he wanted.  He has it, he has performed to the highest standard possible and he has been told, "Good luck and thanks for the dance" because a small group of green blazers will not relinquish control.  </p><p> What legislation does Mr. Mulvey need as part of his armour to put him in a strengthened position where he is not just left with threatening to remove funding at a time when there are so many good athletes?  Mr. Mulvey is caught between a rock and a hard place.  He has good athletes who are capable of winning and all he can say is that he will hold back the money.  Who suffers?  It is the athletes and the reputation of the country.  What suite of measures need to be put in place, given that a dysfunctional amateur association is not living up to the standards we all expect?  It has the ball and is holding on to it and in the process it is giving all of us the two fingers.  It is an appalling situation.  It is sad given that there are so many volunteers.  In my own county I know the work that is being done by boxing coaches and people who are involved in the sport.  They have played such an important role in the lives of teenagers and young people who, in many cases, might have taken another path were it not for the fact that they had the support of volunteers.  There is a handful of people at the top who do so much damage to people's lives.</p><p> Who are we talking about?  Can Mr. Mulvey name the executive?  I am sure it is a matter of public record.  I would Mr. Mulvey to tell me who is the chief executive, the chairman and the couple of directors with whom he has had most contact.  He does not have to cast any aspersion on them, as I am sure he will not.  He is a diplomat in that regard but let us have their names out today.</p></speech>

I will have a little more time to dedicate to Sport Ireland, which has been an increasingly onerous but enjoyable task as I am due for mandatory retirement next May.  Between last night and this morning I have been displaying my own frustration and anger at this debacle.  No blame can be laid at the Sports Council or the Minister on this matter.  We have bent over backwards with these individuals.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked a number of questions, one of which was if there is anything that can be done in legislation.  I believe we have sufficient powers within the current legislative framework.  It is a matter of political will on our behalf and on the Government's behalf.  It is a matter for the board of the new Sport Ireland.  I know from the board of the Irish Sports Council, with which I am still in a limbo situation, that it was very clear on what we should do.  I am echoing its sentiments so I am representing its opinion.  Our view is that this cannot continue.  One cannot have a situation whereby the will or the genuine interest and concern of the council and the Minister, both<i>ad idem</i>, is ignored, and even more than ignored as the Deputy said.  They have been given the two fingers.<br/><br/>The IABA for all practical purposes is almost totally funded by the State.  It is not my intention and it will never be the intention of the board to hurt the athletes, the boxers, the coaches and the young people participating.  All of those can get a guarantee from me this morning they will not be touched.  We will ensure they continue to receive our support to the best financial level we can provide.  My concern is that portion of the grant that is given to the IABA for central headquarter administration and cost.  I am putting the marker down today and I hope I will be supported on this.  We will review that for the 2016 funding round until we are assured that everything that is required from transparency and corporate practice is to our satisfaction and the satisfaction of this committee.  It is no more and no less than is required because things have happened in the past, things are happenings and now we have the culmination of this.  It is a long-running row.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan<b></b>would know it from his own membership of the council.  It is not today or yesterday this arose and it is not just Billy Walsh.  Others have suffered.  It is not working properly, it needs to be fixed and it has to be fixed.  <br/><br/>The Deputy asked who do we fund.  I understand we fund everything, including salaries; coaches where they are professional coaches; expenses; travel; the gyms, that is, the capital; and everything else through the capital-----</p></speech>

From a personal perspective and in my role as a Senator, I thank Mr. Mulvey for his leadership of and dedication to the Irish Sports Council since his appointment.  Having been on the board of the Irish Sports Council and having chaired the high performance committee I have witnessed at first hand exactly what the Irish Sports Council has delivered.</p><p> Subject to the approval I have no doubt will be forthcoming, I wish Mr. Mulvey and the board the best of luck with Sport Ireland.  The Irish Sports Council transformed Irish sport following its establishment in 1999, in particular over the last eight years when it has asked all the national governing bodies to step up to the plate.  Where it established criteria for them to be professionalised, most of them have met them.  I have seen the transformation of the high performance programme in all sports through to participation in sport in Ireland and coach education.  Last Saturday week, I was in at the sports campus and I was never so envious in all my life.  It is 30 years too late for me.  When I saw the new national indoor arena under construction, I said "Wow" and wished it had been there all those years ago.  The facilities are a monument to the people of Ireland, not just the high performance sportspeople.  The public will be able to use those facilities going forward.  Having all the NGBs located on campus will be brilliant.  They will be able to share knowledge and think and act big.  They will raise their level of thinking in world terms to a higher bar.</p><p> Each week, we celebrate great Irish sporting performances by individuals and teams all around the world.  Sometimes, we cry a little bit when we do not make the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup.  The saddest story of all this year was the resignation of Billy Walsh over the last number of days.  I have known Billy for many years and understand exactly what has been going on for the past seven years.  I have two simple questions for Mr. Mulvey, who may reiterate what he has already said.  I know it is not about money because looking at what Mr. Mulvey has shown us, he should be getting double the salary.  Given that he is not looking for money, what is Billy looking for?  What is the IABA so resistant about giving him?  What is it that they will not give Billy?  The other question relates to the Chairman's point and the relationship with Sport Northern Ireland.  There was some contention with athletes from the Republic of Ireland who felt that while they were getting nice funding from the Irish Sports Council, Olympians and Paralympians in the North of Ireland could get double funding.  That was being addressed a few years ago.  What is the situation with regard to that double funding and have any decisions been made about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015102100002#J00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his kind words.  I enjoyed a period of time working with the Senator before his appointment to the Oireachtas.  Senator Coghlan asked what Billy Walsh was looking for.  I think he was looking for respect and, my God, did he deserve it.  The second thing he wanted was reasonable authority to run the high performance programme without petty bureaucratic interference day in and day out.  They were the two core issues with him.  I gave a flavour of what the IABA was looking for in the new contract.  How can one have a situation in Doha where a boxer wins a world medal and he turns to Des Cahill to say, &quot;I cannot be interviewed.  I have to get written permission from the chief executive&quot;.  There is a lot said.  That exposes a mentality to me.  From what I know and understand of what was going on, it was constantly to chip back at whatever authority Billy had achieved within the organisation, albeit that authority was not enormous.<br/><br/>There is a feeling I get sometimes from meeting with the IABA that there is a resentment of the high performance unit and the resources that go to it.  It is not out of kilter with the balance in other sports.  We maintain that balance.  Participation is vitally important.  It is not about elites but participation.  We develop elites out of participation and that is vital.  When we get elite talent, we nurture and care for it by providing the facilities.  Senator Coghlan had to go abroad to do it, but athletes no longer  have to do that in a lot of sports.  We have to arrange for training abroad, but it is not the first criterion.<br/><br/>In regard to the double funding issue, I am not as familiar with that as I should be.  We have discussed the matter with Sport Northern Ireland and there is a further meeting this morning.  We have to watch that we are not doubly funding.  We have a proper and reasonably generous podium finish for our elite athletes on the basis of performance and that is important.  The issue in Sport Northern Ireland is a bit more sensitive because we have Team GB who are predators about certain athletes on our island.  Team GB has medalled people at gold, silver and bronze at world, Commonwealth and Olympic games on the basis of dual nationality in Northern Ireland.  It is a sensitive issue.  We must ensure that those we fund in all-Ireland sports are not disadvantaged<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the incentives and opportunities that may be available from across the water.  It is highly competitive.  Team GB sees the GB as GB, with Northern Ireland as an element of that.</p></speech>

I respect his honesty.  He was passionate about the way he sees this.  I was surprised that he was so straightforward in terms of what has happened.  It is a great pity that we have Mr. Mulvey here to talk about all the issues around Sport Ireland but have ended up debating the whole Billy Walsh issue.  I will touch on it briefly, but it seems that there will be two casualties.  It looks as though the IABA is untenable from what Mr. Mulvey says.  Its position is untenable into the future one way or another whatever happens with Billy Walsh.  It is deeply insulting that anyone would ask a manager or someone in charge not to have an interview.  I can imagine what would happen if someone told Joe Schmidt that he could not be interviewed.  That is his job and part of the way a manager runs things.  We are going to lose a fantastic man whose record is second to none and it is all down to bureaucracy and positions and people wanting to wield a bit of power.  I will say no more on that.  I am so disappointed with the IABA.</p> <p>  The sports campus is on the edge of my constituency and is an outstanding facility.  With all the different sports that are going in there, it will have a huge impact over time.  What other sports does Mr. Mulvey consider need to be addressed from a long-term point of view?  There are a lot of sports.  I am into karate which is one of the things I have been doing all my life.  It is not really recognised in the Olympics.  There is also the Irish trotting issue.  We have horse racing and the conflict with trotting trying to get on the map, notwithstanding that it is big as a sport in other European countries and in the USA.  What is Mr. Mulvey's opinion on some of this?  We have not mentioned the Paralympics and our huge successes there.  In general terms, we are punching above our weight as a country.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the all-Ireland approach.  There is Sport Northern Ireland.  The debate many years ago was about an all-Ireland soccer team.  We have an all-Ireland rugby team.  Is it Mr. Mulvey's intention to engage in that argument again?  We should have an all-Ireland soccer team.  It should be back on the table for discussion.  It is something Mr. Mulvey might let us know about.</p> <p>  We are trying to push the health message to schools.  There are issues of obesity for many pupils.  Can Mr. Mulvey give us an idea of how Sport Ireland works regarding the different schools and getting the message out?</p></speech>

Sometimes, when one sees something happen that should not happen, anger can come out.  I watched Mr. Billy Walsh this week.  Deputy Dooley has said that here was a man forced into exile because Mr. Walsh did not want to go.  It is as W.B. Yeats said a century ago:</p><blockquote>The beating down of the wise<br /><br />And great art beaten down</blockquote> <p>What is in us that we cannot recognise, reward and honour success?  We may not be unique in that but my God we do it with a flourish - but that is a personal view.<br/><br/>I will now turn to the issue of minority sports, including karate and so on.  It is our hope that the dedicated training facilities of the Irish Institute of Sport will be available to all sports.  There is an area specifically for boxing which could be utilised by karate and other sports which use the same mats, the same ring and the same training arrangements.  It would be useful if the committee could arrange a visit in order to view the facilities.</p></speech>

It is also very commercial.</p></speech>

We are facing an obesity crisis among our young people.  Some of the major ways to avoid obesity are exercise, appropriate diet and food intake and engagement in sport.  That many of our young people are spending more time in front of a laptop, iPad or computer rather then being outside is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It is a health promotion issue, a sport issue and a cross-departmental issue and we are going to have to create more initiatives around that.  Sport Ireland is conscious of this and we have held discussions about it from the health promotion perspective.  We need to structure it and roll it out on a larger scale in order to inform people about what can be done.  At the other end of the spectrum, we need to educate older people about the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of adult diabetes and for heart health through cardio exercises.</p> <p>  I will  now turn to the matter of all-island co-operation.  Deputy Ellis would be very aware of the sensitivities around this issue.  The relationship between Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland is excellent.  I have a very good personal relationship with the chairman of the latter and there is good communication between our chief executives and our boards.  The important element is that our boards would meet.  Our Ministers and ourselves met recently at Slieve Donard for a breakfast meeting about a European network arrangement around which there is much positivity.</p> <p>  Some sports, such as athletics, cricket, hockey and rugby, have an all-island history which precedes the War of Independence and the Special Olympics and the Paralympics are run on an all-island basis.  I will be blunt about it - in Northern Ireland the big issue is what school one went to and where one's political or national loyalties may lie.  It is a sensitive matter.</p> <p>  Reference was made to an all-island soccer team.  I had thought that it might be feasible but when both teams were in the doldrums it became more difficult.  With the tremendous success of the Northern Ireland soccer team I cannot see them wanting to euphorically join up with the Republic of Ireland team anytime soon.  I hope we will succeed in our match against Bosnia.  We once had a united Ireland team when we played against Brazil under Derek Dougan.  He was in there in Dalymount on that marvellous, excellent and wonderful day.  However, issues and tensions remain around the idea of a united Ireland soccer team.  Perhaps an international body such as UEFA  - I do not want to mention FIFA yet - could liaise with the representatives about "the home countries" being too big.  With the break-up of the Balkans and with new states emerging, that issue has died a death as the governing body wants everybody in, no matter how small they might be.  However, the two O'Neills might be able to talk to one another.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his new position, it will be an exciting role.  I agree with Deputy Ellis that it is good of Mr. Mulvey to come before the committee and be so honest with us.  Such honesty is needed within sport and across all bodies.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvey referred to female participation in sport.  Women's Gaelic football is one of the fastest-growing female sports in Ireland.  However, there is a disconnect between the two organisations - the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the GAA - involved in its administration.  People may not realise there are two associations and I will give an example.  A new state of the art centre of excellence opened in Meath last month.  It has fantastic football grounds, sporting facilities and a dedicated sports building.  There was a big event with minor sports and junior sporting activities happening all day.  However, I left half way through the event because 15 km away in Navan, the intermediate junior and senior ladies Gaelic football finals were taking place.  One would imagine that steps would have been taken to ensure those two events did not take place on the same day.  There seems to be a breakdown and I do not know if one could place blame with one organisation.  Does Mr. Mulvey feel that something could be done in that kind of situation?  Mr. Mulvey referred to the hundreds of millions of euro invested in sporting facilities and the GAA would be one of the beneficiaries of that investment.  I understand that women may pay higher rates of insurance per player to play on the pitches so I would appreciate comment from Mr. Mulvey on that.</p></speech>

I always approach GAA matters with a certain tiptoe attitude since the Chairman would be very familiar with the GAA.  There is the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, then there is the Camogie Association and the GAA, which seem to operate effectively within one organisation.  I believe the GAA would like a merged organisation.  From a funding point of view, we would like a merged GAA as we would prefer to fund a single body.  That body would then decide what needs to be done.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan would be aware of that as a policy and that the Sports Council prefers one fund for one body.</p> <p>  I understand that the LGFA fears it could potentially become absorbed in the merged organisation and lose its unique voice.  In Helen O'Rourke, it has an excellent representative who bends my ear whenever she meets me about the importance of ladies' Gaelic football retaining its identity.  We have discussed the one funding principle and the synergies with Paraic Duffy and with the president of the GAA and it will arise again in the next funding round.  Sport Ireland will not force the position because it is a matter for discussion and a sensitive area.  I am sure the LGFA would be of the view that it might not be to its advantage to be deprived of separate funding.  We must listen to its view.</p> <p>  We must also address the formation of the Women's Gaelic Players Association, WGPA.</p><p>They will be seeking similar <i>pro rata</i>funding arrangements as their colleagues in the GPA, whom we fund to the tune of almost &euro;1 million a year.  I assure the Deputy that it will be a live issue in the coming months.  It is an issue that is not going to and should not go away.  It must be addressed.  This issue has also arisen for the IRFU with regard to the funding of the international women's rugby team for potential Olympic participation.  It arises for the FAI and other sports as well.  We have been trying to develop the Women in Sport programme in addition to the other funding.  I need to tread very carefully in this area.  If we are to achieve satisfaction for all groups, it will require some delicate footwork - if I can use that phrase - in light of the legitimate interests of both sides.</p></speech>

Although I do not know him, I must say I was impressed by his straightforward and honest contribution to a television programme he appeared on last night.  It seemed to come from the heart, which is not something we encounter in bucketfuls around this place.  It was good and refreshing to see someone so impressive whose heart is in the right place.</p> <p>  We all know we have a problem.  How do we solve that problem?  The next phase needs a leader or someone to solve the problem.  Is there some way that the Irish Sports Council or another body could take over the high-performance team in order to ensure that the boxers who represent our country are given every facility and every opportunity to compete with the best in the world?  Has Mr. Mulvey or anyone associated with him contacted Billy Walsh?  Is all of this being done through the media?  Is it a case of "I said, you said"?  Has anyone made contact to ask whether the clock can be stopped so that those involved can sit down to solve this problem?  If the issue at stake is not money, I think the problem can be solved.  From what I understand, it is not about money.  That is what I believe on the basis of what I have heard everyone saying.  We are where we are.  We need to resolve the problem.</p></speech>

Can something be done regarding the high-performance team?  Perhaps some other body could take it over.  Can Mr. Mulvey intervene now, even at this late stage, by putting his neck on the line to ensure this is pulled out of the fire?  I ask him to intervene with our boxers, Billy Walsh and whomever else in order to ensure that common sense prevails so that we can go forward to the next Olympics in the best possible position.</p></speech>

I think we might share the same province and the same hinterland as the Chairman of the committee.  I thought I put it as plainly as I could last night.  I also put it in such terms previously when I spoke directly to the IABA about its engagements with Mr. Walsh and my negotiations with him.  The Deputy has asked a direct question.  My view on this matter can largely be summarised by repeating that last night I asked the IABA to contact Billy Walsh to give him the contract and the terms we agreed.  The Deputy is quite right.  That is what the IABA, as the employer, should do.  I am not the employer.  I am responsible for the funding provided by the taxpayer through the Oireachtas.  If the IABA cannot understand what I said last night, we have a real problem.  I think I said it as plainly as I could, as people from our part of the country sometimes do.  The IABA did not hear anything last night that I had not previously said to it across the table.  It allowed this matter to drift.  It said it was in negotiations.  Then the solicitors on both sides got involved.  I know that anyone who has dealt with the IABA in these negotiations, including human resources consultants and legal personnel, have found it to be the most frustrating experience they have ever had.  That mirrors my own experience.</p> <p>  The IABA needs to decide whether it wants Billy Walsh.  It appears that it does not, given that it has brought the matter to this level.  It has allowed this poker game to go to the ultimate point that has been reached by Billy Walsh out of sheer frustration.  The president of the IABA told the Minister of State with responsibility for sport last weekend that this matter would be resolved - that everything was all right and that it would be done.  We found on Monday morning that it was not done.  As I said last night, it is not about the financials because they have all been thrashed out and paid for by the Irish Sports Council on behalf of the taxpayer.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is quite right in that regard.  It is about all the other indignities that have added to this problem.  There were problems in the United Kingdom with regard to high performance.  The UK authorities took boxing out of the high-performance system and put it into a dedicated centre in Sheffield.  We have a dedicated centre for high-performance boxing in the new institute.  That is going to be on the agenda.</p></speech>

I cannot think of anyone more suited to this role than Mr. Mulvey.  I fully support his stewardship of Sport Ireland.  I would like to ask a question about that body.  It is possible that the 2023 Rugby World Cup will potentially be held in Ireland.  Is Sport Ireland going to be involved in that process?</p> <p>  The issue of governance is a core one for an Oireachtas committee because public money is being channelled through the Irish Sports Council to the IABA.  That is a fundamental issue for this committee.  Mr. Mulvey has gone through it.  When one looks at the members of the board of the IABA, one thinks on the face of it that they look like people of calibre.  The board includes legal representatives, businesspeople, solicitors, managers, building contractors and people involved in boxing and other sports.  They should know from their own experiences about their governance responsibilities with respect to public funds and all the rest of it.  Does Mr. Mulvey think it would be appropriate at this time to have representatives of Sports Ireland or the Irish Sports Council, or people nominated by them, sitting on the boards of the national governing bodies to oversee how public money is being spent through the governing bodies and to report back directly to Sports Ireland, the Irish Sports Council or the Oireachtas?  It seems that this is not just an IABA issue - it could well be an issue in respect of all the national governing bodies.  When a dispute like this happens, there seems to be a real disconnect when it comes to accountability for public money.  In this case, the Minister for sport has got involved and has clearly been left deeply frustrated.  Similar examples can be seen globally.  Mr. Mulvey has touched on what has happened in the high-performance units in Britain.  We are aware of what has happened in FIFA.  Do we have any idea of what the IABA's sponsors think about all of this?  If I was sponsoring the IABA, or if someone I knew was sponsoring it, I would not be best pleased about the controversy that has blown up in front of that organisation.  I ask Mr. Mulvey to comment purely on the governance issue.  Does he have views on how this difficulty could be dealt with in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015102100002#L01700"><p>I will take the other questioners at this time as well.  I call Senator Mooney.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015102100002#L01800"><p>It is always a pleasure to listen to Mr. Mulvey.  When I made my initial remarks about the 15-page presentation, I should have realised that, unsurprisingly, he was able to parse it effectively and well.  I have read it all, by the way.  It is an excellent document.</p><p>It is a blueprint for going forward.</p><p> I do not wish to further exhaust the well on the issue of the IABA.  However, Mr. Mulvey has made his position perfectly clear.  The committee agreed to my earlier proposal that it would invite both the Irish Sports Council and the IABA to come before it.  I am not so sure there is necessity for representatives from the Irish Sports Council to appear.  However, it is still relevant to have the IABA in because I believe it should be called to account, especially in light of the fact that its total funding comes from the taxpayer.  It is accountable - whether it likes it or not - to this Oireachtas, to the Minister, by extension, and to the taxpayer.  Mr. Mulvey has made his position clear.  I agree with the views he has expressed at this meeting as well as his other recent comments on the high-performance unit and the matter of how he will deal with that in its relationship with the IABA.  He is going to have to play hardball on this.  Obviously, he is dealing with Neanderthals, dinosaurs, people who are not living in the real world in terms of sport.</p><p> We are all delighted with the Northern Ireland soccer team&rsquo;s success in the European football championships.  Any sports-loving person will be cheering on Northern Ireland next summer, as well as the Republic, hopefully.  I would not like Mr. Mulvey to take his eye off the ball with the ongoing dialogue, albeit beneath the surface, in respect of an all-island team, however.  I have been involved in this, no more than others, through my membership of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly going back 15 years.  Any time I raised this issue on Northern Ireland radio or television, one would believe I was being accused of treason.  There is this sensitivity, as if one were proposing a takeover.  The Irish rugby team plays in the green jersey and it is an all-island team.  Why should the soccer team not play as one?</p><p> I know Mr. Mulvey has exhausted this but I still believe the single most significant movement that can be made towards unifying the peoples of the two parts of this island would be if we had an all-island soccer team.  The worst reflection of sectarianism is in the sport of soccer.  One need only look at the media reaction to Northern Ireland winning when they went into the two divided communities.  The different reactions in the two communities were as if they were living in two different worlds.  Catholics just do not support the Northern Ireland soccer team because it plays its home games in a cold place.  Windsor Park is a cold place for Catholics and Nationalists.  That is sad.  I know the Northern Ireland soccer federation is doing its best to trying to eliminate that.  I hope, however, that this matter will be kept on the agenda by Mr. Mulvey.  There never is a good time.  The fact the Northern Ireland team qualified on this occasion - hopefully, we will too - is because of the expansion of the European championships to promote smaller countries.  It might not happen with the World Cup, however, and it might be a long time before either part of this island qualifies for another international competition.</p><p> What is Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s view on minority sports?  There are 67 different governing sports bodies.  One need only think of the success we have had in sports which have received limited funding, relative to the big ones such as GAA, rugby and boxing.  There was the excitement created by Annalise Murphy when we were all hoping she would win an Olympic gold medal in sailing in 2012.  I know we are an island nation but sailing is not a sport that springs to mind.  There is the success of the cricketing team and we came fourth in kayaking at the Olympics.  Some years ago, Team GB decided it was going to invest more money in minority sports because it felt, even for a nation much larger than us, there were greater chances of success internationally by promoting some of those sports.  Does Mr. Mulvey share that same view?  Do we tend to look at the marquee sports when we might have more of an opportunity of winning medals internationally in minority sports?  Will he identify those particular sports, encourage them and fund them more?</p><p> I have no difficulty with Northern Ireland athletes being double-funded.  Mr. Mulvey is correct that it is a hugely competitive area and they are poaching our people.  There are people from Northern Ireland who have gone with Team GB and won medals.  If a double-funding mechanism is in place because of the unique nature of this island&rsquo;s make-up, then why not?  Good luck to them because sportspeople need as many financial resources as they can get.  I know it is a disadvantage from a Southern perspective but, in the overall context, I do not see any difficulty.</p><p> I am delighted Mr. Mulvey has been appointed to this particular role, as there could not be a better person for it.  I wish him continued success and look forward to further engagement with him.</p></speech>

I support Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s effort to use every bargaining chip he possesses.</p> <p>  What is Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s vision for increased participation in sports for people with disabilities?  How best can we use existing facilities and human resources networks, for example, organisations such as the GAA, the strongest of all our sporting organisations, to encourage more people with disabilities to participate in sport?  Can we build on the work done by Special Olympics Ireland and other such organisations?</p></speech>

If one does not have governance, the role I am obliged to perform for this committee and the Oireachtas falls.  Most problems start with governance.  If governance is not proper and right, it infects an organisation all the way down.  I am very conscious that it is hard-earned taxpayers&rsquo; money at stake here.  We always have to strike a delicate line between oversight and interference.  This is one of the issues around which the Irish Sports Council in the past may have had some difficulties.  When we see the system of appointment of chief executives, high-performance directors or other staff not done in an appropriate and transparent fashion, it is very hard for us to get involved in the employment relationship, even though we may be funding the outcome.  It is a delicate balance.</p> <p>  Do we put people on the boards of the national governing bodies?  That has not really arisen.  Up to 95% of the national governing bodies operate effectively and have very good boards and chief executives.  They have made monumental changes in the past five years.  We put on courses on governance, its requirements, codes of practice, as well as financial and reporting accountability.  We need to retain that balance.  It is only when we encounter an issue such as that which we addressed this morning that it is highlighted.  I do not want to put that in the context against the 95% of organisations with which we do not have a problem.</p> <p>  We also audit organisations each year.  We will select several organisations for audit.  They do not know it.  We tell them they will be audited in a particular year, in three-year cycles.</p><p>That is how we get through all the national governing bodies of sport, NGBs, and it is done by our independent auditors, who we procure by public advertisement for that purpose.  It is a separate reporting mechanism.  I take the point that sometimes it would be good to have a presence on the board, but we might then run into issues of autonomy, interference and so on.  It is a question of achieving balance and it is problems like these that bring the issue to the fore.</p><p> On the question of the national soccer team, the phrase "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread" comes to mind.  I lived in Northern Ireland for a while and saw the situation there at first hand.  One must always keep in mind that one person's sport is another person's antipathy.  Whereas we have had major achievements in terms of co-operation in rugby, hockey, cricket and other sports-----</p></speech>

I have been in Windsor Park on good nights and on bad nights.  The atmosphere can be challenging at times, let me put it that way.  This is an issue I assume the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and the Irish Football Association, IFA, are working on themselves.  Together with our colleagues in the North, we act as facilitators and are happy to assist in any engagements that take place.  It is an important aspect of what we do.</p> <p>  Senator Mooney also had a question to do with minority sports, which is an issue we do keep on our radar.  We apportion funding sometimes on the basis of participation, sometimes on the basis of competition, sometimes in respect of facilities and sometimes around performance.  There is no doubt that in recent years, new athletes in new sports have come to prominence.  The build-up of cycling, for example, has been enormous; hence the need for the velodrome.  The Senator is correct that Team GB has targeted the two sports of cycling and rowing in particular, and one can see the haul it has taken out of them.  It used to be just Oxford and Cambridge in the boat race, but now there is so much more going on.  We were a great rowing nation in the past.  We all remember the achievements of Se&aacute;n Drea and others.</p></speech>

She was our great hope, having won medals in European and other competitions.  Sometimes it is the case that one is relying on one athlete in a particular sport.  Arthur Lanigan-O'Keeffe is someone who is coming through almost out of the fog.  We are doing our best to bring athletes on within the different sports by funding them and their high-performance directors.  We have a broad church and we take a broad church view.</p></speech>

We meet with representatives of each of the NGBs every year and look at their targets, performance, emerging talent efforts and so on.  We have that engagement going on all the time.  Largely, however, we need the NGBs to come to us and tell us what they are doing.  We can then give them assistance to put a plan together and we will examine that plan.</p> <p>  In the context of disabilities, as referred to by Deputy Griffin, I am very conscious of the work of Special Olympics Ireland.  Indeed, I was very involved in that even before I was on the Irish Sports Council.  We gave Special Olympics Ireland a special grant this year of &euro;0.25 million, in excess of its existing grant funding, to ensure we could have a tremendous presence in Los Angeles.  That was on top of the normal allocation.  To clarify, we provide Special Olympics Ireland with special funding for the annual games and, in addition, special funding for the international games.  One cannot put a price on what has been achieved by that body.</p> <p>  Paralympics Ireland is our most successful sporting body in that we fund more podium finishes in paralympics that we do in athletics.  In fact, the Irish paralympics team has podium finished at Olympic and World Games beyond our expectations.  We take an all-inclusive approach with that body and work closely with it.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the big field sports and the need for inclusivity in terms of access to facilities and so on.  It is an issue I will take on board.  I have not directly approached the NGBs about it but organisations like the Irish Rugby Football Association, FAI and Gaelic Athletic Association certainly are very conscious of it.  One of the ways to facilitate that type of inclusivity is by requiring all capital facilities to have full disability access.</p></speech>

I have speaking notes, which have been circulated to the committee.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to engage with it for what I know is an important issue for it and the public.  I am the managing director of Volkswagen Group Ireland.  I am originally from Denmark and joined Volkswagen Group two years ago, having previously worked in a variety of other industries, including commercial vehicles.  I took up my current role in Ireland in January 2015.<br/><br/>Volkswagen Group Ireland is the Irish importer and distributor of Audi, Seat, Skoda and Volkswagen passenger cars and commercial vehicles.  We directly employ more than 140 direct staff in Ireland and our cars and vans are sold and serviced through a network of 155 dealerships and-or workshops in 75 locations around the country.  These employ approximately 2,500 dedicated staff.<br/><br/>In my capacity as head of the business in Ireland, I would like to express my sincere apologies that our group has let down our customers, our dealers, our staff and the wider public in Ireland.  The findings of irregularities in some diesel vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen Group are unacceptable, all the more so given our long history and the trust placed in us by successive generations of car owners here and internationally.  These are matters that the board of management of Volkswagen AG and here in Ireland take very seriously.  We recognise that we have fallen short of the standards expected of us and the standards that we expect of ourselves.<br/><br/>As a group, we accept that we mishandled these tests and we will fix this at our expense and in a way that minimises any disruption to our customers or other stakeholders.  Beyond that, we recognise that we need to learn lessons from what has happened and to co-operate with regulators and policy-makers in this regard.  <br/><br/>Also as a group, we are undergoing organisational structural change with a new CEO and have started a strategic product redirection - for example, a reorientation of our diesel strategy using only selective catalytic reduction with AdBlue and pushing our electric vehicle architecture.<br/><br/>Like most of the committee members, I first learned about emissions irregularities in the US on 19 September, and potentially in Europe on 22 September, with clarification in the following days.  I will now turn to the specific issues as they relate to Ireland.  On 1 October, I announced preliminary data about the local impact and about Volkswagen Ireland's response.  This was that up to 80,000 vehicles sold by our company may be affected, that a further circa 30,000 imported vehicles may also be affected and that Volkswagen Group Ireland will take responsibility for these also.  As previously indicated, the emissions issues relate to vehicles registered between 2008 and 2015 and containing a type EA 189 engine.  Clarification of affected vehicles has been ongoing and the number today is 115,917.<br/><br/>I have also previously confirmed that the affected cars are technically safe and roadworthy and that there is no impact on handling and-or consumption.  In terms of addressing the problem and engaging with our customers, I can confirm that all owners of affected vehicles are being contacted directly regarding the process to get<br/><br/>their vehicles remedied in the near future.  Individual letters to all owners have been sent this week.  We have also set up a national website where Volkswagen customers can check if their vehicle is affected.  For ease of use, we have correlated the vehicle identification numbers that we normally use as a car company with the vehicle registration numbers that the public is more familiar with.  What that means is that drivers can check if their vehicle is affected by simply entering their car registration on our website <i>www.campaigncheck.ie</i>.  This website has been very well received and has received more than 100,000 searches in its first week in operation, identifying more than 15,000 affected vehicles.  In the second week, we identified more than 25,000 vehicles via the website.  <br/><br/>On 7 October, Volkswagen AG presented its plan and technical solution to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, KBA, for approval.  Its decision was issued to Volkswagen on 15 October and includes, in particular, the following measures.  An ordered recall is taking place.  A timetable and plan of action submitted to the KBA is being implemented.  Today, Volkswagen AG must present the technical solution for fixing the 2.0 litre engine to the authorities.  On 15 November, Volkswagen AG will the present technical solution for fixing to the 1.6 litre engine to the authorities and by the end of November, it will present the technical solution for fixing the 1.2 litre engine to the authorities.  It is important to state that vehicles can continue to be used on the roads without limitation and that the current EA 288, EU6, successor engine generation is not affected by the recall.  <br/><br/>On 24 October, Volkswagen Group Ireland initiated a voluntary suspension of sales of unregistered cars and vans with the affected EA 189 engine.  We are also assessing a wide range of options to ensure ease of implementation for our customers.  These include accommodating times and venues that best suit our customers and ease of process for dealers to cope with the massive capacity needed.  All our customers with these vehicles will be kept informed over the coming weeks and months.  We want to do everything in our power to correct these vehicles and to begin the process of regaining trust.  This company has built an excellent reputation in Ireland over more than 65 years.</p><p>Recent events have caused concern in the public's mind and we are now doing everything we can to rebuild trust with our customers, partners and the general public.</p><p> The remediation process should have no impact on CO2 emissions in the future, as some have speculated, and we will provide technical proofs to corroborate this assurance in the period ahead.  We take full responsibility for our actions and we are working with all relevant authorities in a co-operative way.  I offer the commitment of Volkswagen Group Ireland to work with this committee to understand what happened and how we can move forward.  We have not had the opportunity to review all aspects of this matter as the investigations are just beginning.  My testimony, therefore, and my answers to questions will, by necessity, have to be considered preliminary and based on my best understanding at this time.  Members can rest assured that I and my dedicated team here in Ireland will not stop until this issue is fully resolved.</p></speech>

The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, is the national representative organisation for the motor industry in Ireland.  The organisation has more than 1,100 members, covering all sectors of the motor industry including vehicle and parts importing, sales, repairs and servicing as well as other specialist support businesses from finance to IT providers.</p> <p>  The recovery over recent years has seen employment in the sector increase by almost 10,000 jobs to a current level of 45,000.  The improvement in business this year will see the VRT and VAT collected for the Exchequer from car sales exceed &euro;1 billion for the first time since before the recession.  On the issue at the centre of today&rsquo;s invitation, we are acutely aware of the seriousness of the situation for our sector.  However, we cannot answer on behalf of the individual member concerned or comment on specific issues in so much as they relate only to a specific individual member company.  It is clearly more appropriate that any such questions are addressed to our colleagues from Volkswagen Group Ireland, VWGI.  We are happy to deal with the more general issues and principles from an industry viewpoint.  In this regard there is no evidence that there is a similar NOx issue in relation to any other companies.</p> <p>  We do not manufacture any vehicles in Ireland so we are not directly involved in the type approval of new vehicles at the manufacturing stage or in emissions testing under the EU directive.  These are, however, key issues for us in Ireland as we have such a strong environmental focus as a country.  The motor industry in Ireland has been very strongly supportive of the environmental agenda and we are aware that the future for private car transport needs to be as sustainable as possible.  In Europe, the focus in relation to emissions has been principally on CO2 as fears over climate change and Kyoto targets focused on the need to reduce CO2 from road transport.  Our vehicle registration tax, VRT, and road tax rates are also based on the CO2 emissions figures rather than the NOx emissions which are at issue here.</p> <p>  The issues raised here and the focus on how CO2 and NOx emissions are tested in Europe have strongly centred the debate on the difference between the type approval laboratory tests and actual results in real world driving as experienced by consumers.  The EU and the motor industry at European level have been working for some years to change over to real driving emissions, RDE, testing and the current debate will speed up delivery of that project as it is now a matter of urgency.  This is targeted to begin in September 2017 and these RDE tests will produce figures that will be far closer to what consumers experience when they drive on the roads.  This is a phased project which will implement further stronger emissions targets over a number of years after that.  It is likely that the final detail on these new requirements will be confirmed by the EU before the end of the year.  Consumers will see huge improvements in the real world accuracy of emissions and fuel consumption data over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

All of us have been approached in the past couple of weeks about the initial confusion before Volkswagen came out with its statements.  I received an e-mail from a company which has a fleet of vehicles and it was wondering what arrangements for compensation there were on account of the fact that it had to take the vehicles off the road and the vehicles suffered a reduction in resale value.  It had gone for an environmental ISO to comply with the quality required for transport but this has thrown all that into chaos.  They are saying that this fleet of vehicles has damaged the company's credibility.  Will this loss of value be made up to the company?  Will there be reductions on new vehicles if they have to be replaced?</p> <p>  Mr. Nolan said there was no evidence that other companies are affected by this.  Have other companies said clearly that there is no issue or is it just that there is no evidence for it at the moment?</p></speech>

It is a very new issue and we are focused on finding a technical solution to bring the cars into the condition that is needed.  We expect the technical solution to apply to 50% of engines.  In 52% of the engines in Ireland software is the issue while in the other 48% the issue is potentially both software and some hardware.  The operations should take approximately an hour for software, with extra time for the hardware later on.  Time off the road should be absolutely minimal.  Many customers will come in to service their cars anyway and it will be natural to carry out the update of the engine at that time.  We will make certain that we can accommodate customers and we will be in contact with fleet owners with a view to doing this on their premises.  We will be very flexible and will ensure there is minimal inconvenience as soon as we have the solution.  The solution should not have an impact on CO2 and should not impact mpg or the performance of the car.  There should, therefore, be no difference in residual value.  It is very early days and we are tracking residual values.  We will take full responsibility but we need to base our approach on facts and to make sure that we fix these cars.

There was software coding on the test bench that should not have been there.  That is being investigated.  It is important for us to find out why and how that happened.  We are as interested as anyone else in finding that out and in making certain it does not happen again.  That is part of the investigation, both the external investigation and also an investigation that we have initiated with external lawyers to make certain that no stone is left unturned in finding out how this has happened.  It is important in restoring trust.</p></speech>

It should be as plain as day what happened and why it happened.  Volkswagen had an engine that did not meet the standards and somebody within the organisation decided to manipulate test results through the electronic components.  That has been established.  How Volkswagen manages its business behind the scenes in terms of the reputational damage that has been done to Volkswagen is an issue for Volkswagen.  Get on with it.  Do not expect a clap on the back for initiating all that investigation to improve the shareholder value.</p> <p>  There are a number of injured parties here.  First, there are the people who went out and spent their money on a Volkswagen car, who believed in the brand and are now at a significant loss.  The resale value of the cars is questionable.  Another injured party is the environment, which affects all of us, whether we are Volkswagen owners, Audi owners, or owners of any other car.  We have all been affected by Volkswagen's wilful neglect of standards, which has an impact on the environment.  Let us get real here.  Those are the injured parties.  This is not personal, but on behalf of his organisation, Mr. Himmer should start to figure out how Volkswagen will resolve that issue, as opposed to how it will regain the trust of consumers so that they will continue to buy its brand and continue to look after the people who work in Volkswagen.  That is not where Mr. Himmer should start from.  </p> <p>  There is a further point.  Mr. Himmer said in the course of his comments that he discovered, as the rest of us did, on 19 September 2015 that there was an issue with US emissions.  He went on to say that on 22 September 2015 it became clear that there were issues in Europe, yet he did not suspend sales of the vehicle until 14 October 2015.   There is another injured party.  Those cars were not taken out of circulation.  Mr. Himmer should have contacted those who bought vehicles between the date he became aware of the problem and the date on which he suspended sales to offer them their money back and let them decide what they wanted to do.</p> <p>  Mr. Himmer will not answer the question, but I will ask it again.  Has any thought been put into how Volkswagen intends to address the very significant damage that has been done to the stakeholders, namely, the affected owners and the State, on behalf of its citizens, because of the impact on the environment?  I get the impression that no thought has been put into it.  It is easy for Volkswagen to say it is sorry and that it regrets what has happened.  That is all good, but it is PR spin.  It is straight from a PR textbook - when one is caught, one should put one's hands up and try to mitigate the damage rather than truthfully addressing the core of the problem.  I do not get the impression from anything I have heard from Mr. Himmer or his counterparts in the United States and the UK that, as a corporate body, Volkswagen has any interest in addressing the core of this issue.  It is a "cover thy butt" exercise that is going on.  I do not think it is acceptable.  It is a wasted exercise to have the witnesses come in.  </p> <p>  Has Mr. Nolan sought any kind of guarantee or binding statement from suppliers or other manufacturers?  Has he received documentation to say that they have carried out a full review of all their procedures and processes to ensure that nothing like this is happening with any other make of car?</p></speech>

We have already made financial allocations to pay compensation.  That was done in the early days in September after we became aware of it.  We are looking at the impact of it, which is very important to establish injury.  That will also depend on our getting the car back to where it needs to be.  Again, we will work intensively on the test bench to get the car into the condition that it needs to be in.  We will not shy away from responsibility.  We have been in Ireland for 65 years.  We have no intention of running away from our responsibilities.  I hope we will be here for at least another 65 years.

We will not run away while we do that.  Our investigations are ongoing and when we learn more about what and how it happened I am certain that we will have these discussions again.  I reassure the committee that we will live up to our responsibilities.</p> <p>  Some markets suspended sales of vehicles on 13 September 2015 and in the days afterwards.  Many markets did not, and some are still selling.  We looked at it carefully every day.  The cars are still technically safe and roadworthy.  Type approval is in place on the condition that we fix these cars.  It is important to say that we still have type approval but we have to fix the cars.  We suspended sales on 14 September.  To put it into perspective, in Ireland, four cars and 12 vans were delivered unregistered between 1 October and 14 October 2015.</p></speech>

Mr. Himmer told Deputy Dooley that this was a software coding problem.  It seems to me that it was not a mistake, and that it was deliberately rigged in such a way as to give the impression that the emission regulations were being met when they actually were not.  That is how it appears to me.  Was this software developed in-house by Volkswagen or by a software company outside Volkswagen, which may have supplied other car manufacturers with the same kind of system?</p><p>Could this problem affect other car manufacturers in Europe or worldwide?  It seems to me that it borders on something criminal.  If somebody deliberately rigs a system to get around a safety and emissions system, it appears criminal.  We need to know who was responsible for the software coding.  It obviously comes down to some individual or software engineer.  Do we know who that person is and, if so, what action is being taken to deal with that problem?  A family member of mine works full-time in the motor industry.  There are all kinds of implications for the credibility of different companies.  Everybody has held Volkswagen in very high regard for many years and suddenly, out of the blue, we hear of this problem.  People are asking whether this problem is affecting other models of car manufacturers.  I would like to get specific answers to those questions.</p></speech>

The Volkswagen board and the management board of our company have said we will co-operate fully because we want to find out as well the who, why and how.  These are fundamental questions and we have the same interest in finding answers.  Knowing that would enable us to ensure it does not happen again and also how to move forward.  We do not have a name today.  The investigations are ongoing.  They are ongoing with a legal company that is looking internally and also at authorities.  I do not have any insights on how that is going or how much progress has been made or if that investigation will be finished at a certain point but I hope it will come quickly and that we get those answers.  The public needs it, the committee needs it and we need it as well.  My understanding is that it is internal software.  I do not know of others being involved.</p> <p>  I would like to add a little to help understand the complexity of the case.  Three different engines are impacted out of a total of approximately 11 million - three engines of 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2 litres.  There is different software from different suppliers on the three engines.  Each engine is delivered to five different brands.  Each engine has different transmission systems.  The variations are very high.  The complexity is high.  It is not a box that is put on the car on-off switch.  It is something that is in the software that makes it difficult.  Unfortunately, that is why today we do not have the full solution for all of them but it is the solution that is coming engine by engine.</p> <p>  I do not have any comments about the industry.  I have no reason to believe it did it.</p></speech>

The first reaction of most people to this issue has been the scale of the problem, not only here but across the Continent.  The reason this continued from 2009 and was only discovered in 2015 is difficult for anybody to understand.  If the problem is confined to the EA189 engine and there are three different versions of it and if it is down to the electronic monitoring, there is obviously a problem with the engine.  If that is the case, can it be fixed?  Is it a case that no matter what one does, the emissions from that engine will be a problem?  From a technical view, even if one installs electronics, will that solve the problem and will it meet the standards not only here but in other European countries?  Outside of the reputational damage to the company, there are other implications in terms of motor tax in other countries.  There will also be implications for national car test centres as to why this was not detected.  I gather the problem was not detected until the vehicle was in operation.  If the electronics can fool NCT centres, there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I do not know whether that will have legal implications.  In most countries there may be issues in terms of people who paid taxes and so on.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses noticed much of a change in the industry?  Has this issue had a big effect on sales?  Are we seeing a massive drop in sales?  I am curious as to whether this will lead to job losses over a period.  At the moment I can imagine many people are worried about their Volkswagen vehicles, their resale and the effects on the environment.  Mr. Himmer said that approximately 110,000 vehicles are affected - 80,000 in Ireland and 30,000 imports, whether cars or other vehicles.  Euro 6 has stated that, in general, nine out of ten cars exceed the limits.  Is it the witnesses' goal to get the limits down to Euro 6 levels although it does not appear as if that would be possible?</p> <p>  I was a technician by trade before becoming a politician so I understand a good deal about the electronics.  One can put stuff in electronically but so far as I can see, the actual engine is the issue.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on some of those questions. </p></speech>

I will try to take them in order.</p><p>As to whether they will meet standards, they must.  I am certain they will also be rigorously inspected and that the affected vehicles will be obliged to meet those standards.  Today, Volkswagen is presenting to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, which issues the type approval in Europe, our solution for the 2.0 litre engine and over the coming weeks, that authority will look carefully at it.  It is important that it be both validated and approved before we then start to implement this solution in cars.  Making this right should also then mean there should be no impact on CO2, for instance, and then on motor tax in Ireland.</p><p> A concern was expressed about job losses.  From a group perspective, this, of course, has been communicated as a disaster for the Volkswagen group.  There have been announcements that we must cut costs.  We already needed to do that, and this has been intensified.  We are reviewing carefully our investments but from an Irish perspective, I mentioned I have 140 dedicated fantastic colleagues in Dublin and approximately 2,500 colleagues working with the brands at dealerships throughout the country.  From a local market perspective, we must review some of the investments we are doing here but as an importer, they are relatively limited in the motor industry.  I envisage more rather than less work in the future, as 115,000 cars need to be remedied in the next year.  That is a lot of work.  It will be done by us as an importer co-ordinating it, communicating with customers and making it as efficient a management process as we can for everybody.  It will be our colleagues in the dealer network who will do the work and that will involve more work over the coming year.  It will be a lot of work that will entail talking with customers to the effect that their car is getting the right solution, is back on the road and is good.  Consequently, from a local perspective, I foresee very limited risk and actually see the opposite in the short term.  Ultimately, it will depend on Volkswagen fixing this and setting it straight.</p></speech>

Moreover, we in the motor industry in Ireland take on board all the things said about credibility as from our point of view, it is hugely important across the entire industry.  When one looks at the current laboratory-based testing regime, it has been in place since the late 1980s and so is 35 years old.  Cars were very different then and what is fitted to cars now is very different.  The problem is it was set as a consistency test to make sure each manufacturer would do precisely the same thing.  Consequently, while the comparison was good, it did not reflect what actually happened in the real world.  As a result, the fact that when one drives the car it has different emissions than in that test is just a factor of the type of test it is.  We cannot wait for it to move to real driving emissions because we are buyers of the technology in Ireland.  As we do not make them, we can choose the very best.  From our point of view, such a test will involve a portable laboratory, if one likes, towed behind a vehicle to actually measure it as it is driving along.  The reason it will take time - that is, until 2017 to deliver it - is to make sure the test cycle is identical for each manufacturer for each vehicle to make sure they are completely consistent.  However, when one considers the national car test, NCT, the problem is we do not currently test for NOx emissions at these periodic tests.  It is not part of the European requirement but this current debate might well change that.</p></speech>

Consequently, provided the cars are within this measure - that is why this debate at European level is about the approval document and making sure the vehicles actually match what was carried in the approval - it should have no implications for people.</p></speech>

He is answering questions because of something that someone in an office or laboratory far away decided to do.  I acknowledge his role here today is very much as the messenger and I certainly do not wish to shoot the messenger but there are questions I must ask.  One in particular concerns the removal of software or hardware.  What impact will this have on every aspect of the performance of the vehicles affected?  Can Mr. Himmer provide information in this regard?  In addition, I refer to an important point for Volkswagen customers.  While it may be a worldwide phenomenon, I have found Irish people in particular to be loyal to their make of car.  If they get a good one, many people will try to stick with the car brand that has served them well.  In particular, I have found this to be the case in respect of Volkswagen drivers.  I know many such drivers who are on their tenth or 15th Volkswagen and these are the people for whom I really feel sorry.  They feel let down and unsure.  Many people who buy Volkswagen cars do so because they know they will get a good price for it when selling it on, all going well.  Many of my constituents have asked me what impact this will have on resale value and Mr. Himmer must try to elaborate on this point.  </p> <p>  My final question pertains to something that is paramount for anybody who is purchasing a car.  This might sound like a stupid question but is there a safety implication arising from the removal of the aforementioned pieces of hardware and software?  Is there a safety implication arising from any stage of the scandal about which drivers of Volkswagen cars or the other cars affected must be concerned?</p></speech>

I recognised that as soon as I came here.  As to exactly what will change, it is only what we are presenting at the moment but we undoubtedly are doing everything in order that there will be no change in respect of CO2 emissions, fuel consumption or performance.  Were there to be, then we would be obliged to address it but there should not be.  Consequently, I will not speculate and reiterate everything is being done to make certain it is meeting all the standards.  When it meets all the standards, there also should be no difference in the residual value.  We are monitoring this carefully not just in Ireland but even more so in other markets where we have a higher volume and better data points and we see very little impact.  If one looks back on the history of recalls of our vehicles or those of others as an industry, while there might be minor beeps, they often settle very quickly as well.  It really is about how we manage the next months and how we address the uncertainty that exists at present as we have the solutions.  It will depend on that.  On safety, there is no safety issue.  We still have the type approval in place and the cars are safe to drive.  They are roadworthy, there is no issue.</p></speech>

When the devices were removed, some of the emissions were measured at more than 40 times the standard in the United States.  In respect of safety, particularly in built-up areas, has Volkswagen, either internationally or here in Ireland, initiated research into the possible impacts on general public health and on the drivers of the vehicles themselves?  Mr. Himmer might picture the scenario in which one is sitting in traffic for 30 minutes or an hour in a vehicle emitting 40 times the standard amounts.  Has there been initiation of research on that front?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-21a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lars Himmer" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015102100002#S01000"><p>I might start by noting the Deputy mentioned the United States, where the regulations and the manner in which the tests are run are very different from the position in the European Union.  If one considers NOx, which is the matter at hand here, the level for the current Euro 6 regulation in Europe is 80 milligrams per kilometre, whereas in the United States, it is 31 milligrams per kilometre only.  Consequently, it is 2.5 times stricter in the United States.  In addition, the software is effective in the test and what has been addressed at this meeting through The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, is that the way we run the test today in Europe, through the new European driving cycle, NEDC, is increasingly different from what happens in real life.  What needs to be done in the plan for 2017 is really to bring in real-life driving and real-life testing, which could answer some of the Deputy's questions, in order that there would not be this difference.</p><p>One of the figures I read is that the additional emissions as a result of the scandal equate to the entire carbon output of the UK for one year.  The figures are not small, and the general impact needs to be at the forefront in terms of research and atoning for this.</p></speech>

Does this mean that the emissions from a car built now are the same as those from a car that was built in 2008, because this did not work, or are they greater now?  Is it true that Volkswagen has now stopped selling all of its vehicles, including Transporter vans, Caddies and so on, in Ireland?  Is there a plan for dealers who live on the turnover from selling such vehicles?  Their income will decrease massively. </p> <p>  As with many other vehicles down through the years, modification is an issue.  Software and hardware were mentioned.  What hardware does Volkswagen use?  Are liners or pistons changed?  Are intercepter boxes installed, or has the problem been solved?  The problem does not affect the ability to drive a car or its day-to-day running.  Rather, we are focused on emissions.</p> <p>  I note with interest that when cars go for the NCT they are revved up to check emissions - they get a fairly good revving in Ireland.  How were cars able to beat the machine?  Reference was made to NOx and other emissions.  I am open to correction, but I understood the presentation stated that when driving on the road the emissions were greater than when a car was standing or being revved.  Was there a block box or hardware stopping emissions from being detected when cars were standing?</p></speech>

A very minor amount are standing still.  Some 115,917 vehicles are affected, including the ones standing still, and a service campaign is required.  That will be done and we have the timeframe for it, which is approved with the type approval authority.  We have to go up to that and, with that commitment, also acknowledge that the cars are fit to drive.</p> <p>  We are in very close communication with our dealers, which has been the case for many years.  We are in even closer contact now to see how the situation is developing because it is having an impact on them.  We also need to work very closely together to make certain that we can handle a campaign involving 115,000 cars next year.  It is a very large number.  As soon as we know what the full solution will be, such as whether one or two hours of software updates are required, we will inform dealers.  Of the hardware in question, the main issue is the injector.  We will then know exactly what capacity is needed, and we are working that out with dealers.</p></speech>

How were the cars able to con NCT machines in Ireland when they were revved to check the emissions?  The problem appears to have started in 2009, and once a car is two or three years old, it has to be tested.  Emissions testing for cars involves the use of spec sheets to test standards.  How were cars able to fool the emissions machines here?</p></speech>

The NCT does not check for NOx.  It is not part of the European testing requirement.  It tests for CO2, soot and other things.  These discussions may change that.</p> <p>  I do not want to downplay NOx emissions and the health issues attached to them.  As an industry, we need to find solutions.  Research in Europe would suggest that NOx output from the car fleet has reduced by 40% or 50% over a period of about ten or 15 years, at a time when the number of cars has increased by the same number.  The situation has improved.  In Ireland there have been no issues because we are quite an empty country, other than, I understand, once during 2009 when EPA research showed we came close to having NOx issues.  It only affected small areas.  I am not downplaying the issue, but because we are a large open country it is not as much of an issue.  In 2009 we were at the lowest point of the recession, and the problem had more to do with a lack of maintenance on vehicles, which has an impact, as well as weather conditions.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  I have to declare an interest - I drive an Audi diesel car.  Would the witnesses not agree that the confidence of the consumer base has been shaken as a result of this?</p> <p>  Over the past decade, the issue of carbon emissions was centre stage and the public perception was that the motor industry in general was resisting improving and reducing carbon emissions, particularly when EU legislation was proposed.  At the same time, the motor industry and Volkswagen promoted the view that it was attempting to make diesel more acceptable.  As we all know, diesel is a dirty fuel, but it made diesel more acceptable and improved it performance-wise.  It has certainly improved since the first diesel vehicle I purchased.  At the same time, it claimed that carbon emissions were being reduced.  At that time, Volkswagen had a technician or group of technicians beavering away in Wolfsburg trying to defy the emissions issue.  Quite frankly, Volkswagen should be ashamed of itself for doing that.  Will heads roll?  The witnesses addressed the question of the ongoing investigation earlier.  How long does it take to investigate something in a company as large as Volkswagen?  Who was responsible for this?  Was it one individual or a research team operating within the structure?  I am not familiar with the company's structure, but was it a team?</p><p>I presume that it was as I doubt that this was just one software engineer unless he or she had a eureka moment and found a way to get around the emissions regulations.  Someone somewhere along the chain had to approve this.  As such, the entire company is under question, not just those people.</p><p> I suggest that the sooner Volkswagen gets this out into the open, the better for the company.  It seems strange that it is taking so long for Volkswagen to identify the culprit or culprits and determine how it happened.  It was very clever.  The software was so sophisticated that it did not activate until it sensed that the car was being tested while, under normal driving conditions, it made no difference.</p><p> What Volkswagen has done is disgraceful.  Will this have an adverse financial effect on the company?  Is it possible that Volkswagen could go under?  Although Volkswagen has presented &euro;6.5 billion to address the problem, every day there are indications that it is much larger than was recognised on day one.  Are there discussions within the company of a loss?  Mr. Himmer indicated that there had not been much of a loss in sales, but public confidence has been shattered.</p><p> To Mr. Himmer's colleagues from SIMI, should I now be changing from diesel and considering petrol?  We do not seem to be able to trust the motor industry to make the improvements it has been claiming.  Sentiment seems to be against diesel now because it is a dirty fuel.  Is this having an impact?  What is SIMI's views on consumer resistance developing towards diesel?  I am beginning to revise my opinion on whether to switch even though I have been driving diesel cars for 15 years.  I used to drive liquefied petroleum gas cars.</p><p> Will Volkswagen grasp the important issue of carbon emissions?  Given its sophisticated structures and the expertise it has at its disposal, can we hope to expect news from Volkswagen that not only has it addressed this problem but also that it has further eliminated carbon emissions from its cars?  Is this part of the company's mission statement?  I am not trying to be hostile.  I am only trying to reflect a consumer view.  This is the opportunity to do that.  I like Audi cars and am on my third, but Volkswagen has undermined public confidence.  The people involved must be identified publicly, fired and maybe subjected to criminal charges, although that last is not an issue for Mr. Himmer or me.  I urge Volkswagen to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and not to prevaricate.</p></speech>

This is a global deception and many people have been affected for different reasons.  Many were customers of the Volkswagen group given the lower emission levels advertised for its vehicles and that environmental issues were an important consideration when purchasing.  Ireland has a taxation regime that is based on low emissions.  It has been compromised.  I am a customer of the group.  My car is not affected because it is an older vehicle and I pay a higher rate of tax on it based on its stated emissions, as many do.  However, there are those who pay less and the State gets a smaller tax take because of the group's declared emissions.  Have the implications of this been addressed and quantified by the group in partnership with the State or another agency?  Has work begun on determining how the emission figures will impact on the Exchequer, the customer and the group?  What other EU countries have similar emissions-based taxation systems?  Has that issue been quantified?  I hope Mr. Himmer will tell us that work has begun as there is a great deal more to be done as regards the emissions figures that this State must regularly audit and present to the Commission.  This will have major implications for the State.</p> <p>  There will also be issues for the markets and business confidence in this and most countries where the group operates as well as for the group's companies and their staff, both those who are directly employed by those companies and those who are indirectly employed throughout the country and whose business depends on sales that are based on the group's supposedly genuine information.  Has Volkswagen conducted a study of this impact?  The implications arise from a deception that was meant to gain a competitive edge over other manufacturers.  That stance is unjustifiable.</p></speech>

We all ask that question - consumers, the public and employees - and look for those answers.  I hope that they come quickly, but I do not have a date for them.  It is also important that we not jump to conclusions.  We want to find the right people and understand the reasons.</p> <p>  Taxation in Ireland and many other European countries has been focused on carbon dioxide whereas the software in the engines addressed nitrogen oxide, NOx, which is not related to taxation.  Distinguishing between the two is important.  We are committed to lowering CO2 emissions further.  Diesel is more efficient than petrol, which pays when one has a higher mileage.  Our new management team and CEO have stated that we will only develop diesel engines with selective catalytic reduction, SCR, and AdBlue, which is cleaner.  We will also focus more aggressively on our electrical vehicles.</p> <p>  Wolfsburg, the home of Volkswagen, is a special place.  Its factory is interesting.  Along the assembly line, different models have the same platform.  One can see a Golf that comes as a petrol, the next Golf along the line is a diesel, the next uses compressed natural gas, CNG, the next is a plug-in hybrid and the next is electrical.  We want to push emissions down and we have the different technologies and vehicles to do it.</p> <p>  The software update should have no impact on CO2.  Therefore, there should be no tax implications.</p></speech>

This is a major and ongoing issue.

It is important, when the facts are established, that the issues of compensation, the resale value and fleet owners about which we talked about are met upfront.  There should only be winners in this regard.  That includes customers, dealers and Volkswagen.  I ask Mr. Himmer to inform the committee of developments as soon as possible.</p></speech>
