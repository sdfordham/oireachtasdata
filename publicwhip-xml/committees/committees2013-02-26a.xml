I am not sure whether committee members have read the document, but if not I will read it through.</p><p>  Commonage land is land that is owned collectively or by one person over which land other persons have rights.  That is the fundamental aspect of commonage as opposed to private land.  These rights are exercised in common with all other rights holders.  Common rights include the following, some or all of which may apply on a commonage.  Pasturage<b></b>relates to the right to graze cattle or sheep.  Turbary<b></b>rights relate to the right to cut peat or turf for burning as domestic fuel, and estover<b></b>rights relate to the right to take wood or timber for firewood.  Commonage land legally is the common property of all the shareholders and its use by any other requires the express permission and approval of the shareholders.  One very important point with regard to grazing rights is that the grazing right is only proportionate to the share of the land owned.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for 2012 the total commonage area in the Republic of Ireland is 422,415 hectares, which accounts for 8.5% of the total utilisable land of the State.  The CSO also provides a figure of 440,000 hectares in the same 2012 report.  We are talking about a sizeable amount of land of approximately 500,000 hectares.  The only other country where commonage is of such major importance is our near neighbour, Scotland, where there is 591,901 hectares of commonage, which amounts to 9% of the total utilisable land of that country.  Currently 33% or 360,360 hectares of all commonage grazings in Scotland are unclaimed.  In Ireland huge issues arise around the question of dormant or absent shareholders with some commonages having as much as 80% dormancy.  The figure was extracted from the European forum on nature conservation and pastoralising report from June 2012.</p><p>  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most commonages were subject to serious overgrazing, mostly by sheep.  That was as a direct result of EU agricultural policies operating at the time.  In 2002, alarmed at the scale of the damage being done, a successful case was taken to the European Court of Justice which found that Ireland was in breach of EU nature directives.  In particular the birds directive for permitting the destruction of red grouse habitats.  In fact, the EU Commission at the time threatened to stop all agricultural support payments to Ireland's commonages unless serious corrective action was taken.  The State was obliged to take immediate corrective measures to restore the damage caused by overgrazing and the restrictions were to remain in place until there was a near complete recovery of vegetation cover, flora, fauna and ground structure.  Most of the restrictions were to remain in place until the end of 2013.  As a result there are now around 4,500 commonage framework plans, CFPs, covering around 440,000 hectares.  The figures were provided by the CSO.  The framework commonage management plans have been implemented, monitored and re-monitored over the past ten years and as a result it can be fairly stated that commonages still vary in terms of their grazing conditions, that is, some are overgrazed, some are undergrazed and others have sustainable grazing involving the restoration of heath and heather and calcareous grasses.  All of the above mentioned commonage management plans were carried out to meet the requirements of EC Regulation 1698 (2005) as amended by EU Regulation 65 (2011).  Members are probably aware that an EU regulation is the most direct form of EU law.  As soon as they are passed, regulations have binding legal force throughout every member state of the Union, equal to all national laws.  National governments do not have to take any action to implement the regulations in their national parliaments; they are automatically transposed into national law.</p><p>  In July 2011 the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Simon Coveney, unveiled his plan requiring farmers on commonages to increase stocking rates.  The plan set minimum and maximum numbers of ewe equivalents required to graze each commonage.  It also included a draft agreement requiring each commonage shareholder to state their 2013 stock numbers.  Included in this communication was the usual threat to farmers that failure to comply with the conditions and specifications, as outlined, would have serious impacts on their single farm payments and other payments.  The Minister made it clear at the time that the plan was in support of his concept of what is termed the &quot;active farmer&quot;.<i></i> He further stated his intention to link future payment supports to the concept of the &quot;active farmer&quot; - an as yet undefined entity.</p><p>  The United Farmers Association has the most serious concerns as to whose benefit the changes in stocking rates are meant to support.  There is a deep suspicion that this is an underhand attempt to deprive thousands of west of Ireland farmers of their farm supports.  In the west, commonage represents 19% of the total farmland area.  At present there are 4,500 commonage framework plans covering the 440, 000 hectares of every individual commonage.  The commonage framework plans being implemented at present were drawn up after careful study and physical examination of all commonages by geologists, agronomists and agricultural professionals and were only completed in 2005.  With the full-scale implementation of the CFPs a new agricultural scheme was introduced - the National Parks and Wildlife Service farm plan scheme for designated areas and commonage.<b></b> Under this plan farmers were compensated for the quite severe destocking, in some cases by as much as 30%, which had to be carried out.  Farmers in the REP scheme on commonages got an additional &euro;7 million a year and those farmers on commonage not in the REP scheme received an additional &euro;5 million from D&uacute;chas.</p><p>  The whole situation is now in a state of confusion and uncertainty.  The new plan from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service now sets new stocking rates for each and every individual commonage, many of which stocking rates make no sense or logic.  Contiguous commonages side by side will have very different stocking rates.  Who agreed the stocking rates?  Agreement on the stocking rates will have to have as a condition of the new scheme the full consent and agreement of all the rights owners on each individual commonage.  However, in some cases there is an 80% absentee rate of rights owners.  In addition, we have a property regime which invariably implies and encourages rivalry and non-excludability, and in many cases outright hostility on how that is to be achieved.  We do not know what professional assistance, if any, will be provided.  In the event that universal agreement cannot be reached between all the rights owners the present stock owners on commonages must undertake to provide the total stock numbers designated for the commonage.  Therefore, if a commonage has 32 rights owners and at present only two stock owners farm their individual shares, unless there is total agreement those two stock-owning farming rights owners will be forced to provide all the stock to cover the requirements of the other 30.  The stock must be of four specified breeds of sheep or cattle.  One could ask whether there is sufficient stock for the purpose.  Facilitating agreement even if it is possible to trace all the rights owners can take a considerable amount of time and effort.  Experience in England has shown that this process took a minimum of one to two years.  A more realistic timeframe to bring about such revolutionary changes on Irish commonages in terms of management structures, stocking and changes in stock types and breeds is probably five to ten years.</p></speech>

We had a very interesting discussion with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this subject last week.</p><p>  Mr. Wall has listed many things that must not be done.  I agree with him.  I think all members of the committee would agree that if a farmer has destocked and has to restock the only way to do that is to breed the sheep back on the hill over time.  Allowing that 0.7 of a lamb survives for every ewe and that 50% of surviving lambs will be male and 50% female, one can see that increasing stock will be slow over time.  In some years, the replacement rate will be even slower than that.  Whatever restocking has to be done must take account of those calculations.  We cannot suddenly go to a minimum stocking number that is far above what is on the hill.</p><p>  The issue of agreement on the hills fascinates me.  There was some tacit agreement on many hills and very little on some others.  In the past, farmers figured things out.  There were not so many fighting neighbours as might have been thought.  When people are forced to do something at risk of a serious penalty, even if only one in ten commonage users gets into trouble that amounts to a large number of people.  All it takes is for one very awkward person in an odd commonage here and there to put us into a really difficult situation.  In the commonages I am used to, one could have up to 150 or 200 people.  </p><p>  We also have the issue of three types of user or owner.  There is the owner with the sheep or cattle on the commonage.  Then there is the owner who does not put sheep or cattle on the commonage but puts them on his area based payment and claims on them, with the risk that he will not get a payment if the new regime comes in.  Finally, there is the owner who has never put anything on the commonage and has not claimed.  There is a big number of those.  It is a pity we cannot bring those into operation.  If we could, the amount of land that would suddenly appear for area based payments in the west of Ireland, in upland areas and in the hills of Wicklow and Tipperary would suddenly increase.  It is regrettable to see land not being used in any way.  </p><p>  The legal situation of people who own these shares, even if they are in the names of grandparents or great grandparents, is a difficulty.  Has the UFA an answer to the problem or dormant shares?  If someone gets commonage into his name he will have a right to put sheep on the hill.  In many cases, such people have no right to single payment.  I am wondering how we do this.</p><p>  Is the UFA party to the discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  If so, Mr. Wall and Mr. Guerin might let us know how they got on with the Department, compared to this committee.  We had a constructive meeting last year with the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I was much more assured after that meeting than I had been beforehand.  Has the UFA been in discussion with the Department and have some of the issues that were of concern moved on or where are we now?  </p><p>  There is no need to do this in a hurry.  The framework plans are still in place so there is no danger of Europe coming after us.  Whatever follows the framework needs to be worked out. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022600006#G00200"><p>I thank Mr. Wall and Mr. Guerin for the presentation, which was well laid out, particularly the legal position on commonages and so forth.  That is helpful for all of us who make decisions.  Everything on a commonage is dependent on a commonsense approach because, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, one person can cause havoc as a shareholder on a commonage.  The west is probably the area most affected, given 19% of the land there is in commonage and that creates problem.</p><p>  In July 2011, the Minister made it clear that his plan was in support of the concept of active farmers.  It is difficult to get a definition of an "active farmer".  What is the UFA's definition?  Some people believe it is a full-time farmer whose entire income comes from the land while others believe it applies to those who have an income from the land and who through no fault of their own have had to take up off-farm employment and so forth.  The definition, however, varies from person to person.</p><p>  Mr. Wall made an excellent point about the collective agreement concept potentially leading to conflict between different classes of stakeholders.  There are dormant and semi-active stakeholders and active stakeholders who are focused on maximising their return from the commonage.  I take it there is no way of resolving this legally such that the dormant stakeholder would have to relinquish his or her claim or sell his or her rights.</p></speech>

It takes between five and ten years for a new breed to integrate and become accustomed to the area.  Sheep know their area and they go back there all the time. They develop an immunity to diseases that may prevail there.  I thank the UFA for the presentation, which was informative and helpful.</p></speech>

The committee has had a number of hearings and there has been a great deal of consultation.  There are many problems, particularly in the context of destocking with the wheel having gone full circle since 1997 when we were asked to take our sheep off the hills first.  Many farmers purchased green land, put up sheep sheds and so on.  As everybody has said, it takes a number of years to get the sheep used to being back on the hills.  We witnessed something similar on the Cooley Peninsula following the foot and mouth disease outbreak.  Farmers had this problem.  They had to take their sheep off the hills and they found it difficult to get the sheep to breed when they put them back.  Those of us who are used to working with sheep on commonages know it takes a number of years to build up the flock on the hills.  There is a problem with dormant shareholders or older farmers who cannot farm anymore but do not want to sell their share.  Legally, even if they want to sell the share, they cannot do so because it is attached to the holding in the lowlands.</p><p>  We have to have collective agreement and we need all the shareholders to sit around the table.  That could be aided by a departmental of Teagasc official or a REPS planner to guide them in the right way because there will be difficulties among the farmers.  We have to get them around the table and then they can decide what they want to do in the future.  For example, they could permit a neighbour or a younger farmer to graze their share.  That would be the sensible approach to this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022600006#G00800"><p>I thank the gentlemen for their presentation.  Great thought went into it.  Mr. Wall outlined the UFA policy objectives.  I take it there is a problem with commonages in some areas that needs to be addressed and Mr. Wall has set out the many challenges facing the Department in addressing them.  He set out the UFA's concerns.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the committee's dealings with departmental officials and the NPWS last week.  Mr. Wall said all development measures and programmes should be implemented in consultation with all stakeholders.  New CAP future funding streams need to be examined in the context of commonages.  Different views were expressed as to how adequately that could be funded.  Where they are set aside, a payment needs to be considered, if that is possible, without having a negative impact.</p><p>  I agree that the collective agreement concept for the future governance of commonages is a potential minefield.  While I am from County Kildare and I am at a remove from the undergrazing issues in the west, not everybody on the commonages in my area gets on and there would be difficulties in trying to reach a collective agreement.  Is there a clear alternative to that?  It would be just as significant a problem to steamroll everyone and tell them what would happen, from the State's point of view, because it would then be accused of pursuing a nanny state, as it would be to give everyone an equal say and not reaching an agreement.  The UFA says this will inevitably lead to conflict but there will be conflict either way.  If one goes in with the big stick, there will probably be conflict.</p><p>  I accept that the concept of holding all farmers responsible collectively for the action or inaction of others is unfair.</p></speech>

Our dealings with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been about CAP reform to date and have been very poor as it did not want to hear our viewpoint.  We have sent it our policy document and will request meetings with it.  Our first priority was CAP reform.</p><p>  The whole question of the absent stakeholders has to be handled very gingerly.  I remember being called to Donegal, Sligo and Kerry on one or two occasions when people wanted to put afforestation on to commonages.  That caused an amount of trouble.  The area where the trees were to be put in place had to be fenced.  The whole concept of putting fencing on a commonage was so alien to some people that it created horrendous problems.  People who thought they owned shares in particular commonages and found that other people had turbary rights then objected.  I foresee all these issues arising again.  There may be a situation where one could rent another person's share but then a family member will object because he or she considers they have turbary rights on it.  There is a huge lore of hidden problems in the management of commonages.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, the key is to take our time and give ourselves a good lead in period.  If we insist on implementing all of those changes it will not be possible.  First, the people whom we expect to increase stock numbers, or do it rapidly, will not have the financial resources to do so; therefore, they will have to be given time and financial assistance.  Perhaps the best method, as far as possible, is to allow the farmers who want to actively farm the commonages to rent the space from other stakeholders in the commonage.  </p><p>  In regard to the collective agreement issue, we all know that where farmers enter into a agreement voluntarily, that is fine.  If, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said, there is an element of being forced into it, farmers are suspicious of legally binding agreements and always have been.  Farm owners and landowners are intrinsically very independent minded people who like to do their own business and mind their own business and mind their own patch.  Therefore, a fundamental change in thinking and mental attitudes will have to be brought about to this concept which is a pretty new one.  People will raise all sorts of problems in regard to the collective agreement issue.  If I keep the proper stocking rate, while another guy with whom we are in agreement does not keep to the stocking rate and we will all be punished, why should I accept that?  All of these issues will have to be addressed at meetings and explained to people.  The matter will have to be taken gingerly.</p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris asked for a definition of what is meant by term "active farmers".  Our definition in United Farmers Association is anybody who is producing from the land, whether it is cereals, animal farming, fodder for other farmers who do not have sufficient land to keep their stock and require a neighbour to provide silage or hay, or vegetables.  That is our definition of an active farmer.  Regardless of whether he is part-time or full-time he is actively producing something from the land.  Every hectare that produces something that is saleable and worthwhile should attract the same level of payment.  Our attitude is that there should be no discrimination between good land, poor land or the product produced on that land.  </p><p>  On the introduction of new breeds, if there is an insistence on a short period - we suggest five to ten years - for getting the stocking rates up to the specified stocking rates and bringing in new breeds, huge problems will unfold.  The committee is aware that commonages are vast open areas.  These sheep have no sense of place or locality and will wander all over the place.  Are we going to fence the commonages, which is against the whole idea?  Will we have to fence the sides of all public roads running through commonages?  In a county such as Donegal let us think of the amount of fencing that would be required there.  The State is reluctant to fence in its own land in the national park and allows its stock to wander all over commonages owned by private individuals.  Therefore, is the State going to fund the huge cost of fencing?  It is either that or we slowly introduce the sheep over a period and allow them to become hefted sheep, in other words, accustomed to the area.  These are the problems.  Do I have a solution to the absent stakeholders?  They have to be encouraged to allow people who want to farm to rent or sell their stake to them.  At the end of the day, I do not have a legal answer to those who will do neither.</p></speech>

If we move slowly in that way, much more will be achieved, rather than going in with the heavy stick or regulation.  I have seen situations like that where the older generation has rented their land and the next generation is not that interested.  The children who have full-time jobs and are away from the land will agree to sell it to the neighbour but the older generation would never agree. I suggest we take our time and move slowly.  One has to move slowly in terms of the restocking programme in any case because bringing in sheep that are not accustomed to the hills will require a lead-in period  If we take the lead-in period as regards the animals and the lead-in period as regards the people we will achieve success but this cannot be pushed through in the space of six months.</p></speech>

Precise figures are available there as to the dormancy level and the absentee level.  We do not have those precise figures in Ireland.  If we do that we will have a handle on the size of the problem.  I am sure the numbers vary from commonage to commonage.

It proved to be quite a constructive engagement and it would be well worth reviewing the transcripts of it.  The key underlying fact is that all commonages, and not only uplands commonages, should be in good agricultural environmental condition.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the Burren, where even before it became a description or phrase it was the underlying objective.</p><p>  We learned from the officials last week that each of the 4,500 commonages is individual and has different circumstances with regard to numbers and the dynamic which exists.  Undergrazing seems to be a bigger problem than overgrazing.  Perhaps when the original framework was done it was the other way round, particularly in the west.  I could probably say hand on heart that very little change has occurred in Wicklow one way or the other.  There is a tendency towards undergrazing but there has never been a tendency towards overgrazing.  There is a bit to go on this and the point has been made that we should make haste slowly.  From listening to the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service last week, their focus is on trying to get this right.  If good agricultural environmental conditions are the objective, it is the only way we can achieve them.</p></speech>

As the Chairman stated, joining me here today are Mr. Tom Fadian from Mayo, Mr. Flor McCarthy from Kerry, and Mr. Gerry Gunning from Roscommon.</p><p>  I welcome the committee's interest in this particular issue, particularly as farmers in these areas have been very concerned about proposals to introduce new stocking rate criteria without their agreement.  Discussions on a review of the commonage framework plan have been ongoing for some time, and the IFA has strongly stressed that the requirement for collective agreement on commonages is unworkable and unacceptable.  It was only right that plans to introduce this were put on hold pending the introduction of greater flexibility, as the problems encountered vary from commonage to commonage.</p><p>  In the context of eligibility for land, farmers have been particularly concerned where areas have been reduced following Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine inspections deeming they were not in good environmental agricultural condition.  The destocking of hills ten years ago has led to some areas becoming overgrown.  The time is opportune for the introduction of an upland environmental management scheme which should coincide with the implementation of new stocking rates.</p><p>  Critical to maintaining farming in hill areas is ensuring the maintenance of farm incomes.  Low returns from hill sheep farming mean that direct payments are a critical element of farm income.  Cutbacks in recent budgets, as well as attacks on the income disregards for farm assist, have resulted in farm income pressure in commonage and hill areas.  The Common Agricultural Policy after 2013 must ensure active farmers are supported by recognising the limitations of the land and the value to the environment and the socioeconomic effect of maintaining farming in these areas.  This can be done through a combination of pillar 1 single farm payment and a very strong pillar 2 rural development programme supporting areas of natural constraint and an environmental scheme.</p><p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Gerry Gunning, the executive secretary of the IFA rural development committee, who will make a PowerPoint presentation on the issues and proposals necessary to sustain farming in commonage areas.</p></speech>

We estimate a large proportion of our farmers, approximately 15,000 of them, claim commonage under various EU schemes which covers 6.5%, or approximately 3,500 ha, of the declared area for single farm payment.  This land is in various counties, mainly in the west but also in Wicklow, Waterford, south Tipperary, the Cooley Peninsula and other areas.  The farmers involved have a high dependence on direct payments which are a crucial element of farm income in these areas.  We estimate a high proportion of farmers on commonages are on farm assist and are highly dependent on the social supports which have been in place and are now under threat.  As Mr. Bryan has outlined, destocking has led to undergrazing in certain areas, and departmental inspections have led to areas being reduced.  As a result, farmers have lost out on payments.</p></speech>

I am extremely worried about the way the minimum and maximum levels were arrived at because they are so far away from the appropriate levels for many areas.  Flexibility is the most important factor when attempting to compile stocking levels for land and must play a large role in commonages.  For the past 11 years the commonage lands have been controlled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Any perceived problems have not been created by the farmer concerned because he simply followed the instructions meted out by both Departments in order to accumulate his payments over the 11 year period.  Previous to that experts spent four years examining every commonage across the country which amounted to close to 4,000 plots.  The experts arrived at a figure and told us, as farmers, that if we followed those figures that we would have a pristine environment today.  That has not been the case.  The next rural development programme will span seven years and  farmers should be given flexibility and allowed to farm their lands in the ways that they can manage.  The farmers who farm the land know how best to do so.  Today's figures for the minimum and maximum stocking levels have been set down and are rigid.  No allowance has been made for different farm practices, different land types, what lands can carry, the seasonal usage of land or any of that.  The areas must be flexible and people must be allowed to make decisions.  It must be accepted that farmers know the best way to farm the ground and a rigid system does not help them.</p><p>  There is one matter that is promising.  There have been a number of submissions for an uplands management scheme.  Nearly everybody across the country has made submissions of one kind or another to that effect.  It is not just the farmer, but  everyone in society, who can see that the farmer must be accommodated to live in that environment and to farm it. </p></speech>

As everyone has realised, they were totally unworkable.  We welcome his decision to put in place an independent chairman.  That must happen.  Farmers in such areas are probably farming some of the most beautiful parts of the country.  It would be a pity if anything were to happen to such areas.  The management plan that we will put in place over the next five years will have to be backed up with pillar 2 funds and it will have to be a strong environmental programme.  That is what has kept people farming in peripheral areas &ndash; disadvantaged area payments and environmental payments.  The environmental scheme we have at the moment, the AEOS, is a poor replacement for REPS.  Following the agreement in Brussels, we will have &euro;313 million to put in place a proper environmental scheme.  There is much concern by farmers due to the uncertainty over single payments.  There is talk that their land will not be dealt with on the basis of an acre for an acre.  At the moment they are facing reductions of as much as 50% because of rock and lakes, which are all beautiful landscape features, as deductions are being made for them in the single payment.  We accept the situation currently but we are not willing to take any more reductions.  That is one of the big concerns we have.</p><p>  We need an environmental scheme because in peripheral areas in west Mayo, south Kerry or Donegal, the biggest part of one&rsquo;s income is based on disadvantaged area and environmental scheme payments.  In the context of the latter, I am talking about on-farm schemes.  Farmers are willing to work to the plan if it is manageable but the plan being imposed would mean some farmers would have to reduce stock on hills that were under-grazed and other farmers would have to increase stock drastically.  One must have the co-operation of farmers.  An independent chairman and proper representation from the various areas is the way forward.  We welcome the progress in that regard.  We are willing to co-operate.  Farmers realise all their payments are based on ground having guaranteed eligibility.  That is the strongest thing we want.  What we want from the process is that a person cannot arrive into our farms and decide that the ground is not eligible for payment.  That is the greatest threat any farmer faces.  We do not want farmers to be living in fear.  We want co-operation, which is in everyone&rsquo;s interest.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Coveney, recognised that there was a problem and put the plans aside.</p></speech>

They had a significant advantage over the committee, even though we are a committee of elected representatives, in that from what they have said, they were involved in the negotiations for a year.  We became aware of the plans just before the letter was ready to issue.  At that stage the committee asked the Minister not to issue the letters so that the committee of Senators and Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la would have an opportunity to examine the proposals.  I thank the Chairman for the good work he did in persuading the Minister to hold back until we had an opportunity to examine the issue in detail.</p><p>  Much has been said by the witnesses.  It was mentioned that cattle and sheep are required to graze commonages, but there seems to be a perception in some places that sheep are the only species to be put on a hill.  I regularly get phone calls from a local farmer who reminds me that the Connemara pony is also an important grazer on mountain commonages and mountain land in general in Connemara.  Cattle and sheep are complementary grazers and it is important to remember that both are required.  I was a little taken aback to find out that in the small print of the budget, cattle farmers on mountain land have been cut back &euro;137 per annum in the disadvantaged area payment if they own more than ten hectares.  I wondered whether the IFA was consulted on the cutback.  It took me some time to find out as the Minister kept referring to the fact that he had not cut back payments to hill sheep farmers.  I asked myself why he kept mentioning sheep and when I pursued him on the issue, he eventually admitted that he had cut back payments to cattle farmers on mountains.</p><p>  No allusion has been made to one issue that is crucial in terms of money for farmers.  In my experience of commonages, there are three groups of people involved.  First, one has the people who claim all their land, have sheep or cattle and use the commonage proactively.  Then there are those who claim all their land but do not put animals on the commonage.  Finally, there are those who do not claim any of the commonage land at all.  The solution, as discussed previously, is for active farmers to buy out the third group.</p><p>  For people who claim commonage on their area-based payment but who do not farm it, has the Department given any reassurance that it will not refuse to pay either disadvantaged area payment or single farm payment on the land?  If the Department were to withdraw the payment on the land, it would be totally different from what it does for non-commonage land, which is that as long as it is kept in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, it is up to oneself how one does that.  One can have fields that one never puts cattle into and one still gets paid for it under the area-based payment.</p><p>  If one were to force all farmers who have commonage to farm actively and at the same time put restrictions on commonages as to the amount of cattle or sheep that can be kept, then in the case of 20 farmers with an entitlement to put cattle or sheep on a hill but where only ten do so and the other ten claim for it under area-based payment, if the latter group can only be paid by putting cattle or sheep on the hill, it will mean one will go from ten farmers doing so to 20.  The ten who already had stock on the hill will have to cut their numbers in half because of the limit on the amount of stock allowed.  It will be a zero sum game because the Department will wind up with the same number of cattle and sheep on the hill but most of the flocks will become unviable because they will be much smaller than they were heretofore.  Was the IFA given an absolute assurance that payment will continue under the new CAP on commonages where a person does not necessarily put cattle or sheep on a hill?</p><p>  The point was made that hill farmers have bigger farms but in fact if low payments per hectare are anything to go by, farmers with the lowest payment per hectare also have the smallest farms.  That is the experience in my constituency.  There are some large hill farmers in Connemara but they are few in number.  I can count them on two hands.  The reality is that people with the low payments and who tend to be hill farmers have on average 32 hectares, whereas the people with the highest payments have an average of 44 hectares.  The latter farms are approximately 33% bigger.  On average, low payments and small size go together.  That is because they are commonages.  In many cases one might have 1,000 acres of land but 200 shareholders, which means each shareholder does not have much land.</p><p>  Reference is made in the IFA presentation to Teagasc giving a breakdown of direct payments for hill farmers of &euro;16,468.  I presume a big slice of REPS payment is involved in that.</p></speech>

The guys with the tractors on the lowlands would think it was very hard work.  The answer to the problem is to pay decently for GAEC in the single payment.  I do not believe there will be a significant REP scheme the next time around because with greening in the single payment, it will be very hard to justify it.  I know the way Europe deals with this.</p><p>  Last Thursday morning, the departmental officials explained the update on the Common Agricultural Policy.  I attended the IFA dinner on Thursday evening only to be told that the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> was reporting on a coefficient for hill land, yet the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials did not see fit to tell Oireachtas Members about that proposal, even though they were meant to brief us on the updated CAP position.  As the IFA seems to know about this coefficient, the representatives might let us in on the secret.  It is becoming like the third secret of Fatima for Oireachtas Members.  They might also let us know what this coefficient for hill land is about.  I always thought that, when it came to the single payment, a hectare was a hectare.  There seems to be a rumour, however, that some hectares are worth more than others.  I would be very interested if the IFA could clarify that for us.</p><p>  I apologise for taking so much time but this matter is very important.  The IFA has been involved with this for a year already so its representatives know more about it than we do.  Can they tell us the IFA's definition of an &quot;active farmer&quot;?  Is it the European definition or something else?  I will be blunt about it.  To me, an active farmer is one who farms his land.  What he does in his free time - be it hurling or football - is his, or her, business.</p> <p>Perhaps the representatives from the IFA might clarify for me, once and for all, their definition of "active farmer".  My understanding from Europe is that effectively it is anyone who farms land and who is not a corporation, an airport or something else.  However, something appears to be happening in farming circles to which I am not privy because I keep hearing the phrase, "active farmer", with some great weight behind it, but no one tells me what it is.</p></speech>

Mr. Tom Fadian put it very well when he spoke about the west of Ireland, the interdependency of coastal communities and so forth.  I refer to the huge damage that has been done to the west in particular with the economic decline and so forth.  Many young people who potentially are good farmers have been obliged to leave the country as a consequence of being unable to make a living there.  The witnesses' overview has outlined well the various cuts that have hit the farming community over the past four to five years in particular.  Successive austerity budgets have hit the more vulnerable and weakened sectors within the farming communities.  In this context, one is talking about hill farmers, persons with smallholdings and people who are trying to scrape a living and feed their families from what is not the most desirable land.  However, the biggest disgrace ever in recent budgets, for which no one can ever explain any moral reason, was the cutting of farm assist.  Farm assist payments kept people alive and living on the land.  I cannot understand how any Government could take away from the more vulnerable and the weakest.  As Mr. Flor McCarthy will be aware, some farmers in our home county of Kerry were absolutely dependent on farm assist to try to keep food on the table.  They now find themselves being absolutely crucified by what has happened.</p><p>  The section in the presentation on CAP reform has put the point well that farmers need certainty of funding and of income.  If this activity is to be passed on to another generation of young farmers, there must be an element of certainty to it.  Part of this certainty has come about through dependency on grants and so forth and on schemes that were in place to help people to stay on the land.  In addition, by being able to stay on the land on foot of the existence of the assistance available for them, farmers are producing food for the food chain at a reasonable, subsidised price.  As for the reference to an average family income of &euro;15,441, no one in any other sector would work for that amount.  I acknowledge there are farmers who are making an awful lot of money but the majority of members of the farming community are on a low income.  Their general contribution to society and the communities is of huge importance for this country and for its recovery, which also depends on it.</p><p>  Mr. Gunning mentioned, in the review of the commonage stocking levels, a new upland agri-environmental scheme, a consultative committee and an appeal scheme, which are all interrelated.  Has anything emerged in this regard from the IFA's consultations and negotiations with the Minister?  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct in that the IFA has been involved in negotiations for 12 months and members have been kept in the dark about much of it except what they glean from occasional briefings from the IFA, which is what brings them up to date.  It would be nice to learn some progress is being made on the review of the commonage stocking levels.  In this context, members heard a presentation from the United Farmers Association earlier at which its representatives also laid out matters in great detail.  Although there are obviously differences, there was considerable commonality between the two presentations.</p><p>  In respect of commonages, there are dormant commonage stakeholders, some of whom simply are not taking up their entitlements or rights to use the commonage.  However, I believe that many of them have died off and there is no actual connection to the commonage in question.  Do the witnesses have figures to hand in this regard?  Is a proactive approach being taken by the farming associations to identify dormant stakeholders who no longer exist, for want of a better expression?  Were that the case and were such shares to be redistributed within the commonage, it would increase the intake for the commonage stakeholders who are working the commonage rather than having it lie dormant.  As something needs to be done in a proactive fashion, has the IFA discussed this with the Government?  Someone made a point that competent farmers know best how to look after the commonages and so forth.  While I thoroughly agree with that point, there are people who are not competent farmers about whom I would have a different view.  That said, practically all farmers of my acquaintance are competent and capable people who have the best interest in protecting the environment in which they work and do a very good job in that regard.</p><p>  As for the past ten years in respect of grazing and overgrazing, a situation now is being reached in many areas where there is under-grazing.  The question then arises as to how one restores hills that have been under-grazed for a considerable length of time.  At a meeting last week, members heard mention of a burn-off and only yesterday, I looked back at Kerry Head and Brandon to see the whole place was on fire.  While I am quite sure it was not planned, it was happening anyway.  A planned approach is needed in this regard and an extension of the season for this is required.  One could have the same regime as obtains in the North and could have it extend from September up to mid-April or the beginning of May.  That makes sense as how could one burn off anything from last October right through until the beginning of February this year?  One could burn nothing off because the ground was saturated.  Is the IFA having success in its talks and negotiations with the relevant authorities regarding this issue?  I again thank the witnesses for the presentation and will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I will be quite brief and note I agree with the two previous speakers in respect of most of their comments.  Last week, representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department appeared before the joint committee.  They mentioned the 4,500 individual commonages, how an individual plan was required for each one and how one could have two adjacent commonages, one of which was overgrazed and the other under-grazed and that there would be a need for different stocking levels on them.  I have three short questions in this regard.  How do the witnesses envisage the issue of the stocking of dormant shares being dealt with?  What would be a workable plan in that regard?  Would active farmers on those commonages be obliged to stock up or stock down to ensure the entire commonage was properly grazed, depending on whether it was overgrazed or under-grazed?  Would an appeals process be of any use?  Would it work or would it simply be another level of bureaucracy within the system?  Finally, in respect of the upland agri-environmental scheme and the IFA's discussions with the Department, is there a commitment to such a scheme?  Has the Department agreed to take up the matter with Europe and what progress, if any, has been made in this regard?</p></speech>

It was good to hear from them.  Since this matter appeared in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> last November, there has been much talk and much fear among farmers that something would be imposed on them.  Consequently, I welcome the opening of dialogue and that farmers will get an opportunity to get around the table.  If I go back to my time with the IFA, the wheel has gone full circle on commonage appeals since the overgrazing and destocking of 1997 and 1998.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had no choice but to miss part of the meeting.  It was not done out of disrespect to our distinguished colleagues.</p><p>  The debate on commonage is ongoing in the committee.  I was particularly impressed with Andy Bleasdale from the National Parks and Wildlife Service who seemed to have a grasp of the problems.  He also seemed very keen to ensure that no coercive measures would be introduced and that it would be very much a consultative and co-operative process between the Department and the farmers.  As a townie looking out over the mountains around Drumshanbo and Sliabh an Iarainn, I would have thought overgrazing was the main problem, but what came across in his presentation was that under-grazing is as big a problem, if not bigger.</p><p>  I am curious about the IFA&rsquo;s position on addressing the issue.  As Senator Comiskey said, a variety of shrub has developed due to under-grazing and a problem is emerging across the country, in particular in upland areas.  What policies does the IFA have in that regard?  What proposals does it believe should be introduced to address the issue, especially given that farmers &ndash; as all members have pointed out - are operating on limited incomes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022600013#O00300"><p>I welcome the IFA members.  I apologise for being late but I had another committee meeting to attend.  I am not a member of the committee but I am a guest.</p><p>  I brought a delegation from Connemara and Galway IFA to meet the Minister before Christmas to explore some of the issues.  Mr. Fadian was present and is aware of the Minister&rsquo;s view at the time in terms of stopping the request by the National Parks and Wildlife Service for letters to issue, which caused much concern before Christmas.  The minimum and maximum figures published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> would also have caused much unrest, in particular the issues relating to neglected responsibility.</p><p>  We had a good discussion last week with the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the issue.  I asked a number of questions at the time.  I put the view to the witnesses at that meeting that if a commonage is in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, for example, like south Connemara, that the Department should not need to deal with individual farmers on the basis that someone is doing something right.  Those who are grazing are doing it right and those who are not grazing are also correct.  Therefore, if the commonage is in good GAEC there is no need to get involved.  There is a need to get involved in other commonages that are not in GAEC for a variety of reasons such as overgrazing or under-grazing.</p><p>  I put the figures in a simple way to the Minister at the previous meeting.  If one has ten shares in a commonage of which three are dormant, four inactive &ndash; where individuals do not graze sheep - and three active, and the overall commonage is allowed 300 sheep and the three farmers have 100 sheep each, therefore the commonage is being grazed to its maximum potential by three individuals.  Surely that would mean the Department would not need to examine the situation of the farmers who are inactive.  The Department pointed out that the Commission will query whether it is right to pay farmers who are not grazing the commonage.  I am not sure whether in such cases farmers with cattle are considered active or inactive.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v inquired about the definition of &ldquo;active&rdquo; and &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; in that regard.  I consider an active farmer to be one farming his or her land to its potential.  One could not have the same stocking rate across the country because land quality differs.</p><p>  I do not expect anything to be sorted out on commonages this year but it is becoming increasingly obvious that farms are being under-grazed.  There are more farmers now aged over 80 than under 30.  If one has a group of elderly farmers, few if any of them are grazing commonages, although there might some on smaller commonages.  In effect, one could have a commonage that is not being grazed at all but where a claim is being made.  What is the advice for those farmers who might be inspected this year who suddenly find that the commonage is not in GAEC because of the low level of grazing?</p><p>  The Minister appeared to be supportive of liaison groups.  What is the view of the witnesses on them?  Do they believe they are workable?  A smaller commonage with fewer shareholders is easier to deal with as one can put all of them around a table - assuming they all get on together - and thrash out a plan for stocking rates.  I accept that a commonage with a larger number of people involved gives rise to particular problems.  I spoke to someone who told me that the commonage of which he is a part has a 100 acre section coming down from the brow of a hill to other land where an individual goes out with a few dogs.  Any time sheep come into the 100 acres, he runs them out of it to make sure for whatever reason that sheep are not allowed into that section of commonage.  That is one of the unfortunate peculiarities one can find on a commonage.</p><p>  In terms of dormant shares, I am not worried about individuals not taking up their shares on a commonage.  People might not know they have shares or in other cases the owners might have died.</p></speech>

I was in the Seanad contributing to the debate on child benefit.</p><p>  My contact with this topic is Connemara.  While I live east of Galway, where there is a very different type of farming from the area to the west, I come in contact with this issue very often.  My assessment is that many rules on destocking and care for the environment have been placed on farmers in the hill areas of Connemara over the years.  How effective are those destocking rules and the requirements farmers must fulfil?  How much income has been lost to producers as a result of those requirements under various directives?</p><p>  There is a view that as a result of all of this, by virtue of their location and the local terrain, the income of these farmers is completely controlled.  As a result there is an over-reliance on direct payments through no fault of their own.  Have there been any discussions with Government about a commitment to co-funding REPS and rural development programmes?  What are the thoughts on this and what feedback has the IFA received on the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Bryan" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022600014#P00300"><p>The retention of properly funded Pillar 2 rural development funding is critical to the future of farming, but co-financing from the Government is essential.  While Ireland is down in Pillars 1 and 2, over the next seven years there is a commitment from the European Commission to pay &euro;313 million, which will require national co-financing to draw down.  I have discussed this with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Naturally, I have no commitment at this stage but in some of the signals given, the Minister mentioned 47% co-financing but we need meaningful Pillar 2 schemes.  Some other Deputies expressed concern but the European Commission has a clear view: Pillar 1 is to promote food production and create employment, while Pillar 2 is to nurture a higher standard.  The commonages meet that higher standard.  The greening requirement across the entire EU will be a level of permanent pasture, ecological setaside and crop rotation but this would be a higher level so there is no conflict whatsoever in paying a substantially higher Pillar 2 payment for higher greening measures.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked about income loss in Connemara.  As Deputy Kyne pointed out, there are different commonages right next to each other.  The requirements in the past did not all make sense.  Some were destocked too much and now the problem is under-grazing.</p><p>  There is a need for new plans but the biggest problem in Irish farming and hill farming is income.  Mr. Gunning supplied the figures to show hill farmers do not retain 100% of their premium.  Sheep farmers all over Ireland do not retain 100% of their income and neither do suckler farmers.  Very few farmers retain the same amount of money as they draw in premiums become of compliance costs and family farm size.</p><p>  Stocking should consist of sheep, cattle and horses, if necessary.  That is not a problem.  Deputy Kyne asked about special breeds and in the last REPS there was a higher payment for them.  We would encourage farmers to stock them but they should be able to meet their stocking rate with a mixture.  I do not care if they are Charolais cross, Lincoln cross or what they are as long as they graze the land.</p><p>  Someone asked about active farmers.  The farmers in the Gallery live on the hills.  They farm sheep and cattle and they farm their share of the commonage.  They do not live in another country and hardly know where the commonage is, but they actively farm it.  Those farmers must be protected and they need a proper environmental scheme.</p><p>  Some commonage is not grazed at all.  The European Commission has the view that land that is not grazed is abandoned and should not be counted in the base area for the country.  That is causing major problems in Spain, where they are talking about up to 20 million hectares that the Commission states are not being farmed and, therefore, should not be counted.  Every Deputy and Senator has said that good agricultural and environmental practice means the land is farmed.  It does not mean the farmer owns the land, be it in Kilkenny, Mayo or Kerry.  It must be farmed actively and there would be more grazing done if it was not for faulty plans in the past.</p><p>  One man and his dog is an example of why collective responsibility is lunacy where one man is being unreasonable.  Should all the other people on that commonage be penalised because he is unreasonable?  I have said before that the IFA absolutely rejects collective responsibility.  If every Oireachtas Member was held responsible for one wrongdoer, they would have a lot of headaches.  Let us be clear: collective responsibility is wrong.  It is not fair and cannot be imposed on farmers.</p><p>  The liaison committees can work and I accept the point made by several Members.  These men know their hills and know what is a good level of stocking.  There must be more liaison.  Individual plans that work must be put in place.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about ten farmers sharing.  If three of them are farming the commonage, under EU rules the three are entitled to payment.</p></speech>

I agree with him that farmers manage the hills.  Mr. McCarthy, who is from the Deputy's region, and Mr. Fadian, who is from County Mayo, know about the management of hills from experience. </p><p>  As Mr. Gunning stated, undergraze burn-off is permitted for six weeks longer in Northern Ireland, which makes a significant difference.  Two weeks ago, one could not burn land because it was too damp and cold. </p></speech>

There are not other groups of farmers outside of commonages who have management plans.  If that were the case, they too could be part of an agri-environment scheme.  The scheme will be part of the next rural development programme, of which 25% of the funding has been allocated for agri-environment schemes.  These schemes are compulsory for member states, although it is not compulsory for farmers to participate in them.</p><p>  The focus today is on a strong agri-environment scheme in the commonage area, one which will run in parallel with the management plans which will hopefully arise out of the discussions.  As Mr. Fadian and Mr. McCarthy stated, we need flexibility and there may be different solutions for different areas.  The Chairman will be more familiar than most with the problems we have experienced with commonages in various areas. </p><p>  On dormant shares, this is where the matter becomes tricky because if land is dormant, one cannot tell who owns it and one will use the dormant share because it is not being used.  The dormant share should become part and parcel of the management plan and discussions should take place at local level to decide how to deal with dormant shares.  The Department has not made a decision on how it will deal with this matter.  When discussions convene the IFA will propose that this option be given serious consideration because doing something with the dormant shares could be the only way to get some of the areas in question back into good agricultural environmental condition.  This view will form part of a discussion, although different solutions may be provided in different areas.  Flexibility on this issue is required for this reason.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a question on farm incomes and he is correct that I used 2011 figures.  Given that farmers were leaving REPS 3 in 2012, the position was undoubtedly worse in 2012. </p></speech>

We did not want to come to this meeting without official figures and for this reason, we have with us the Teagasc national farm survey of 2011.  We will revert to the joint committee on the position in 2012, which will reflect Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's contention that direct payments reduced last year on the basis that farmers lost the REPS payment.  While some of the farmers in question will have re-entered the agri-environment options scheme, this scheme is not the same as REPS.  One must take account of all direct payments.</p><p>  In answering a question on farm size Mr. Bryan noted that one third of those who lost out as a result of the cut introduced in the budget of October 2008 were located in mountain grazing areas.  However, hill farmers make up only one fifth of the farmers in disadvantaged areas, which indicates that more farmers in mountain areas lost out than in other areas. </p></speech>

Just as we did not agree with the Minister on decreasing the disadvantaged area hectarage attracting a payment from 45 to 34, nobody consulted us on the figure of 137.  In case the Deputy was misled by anybody, he should note that under no circumstances were we consulted.  At all stages, we have been very clear that the disadvantaged areas payment is an important one.  The level should have been retained at that of 2008 and the hectarage should not have been reduced to 34 hectares, or 30 this time.

The Austrians' request has been an official one for nearly nine months.  They have already said they are using a coefficient of 25% for the hills.  The Spanish are seeking a coefficient.  The Scottish are opting for a regional model, varying from a payment of &pound;11 per acre on the hills to &pound;100 in the disadvantaged areas, with a maximum of &pound;200.  When the Deputy said he believed all hectares were equal across European Union, he should have noted that the European Commission, in the document it submitted to Ireland in July 2011, proposed eight regions attracting totally different payments.  This is not the fourth secret of Fatima but what has been on the European Union website for a very long period.</p><p>  The Commission document contained many points that surprised us.  The Germans, however, sought no capping but different options.  The French made requests and the British sought the option of transferring money within pillars and that of transferring greening measures, as referred to in the document, from pillar 1 to pillar 2.  This is the last thing we would want.  This fits in with what was spoken about a minute ago.</p><p>  The document is quite long.  The Austrians were the first to suggest a coefficient.

We asked several times for examples for commonages.  The representatives were on two commonages actually and I was on one commonage with them myself.  They did not give us examples.  One cannot make a decision on anything until one has the figures.  The first time we saw the figures was when they appeared in the journal.  We knew the consequences automatically.  On my commonage, the minimum stocking rate is 3.3 ewes per hectare.  The top of Carrauntoohill is covered with snow for three or four months per year.  The rate should be approximately 1.5 ewes per hectare.  There are commonages in Kerry where one can drive a jeep to the top, yet the rate is one ewe per hectare.  One does not need a high level of intelligence to realise the figures are wrong.  We want control over the figures for our own land.  We do not want the Department dictating to us.  However, if we stand idly by, the Department will impose the figures on us.  We have to react and that is what we did.  We met the Minister and hope he will put the independent chairman in place to deal with the matter.  We would love to have control.  That is the ideal scenario.  It would be as it always was.  Unfortunately, it appears from what we are seeing that this will not prevail.</p><p>  As every farmer knows, the single payment, disadvantaged areas payment and environmental payments comprise our income.  We will protect these at all costs.  As a farmer, it is all about protecting my income.  I depend totally on farming and cannot just hang my two hands by my side and let the Department impose rules on me.  I have to drive on and try to obtain some kind of workable solution.  What we are proposing is a plan for seven years over which farmers will have control.  Obviously, we would prefer to be working to our own plan with no outside interference but it appears we cannot draw down a single payment under this model.  We would love to be able to do so.  If the committee can influence the Minister and put pressure on him in the D&aacute;il, we will welcome it.</p><p>  Reference was made to the environmental programmes.  We obviously realise the financial circumstances of the country.  We want a proper environmental scheme because we realise disadvantaged areas schemes and environmental schemes comprise and have comprised an important part of hill farming.  We fully support what the Deputy says in that regard.</p><p>  Let us consider another reality we face in respect of the Minister and the withdrawal of plans.  We met the Department representatives last Friday week and noted they are still talking about proceeding with these plans.  It is a serious worry for us as farmers that this is still in the background.  We must deal with that.  We could bury our heads in the sand and just hope what I describe will not happen.  I would love to believe that approach would be successful but I have a strong feeling it will not be at this stage.</p><p>  Given what is happening in Brussels, there will be increases to the single payment for the lands in question.  The payment will, therefore, become more important and consequently the plans will become more important.  More money will hinge on them and that is the reality for every farmer.</p><p>  I could not agree more with Deputy Ferris on the farm assist scheme cut.  Farmers on the scheme were the only farmers on social welfare benefit that were attacked.  We have lobbied all the Members extensively on this, obviously without success.  As members are aware, none of the budget decisions was reversed.  The Government has a big majority but we have a major problem with the cuts to the scheme.</p><p>  Dormant shares are obviously a problem.  IFA policy is always that everyone should get paid.  We do not lobby for cuts; we lobby for everybody to get paid.  The Department or European Union takes decisions, perhaps not to pay certain individuals.  Our policy always has been and will be that everybody should be paid with his little red tape as possible.  We do not want rules and regulations.  I, as a farmer rather than a representative, want to be able to access my money as easily as possible.  We do not live in our own world and are governed according to schemes designed in Europe.  We are all willing to obey the rules once they are workable but we do not want rules imposed on us without consultation.</p><p>  A Deputy asked about the appeals system.  Of course, we need an appeals system.  If what is imposed on us is totally unworkable, we have to react.  If what was in the journal is imposed, we will say "No" because we have to.  The proposal is totally unworkable, but we are willing to work within a framework to get money.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames referred to stocking rates in Connemara, which have been significantly affected.  I have been in the region myself and have met the farmers.  I noted their concerns.  The only real concern is that they will be able to access their single payment, their money.  This applies to us all, no matter whether we farm in Kerry or Donegal.</p></speech>

Of concern are the farmers farming elsewhere who have stock and meet the minimum stocking rates.  If agreement is reached during the Irish Presidency, the next round of the CAP will commence in 2014, the major changes of which may not be implemented until 2015.  It appears that as part of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions a minium stocking rate will be introduced not only in the hills but everywhere.  Most countries appear to be asking for this. This means a claim from a farmer who has no stock and is not engaged in farming will be determined invalid by the Commission.  The Commission decides terms, which often run to 30 pages.  An applicant must be actively farming.  A farmer who is not engaged in farming, has no stock and takes no active part in farm maintenance gets nothing.  Some countries have drawn up plans for people not involved in farming but taking part in a maintenance scheme, which is slightly different and includes topping a couple of times.  However, some land is incapable of being topped.</p></speech>

The Commission does not state that a farmer must farm every square inch of land, whether that land is in Achill or Kilkenny.  When my land maps were returned to me various pieces of land had been removed because the Commission deemed that land was not being farmed.  Land which is being farmed and kept in good agricultural condition is deemed eligible.  Whether a commonage or not, if the Commission deems land is not being farmed it is taken out.

We are moving to a new scenario <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the single payment, agri-environment and disadvantaged areas being called areas of natural constraint.  There is much discussion to be had around the details of all aspects of this.  We will probably be back before the committee again.  One of the key considerations is funding.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v appeared to be throwing cold water on the rural development side.  It is up to the Government to put in place a strong rural development programme.  We are arguing for a seven year programme because we will get only one go at addressing this issue.  It is important we complement the Pillar 1 payments, which are hugely important everywhere.  We also need a strong Pillar 2 to deal with specific targeted issues.  One of those issues, with which we have dealt today, is commonages.  We would see Pillar 1 as complementing Pillar 2 in this regard.  In many ways, the Pillar 2 environmental schemes will be hugely important in the common areas because farmers previously in the agri-environment and REP schemes are the ones who have lost most in terms of cutbacks.</p></speech>

As pointed out in the example I gave, this does not assist the Department.  If one forces all farmers who declare commonage in their area aid to put sheep on that commonage those already doing so will be required, because of the cap, to reduce the number of cattle or sheep they have on their commonage.  This is of major concern.  Perhaps the delegates would confirm that the IFA proposes to oppose any such approach.</p><p>  We know the figures in relation to the issue raised by Mr. Bryan.  To obtain a disadvantaged area scheme payment a person is required to have 0.15 livestock units per hectare in a mountain area.  If I recall it correctly, it must be a severely disadvantaged area, which is a ludicrous stocking requirement in respect of that area but reasonable in respect of the hills.  We know for certain that while 10,000 applied only 2,000 were refused.  In other words, 80% of the derogations were granted.  I have asked for a breakdown between severely disadvantaged, less favoured and mountain areas.  The figures I received at Christmas indicate that more farmers on severely disadvantaged and less favoured areas than on the mountain areas were refused a derogation, which means we can surmise that fewer than 1,000 farmers on the mountain do not meet minimum stocking requirements.  I have said time and again that we should have a minimum stocking level and that there should be four levels to that minimum stocking level, one each for the mountains, severely disadvantaged and less favoured areas and another for good land.  That should be a requirement for single payment.  This does not pose a problem for farmers in mountain areas because there is very little under-stocking of land in the mountain areas.  The problem is more severe in other parts of the country.  We know that for farmers with 0.15 of livestock on severely disadvantaged land it is an even bigger problem.  The suggestion that there are many farmers in mountain areas declaring a great deal of land but who have no stock does not stand up to examination.  A farmer who did not use the hill had to make up to 0.15 on his low land.  As such, that farmer would have to have had 0.03 or 0.05 or more on the low land to make up for the hill.  </p></speech>

Under-stocking has been identified as a big problem.  They over-egged it in the last plan.  Other issues such as burning and deer and vegetation management need to be addressed.  Common sense must prevail and people should not be suggesting it is not possible to burn after 1 March and so on.  We have to fix the problem and need practical solutions if we are to do so.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the committee is familiar with Mr. William Parnell and Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Carroll from the Department who have done a significant amount of work in putting this together.</p><p>  I need not tell the committee that the economy is undertaking a difficult transition from one that became far too dependent on construction, property and debt, and that we must rebuild one that is focused on innovation, exports and enterprise.  That is a considerable journey.  If one looks back, before we entered Government the average number of jobs lost per year in the private sector was nearly 90,000 and the economy was really devastated by the crisis.  We have made jobs a priority so that not only are we about correcting the bank and fiscal problems, but we have put jobs at centre stage.</p><p>  What we devised, in the Action Plan for Jobs, is a fairly unique instrument in my experience in politics, namely, a policy paper which is an annual process that embraces the whole of Government to work together on the central objective of creating employment.  That has been really positive.  To say a short word about the process, the plan is being monitored by a joint committee of both the Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of my Department, with other representatives of other Departments.  They monitor the delivery, quarter by quarter, as to whether what was committed to is being delivered.  Last year there was 92% delivery.</p><p>  It has changed the collaborative way the public service works across the silos in a way that is really positive for our endeavours to deliver in the employment area.  It has also speeded up what, certainly in my experience, would be inertia in the system in getting initiatives across the line.  It has been a worthwhile tool.  As I stated, we delivered 92% last year.  Some of the measures were not possible, mainly for legislative reasons.</p><p>  This year we are becoming more ambitious in what we are seeking to do.  We have picked out areas where we believe there is a really strong strategic case to identify flagship projects that can make a difference.  We have described them as "disruptive reforms".  They are designed not only to address an area of strategic importance but to do it in a new way, namely, to bring in, as we have been doing already in the action plan for 2012, the various players in the public service but also for the first time to bring in industry partners to help us drive forward these particular areas.  There are seven such areas identified across a range of sectors and they are listed.</p><p>  The first of them - in no particular order - is big data.  This is an area that is exploding in growth because of the explosion of information, both from social media and from the availability of various data sources.  There is a sector growing around analytics of those data designing new business models to exploit the opportunities.  Ireland is well placed for a number of reasons to position itself to be the centre of excellence in a European context.</p><p>  Another area is ICT skills.  I note Senator Clune brought a report to the joint committee previously.  We have identified that as an area where we need to act, not only in the short term where we are committing to 2,000 additional graduates in 2013 but also in the long term to become the country that produces the most graduates in Europe in this area.  The reason this is really important is that it is not only strategic to the ICT sector which is growing rapidly with 4,500 jobs in the past 18 months or so, but also one is seeing increasingly that ICT is transforming other sectors as well.</p></speech>

Over the weekend the Minister and I discussed the action plan for jobs.  There is nothing wrong with it and I welcome the plan's approach.</p><p>  With regard to the Action Plan on Jobs 2012, at the end of the year we had 429,000 people on the live register of which 329,000 people were full-time unemployed.  That will be the measure we use to analyse the action plan.  I know that job creation takes time and that governments do not create jobs.  The live register must be the measure we use to see progress.  The measure of any action plan is where the action is.</p><p>  I shall ask a couple of specific questions on initiatives rather than make general remarks.  The Government is committed, in the programme for Government, to creating 100,000 new jobs by 2016.  The medium-term fiscal outlook was published in November.  It stated that there was only a 1% growth in employment level anticipated by 2015 which means that around 18,000 jobs are anticipated.  Can the Minister explain the difference in numbers?</p><p>  I wish to comment on specific parts of the plan.  The term "disruptive reforms" sounds like a good title.  Can the Minister explain how disruptive reforms will work?  He said that he will identify private sector champions to drive them.  What kind of people has he in mind?  Will there be open competition?  Will back-up be provided?  It is all very well getting somebody with private sector experience.  It will be a challenge to get somebody from the private sector to work through the layers of the public sector, particularly for some of the reforms that he has in mind.  What support will be available to them that will allow them to navigate his or her way through the bureaucracy that he spoke about previously?  </p><p>  I welcome the plan to reform the work permit system.  Will it include the so-called technology visa that was championed by Open Ireland?  Has he more thoughts on the matter?  </p><p>  I welcome the licensing enforcement regime and its reform.  A difficulty for many people in business, particularly in retail, is the number of inspections that are carried out.  An inspector from the HSE, NERA or three or four other inspectors could call by a business.  The Minister has said that he intends to tidy up all of the licences.  Will he tidy up the inspection process?  Will he have a united inspection process?  </p><p>  Can the Minister confirm that the JobsPlus scheme will be operated only by the Department of Social Protection?  In terms of the selection process for the employer, what will be involved for any business that is interested in the scheme?  What do they have to do?  Will it be similar to the employers' incentive scheme that was previously operated by Enterprise Ireland?  Can people on the live register join the scheme?  Will people be chosen from the live register?  Will they be corralled off the register? </p><p>  The Minister said that his Department's typical value will be of the gross national minimum wage cost.  What specific costs of employment will be covered by the grant?</p></speech>

I will try to respond to each of the questions.</p><p>  Clearly our ambition to create 100,000 jobs will require a shift change from the <i>status quo </i>that is being projected on the existing performance of the economy.  That is the reason for this initiative of &quot;disruptive change&quot; to break the patterns and trends, to open up new opportunities.  This is about being ambitious.  Each year we need to be more ambitious and this year we have taken the approach outlined in my opening statement, picking areas in which we believe we can position ourselves strategically to do something that will be decisive in its impact.  I think we are about to change the performance of the economy.  We cannot just accepting the existing performance.</p><p>  We will first bring the industry players into the monitoring group so that they will play an active role in the group but they will be looking very specifically at these areas of expertise, in which we are seeking to deliver significant change, ICT, big data, energy and so on.  The people will be selected to match the opportunities.  We will select people who we think can contribute to the areas that have an input.  They will also have a role of looking to how we deepen the connections and not only monitoring what we are doing in 2013, such as in the new technology centre in big data.  Yesterday we launched the largest ever research centre specialising in big data, data analytics and so on.  We are also driving the pilot schemes in the public service, doing the skill analysis of where we need to be.  Those people will be in a position to not only monitor what we have already committed to but to identify the areas in which challenges will present.  We need to get closer to industry to help develop the appropriate responses.  The ICT initiative in Skillsnet is a good model, in which industry, education and enterprise sectors sat down together and bought into the system.  Industry committed to take people on work experience, to take people to interviews so that the training they got during their conversion courses was embedded within the sector.  That model of partnership was a success in the ICT area and we want to deepen it.</p><p>  Reform of the work permit system will not include a tech visa as envisaged by some people who suggested that anybody with a technical qualification could just come into the country and be granted an open ended visa.  It will be related to companies with vacancies but there will be significant changes in the system.  People who are seeking to recruit in areas of shortage and will be trusted partners can rely on the system to support their recruitment.  We propose to reduce the time one waits for a visa by about one third.  At present one can only recruit an ICT person for the ICT sector, without having to undergo a labour market test.  In future ICT personnel in any sector will not have to go through a labour market test.  A range of simplifications have been spelled out and we will implement them.  This will mean bringing fresh legislation to the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct to state that inspections will follow on from licensing.  They are a more complex challenge.  The concept of a single portal is having a single interface with the business - the people in the back office do what must be done - but it should make things simple for business.</p><p>  The system of inspection gets to the point of whether one can integrate the different inspectorates, so that one has general inspectors who have a range of skill across food, environmental and labour market conditions.  That is a good question.  We have not done the research yet to identify our capacity to do that.  We are looking at shared inspections but the process will take time.  It is a harder ask.</p><p>  JobsPlus will be run by the Department of Social Protection.  All costs will be covered and the employer will get &euro;75 a week off the pay costs.  It will be a cash refund for the employer who takes on an employee for more than 30 hours per week.  The scheme will be made as simple as possible, the full administrative work must be done but there are no conditions such as applied to the PRSI scheme, in which case the employer had to guarantee the job would last for a certain duration.  Under the Revenue Job Assist scheme, an employer would get no relief if the business did not make a profit, and in cases where businesses made a profit, they could not get it until the financial year was over and the employer had made returns to Revenue.  There were many obstacles to these schemes, apart from whether people knew about the schemes.  We have removed those obstacles.  The ambition was that 10,000 people would avail of the PRSI scheme, however even after increasing its attractiveness by 50%, only 1,000 people availed of it.  I think more factors in addition to advertising will have to be changed, for example the terms of reference.</p><p>  I will now deal with lending to SME companies.  The surveys conducted by Red C on lending to SMEs shows an improvement.  Both the demand for credit from SMEs, in particular from the Microfinance Fund is improving.  The refusal rate is falling.  There is some improvement in the area.  Our refusal rates are still high by international standards.  Very few people are triggering the appeal mechanism, either by making an internal appeal to the banks or appealing their case to the Credit Review Office.  If one believes the report of the Credit Review Office, although they are only seeing a very small portion of the loans, many of Mr. Trethowan's decisions are turning over the bank decisions.  There is still concern that bankable projects are not getting through.  We require a better analysis of exactly what is happening with the loans that are turned down; why the SMEs do not appeal the decision, and ways to make the option to appeal the bank's decision an easier option to take.  We are going to look at ways to do that.  It will be the role of the State Bodies group.  It is already in place in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Finance and key players across the sector such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund<b><font color="#222222">,</font></b><font color="#222222"> </font>NPRF and others such as Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  Let us sweat the new instruments we have put into the field and look into greater detail as to what is happening in the banks.  That is the reason we have put our money in the bank and we need to get the money to work better.</p><p>  The terms of reference have not yet been agreed.  We expect to meet the departmental committee before the end of the second quarter.  I have good contact with the retail sector and they have welcomed the licensing reform.  They welcome the online initiative.  We are doing things that seek to support that.</p></speech>

To be honest, what we have created by going cross-government is a new dynamic within the public service.  We want to take that to another level by bringing people from outside the sector with particular knowledge in the areas we have identified to drive change.  Hopefully, their role will evolve.  They will certainly have a significant role in saying where Ireland's competitiveness needs to improve and in what areas we need to reposition ourselves.  That dynamic within the process will be really positive.  We have to open that up.  Employment is a shared challenge and what we have done to date has been looking within the public sector at what changes we can make.  This is moving it to another level.</p></speech>

I notice that the Minister has not got his football team in with him today, so it looks like the Croke Park agreement is perhaps being implemented.</p><p>  I wish to acknowledge a few of the positive points of progress.  Obviously, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have been doing good work on creating jobs.  Irish exports have also been increasing, even though the level of unemployment has not been falling in proportion to those export increases.  Good work has been done on enterprise loans, micro-finances and licences.</p><p>  In many ways, however, there is a lot in this plan that is not new.  Point 59, for example, deals with monitoring lending targets of the two pillar banks.  Point 63 concerns promoting awareness of the understanding of Government-supported funding.  Point 126 refers to establishing an interdepartmental group to consider further possible measures to assist the retail sector.</p><p>  Some of the points in the action plan are airy-fairy, to say the least.  It is important to say, however, that governments do create jobs.  This committee needs to get away from the idea that governments do not create jobs.  The Government is the biggest employer in the country.  The retrofitting incentives, announced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, involve money that has a direct effect on creating jobs.  </p><p>  The key performance indicator that we cannot get away from is the number of jobs that the Minister's action plans create.  There were 3,400 fewer jobs in the economy in the past year, so it is a net decrease.  We often hear about these 12,000 new jobs but there has been a net reduction.  By any means, therefore, it is not a positive outcome in that key performance indicator.</p><p>  The Government makes a big point of saying that it has at least created stabilisation with regard to the unemployment figures.  However, in July 2010, unemployment reached 14.1% and it has plateaued.  That was eight months before the current Government took power, so unemployment has been in a plateau situation well in advance of these action plans and policies.</p><p>  How many of the 12,000 new jobs in the private sector are temporary, part time or full time?  When we focus on the likes of ICT, we must not get befuddled by that sector.  It is an important growth area but it accounts for 4.2% of the working population, which is a very small segment of the economy.  </p><p>  I often get frustrated when buzzwords creep into the lexicon of job creation, such as "cloud computing" and "big data".  They are seen as a panacea for problems, whereas in fact they are tiny opportunities in the whole scheme of things.  All opportunities must be chased vigorously but those are very small ones.</p><p>  Regional disparities are important to this committee.  We have created a jobs plan to focus revenues into areas of greatest need.  Some 2% of the jobs created in the past year covered 49% of the population.  Therefore, half the population of the State saw 2% of actual job increases, which is a phenomenal figure.</p><p>  The original action plan had a commitment that 50% of jobs created would be outside the Dublin and Cork regions, but that is not happening.  I do not think that commitment is being repeated, but the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  Will the Government try to retain that 50% commitment of FDI outside Dublin and Cork?  How will the Minister tackle those regional disparities?  </p><p>  Broadband is a critical issue in this economy, which is behind most of our competitors with regard to the geographical spread involved.  That, in turn, affects the ability of regions to compete for jobs.  </p><p>  A number of points were made about procurement.  In launching this committee's jobs plan, the Chairman focused on social clauses in Government procurement, which Sinn F&eacute;in has already mentioned.  I do not see that in the Minister's action plan, however.  </p><p>  One of Sinn F&eacute;in's initiatives is to actively introduce indigenous small business and FDI, but this is not being done in the State's area of operation.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us why that is not the case.  </p><p>  Upward-only rents, no commitments on rates and no addressing of utility costs can all negatively affect competitiveness.  Last Friday, the Chairman, Deputy English, and I met with the management of Tara Mines who told us that their annual electricity bill of approximately &euro;20 million had increased by &euro;3.2 million this year.  Those utility costs are nailing companies that will then start to focus on wage costs, which obviously has a negative effect.</p><p>  Not enough work is being done to tackle cartels in this State, although I know there is a lot involved in that issue.  In addition, this committee has focused on the youth guarantee, but youth unemployment remains a matter of concern.  Meanwhile, efforts to ameliorate youth unemployment have gained great traction across Europe. </p></speech>

While some of them are outside my remit, the report refers to the need for a national youth strategy in entrepreneurship, and Deputy Lawlor also raised that issue.  It is something the Department is considering.  It will produce a policy paper on entrepreneurship this year and will consider youth entrepreneurship in particular.  Last year, the Department examined female entrepreneurship and initiated a competitive fund for female entrepreneurs, which initially comprised &euro;250,000.  However, it had such success that it has been trebled within the past year.  There are untapped areas in entrepreneurship and youth may well be one of them.  The Department certainly will give consideration to that.</p><p>  As for the youth guarantee, it probably goes well beyond my role in that initiatives such as Momentum, JobBridge and Springboard are all new schemes introduced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  They are targeting young people in an effort to get schemes that will be tailored to their needs.  They comprise a mixture of skill and employment experience and it is hoped they will be successful.  I consider Momentum to be a particularly well-designed scheme.  The mix of on-the-job and off-the-job experience on 20 to 40 week programmes is really interesting.  Moreover, some of the sponsors, of which I believe there are 72 in Dublin, are quite interesting.  It is to be hoped it is a scheme that will really work well.</p></speech>

He obviously is grabbing hold of many challenges.  I wish to raise the issue of licensing reform, particularly, but not exclusively, in retail.  It appears to me that all big businesses started as small businesses and to have in place the same legislation for licences for someone who employs 500 people as for someone who employs four people simply does not seem capable of being handled.  Moreover, I also wish the raise the number of licences that people need, particularly in the retail sector, .  While I acknowledge the Minister has touched on the subject, he should provide members with some idea of what he is considering.  In France, for instance, a large number of licences do not apply to any entity with fewer than 50 employees.  Is European Union legislation forcing Ireland to have so many of these legislative items or is Ireland to an extent free to do some of it itself?  While I acknowledge we have some difficulty in handling matters in some areas, it seems to me as though the fewer regulations we have, the more likely it is that someone will set up a business as a one, two or three person business.  This is where the big businesses start and is from where the employment comes.</p><p>  One final point was also touched on by Deputy Calleary, namely, the upward-only rents.  I am unsure whether this issue is under the Minister's remit but is there anything that can be done about such rents, particularly in the retail sector?  It just seems to be an impossible task.  I am told that was the Government's intention when it came into office but that it has been unable to go ahead with it.</p></speech>

How successful were such schemes and what were their failings and deficiencies?  How many people were employed through those initiatives?</p><p>  Another question relates to the proposed health innovation hub.  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, announced the new children&rsquo;s hospital, he referred to the establishment of a medical quarter in Dublin&rsquo;s south-west inner city.  I note that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is keen on the idea of a health innovation hub.  Could the schemes outlined be geographically defined and what is the prospect of the south-west inner city taking on such a challenge, in particular St. James&rsquo;s Hospital?</p><p>  I am concerned that the plans outlined suggest unemployment is geographically evenly spread, whereas urban areas have mass unemployment where enormous personal, family and community damage is being done by the sheer level of unemployment.  There does not appear to be a consciousness of the need to intervene in a radical way to give such communities more basis for hope and the individuals who are affected some basis for thinking that their turn will come again.  I would like to see the Government do more in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013022600008#H00300"><p>First, I will deal with the point raised by Senator Quinn.  We introduced an audit exemption, for example, which was about removing smaller companies, and we enhanced that last year.  We look for that wherever we can.  When it comes to environmental standards or wage rates there are certain criteria one expects to apply whether one is a large or small company.  However, there is scope in the area.  The EU is anxious to examine <i>de minimis</i> exemptions.  I do not know how far the talks have got in that regard.  What we have been doing is simplifying the entire licensing regime, but it is a reasonable point and we could do work on it to see whether there are areas we have missed where one could have a lesser requirement for smaller businesses.  I am not familiar with the French example.  Is it outside of the audit requirements in that it would not impact on public health or welfare?  I would be interested to examine the situation and perhaps to have a look at the French case.</p><p>  The high level group on regulation has business representation.  The purpose of that is to churn up areas where we can identify changes.  Last year we reformed the wage-setting mechanisms, which were very much a problem in the retail sector where one had different parts of it having to observe different rules.  We have tried to simplify that and to have more uniform rules.</p><p>  One could only implement a change on upward-only rent reviews if the State intended to compensate the landlord that was obliged to reduce the rent.  We did examine the situation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, examined the position, as did the Attorney General and others in order to see whether a system could be devised but that was the bottom line and the taxpayer simply could not afford to pay compensation to landlords.</p><p>  On the positive side, NAMA agreed to go ahead with the approach considered, namely, where companies could demonstrate they were in difficulties that it would agree to renegotiate terms.  NAMA has renegotiated more than 270 leases on the basis of the commitment.  Other work is ongoing in terms of having greater transparency in the registering of rents.  Some progress is being made.  Rents are being renegotiated but, as we have seen, sometimes they are only renegotiated by the larger groups by going into examinership.  It is a continuing problem but it is not one that the taxpayer can deal with.  The taxpayer is trying to deal with a lot of issues and this was one that could not be changed without the taxpayer paying compensation, which was not on.</p><p>  In response to the points made by Deputy Conaghan on the statistics on participation, the PRSI scheme had approximately 1,000 people on it but the ambition was to have 10,000.  The Revenue job assist scheme had approximately 700 to 800 on it.  It is a much older scheme and, typically, had very little take-up over its long life.  The scheme had been going for years and dates back to the previous recession.  The reason the schemes were not successful is that there were too many boxes to be ticked.  One had to show the job would endure, wait until one returned one's income tax and got the tax relief on the Revenue job assist, which could be a year later, and if one was not in profit one would get nothing.</p><p>  There were a lot of &#8220;hand trips&#8221; that made it difficult to use those schemes.  This one will be simpler.  From the point of view of people who are unemployed, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n or another member indicated, the advantage is that a person who is 12 months out of work, in effect, can go to an employer confident in the knowledge that there is a &euro;75 a week coupon if they recruit the person coming back to the employer.  It changes the conversation a bit, whereas with many employers if one had been out of work for so many months one would not be considered.  They would only look to someone who had a CV with a relatively small gap in it.</p><p>  On unemployment black spots, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has included measures in the Finance Bill to address such areas in Limerick and Waterford.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, through Intreo, the new employment service, is focused on unemployment black spots.  In my area it is focused in Coolock where there is a higher level of unemployment.  The work is only in its infancy but the concept is to have much earlier engagement with people and to give them options.  The intention is to make the welfare system support the development of the person who has lost his or her job instead of the traditional approach where one only accessed the welfare system if one could show one was idle.  The aim is to change the dynamic that was in the system.  I hope that will have an impact.</p><p>  The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas has been set up but Deputy Conaghan was not referring to black spots in rural areas.  The development of the new interventions through the Intreo service will promote the likes of Momentum, Springboard and JobBridge.  There is now a much better menu of interventions that will be more relevant than community employment, CE, schemes were in the past.  The key feature of the new interventions is to try to get people closer to the labour market.  The new schemes are closer to employment opportunities.  There has been an increase in participation in schemes, for example, 6,500 in Momentum, an additional 2,000 on JobBridge and a further 7,500 on other programmes, including local authority employment programmes.  I hope the additional range of activity will be relevant to areas of high levels of unemployment.</p><p>  On the health hub, a pilot scheme of a virtual hub has been established in Cork.  Essentially the idea was to bring businesses with new technologies and test them in a real-life situation in hospitals where a new service or technology could be test-bedded and then it would become a reference point for international sales.  That is the model that has been used.  It has been very successful in Cork and we are now looking at taking it to a national scale.</p></speech>

Could we have a progress report on the achievement of these targets?  There has been a reduction in the number of licences for small businesses.  What is the timeframe for the introduction of this measures?</p><p>  There was a proposal that there should be 20 major energy efficiency projects.  The funding for Sustainable Energy Ireland is only coming in but there is already talk of changing the scheme.  Would it not be better to put this into numerous smaller projects instead of 20 large projects?  That might create more employment.</p><p>  I raised the issue of ICT and science in schools with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Science is not a core subject up to junior certificate.  I am looking at schools in Kildare to find out how many children are doing science up to junior certificate.  It would be nice to see that in the ICT sector, with the Minister advocating that science be taken on board.  We are planning for something in 2018 but it will be in place for much longer. </p><p>  There was no mention of procurement.  It is not directly the Minister's responsibility but &euro;9 billion is available in the procurement sector for small companies.  There is a problem with the asset procurement services that want to amalgamate everything into bigger companies instead of smaller local enterprises.</p><p>  The young entrepreneur action was mentioned.  I urge the Minister to follow up on the significant success of the female entrepreneur fund last year.  It would be nice if there could be a youth entrepreneur fund, even if it was to start at &euro;250,000, to show we are serious about youth unemployment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013022600009#J00300"><p>The Minister mentioned the upward only rents and property rights.  In both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, during the debate on the IBRC legislation, we set aside property rights without compensation so it can be done if the political will exists.  This features in discussions any of us have with employers, particularly in the retail sector, where we lost 50,000 jobs in the past four years.  I have no doubt the cost of doing business, including the cost of rents, is part of that.</p><p>  The Minister said we need to be more ambitious.  If we look at the figures since this Government entered office, there has not been the increase in jobs we were promised.  The Minister mentioned 16,000 jobs gone in the public sector last year and 12,000 net jobs created in the private sector, a total loss of 4,000 jobs.  While we might be doing well in some areas, overall the jobs strategy is failing.  We are simply not creating jobs in any significant numbers.</p><p>  I am concerned that in response to a direction question on the 50% target for FDI outside Dublin and Cork, the Minister failed to say categorically that it will be retained.  The south east is suffering disproportionately.  We have 25% unemployment in Waterford city, with youth unemployment of over 35%, and a general figure of 19% across the south east.  We need a suite of interventions to make sure we can create the necessary jobs even to reach the unacceptable levels we have in the State overall and I am concerned that we are not reaching those targets.  The only way we will arrive at a situation where we can deal with those regional disparities is that the issue be driven at Cabinet level by the Minister and that it then seeps down into the enterprise agencies and stakeholders so we can join up the different efforts.  That simply is not happening in the south east and other regions that are suffering disproportionately.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that and ensure that where there are strong regional disparities and high levels of unemployment, more of a focus is placed on those areas.  I also want him to support the call for more effort to be made on youth unemployment and entrepreneurship.  In those areas that are suffering disproportionately, encouraging enterprise, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation through second and third level should be part of a long-term strategy for the Government across different Departments.  If we focus on youth unemployment it would be a positive move.  There are very real regional disparities that are at crisis levels and that must be dealt with.</p></speech>

This cross-departmental approach is very important because too often action in one Departments hinders job creation in another.  The approach is welcome.</p><p>  There have been more than 250,000 job losses since 2008 in the private sector, many of them in the construction sector.  While some retraining is possible many people would be best suited for construction work.  We must consider infrastructure investment in terms of stimulus projects.  These might be done through the European Investment Bank, as has been done in some water infrastructure projects under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  For smaller schemes such as schools and health centres, some work has taken place and we need to see more of it in the coming year.  It should also be targeted towards Irish companies rather than the larger projects that must be tendered in the European journal, where non-Irish companies can be chosen to do the work, importing their own workers instead of employing Irish people.  I would also like a progress update on the common visa waiver scheme.</p><p>  Commercial rates feature constantly in any discussions with the business sector.  We must have progress on the valuation legislation in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Similarly, delays with foreshore and aquaculture licences are hindering significant potential for investment because of environmental requirements.</p><p>  I welcome the sections in the plan on SMEs and the additional resources for the Credit Review Office and the monitoring of investment in stimulus from pillar banks.</p></speech>

He also noted the failure to reach the IDA's regional target for the establishment of new companies.  In securing 13 new start-ups, we fell a little short of the 15 fresh starts we had hoped to achieve but that was still a substantial improvement on the previous position.  All the targets have been designed to stretch us.  We have identified the tendency of legislative ambitions to run ahead of the capacity of the system to deliver.  This has been the case with the majority of the targets that were missed.</p><p>  Deputy Lawlor also asked whether it would be better to have 100 small energy efficiency start-up projects rather than 20 flagship projects.  There are different components to our plans in this area.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will focus on smaller types of project, the pay-as-one-saves scheme will be aimed at domestic households and the exemplar projects are in the public and commercial sectors.  A fund is being established with some State money and matching money from the private sector.  This model of joint funding will be used to finance energy saving companies which will secure a return on their investment from the savings generated from an upfront investment in energy saving works.  If this approach is effective, it will create a recycling pool of money, as it were, that can generate more activity.  The savings made will fund further activity.</p><p>  Mathematics has been targeted as the most significant element of the curriculum from the perspective of the information and communications technology, ICT, sector.  For this reason, the plan targets an increase in the uptake of mathematics to 30% by 2020.  That science is not targeted does not denigrate the subject.  Figures from college courses indicate that high placement rates are not so much in science but in engineering and mathematics, both of which are in strong demand.  There is a correct emphasis on trying to build these skills in basic higher level mathematics.</p><p>  Procurement is addressed in section 8.3 of the action plan, which deals with maximising procurement.  The objective is to try to deepen the innovative procurement we started last year by getting more people involved in it and to police the reduction of barriers for small and medium-sized companies.  Deputy Lawlor is correct that there is a move towards more centralised purchasing.  However, efforts are also being made to ensure obstacles are not placed in the path of such companies.  One problem that has frequently cropped up is where an unrealistically high threshold is set in the contract for insurance or previous business.  We are trying to weed out such unnecessary requirements and the National Procurement Service is committed to opening up opportunities for small and medium-sized companies.  While there will be an emphasis on consolidating purchases to secure best value, efforts will also be made to enable smaller companies to apply for contracts through the use of smaller bundles and collaborative tendering in which groups come together to make bids.  Both Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland have good programmes in place for supporting companies which are trying to get into the area of procurement.</p><p>  Last year, we made use of the competitive start fund and chapter 10 sets out a number of initiatives in this area.  We did not establish a dedicated fund with a new administration for female entrepreneurs but used an existing scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland.  The system was in place and we created a dedicated competition for women.  This type of approach has worked well and could be used for youth entrepreneurs.  This would mean using an existing instrument and holding a dedicated competition aimed at a certain segment, rather than establishing a fund similar to the National Youth Council's fund with a separate administrator.</p></speech>

When the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, went into liquidation, it left creditors exposed.  That is different from the Government deciding that companies which are trading as landlords and offering leases would have to reduce their rents.  The two scenarios are different.  If a company goes into liquidation, the creditors are left and their security is what the liquidator can generate from the assets.  Obviously, individual companies can enter examinership and try to renegotiate their property leases.  While I do not wish to lecture Senator Cullinane, one cannot pretend that we will be able to move from an economy in collapse, one which has been traumatised and is prostrate on the ground, delivering this or that number of jobs annually for the next number of years.  The truth is we are in a recovery in which we are rebuilding and fixing many of the things that were broken in the recent traumatic crisis.  We have to fix the banks.</p></speech>

However, we did not pretend, and it would be naive to pretend, that this can be divided up into bundles of 5,000 jobs or 20,000 jobs.  The economy does not work like that.  We must repair the banking system and many of the sectors of the economy that have been damaged.  We must put many things in place, which is what is being done.  We have examined all sectors of government to identify what changes we can make in different areas to rebuild the economy on a sustainable basis.  This will involve building capacity to win exports, developing sustainable enterprises and creating innovative companies as opposed to relying on Government expenditure or debt spending.  This is the challenge we face and it is not one we will achieve by flicking a switch and suddenly creating a set number of jobs every year.  Members must recognise that our task is akin to turning around an oil tanker and steering it in a different direction.</p><p>  The IDA target remains and is a 2020 target in its strategy.  However, we will clearly have to revisit our capacity to deliver in this area.  As Deputies are aware, we have selected the south east and recognise the problems in the region.  I have invested considerable effort in this issue.  The various partners in the south east are working together and all the agencies have a spotlight on the region.  We are trying to make a difference and build up the assets of the region as it requires a stronger asset base.  The IDA has applied for planning permission for a facility.  The challenge we are trying to meet is to rebuild the competitive edge of the region.</p><p>  On Deputy Kyne's contribution, given that we do not have much money to spend, we must spend what we have in a smarter way.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, for example, is having bundles of schools built through public private partnership projects, funding water investment through charges and financing the hospital building programme through the national lottery.  These are ways of creating a stimulus in the economy that will have an impact.  I understand further bundles of schools are planned and primary health centres are being developed.  A number of projects are still in play.</p></speech>

I refer to upward-only rents on which there are different views.  However, could there not be a constitutional amendment to address the problem?  The Minister stated we cannot turn around the juggernaut without taking time.  The countercyclical argument we make, namely, that significant investment can be made, is not pie in the sky but is used internationally.  The troika - the Minister's boss, so to speak - stated that significant money was available through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the European Investment Bank and the private pensions industry.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has announced a &euro;2.5 billion stimulus fund made up of public private partnerships, which is an innovative way of using resources, and he is capitalising the flow of our national lottery.  He has established an infrastructure fund within the pension reserve fund, between the NPRF and Enterprise Ireland.  We have created &euro;2.5 billion worth of funds for SMEs and NAMA has committed to &euro;2 billion of investment in new activity.  We are using the resources we have to leverage investment in ways that are innovative.  That must be recognised.  If these are topped up there would be &euro;7 billion worth of innovative use of funds.  That is what the Government is doing.</p><p>  However, it cannot be ignored that we came into a situation where spending on health, education and all the good things was nearly 50% higher than revenue being received.  That is not a sustainable base for having a traditional Keynesian expansionist policy.  If we have to supplement the tax base with 50% extra in borrowing it is not sustainable.  Given the crash that occurred the Government did not have that option, even if the troika had been willing to lend to us.  We cannot continue to borrow so we must develop smarter ways of using the revenues and assets we have, including asset sales.  We must be willing to sell the assets we built up in the past in order to make investments in assets we need for the future.  That is part of it, along with being willing to admit the need for a revenue stream from water services in order to invest in a world class water system.  Those are the sorts of smart ways of using-----</p></speech>

I propose that we deal with the topics separately.  One might lead into the other and if that is the case, so be it.  I will ask the witnesses to be as brief in their contributions and as specific to the two topics as is possible.  I welcome the following: from the Irish Rural Dwellers Association Mr. James Doyle, chairman, and Mr. Neilie O'Sullivan, PRO; from the GAA Mr. John Kelly; from the IFA Mr. Sean Brosnan; and from the McGillycuddy Reeks Study Group, Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Connell.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and other documents you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website this afternoon.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Today's meeting is another instalment of the process in which the committee is engaged to get a feeling for what it is like for people to get insurance following the devastating effects of flooding in recent times, particularly the summer flooding.  I am from west County Cork, which has been very badly affected in towns such as Clonakilty and Skibbereen.  There are also legacy issues in other areas.  We want to get some idea of the difficulties people represented by the Irish Rural Dwellers Association have encountered in getting insurance renewal.  Some have been refused cover and others have faced increased premia.  It is not just down to a person's residence; it has a very devastating effect on a whole community.</p></speech>

Extreme weather events seem to be on the increase, with torrential rainfall causing flash flooding which in turn can cause extensive damage to homes and businesses.  Some areas are more prone to flooding and damage and as a result insurance companies will not cover them for risk.  Homes and businesses find themselves in the vulnerable position of being unable to get insurance against loss or damage, thus challenging Government to come up with a solution to help people who have suffered major loss as a result of property damage.</p><p>  As a first step, a thorough assessment of the scale, extent and intensity of the problem needs to be undertaken.  A number of different approaches need to be considered.  For instance, urban areas where flood defences can be erected need to be treated differently from natural river flood plains in that urban areas need to be treated as capital expenditure.  In some cases only parts of a townland may be under threat of flooding but the entire townland is being blacklisted by insurance companies.  The Shannon basin flooding problem must be considered, as it is a recurring event.  Financial help will need to be given to those without insurance cover suffering damage and loss owing to the extreme weather conditions.  We welcome this opportunity to discuss this very serious and pressing problem and look forward to participating in a further discussion.</p><p>  I referred to urban areas versus the individual house.  If flood defences are capable of being put in place, that is a different way of financing compared with a private house which may not have that facility available.  That is one of the big distinctions.  The Shannon basin is another major ongoing problem.  I do not know what can be done about that because there have been so many Government promises over the years about drainage for the Shannon.  There are many individuals in rural areas along the Shannon and, as the Chairman rightly pointed out, it is very detrimental to the whole community there when their homes, farmland and businesses are flooded.  That is a major problem.  That is a kind of national approach again as distinct from the problem with insurance on the individual home or business.</p></speech>

What has been the significant difficulty people have experienced with insurance companies?  Is it in getting cover or is it increased policy fees which, if large enough, in effect are a way of telling someone he or she will not be covered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doyle" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013022600004#D00300"><p>I come from near Killarney and I referred to the townland situation.  When one goes to an insurance company and gives one's name and address the employee presses a couple of buttons on the computer to bring up the map.  Although part of a townland or area has never experienced flooding, it could be blacklisted as part of an entire area, and as a result a premium is put on the policy whereby the property cannot be insured.  A study needs to be done to quantify the problem and establish where it is and come to a sensible conclusion on how to deal with it.  Certain towns and urban areas have rivers or are built on river basins.  Work can be done in towns such as Mallow, Clonmel or Clonakilty but this is a different problem to a person in an individual house at the mercy of an insurance company with no redress by way of protection.  Perhaps part of the problem is a legacy of the Celtic tiger when building was done on flood plains.  This is another big area which needs to be addressed.  A study must be done to quantify the problem, see where exactly it is and who is affected and establish who will pick up the tab.</p></speech>

In fairness to the local authorities and the other agencies tasked with such work, drains were blocked and the events happened very quickly.  Generally speaking the response is reasonably good but anything can be improved.  The agencies do the best they can with the resources at their disposal at present.</p></speech>

The report includes eight recommendations and I believe the witnesses will agree with most of them.  The IFA came before the committee and we discussed the matter with them.  We are anxious to solve this issue as it is a problem with regard to many rivers apart from the Shannon.</p><p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is a particular problem.  It sees its role as protecting wildlife, but allowing water levels to rise so high on the Shannon and other rivers means entire species such as the corncrake are being wiped out.  There is a similar problem on a smaller scale in my constituency with the River Goul.  I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on this.  I am very concerned about it.  We will end up losing species and wiping out the human race along river banks because farming will not be viable if the Taliban approach of the National Parks and Wildlife Service continues.  As a Deputy I feel it needs to be challenged and I encourage the witnesses to do so.  Rules made in Brussels will not work during extreme weather events in Killarney, in Cullahill in Laois or along the banks of the Shannon, and this has been proved.  We need to drive home this message loud and clear.</p><p>  Mr. Doyle made a good point on townlands being flooded.  It is a problem.  Consultants are hired to zone areas and draw up flood maps but the problem is that areas are lumped together.  It is an issue with local area plans whereby huge townlands have been sterilised and designated as flood plains.  In Mountmellick an entire area was designated as a flood plain but in actual fact a strip approximately 10 meters wide along the edge of a drain is a flood plain, but the rest of the area cannot be flooded because it is a hill and water will not flow uphill - at least I never saw it do so.  We need to address this issue.</p><p>  I am interested in the views of the witnesses with regard to the policy of the National Parks and Wildlife Service on silt removal and the removal of barriers.  This problem will multiply throughout the country and is already becoming a significant issue.  Had we followed the present approach under the old Board of Works, which preceded the Office of Public Works, approximately one third of what is now agricultural land would not be such and part of the country would still be covered in bogs and woods.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on how best this can be tackled.  It is causing serious problems, including flooding in towns, because the rules on removing a bit of silt are so strict that if one wants to do &euro;1,000 worth of work with a Hymac, one must obtain a &euro;10,000 report, and if six or 12 months pass one must obtain another report.  This is a huge issue which needs to be addressed.</p><p>  With regard to insurance, obviously imposing an extra levy would be difficult.  Does Mr. Doyle see a legal or legislative response to this through the D&aacute;il and Seanad bringing forward new legislation to protect people living in townlands where, to put it simply, a small part of the townland may be flooded but the greater part of the townland would not?  Does the law on this need to be changed?</p></speech>

Much of what comes from Brussels much of the time does not take into account the people, and decisions are made remotely.  We need to go back to a community and knowledge-based approach.  The best knowledge is on the ground and was handed down to us by our forefathers.  We have always cared for the land and our rivers.  A classic example in Kerry is with regard to fires on the MacGillicuddy Reeks as a result of bad policy, some of which emanates from Brussels in response to overgrazing of sheep.  The mountains have always been burned in a very controlled way to enable young growth to provide grazing for sheep.  The sheep were compulsorily removed, which meant the heather and other plants grew to ten or 12 feet high and as soon as they took fire it turned into a forest fire.  This is what happens and it puts much property at risk.  It comes back to the rural forum which could be established and would allow interaction.  The advice from those who have traditionally farmed and worked the land, and who know better than most how to manage the countryside, should be taken as professional advice.  The same applies with regard to the rivers.  I do not know when some of the maps available were drawn up, but as Deputy Stanley stated, it makes no sense that a river plain extends over a hill which is 300 feet high, as is the case.</p></speech>

There should be no need for a levy on the person whose property is not subject to flooding.  If a person's property is subject to flooding no insurance company will take on that risk.  That is a fact of life.  Insurance companies are commercial entities and we fully recognise that.  However, that does not mean that person as a citizen who pays his taxes should not have the same protection as a person in an urban area whose problem may be solved by taxpayers' money by way of defences.  The risk must be equalised.  How that is to be financed is another day's work but I would be loath to suggest how it might be done.</p></speech>

While much focus has been on the Shannon and there is no doubt that area has experienced serious flooding, in recent years serious flooding issues have arisen in rivers all over the country.  In Waterford, the area I represent, the River Suir and River Clodagh are tidal.  When an extreme weather event occurs there is a huge swell in the rivers with the additional water and the  river banks are under severe pressure.  I agree with Deputy Stanley who outlined his concerns in regard to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  As a committee we need to ascertain if we can seek exemptions for emergency works for reinforcement of river banks or removal of silt in rivers where there is extreme pressure.  Recently I have seen farmlands flooded where the water got out on to regional roads and caused a serious traffic hazard.  In the area I speak about, flood defence and mitigation measures have been put in place.  A huge investment has been made by the Government in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Waterford city to defend against flooding.  What appears to happen - I hope we may hear more from the Office of Public Works - is that pressure is funnelled down the river and on to the banks.  It floods rural areas and puts townlands that previously may not have been flooded under serious pressure.  There is a knock-on effect.  There is a need for serious engagement with the Office of Public Works and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on silt removal and the reinforcement of river banks to make it easier for landowners and farmers to do the work in an emergency and readily fashion.  I am interested to hear about the bottom-up approach.  The witnesses, and the committee to a lesser degree,  have an important role to play in voicing their concerns.  The setting up by the Government of the rural commission, under the chairmanship of Pat Spillane, should give us an opportunity to feed back to Government the significance of what the witnesses have said.  I understand the witnesses have a meeting arranged or it is engaging with that commission.  Perhaps they would elaborate on what their approach might be in order that we can broaden the support they will require to express that view.  It is important to express that view.</p><p>  Insurance is becoming a huge issue.  It is like the special areas of conversation where the lines are just drawn on a map.  Other representatives and I would have seen where local authorities include whole fields when only a ten metre run along a river or stream should be in the special area of conservation.  That is another issue.  Perhaps the witnesses would express their views on how the special areas of conservation are designated officially and how rural Ireland and farming people should respond to try to make it fairer and practical.</p></speech>

Most of the time, as I explained about the sheep, there was not enough consultation and local knowledge taken on board.  As Deputy Stanley rightly pointed out, somebody who is remote from the problem, makes a decision which is an academic approach to a situation where there are practical issues that have to be taken into account.  This is the bottom up approach.  If we had consultation and that type of forum, when significant decisions are being taken about sterilising land or whatever, whereby people could be consulted and invited to make an input which is reasonable and understandable then we could address many of those problems without any cost to the Exchequer; in fact we might spare the Exchequer money.</p></speech>

How does he find the interaction between the MEPs for our area?  Traditionally, they would argue that it is very difficult for them to get involved and try to get a profile from issues nationally, even though we are part of Europe as a whole.  How does he find the interaction with MEPs around such issues?</p></speech>

I suppose it is the poor relation of administration.  I do not know how that can be corrected.  Some of us might have access but there is not general access to MEPs as such.  They are very spread out.  While the country is small, at the same time there is much travelling involved.  We are very fortunate in Killarney because we have an MEP beside us but that does not mean that somebody in a different part of the countryside has the same access.  Neither do they have the structure on the ground to cater for that type of interaction which is a great pity.  I was in Brussels last year with our MEP where we met some members of the European Commission.  The Commission is not as draconian as we portray it.  The directives coming from Brussels are not draconian, it is only when we get them here, we seem to go to town on them.  That is a breakdown in the system.  I am glad the Chairman asked the question because it is an important issue that needs to be addressed, given that the European Council has so much power, which we welcome in a democracy, but maybe it is the bad way around on the other hand.  I used to be in IFA and I was in Brussels a few times.  My experience of the Commission was that it was far more benign that what emerged in Ireland afterwards.</p></speech>

I take on board what the witness said about using tradition and local knowledge.  Certainly it is a rich fane that one should tap into and an under used resource in urban and rural areas.  We have to look constantly at mechanisms for tapping into that knowledge.  I think the proposed forum could work in a constructive way.</p><p>  The witness talked about flooding, mapping and sea farms.  Flooding is a topical issue no matter what part of the country one resides, whether urban or rural.  Having listened to the witness the problems are similar.  The geocoding is the same in Dublin as in Kerry, Cork or Galway.  There are houses on top of hills coded as in a flood area.  They cannot get household insurance and people cannot sell their homes because the purchaser cannot get a mortgage and they are totally locked in.  This is very much a common cause.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, is working extremely hard on the issue and Deputy Donohoe  and I have raised the issue many times.  He is working within a sub-group trying to tackle the issue.  For those whose houses have been flooded, there must be some mechanism to allow them get insurance.  It is better that they contribute to their own insurance costs if the house is going to be flooded.  Most of the homes and properties that are flooded are on clear flood plains that floods on a normal basis.  As there is also the one in a 100 year event or the one in a 200 year event, there must be a mechanism to allow that householder or business to get insurance cover.  While we work cross-party here we should work together across urban and rural to achieve that aim.  There should not be too big an onus in terms of cost imposed on the property that may be flooded once in 100 years.</p><p>  There is another matter on which we need to work together, that is after flood defence works have been carried out, there is a reluctance on the part of insurance companies to cover the properties for insurance. </p></speech>

The initiative came about through co-operation between the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, the Kerry executive of the IFA and the Kerry county board of the GAA.  All three organisations are extremely concerned about rural depopulation and what is happening to rural communities.  The GAA county board commissioned a study which produced some alarming results on population decline, particularly with regard to the peninsulas and the peripheral areas of the county.  We then commissioned this report in association with the Institute of Technology Tralee and we launched it last April.</p><p>  The report identifies our key demand, which is the establishment of a rural forum.  Remarkably, when we examined the subject we discovered one of the key recommendations of the 1999 White Paper on rural development, which is an excellent document, was the establishment of a rural forum.  The White Paper was possibly mislaid during the euphoria of the Celtic tiger era when we were all doing very well.  We need to get back to it because there is no doubt that rural Ireland is suffering.  We need a bottom-up common approach.</p><p>  The central theme of The Rural Challenge is about the inalienable right of people to continue to live and prosper in rural Ireland.  We call for the establishment of a rural forum to address in a non-confrontational manner the needs, aspirations and ongoing welfare of those who wish to live, work and raise their families in the Irish rural countryside.  The rural forum would provide a meaningful opportunity for rural issues and concerns to be validated in a bottom-up approach and would give rural people a strong voice and input into policies which impact on their way of life.  The rural challenge group is entirely non-political and not aligned to any particular movement.  We are not interested in public protest or civil disobedience campaigns.  We want to enter into dialogue with our public representatives in local and national government to draw up a realistic vision for the development of rural Ireland and its people well into the 21st century and beyond.</p><p>  Rural Ireland is home to 1.5 million people and is still a great place to live.  We propose a 12-point action plan which we believe if implemented would ensure the future viability and sustainability of our rural way of life.  These 12 points include: fair and equitable rural planning whereby rural people's inalienable right to reside in the countryside is acknowledged and asserted; a reversal of Government and public policy strategies, which to date seem focused on the reduction or closure of services throughout rural Ireland; providing infrastructure and appropriate access to encourage vibrant rural enterprises, including better road access to western seaboard counties and better rail and air services; the provision of high-speed broadband and advanced technology which would facilitate the proliferation of small rural industries and support the concept of home working; the provision of appropriate business supports to allow for innovative rural enterprise and the removal of bureaucratic blockages which tend to stymie small-scale rural enterprises; the ongoing development of the family farm enterprise and the agri-food sector which has the capacity to create much sustainable employment; quality-of-life issues such as home care strategies for the elderly, meaningful community care programmes and support for the concept of the extended family, which traditionally has been a welcome feature of rural life; the recognition of rural customs and traditions and the preservation of a rural heritage; establishing one-stop-shop service outlets in local communities, perhaps utilising the local post office as the preferred location; a review of the national spatial strategy which we believe tends to concern itself primarily with urban development; developing first-class sustainable rural communities through ongoing and genuine collaboration and engagement with local communities and community organisations; and, something which is in the news at the moment, the retention and development of the rural transport system.  These are our key objectives.  We believe the 1999 White Paper should be updated and re-examined as it was an excellent document which ticked many of the boxes in which we are very interested.</p></speech>

I welcome the group and thank them for bringing their wealth of experience to these proceedings.  They are farming community groups, experienced farm leaders, farmers and people who work in the public and legal sectors.  It is great to have the association here.</p><p>  One thing that I like about the association is that its attendance puts to bed a lot of criticism levelled by our critics who  categorised the Irish Rural Dwellers Association as only being concerned with building houses on family farms.  The delegation proves that the association, and groups like it, simply stand up for rural Ireland.  There are 100 other issues like this one and it is important that the association made its presentation today.  The critics' views have been knocked on the head.  They wanted to box us in and label us as something we are not, and I appreciate the association's presentation.  I also thank it for the excellent work it has done.</p><p>  The presentation commenced with issues such as insurance, flooding and similar.  It is blatantly obvious that flooding was caused by restrictions imposed by Europe and, like the association said, by the Department regarding the extraction of gravel from rivers.  Gravel naturally occurs in certain places on rivers.  Over the years farmers, not in a large commercial way but in a small way, and if a farmer did not own a digger he hired a digger instead, spent a day drawing gravel out of a section of the river where it was easy to access a gravel deposit.  He cleaned up a section of the river and took away the gravel to use it for roadways, stockpiled it for use during the winter or to carry out jobs here and there, and the gravel was also mixed with concrete to cover yards.  It was put to a myriad of uses.  That gravel helped the farmer and in exchange, he cleaned the river.  The hole in the river basin meant that when nature took over again the gravel was deposited in the hole instead of choking the river.  It was like saving hay or turf every year.  The gravel was available to the farmer every year.  The removal of gravel was perfectly natural for the farmer.  No fish were killed because the exercise was carried out at the correct time of year.  Not at a time when fish spawned and so on.</p><p>  Today, a farmer would be nearly shot if he was seen going into a river with a machine and a tractor and trailer.  That is no exaggeration.  If he went into a town and robbed a bank there would be less notice taken of him.  If a farmer is seen going into a river with a machine, people will be down on him like a ton of bricks and, believe me, I know it.  Unfortunately, that is what people are up against.</p></speech>

I represent Kildare North where people have experienced flooding in both rural and urban locations.  If we were to begin again, we would not build in some locations.  Mistakes were made in the past.  We cannot repeat the same mistakes in the future.  It is important to state that.  When the OPW conducts a cost benefit analysis for the remediation of flooding, the analysis will disproportionately favour urban locations because the property loss is greater.  That is part of the problem to which I can point in my constituency.  In a town, a scheme will remediate a number of housing estates but in a rural area in which the houses are dispersed over a wide area, it is more difficult to introduce a scheme.</p><p>  I take issue with a number of points raised by Deputy Healy-Rae.  We must recognise that climate change is making a significant difference.  It does not matter how much sediment and gravel one takes out of the river bed, there will be a problem which we must not exacerbate.  Judging from what I have seen of the OPW, it would need to see a robust cost benefit analysis before it will spend public money.  I am sure he is aware of that.</p><p>  Attention was drawn to opportunities created by renewable energy and forestry the involvement of community groups and the role of farmers markets.  We will have a debate in the near future about Coillte.  There are opportunities in rural Ireland that can be exploited.</p><p>  The zoning of land is a reserved function.  In cases in which the local authority officials make a recommendation, the councillors have the ultimate responsibility in voting on the recommendation.  I can point to areas in which very bad decisions were made by allowing development on known flood plains.  We must all pick up the price for those decisions but we should learn from the experience.  I do not doubt that is a really serious problem for those who are trying to get insurance.  I have come across problems in both rural and urban settlements in my constituency.  I understand how it plays out and the difficulties it presents for people.</p></speech>

I do not have a huge amount to add to the committee's deliberations today.  I am involved in a group called the McGillycuddy Reeks Study Group - also known as a trust or community group.  It is a group without any particular affiliation to any other group.  We have been kindly invited to participate today and we are grateful for this opportunity that has been given to us.  We are endeavouring to bring together the entire community of what is a particularly small area nationally, but a substantial area in Kerry, to try to redress the disintegration of rural life that is taking place within that area.  The area is rich in natural resources and has the highest mountains in the country.  It is also an area of great beauty, but the human habitat is being destroyed on a daily basis.</p><p>  The purpose of the McGillycuddy Reeks Study Group is to examine ways in which that might be redressed.  We do not have a particular outcome in mind, nor do we look at it on the basis of what is wrong.  We are looking at what is there and what we can do to improve it.  Part of the problem nowadays is that, because of increased mechanisation, industrialisation and the Internet, people are acting very much as individuals rather than as a group.  We are trying to redress that development.  </p><p>  We are not particularly interested in an outcome that makes the rural community dependent on hand-outs.  We want to promote a means of making a livelihood that is not so dependent.  We look at tax breaks ahead of hand-outs, but that is all in the future.  All we are doing is carrying out an audit of resources in the area.  Hopefully, we can become a pilot for future plans in other areas.  We are looking at what might be achievable when we get our audit back.  It is being worked on at the moment and in the next few months it will hopefully be available.  We can then move on to the feasibility stage.  </p><p>  We would like to support those who wish to make a living in this area by guiding them through the regulatory quagmire that affects rural areas, including SACs and SPAs.  An individual who is trying to take on this quagmire is simply washed away by the flood of red tape.  If we can encourage groups to work together as communities, we can then pool our resources and get through that quagmire.  European regulations are not necessarily something that this committee or the D&aacute;il itself can change at the moment.  We have to work with them and that is the reality of the situation, but we cannot do so as individuals.  We have to persuade those who are making the decisions that they have options, which is what we will continue to do.  </p><p>  We endeavoured to get support from the South Kerry Development Partnership which is supposed to be a support body for groups such as ours.  However, after about six months of red tape we just gave up.  In a matter of four days, overseas supporters provided the same amount of money that we needed to carry out a feasibility study.  Those involved in conservation and agricultural projects abroad can see the value of this, but our own Government cannot.  Nonetheless we will progress.  We do not want to be in a situation where we are always looking for hand-outs from the Government.  </p><p>  That is a brief introduction to our work.  We do want a forum to be able to communicate with the various organisations with which we will have to deal.  A substantial portion of the McGillycuddy Reeks is designated as an SPA and an SAC by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, so there is very little that can be done.  However, we want people in the Government to meet us and talk to us, instead of just coming along at the very end and saying that we cannot do that.</p><p>  There has been a lack of consultation, which is what my colleagues here have been speaking about.  We would like to be able to approach some people and have them listen to us at this early stage so that when we come to them they will say "That is the thing you were talking about.  Yes, we have looked into that and these are ways we can get around the legal quagmire."</p></speech>

I have always been deeply impressed by the contribution the GAA has made to the life of communities in so many parishes and townlands around the country and beyond.  The heading "Community of Faith" still defines the GAA.</p><p>  I am just representing Kerry today but this is a national problem.  The GAA is a community organisation and caters for everybody - young and old, men and women.  It has also made a huge contribution to the economy through the purchase of equipment.</p><p>  In 2010, the Kerry county board commissioned a survey or report which makes for dire reading.  A number of clubs have gone into decline, including the one that Miche&aacute;l's father, Mick O'Connell, who won many All-Irelands with Kerry, played with.  At the moment they face becoming defunct.</p><p>  The big problem is that if small rural GAA clubs - as with small rural schools and post offices - become defunct and people move away to work in urban areas, the infrastructure will no longer be there.  It is impossible to get land in urban areas for school playing fields.  With population growth, we have found that is the case, particularly in Killarney and Tralee.  We are therefore advocating that more facilities and opportunities should be made available in rural areas.</p><p>  I have also been working at Croke Park on the problem of rural isolation with Ms Colleen Regan.  During her period in office, the former President Mary McAleese and her husband Martin became very concerned about rural isolation.  I was on a committee in Croke Park dealing with that issue.  In addition, I was involved with a report which the South Kerry Development Partnership commissioned in 2010.  </p><p>  When considering rural isolation we found that three things were required, namely, rural transport, the rural social scheme, and local community involvement and interaction.  We found that such areas used to have the mart, mass and fairs.  The fairs and creameries have gone now, however.  All that is left for people in isolated areas therefore is the rural pub, which is also in decline.  The only outlet many people had in such areas was to go to the local GAA field.  If the rural GAA clubs go, that will be gone too. </p><p>  In 2010, the coroner for south Kerry, Mr. Terence Casey, found that suicide was increasing in the county.  It is a national problem with 600 people dying per year by suicide.  The graph is moving towards the elderly in rural areas, including south Kerry.  There is much concern about this, including the concerns voiced by the coroner.  </p><p>  We are trying to address the problem by providing services in community halls.  Our own Spa GAA club outside Killarney has social activities, including card drives which we also take around to local community centres.  We are seeking efforts to halt the rural decay of the GAA.  The GAA should be part of the rural forum.  We do not want to lose small communities where there is great interaction and social cohesion - some people call it social capital - between young and old.  It is a great asset to communities.  Providing the infrastructure, however, is a difficult problem.</p><p>  Deputies Healy-Rae and Fleming mentioned flooding.  I live near the River Flesk where there was a serious flooding problem for a number of years.  In that case, they moved in a Hymac and lowered the river bed, removed stones and drained the surrounding area, thus solving the problem.  There has been no more flooding, although there had been for a number of years previously.  In addition, they erected barriers on the river banks to improve it.  It was a very simple process.</p><p>  I advocate the establishment of a rural forum.  We are working closely with Mr. Pat Spillane and had a good meeting with him last week. </p></speech>

I thank Deputies Healy-Rae and Fleming for facilitating our attendance today.  We also have met Pat Spillane's commission for the economic development of rural areas, CEDRA, and were very impressed with the technical backup it is getting from Teagasc.  Very eminent people from the latter organisation are involved in the commission, which focuses more on job creation, which obviously is the central part of economic development.  The idea of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, included in our document, was that the forum might be expanded at some point beyond job creation towards other social aspects as there probably is some need for a rural forum.</p><p>  On the specific issue of flooding, I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae on the need for draining.  I understand that &euro;30 million is being spent on the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies.  This constitutes a large sum of money at present and is more than is being spent on the most recent agri-environment scheme.  While this money is merely being spent on a study of flooding, I believe a lot of the flooding problems could be solved were it used to clean up some of the rivers.  Moreover, much of the flooding could be cleared by landowners themselves with a shovel, a digger or whatever.  However, there are restrictions in place and even during those times of the year when such restrictions do not apply, many landowners are afraid to conduct such work because there are penalties for so doing at the wrong time of the year.</p><p>  On the aspects that relate to this joint committee, one point we mentioned at the CEDRA forum last week concerned the wood energy project under way in County Kerry.  I believe this very exciting project would be of interest to this committee and one of the key points is it actually was driven by the public sector.  It has been driven by the county manager and his staff, Teagasc and the forest service.  This represents entrepreneurship coming from the public rather than the private sector.  Both we and they have a few issues with it.  Some of our issues concern the restrictions on developing forestry within the county, some of which are environmental restrictions, while others simply are restrictions that emanate from within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In addition, there are issues for the local authority in rolling out the schemes in respect of regulation of the heat distribution network.  There are many ideas extant and I believe Pat Spillane's forum is gathering them up.  We do not envisage it to be a commission that will last forever.  It will present its ideas before September and will conclude.  Following on from that, if it is successful, one certainly could think about expanding it into the rural forum about which the Irish Rural Dwellers Association is talking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-26a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013022600010#K00300"><p>In conclusion, today we have been discussing a local initiative in County Kerry even though the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, the IFA and GAA are national organisations.  However, they have come together in Kerry and this initiative has application for the entire country.  I am sure that most of what has been said today could be repeated all over the country and basically, our points are common to the entire country.</p><p>  I will make one point on flooding in respect of the gravel.  I was on a fishery board myself for a number of years and still have an association with the inland fisheries organisation.  One major problem that did happen, was that big Hymacs went in and dug out the beds of the river, which of course is not acceptable to anyone.  Much activity like that on the rivers has been stopped, I am sure Deputy Healy-Rae was not talking about that either but certainly sensible removal of gravel would contribute.  However, the flooding issue is bigger than that.</p><p>  The White Paper of 1999 did actually set out the desirability of setting up a rural forum.  This joint committee would be well advised to inquire further into it, as it has a lot to offer.  One point I might make to the clerk to the committee and the Chairman is that we would appreciate further development of what we are talking about, as well as further communication with us, to tease out this proposal further and ascertain whether there is merit in it.  We firmly believe there is merit in our suggestions.  We are not political in any way, other than in attempting to encourage the political system.  I believe this is the way forward because we propose a bottom-up approach, a representation of what rural Ireland is about and the repository of knowledge, culture and way of life that exists in rural Ireland.  We want to maintain and build on that and get support for so doing.  In this context, we will be asking our Deputies to make representations and to work with us to achieve this rural forum.  We have been highly impressed by Pat Spillane's work in the rural commission.  It is very worthwhile and a lot of good work will come from it.  However, to ensure the continuance of such good work, a forum will be needed.</p></speech>

I have relieved the Chairman to enable him to attend a third meeting.  Even though the witnesses are from County Kerry in the south of the country, as I entered the room they were speaking on issues I hear about on a regular basis and I am from the heart of north County Tipperary in the midlands.  As for the issues to which they referred such as flooding, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy also is from the midlands and we have debated this issue as it pertains to the River Shannon and the River Brosna at committee level.  It is something on which the joint committee is working.  The issues are the same right across the country, as indeed is the spirit about which the witnesses speak.  It is very much alive throughout all counties in rural Ireland through the GAA.  I refer in particular to volunteerism and when people are in trouble in the country, the response from the community is absolutely wonderful.  We all have experienced tragedies of one kind or another and the manner in which the country people rally around their neighbours and the way they respond to crises is really what the witnesses were discussing today.  Every encouragement should be given to that and this is the function of this joint committee.  I speak for the members of the joint committee who invited the witnesses to attend today.  The clerk has taken note of all the issues the witnesses have raised and members will follow them through at committee level as they also invite other representative groups to debate these issues.  Ultimately, the members will compile a report which will be forwarded to the witnesses as well.</p></speech>

We look forward to further communications with the joint committee and to working with it to help along matters.  As the Vice Chairman has just said, there is tremendous energy and activity in rural Ireland, as well as a great number of organisations.  This is a pilot project and four different groups are represented here today.  We would like to broaden this out to encourage everyone to come on board and work towards a better and more informed future when this comes down to legislation.</p></speech>
