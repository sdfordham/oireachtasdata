    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  Mr. McCarthy is accompanied by his colleague, Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit.  No apologies have been received in respect of today's meeting.  Are the minutes of the meeting of 13 October 2016 agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  As there are no further matters arising from the minutes, we will move on straightaway to correspondence.  I refer to correspondence items 105A.1, 105A.2 and 105A.3 and 11A.  These relate to briefing material and the opening statement from the Department of Social Protection for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note them?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on previous meetings.  The first item in this regard is 100B, a letter received from Mr. Denis Leamy, CEO of Pobal, in response to a request for information on Pobal's 2015 financial statements which identified irregular payments estimated at &euro;500,000 in respect of community child care subvention.  The correspondence outlines that there is a Garda investigation into this case.  It also details key controls put in place by Pobal to insure that such instances do not happen again.  Is it agreed to note the correspondence, in particular the fact of the Garda investigation?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I ask that all mobile phones be put in airplane mode as placing them in silent mode means they will still interfere with the recording system.</p> <p>  The next item is 104B, a letter from Mr. John O'Sullivan, commissioner of valuation, regarding the valuation of fisheries.  The letter states that the committee will be kept informed of any planned revaluation.  It is a matter for the Valuation Office as well.  We will note that.</p> <p>  The next item, 107B, was received from Mr. Gerry Quinn, chief operations officer of the Central Bank.  It is a follow-up to the meeting of 21 September 2016 on retention payments in the Central Bank.  Can we note that?  The bank gave us the overall figure at the meeting and the letter sets out some further breakdown of that.</p> <p>  The next item is 110B, correspondence received from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, responding to requests for a meeting with the Department on 10 November.  Mr. Moran has nominated the second secretary, Ms Ann Nolan, to represent him, subject to the approval of the committee.  Ms Nolan will be accompanied by Mr. Declan Reid, senior banking specialist, and Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding management unit.  In fairness, we must acknowledge that Mr. Derek Moran was not in the Department at any time during the period relating to Project Eagle and that the people who are to attend are those who are most appropriate to answer questions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is 112B, correspondence received from NAMA in respect of Project Eagle.  This is important.  The correspondence relates to the release of communications between Lazard and NAMA on the loan-sale process as requested by the committee.  Lazard has agreed to this on condition that the committee does not publish the correspondence as part of its Project Eagle report or otherwise.  We will proceed to consider the documents in private session and agree to the request.  We will obtain and deal with the information but we will not be able to publish any of it as part of our work without Lazard's consent.  We can acknowledge within the report that we received it and will be aware of the information.  However, Lazard is asking that its correspondence not be published because it is confidential between it and NAMA.  Can we agree to that?</p></speech>

We are in public session.</p></speech>

It is difficult to consider it now.  I have just seen it for the first time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B00900"><p>To be helpful, have people seen the letter?  It is very short, only half a page long.  I ask people to think about it.  We wrote to NAMA and the agency confirmed that the documentation it received from Lazard was marked confidential.  On that basis, it sought Lazard's prior consent to providing the correspondence to the committee.  In response, Lazard has stated that it is willing to provide its consent subject to an undertaking from the committee that the confidentiality of its correspondence will be respected and that the correspondence would not be published by the committee as part of its report on Project Eagle or otherwise.  Do members want time to consider this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01000"><p>It is just to think about it.  Lazard has been quoted repeatedly at our meetings as backing up a certain viewpoint.  I need to think about that.  We have not used Lazard, but NAMA has repeatedly used it to say "This is what Lazard said".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01100"><p>We will hold it over until next Tuesday's meeting and try to finalise it then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01200"><p>Can I ask about the Tuesday meetings?  The last Tuesday meeting was held at very short notice.  How was the decision to hold it made?  At the very outset, I asked that it would not be put in on a Tuesday as many of our colleagues are in difficulties.  Thursday was always the day that was assigned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01300"><p>We published a work programme and it is on that.  Was it not on it earlier?  I thought last Tuesday's meeting was well notified.</p></speech>

We will hold over the correspondence in connection with Lazard until the next meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01800"><p>Just to comment on it, this is tactics.  Lazard is a professional adviser to NAMA.  The latter owns the information.  It solicited it, asked questions and got answers.  We have to consider those answers and questions as part of our report.  My answer is "No".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B01900"><p>Deputy MacSharry is suggesting that we pursue NAMA on making sure we have all the information we request.</p></speech>

We are only considering it in the context of it being in the ownership of NAMA.  We are not judging Lazard on its advice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#B02100"><p>Fine.  We will return to that at the next meeting because fair points have been raised this morning.</p> <p>  The next item is 113B, correspondence received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform informing the committee of the appointment of Commissioner John McMahon as chairman and accounting officer of the Office of Public Works.  I take this opportunity to thank the outgoing chairperson, Ms Clare McGrath, for all the work she has done for the OPW and wish her the very best for the future.  We will note the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is 102C, an e-mail from Deputy Cullinane enclosing correspondence from Nua Healthcare on concerns about public sector tendering for a residential disability service.  We will hold that over until the Deputy is present at the next meeting.</p> <p>  Items 108C.1 to No. 108C.4, inclusive, constitute correspondence from an individual in reply to a letter issued by the committee following a discussion on the original submission made on behalf of that individual.  We had a detailed discussion on this a week or two ago.  He has requested other actions by the committee, including a meeting with the individual.  I propose that we write to the individual confirming that the committee does not intend to take any further action and that any further correspondence will be held on file but not discussed by the meeting.  It is the issue we discussed at length and he has written back again.  We will hold future correspondence on file.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and reports of accounts from public bodies received since the last meeting.  There are only a couple on this list today.  The list is coming up on screen for members.  The first item concerns the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's clean audit report and the second concerns St. Angela's College, Sligo, which provides home economic teacher education and nursing and health studies.  Attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  The same remark is there for many third level institutions.</p> <p>  The final item relates to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, which quality assures providers of further and higher education and training.</p><p>There was a clear audit report there.</p><p> We now move on to the work programme of the committee, the draft of which was circulated to members.  Today's meeting will hear from officials of the Department of Social Protection.  Next Tuesday, 25 October, a number of NAMA officials will come before us, possibly accompanied by former officials of the agency.  The attendance list is not yet finalised.  That meeting will commence at 10 a.m.  We then have a gap because the D&aacute;il is not sitting the following week.  The next meeting will be on Thursday, 10 November.</p></speech>

I have that down in my diary.</p></speech>

The meeting was intended to take place next Wednesday, 26 October, but Mr. McGuinness will be out of the country at that time.  The meeting was rearranged to accommodate his schedule.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#C00400"><p>Is the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at 10 a.m. fixed?</p></speech>

My understanding on being appointed to the committee was that our meetings would be mostly on Thursdays.  As well as next Tuesday's meeting, there is the engagement with Mr. McGuinness on a Wednesday in November.  Who made these decisions on the scheduling of meetings?  I am concerned because it is important to have as full an attendance as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#C00900"><p>The committee decided that in order to avoid interference with our normal Thursday workload, our deliberations on Project Eagle would require additional meetings.  Today, we are hearing from officials at the Department of Social Protection and last week we had witnesses from the Revenue Commissioners.  Continuing our regular work programme has necessitated having additional meetings on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  We never have more than two meetings per week.</p></speech>

Who decided it should be in the morning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#C01100"><p>We are not allowed to meet on Tuesday afternoons because the D&aacute;il is sitting.  That is one of the components of D&aacute;il reform.  I see the sense in having it Tuesday afternoon but the rules of the House require us to avoid meetings when the D&aacute;il is in plenary session.  That forces us to have the meeting in the morning.  However, as the Deputy will see from the work programme, that is the only Tuesday meeting schedule and there is only one Wednesday meeting on the list, which is the engagement with the deputy First Minister on 16 November.  As I said, the latter has been deferred in order to facilitate the witness.  Subsequent meetings are on Thursday, 17 November and Thursday, 24 November.</p></speech>

Some 60% of the expenditure in 2015 was funded by the Exchequer through the Vote for Social Protection, with 40% funded by social insurance contributions.  The annexe to the Appropriation Account provides an analysis of the total programme expenditure under the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund.  The total cost of administration of the programmes in 2015 was approximately &euro;584 million, or 3% of the programme spend.  The proportion spent on administration has remained relatively stable, averaging 2.9% over the past four years.</p><p>PRSI contributions are the main source of income for the Social Insurance Fund.  Since 2008, contributions received have been insufficient to meet the expenditure of the fund.  Initially, accumulated surpluses of the fund were used to fund the deficit but from 2010 the Exchequer met the shortfall.  The amount of subvention to the fund from the Vote has fallen, reducing from &euro;1.3 billion in 2013 to &euro;119 million in 2015.  The Social Insurance Fund is expected to record a surplus of contributions over expenditure amounting to &euro;200 million in 2016.</p><p> I have given a clear audit opinion on both the appropriation account of the Vote and the financial statements of the Social Insurance Fund for 2015.  However, I draw attention to the issues reported on in the chapters that are before the committee this morning.</p><p> Irregular welfare scheme payments arise where welfare recipients are paid amounts to which they are not entitled or which exceed their entitlements.  Such payments can arise as a result of deliberate fraud by claimants, from claimant errors or as a result of the manner in which claims are administered by departmental staff.  Fraud and error random sample surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where excess payments arise.  The results of those surveys suggest that there was a material level of payment in excess of entitlements in 2015 on both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund, and I have drawn attention to this in both audit certificates.</p><p> Chapter 9 of my report presents the results of the two most recent surveys completed at the end of July 2016 relating to farm assist and household benefits.  The farm assist survey estimated a level of payments in excess of entitlement of 10.4% of the total amount in payment, which was &euro;88 million in 2015.  The equivalent value of household benefits in excess of entitlements was 5.4% of the cost of benefits, which was &euro;221 million in 2015.</p><p> The chapter notes that the report on a family income supplement fraud and error survey had not been finalised, but I understand this is due for completion shortly.  A separate exercise will be carried out by my office later this year to review the Department&rsquo;s surveying methodology and to verify the rates.</p><p> Chapter 10 presents the results of the examination of the Department&rsquo;s project to develop and roll out the public services card.  At its inception, it was envisaged that the card would be used to access public services more securely, thereby helping to reduce the level of identity fraud.  However, no single business case document was produced for the public services card project.  I would have expected that a formal business case for a project of this kind would have set out, at a high level, all of the key information for the project, including scope, justification, funding required and project roles and responsibilities.  It would also have provided a plan for setting out how and when the project&rsquo;s benefits would be measured and who was responsible or accountable for their delivery.</p><p> The contract with the service provider commenced in 2009, with the intention to have 3 million public services cards issued by the end of 2013.  As of June this year, just over 2 million cards had been issued.  I understand that this has since risen to about 2.2 million cards.</p><p> Project delays led to a renegotiation of the contract on two occasions, namely, in 2012 and 2016.  The delays included identification of the need to update the Department&rsquo;s IT infrastructure; the project coinciding with an increase in demand for the Department's schemes; delay in receiving a technical specification for integrating the card with the integrated ticketing system from the Railway Procurement Agency; and the introduction of increased security features in the card.</p><p> Cost estimates for the card project prepared in 2012 provided only for the service provider's contract at &euro;19.8 million, excluding VAT.  This has increased by 16% to &euro;23.1 million, excluding VAT, as a result of increased security features and delays.  A substantial part of implementing the public services card project involves the Department&rsquo;s own staff.  The cost of those staff is projected to be an estimated &euro;28.8 million by the end of 2017.  The overall projected cost of the project is just under &euro;60 million, including VAT.</p><p> The Department did not set a target for the potential savings that could be achieved from the card, given the difficulties in assessing the extent of identity fraud.  Some &euro;2.5 million in estimated savings to the end of July 2016 have been attributed to the card since its introduction.</p><p> At the beginning of the project, it was envisaged that the card would be used by a wide range of public bodies to authenticate the identity of users of their services.  Wider use of the card required implementation of identity access management or IAM measures.  The Department launched the IAM system in February 2016, which is available to other public bodies to authenticate service users online based on the card.  Currently, the only services available online, using the card, are provided by the Department and relate mainly to jobseekers.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working on legislation for the regulation of data sharing between public bodies and to provide the necessary safeguards.</p></speech>

As well as examining the appropriation account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund statutory accounts for 2015, I understand the committee wishes to examine the two chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2015 on the regularity of social welfare payments and the roll-out of the public services card.</p> <p>  As requested, I provided the committee with an update on the two chapters, together with outturn figures for 2015, the Estimates for 2016 and the Department's annual report.  Overall, I hope these documents indicate the scale and scope of the Department&rsquo;s work.</p> <p>  The three key elements of the Department's business are: income support, activation of people of working age and the control of fraud and abuse.  A longstanding objective of the social welfare system in Ireland has been the provision of income supports.  This continues to be our primary objective.</p> <p>  Activation places a particular emphasis on measures to help long-term and young unemployed people find a route back to employment.  I am pleased to report that the redevelopment of Intreo service centres across the country has now been completed.  The development of Intreo, including active case management, plays an essential role in assisting many in their return to employment.  For example, this year's Intreo careers fair took place in Dublin Castle on Tuesday, 6 September.  Up to 3,000 jobseekers availed of the opportunity to meet employers across a range of sectors.  Leading employers in retail, wholesale, home care services, transport, recruitment, consultancy, construction and technology were represented.</p> <p>  In addition, the Department's second jobs week took place from Monday, 26 September to Friday, 30 September this year.  Every region in the country held various events which help jobseekers to become job ready.  Jobs Week is also an opportunity to promote awareness of the suite of services, supports and products provided by the Department for both jobseekers and employers, which have been broadened and enhanced through the development of the Department's Intreo services and brand.  This year, 150 events took place, some targeting jobseekers and some employers.  Employers with vacancies were recruiting at these events also.</p> <p>  It is worth pointing out again that the Department considers that the vast majority of people who are supported by the Department are exercising their legitimate rights and receiving their appropriate entitlements.  That being said, however, public confidence and trust in the welfare system requires us to be vigilant in both preventing and tackling fraudulent activity.  To this end, the Department is keenly aware of the importance of continuing to enhance the systems and methods it employs to address the risk of non-compliance across its schemes.  In early summer, we engaged in a number of control seminars with some 270 staff at which we discussed areas that should be reviewed.  Suggestions and issues raised will be considered in the further development of our control strategy.</p> <p>  Turning specifically to the chapters being examined today, the Department seeks to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is focused appropriately.  As I have outlined previously to the committee, fraud and error surveys are a key element of the Department&rsquo;s overall control strategy.  The surveys, which are a point-in-time measurement, identify areas of risk within schemes and the Department takes steps to address, ameliorate and eliminate the risks identified.</p><p>The surveys, which are a point-in-time measurement, identify areas of risk within schemes and the Department takes steps to address, ameliorate and eliminate the risks identified.  The results of fraud-and-error surveys are used to focus the Department&rsquo;s control activity where it is most likely to be effective.  Chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report looks at fraud-and-error surveys completed in previous years and, in particular, comments on the two most recently completed surveys, on farm assist and household benefits.  While no specific recommendations have been made in this chapter, I understand a separate exercise will be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General to review methodology and verify figures later this year.  We will continue to work with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office to ensure that the surveys continue to meet the highest standards in terms of methodology and reporting of results.</p><p> The Department has agreed a schedule of surveys up to mid-2019 with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office.  This schedule commits the Department to doing an average of three surveys per year, which is challenging as each survey raises unique issues.  A recommendation previously made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, in the 2014 chapter on regularity of social welfare payments, referred to a need to strengthen our capacity to carry our medical control reviews.  I am happy to report that the Department has successfully appointed new medical practitioners as medical assessors and currently has 27.5 full-time equivalents, including the chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer.  A number of additional appointments are currently in train and, as a result, this number is expected to rise to over 29 full-time equivalents by January 2017.  A further recruitment campaign will take place in November to ensure a panel is available to fill any vacancies arising in 2017 and to maintain these numbers.</p><p> Chapter 10 of the 2015 report refers to the roll-out of the public services card, PSC. The PSC is an important strand in modernising public service delivery and seeks to standardise and simplify how our public services are accessed.  When a person registers through a secure registration process that provides a substantial level of assurance in relation to his or her identity, he is considered to be registered to a standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, level-2 standard.  The PSC is a token of such registration.</p><p> The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector, such as my Department&rsquo;s free travel pass and the social services card, and to make it easier for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers in person and online.  The PSC is now a requirement for first-time adult passport applicants in the State and for Irish citizenship.  From the end of the year and beginning of next year, SAFE registration will be required by Revenue for first-time applicants for tax credits.</p><p> In terms of the roll-out of this project, some delays did occur, most notably around the time that the recession hit when, understandably, the Department had to prioritise other developments to deal with the demands that emerged at that time.  However, the processes and the product itself have been considerably improved as a consequence.  The PSC helps to safeguard the identity of individuals in that it makes it extremely difficult for others to commit identity fraud by stealing a person&rsquo;s identity for the purpose o dealing with the public service.  As a result, the PSC is, and will be, a key asset in the deterrence of identity fraud.  Given the innovative nature of the project and the fact that there were not any ready references for comparison purposes, it was not possible in the early stages to determine precise costs and staffing requirements.  It was not possible to estimate properly any cost until market testing via the procurement process had been completed in 2009.  Staffing requirements could only be determined once the processes for registration and quality assurance had been designed and tested.  This was completed in 2011.</p><p> To date, the Department has recorded &euro;2.585 million in SAFE-related savings.  It should be noted that these savings relate to the cases where the Department actually caught a person using a false identity.  The Department cannot assess the actual savings that have been made in cases where a person signed off or claimed he or she no longer needed social assistance or a benefit instead of going through the SAFE registration process.</p><p> With over 2.2 million PSCs issued to date, my Department expects that the target of 3 million cards will be met by the end of 2017 and that the project will continue to provide considerable value to all individuals and public bodies for years to come.</p><p> The work of the Department in safeguarding the data underpinning the PSC and all other data relating to individuals who interact with us for income support and services is a critical element of our operations.  Given the scale of its operations, the Department is one of the most significant data controllers in the State.  I can assure the committee that the Department takes its responsibilities in relation to data protection extremely seriously and works closely with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that the highest standards continue to be applied in this regard.</p><p> I acknowledge the support of staff and colleagues and express my appreciation for their endeavours.  The staff of the Department deal with many demanding challenges, across many schemes, programmes and projects.  Please be assured that in delivering on our obligations, we are very conscious of our duties to our customers, the taxpayer and, of course, the Oireachtas.  I am very happy to discuss any issues raised by the committee.</p></speech>

This will help to ensure everybody gets a fair chance within a reasonable period.  Both the clerk and I will be keeping a close watch on the time and I will tell members when they have one minute remaining.  If members have a further round of questions, they will be able to ask them on a second occasion.  I ask for co-operation in this regard.  Our lead speaker today is Deputy Peter Burke, who is to be followed by Deputy Catherine Connolly.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department is a major spending Department.  I wish to focus on a few of the areas that the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to.  When one adopts a sense of materiality within the whole Department, some areas can seem more concerning than they actually are.  I fully appreciate that in terms of carrying out audits.</p> <p>  I understand that 1.6 million people receive a payment each week from the Department.  Therefore, the scale is huge.  The Department introduced a new debt-receipts accounting system in November 2014.  Could Ms O'Donoghue confirm the cost of the system introduced?  Who provided the system and how much internal resources were put in place to ensure it could go live and run effectively?</p></speech>

On the internal cost, the arrangement effectively involved a combination of staff within our control division and staff within our IS services who would have been involved in working with the consultant contractors to develop the system and implement it.  I do not have a precise cost for the Deputy but we can work it out for him.</p></speech>

As with any of our systems, there are ongoing checks, including management checks.  This is to make sure the system is recording the information accurately.  We have been able to deal with the identification of overpayments and put the recovery of those overpayments in process far more quickly since the introduction of the system than we were able to do previously.  Previously, it would have been a quite manual process.  Effectively, the new system, since full implementation, is now allowing us to recover approximately &euro;7 million per month.  This means that, for the people involved, there is very speedy identification of where a problem has occurred.  It means there is no time lag creating additional difficulty for individuals concerned.</p> <p>  With the new legislation that we received a couple of years ago, the level at which we are able to recover overpayments has increased.  Our deciding officers have been given increased scope to recover an overpayment quickly, which, again, has improved our ability to redress problems in a much more speedy fashion.</p></speech>

From reading the report, there seems to be a difference in the calculation.  Will Ms O'Donoghue comment on this?  How has the difference come about?  I understood it was because of a difference in cash balances in a particular Intreo office and that the cash balance was different per system.  There was supposed to be a per system figure of &euro;122,000 in the office, but it was only &euro;68,000.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We are working to reconcile the reports across a number of our systems, including the accounting system and the debt recovery system.  Local offices, Intreo offices, complete reports on a monthly basis on the amounts of cash held by them.  There was a discrepancy of about &euro;54,000 at the end of December; they showed a cash on hand figure of &euro;68,000 compared to the accounting system which showed a cash on hand figure of &euro;122,000.  There is a difference of somewhere in the order of &euro;50,000.  We are working to identify the reason.  It is about the transition from the old to the new system and reconciling information from two accounting systems.</p></speech>

We have a very large number of staff, a large number of whom are operating on the front line.  The number of staff absences in the Department is probably one of the highest in the Civil Service.  Payroll overpayments are primarily due to absences due to sick leave.  The build-up of overpayments has occurred in large measure because of the changes in sick leave pay policy and time lags in reporting absences and a return to work.  This has caused problems.  Sometimes the payroll can be run before a notification hits the system that somebody is absent.  This is a critical issue for us.  An assistant secretary from my Department is leading an interdepartmental working group which is working with PeoplePoint to identify the underlying causes and take mitigating action.</p></speech>

It also lies with the operation of the shared services system in processing information.  There have been difficulties and time lags in the reporting and interaction of information on sick leave and pay.  As it is now a much more complex environment, there are many more complex checks that have to be carried out before a payroll instruction can be issued by the shared services division.  That can mean somebody being paid when he or she is not entitled to be paid and the issue is only dealt with in arrears.  There is shared ownership in taking action at Department level and in the shared services division.</p></speech>

The working group has been working to identify exactly how it occurred and see what can be done at all levels by all stakeholders to improve the processes involved and their reaction to these issues.</p><p>When one goes to a shared services environment, these things happen until the teething problems have been ironed out.</p></speech>

Does it concern Ms O'Donoghue that over 53% of her staff have no recovery plans for overpayments from the Department?  Is she concerned about how that might look to the public?</p></speech>

We work closely with PeoplePoint, the shared services environment, to ensure as much co-operation as possible in putting the arrangements in place.  PeoplePoint is doing this, rather than the Department.  There are a very small number of cases which the Department might have flagged as having particular circumstances, such as ill health, where greater sensitivity was required for a recovery plan but in all cases the Department would fully support PeoplePoint.</p></speech>

Clients are asked to put a repayment plan in place or face significant consequences but the cumulative figure has increased to 53% for staff within the Department who have been overpaid and who do not have recovery plans in place.  The example the Department is setting to clients is a huge concern for me.  Those clients are working in challenging and sensitive conditions and sometimes are not aware of certain things but they are required to meet overpayments.  I accept that they have to be dealt with appropriately but the Department must lead from the front in this regard and a cumulative figure that suggests it is not being dealt with sends out the wrong message.</p></speech>

We have been working with the shared services centre to ensure that as many issues as possible are dealt with to ensure recovery plans can be put in place as quickly as possible.

We have been facilitated in doing that through the new system we have put in place but the recovery of overpayments from staff when they have occurred through PeoplePoint is a responsibility for the latter to manage.  We have been working closely to ensure that how it is handled is improving and will continue to do so, precisely because of concern over the signal effect.</p></speech>

The latter meant that we redeveloped our business model and our entire public office offering.  We introduced new Intreo centres and have been involved in a very significant period of organisational change.  We have been trying to develop the tagging system for fixed assets and in 2015 we carried out inventories of 42 of the Department's locations, with a further inventorising programme taking place this year.  We expect to make significant inroads into this issue in the next year or so.</p></speech>

It is a little misleading to speak of 42 offices out of 450 because the figure probably covers a large proportion of the Department's stock.</p></speech>

As with any head of any organisation, if I had more staff I could do more but within the numbers the Government has approved for us we have to prioritise our activities across our core functions and our control activity to ensure we deliver the best service we can and take advantage of as much business efficiency technology and automation as we can to get best value for the staff we have.</p></speech>

I found the report at the end of 2015 very interesting.  Social Justice Ireland has pointed out that, in 2014, in the absence of social welfare benefits half of the Irish population would have been living in poverty so the Department has a very onerous task on its hands in respect of equality.  I agree with my colleague that the Department has a huge budget, at more than &euro;19 billion, and mistakes will obviously occur.</p><p>I will come back to those mistakes because they were not mentioned in the opening statement.  However, fraud is mentioned.  Recently, the <i>Connacht Tribune</i>published a headline &quot;War on Social Welfare&quot; in Galway.  The story stated there was a crackdown on fraudsters with Revenue and social welfare officials and garda&iacute; out on the streets of Galway.  The Department's policy document and Ms O'Donoghue's opening contribution state that the vast majority of recipients are not cheaters.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Obviously, departmental officials are not responsible for them but the reporters are basing them on what they heard from Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  Garda&iacute; are on the streets of Galway stopping cars.  The report says they are stopping 4X4s because of cheaters.  That is an unhelpful message and I might come back to it later.</p> <p>  The roll-out of the public services card seems to have been an unmitigated disaster and I choose those words reluctantly.  Following expenditure of &euro;60 million, everybody still does not have a card.  Is that correct?  A total of 3 million cards were to be rolled out by 2013 but, in 2016, 2.2 million have issued.  That is a huge problem.  Ms O'Donoghue has given reasons-----</p></speech>

The Government made decisions at that point that this was worth pursuing.  The Department went to the market in 2009 in the first phase of the development to ascertain whether the market could respond and give us what we were looking for in terms of a secure identity card, which could be used for accessing public services based on the information we hold in our client identity services, and a registration process that had yet to be designed</p></speech>

It was highlighted that the Department did not have a business plan, did not assess the risk, and did not assess the competency of the contractor to roll this out.  Why was the project not re-tendered when all these problems emerged?  Was that ever considered?</p></speech>

We did not have a single document business plan.  We have provided all sorts of documentation, which the Comptroller and Auditor acknowledged in his report, and it contains most of the elements that would have been contained in a single business plan.  However, it is fair to say it is not in a single document.</p> <p>  The point I was making about the history is incredibly important because in terms of risk and what might happen, few people in 2009 would necessarily have been able to foresee exactly what would happen over the following three to four years in terms of the general environment in society and, most particularly, its impact on the Department.  That is quite apart from the project itself.  In the first place, when we signed the contract in 2009, we envisaged absolutely that we would focus on this as a priority project over the following couple of years and would roll out public services cards but, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, our baseline activity changed out of proportion to anything we experienced previously.  As a consequence, we had to prioritise providing income support service people over and above anything else we were doing.  Additionally in 2010, the Government made a decision we would not have been privy to in 2009 to change the entire institutional infrastructure of the Department in respect of how we dealt with people of working age.  We were required to integrate staff from the community welfare service and the employment services of F&Aacute;S and build a new business model and offering.  This was an enormous organisational programme change that we could not have foreseen in 2009.</p> <p>  With regard to the project itself, there were difficulties.  The company involved had to build a plant to effect production and, therefore, that phase of the project to see whether it could produce a card within time came on board.  Our expectation was that in the initial stages, priority would be effected to giving the card to those entitled to free travel.  That was to be the first offering because we wanted to replace the free travel card.  As it happened, despite the goodwill and effort of ourselves and the National Transport Authority, NTA, there were delays in developing the infrastructure for the Leap card and so on, which meant the NTA was unable to integrate with our card.  There were all these reasons-----</p></speech>

It was also possible that this would have been contracted out to another tenderer if we had felt that was appropriate.  However, when we got into full production of the card and put the infrastructure in place to register people, the production volumes we managed to deliver were very much in keeping with what we envisaged in the original plan for the card.  Over a three to four-year timespan, we will have issued 3 million cards, which was our intention in 2009 but for the things that overcame us.</p></speech>

The value of the card is its use across the wider public service, and we have now built the infrastructure, which the Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned, to use the identity set in an online setting, which is an increased attraction across other public service offerings.  This was not envisaged in 2005.  The card has been a cornerstone of the public service reform plan and the Civil Service renewal plan.  It has been adopted as a specific whole-of-government project by the Civil Service management board.  A new cross-departmental committee has been put in place, which is all about designing the expansion of the use of the card to others.</p><p>I mentioned the fact that Revenue will use the card in the context of registrants for tax and that the Passport Office is now using the card in the context of applicants for passports.  We are in discussions with the Road Safety Authority in terms of driver licensing and vehicle registration.  All of those give me confidence that we will achieve the 3 million cards.</p></speech>

This was a requirement from the Data Protection Commissioner at the time, which we adhered to.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the benefits analysis.  The critical point about benefits is that this is a whole-of-Government project.  The benefits will be realised across the public service.  The Department is not in a position to identify the benefits across the public service because most of the benefits are small.  It is about people having to repeat an identification verification process in their transactions with every public service provider.  They are small in individual item but they build up.  It is hard for us to articulate that.</p></speech>

Error is not mentioned in that statement.</p></speech>

That is not mentioned in the opening statement.  Second, and this is important, the Department has a very important role in policy that it did not mention in the opening statement.  To go back to the document, I see one of the Department's roles as being to formulate appropriate social protection and social inclusion policies.  The Department's policy role is very important given the role of social welfare in keeping most of our citizens out of poverty.  It is significant that Ms O'Donoghue left that out of her opening statement, and she is zoning in on three areas.  Obviously, the support for people is very important, but the control of fraud and abuse, as opposed to the Department's policy role and the errors made by the Department, is very important.  I ask Ms O'Donoghue to reflect on that.</p></speech>

We operate a range of public offices, so we will have people come into offices and, unfortunately, have accidents such as slipping on steps, falling ill or whatever.  Personal injuries claims could arise in that regard.  There are a range of different aspects, both in terms of personal property, medical expenses and personal injuries.</p></speech>

Nothing irks the average taxpayer more than welfare fraud or benefits fraud as they call it in the UK.  It is a real scourge that is difficult to police.  Ms O'Donoghue referred to the savings that have been made from the detection of fraud.  When clients commit fraud and are caught are they put on a naughty list or blacklisted?  How does the Department keep checks and balances on the behaviour of offenders into the future?  I take into account that people redeem themselves and try to become law abiding citizens.  What does the Department do to ensure compliance with the law?</p></speech>

That has no bearing on their entitlement at any moment in time. </p></speech>

In many instances the recovery could be over a long period so that a recovery of funds for something that happened some years ago might be taking place now.  We would risk assess clients.  We have an investigation process that is based on the risk assessment but the critical point is that if somebody establishes an entitlement at a moment in time he or she has that entitlement.</p></speech>

Two years ago 20 garda&iacute; were seconded to the Department of Social Protection to work in our special investigation unit.  Their primary function is to detect social welfare fraud.  They are an integral part of the unit and work with other officers in the unit.  They work on joint investigations with Revenue or with the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  They also assist in fraud investigation.  A key priority of a joint operation is the shadow or hidden economy.</p> <p>  On the question of the value they have brought to the Department, it is two-fold, in addition to their powers under the social welfare Acts they have powers under the Garda Acts so we benefit from quicker investigation and detection of cases, more enhanced powers of investigation, transfer of knowledge skills and best practice.  That means we can get more speedy access to the system of prosecution for serious cases than we would otherwise have been been able to do.  This is quite apart from the normal savings that they would generate.</p></speech>

There is an increase in the numbers presenting and the type of interaction we have now is different from the interaction we would have had previously because not alone are we providing income support but we are also trying to assist people through activation services into employment.  One is dealing with people who can often be in very difficult circumstances.  That is stressful.  Obviously many of our staff work on the front line.  We have a high proportion of staff who are absent on stress relative to other Departments.  It is the nature of the activity in which they are involved.</p></speech>

We have quite an extensive range of training supports, an employee assistance service and we regularly try to look to see what other innovations can be introduced in order to try to support staff both through their own training or local management support in terms of dealing with the circumstances they face.</p> <p>  In respect of the areas that face particular challenges, there is no doubt that as the live register reduces, obviously we have fewer people of working age presenting to the Department looking for working age supports, however, we are seeing some pressures in the sections dealing with in-work supports because as more people go into employment we have many more people availing of in-work supports.  Equally in the whole illness related schemes - illness benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance - undoubtedly we have experienced quite a lot of pressure.  That is something we are working through and trying to improve.</p></speech>

In fairness, the fraud elements would not be very high.  In fact the overall figure for the scheme is not high, but it is higher because of the medical component.

There is a range of issues.  People in the Department have to have access to data in order to carry out their business.  If somebody presents, obviously the data is captured and that has to be captured in the systems.  They must have systems access in order to carry out their business.  We try to ensure that people only access the cases in which they are directly involved.  Obviously if people access things in which they are not involved, that is a problem.  We deal with it.  We have a range of different procedures.  We have an ongoing annual statement that staff are invited to sign indicating that they are aware of their obligations and aware of the practices and protocols around accessing data.</p><p>There is an ongoing range of presentations to staff around the country.  There are all kinds of different communication initiatives.  We have a data protection awareness week that is carried out and highlighted.  We have a high-level working group in place.  We have a constant programme of meetings with the Data Protection Commissioner to avail of best practice knowledge and apply that knowledge back in to the Department.</p><p> It is about awareness raising in the first instance.  Of the data protection breaches that come to our attention, the vast majority of them would be accidental breaches.

There is an actuarial review about to be commenced, I think, at the end of this year.  At the begin of 2017, we are required to commence it.  Previous actuarial reviews would have highlighted a difficulty, because of the demographic profile, the ageing population, the demands from pensions, in particular, on the State pension, that if there were not changes made to either entitlement or the provisioning of the fund, we would have problems into the future.  In the longer term, that would be a difficulty, and I would not expect the next actuarial review to make findings that are too much different from that.</p> <p>  There have been steps taken over the past number of years, particularly in the context of pension entitlements.  The age at which somebody is entitled to old age pension has been increased.  There is a programme of further increase in 2021 and 2028 which was signalled many years ago.  The eligibility conditions to allow one access State pension have also been changed.  All of those are with a view to tightening up on the entitlement side.  The provisioning is another side, which is the rates at which workers pay PRSI.  The viability of the fund and its ability to operate in the longer term is really a question of the balance between the two, the demand and supply aspect.</p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, the Government will be part of the European response.  At present, the UK remains a member of the EU and all of the existing entitlements continue to be in place.  The Department is participating in all of the different working groups at Government level with a view to inputting and trying to assess what the possible implications of Brexit might be, but all of that will dependent on what is negotiated.</p></speech>

It has been an interesting morning hearing about the vast scope of work for which her Department is responsible and the significant impact it has on the country.  In Ms O'Donoghue's opening statement, she spoke of the functions of the Department.  Naturally, most associate the Department with income support but Ms O'Donoghue went on to speak about, in particular, the activation of those of working age and the Department's role in that respect.  Briefly, I will touch on that.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue spoke about the second jobs week that was held in September of this year and the fact that it was held in every region.  I ask her to speak about the success of earlier events and the direct correlation between those coming off the live register and the schemes and events the Department runs.  I ask that Ms O'Donoghue speak about the areas, by geographical region, age group and black spots, that remain a worry for her as well.</p></speech>

The institutional reform I referred to earlier, in terms of bringing together the activation services with the income support services, has meant that kind of seamless engagement with people which has allowed us to tailor the supports that we offer, to profile people in terms of their own ability to exit from the live register or to identify those who might need greater help and assistance.</p></speech>

We will register such individuals for a public service card, we will capture their educational and work history, that is, the kind of skills and expertise that they may or may not have, and on the basis of that information we will calculate a score which is related to what is called the probability of exit, a PEX score.  The PEX score can be high, medium or low, but the critical point is that the score will determine the intensity of engagement that we have with that individual over the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>  All who come in to register with us will be invited to a group information session where they will be given all kinds of information in regard to their entitlements, but also the kind of supports and schemes that might be available to them.  For those who have a low PEX score who are deemed to be in most need of support, within a very short space of time they will be scheduled for a one-to-one engagement with a case officer and they will develop with the case officer a personal progression plan, which will involve them looking at addressing some of the skills deficits or basic needs that they might have, or looking at whether other education or training might be beneficial, and then referring to that.</p></speech>

Youth unemployment relative to general unemployment is higher.  It is about twice the rate of general unemployment, but if one looks, whether across time or across Europe, the rate of youth unemployment has halved from the worst point of the recession.

General unemployment has come down from approximately 15% to 8% or 9%.</p> <p>  Where are we most concerned still is with older people over 50 who are long-term unemployed, the very long-term unemployed who are unemployed for over five years who have now established very considerable distance from the labour market and who are maybe more vulnerable and in need of greater attention, and those who do not have a residual skill, as in they did not come from a skilled background into unemployment and are starting from scratch.</p> <p>  In terms of what has progressed over the past years, probably contrary to expectations arising from previous exits from recession, the general long-term unemployed numbers have come down much quick than has been the previous experience, youth unemployment figures have come down in the way in which I have said and the transition from short-term, if someone went into short-term unemployment, to long-term unemployment has reduced as well.  Those indicators have been very positive in this context compared to previous economic upswings.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is something that is now being tackled through the regional Action Plan on Jobs.  At local level we are working very closely with both the agencies that are involved in terms of attracting industry and with the local employment offices at county council level to try to address that.

One is looking at trying to build new skills or to enhance skills.  We feed information in through the ETBs and there is constant engagement with SOLAS to identify different training programmes and skills-building programmes to put in place in various areas.  There have also been tremendous successes.  One can look at some of the clusters of industry, for example, the biopharma cluster in the midlands where there has been very close interaction between our offices and the industry as a whole.  There has been huge success in terms of moving people from unemployment into those sectors where they previously would not have had experience.  We work with the employers to provide the skills to ensure people are equipped to take up the jobs in the sector.</p></speech>

Ms O'Donoghue referred in her opening statement to the Department's vigilance in tackling fraudulent activity and the importance of enhancing systems to address it.

First, the Department receives a lot of data from other organisations and cross-matches data with other organisations with a view to ensuring that people have the proper entitlements.  For example, we have regular nightly feeds from Revenue in relation to the commencement of employment data to make sure that where people are legitimately working that they are not also receiving a social welfare payment to which they are not entitled.  Data matching is a huge piece of that control activity for us.  In addition, we have, all told, somewhere in the region of 1,100 staff working in control activity from inspectors to the special investigation unit, SIU, to people working in control activity at different scheme levels, all focused on trying to ensure that we minimise problems that might otherwise occur.</p> <p>  I mentioned to Deputy Madigan that the focus of the SIU is very much on the shadow economy, identity fraud and things like that.

It is a small scheme involving approximately 8,000 recipients.</p><p>Only approximately 6% of farmers claim farm assist.  It is a tricky scheme, given that it is based on income at a point in time and unfortunately, as most people know, farming income fluctuates wildly and many of the elements that feed into income are unpredictable and variable.  Many of the issues with the scheme are around cases in which, on review, people's circumstances, such as their costs or income, had changed during the period in question and they had not necessarily advised us of it, and an overpayment or underpayment had arisen.</p></speech>

My point is many of the concerns or issues would have arisen because of the difficulties and the variables of the scheme.  In many other schemes, calculating the entitlements is more straightforward.  The variables in farm assist are often beyond the control of the individual and, on a year-on-year basis, people may not perceive that they need to notify us all the time when their circumstances change.  Unfortunately, this might give rise to overpayments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out an audit in 2014, so both the findings from this audit and those from our fraud and error survey have informed a fairly significant change in practice in terms of the documentation we use and the review processes we have in place and how we capture information.  We have worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to get more sensitised information so we better understand the nature of the particular type of farming and what the expectations are.</p></speech>

The vast bulk of my questions have been well covered by my colleagues.  My recollection was that in 2012, the previous Government changed policy on the treatment of those most commonly known as the stay-at-home child care providers, primarily stay-at-home mums.  The practice has been in existence for decades, and I refer specifically to those who were forced, either through custom and practice within the public sector or the private sector through agreements, to leave employment when they married.  I have had extreme difficulty, as other Deputies have had, in determining the number of people - primarily, although not exclusively, women - affected in the public sector and in some private sector organisations that mimicked what I believe was a requirement rather than a legislative provision in certain areas of the public sector.  I would like to determine some figures and get some information.  I do not expect all the answers, given that I am putting Ms O'Donoghue on the spot.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may wish to chime in if he has an answer in any areas.</p> <p>  When did the practice commence?  When did it cease?  I believe it was 2012, but I am asking it in terms of the Department of Social Protection's recognition and ability to give such a person a full contributory old-age pension despite the fact that the person did not have the required stamps because she was at home.  What numbers are involved?  Would the Department care to estimate, based on the numbers involved, the total cost to the Exchequer to deal with such individuals who are currently excluded and receiving only a percentage of their State pensions?  The only people who have come to me about the matter over the years have been pensioners, including somebody only yesterday.  It is very important that I try to quantify the figure.  I have asked others in the Department and I have been unable to get the figure.  I seek the total number, the estimation of the cost of a policy change to give them full entitlements and the impact of pension increases to be introduced, of which they are to receive only a percentage, as Deputy Shane Cassells mentioned a few minutes ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016102000002#N01300"><p>To tie back to some of my earlier comments, during recent years some decisions have been made on trying to improve the sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.  Some of those decisions were signalled a long time ago while others were taken more recently.  I presume the Deputy is talking primarily from the changing contributions from 260 to 520.  Changes were made to the bands of entitlement, depending on the individual's contribution history.  These changes were implemented during recent years, albeit they were signalled some time ago.</p> <p>  We are talking about accessing the contributory pension.  For a contributory pension, the thinking at the time was that the number of contributions required, 260 over the course of a lifetime of work, was relatively low compared with international experience.  This was part of the thinking that went in.  Although home-maker credits were put in place, there are issues in this regard.  The Department has signalled that it is looking at reviewing the entire suite of pension offerings, such as moving from a fixed number of contributions to a total contributions approach.  All the changes are enormously tricky.  There are winners and losers and it is very complex in terms of the interaction between people's State pensions and whatever private pensions they may or may not have provided for.  In all cases, the pension suite is underpinned by the non-contributory pension.  People who have no contribution history can qualify for a non-contributory pension and the rate of payment is not significantly different from that of the contributory pension.</p></speech>

In many cases, these individuals, who are primarily women, were completely unaware that they were going to find themselves in this position later in life when they needed State support.

I know some people are reluctant to have a public service card in existence.  I think it is daft that we do not have such a card.  We are very happy for banks, mortgage providers and the Department of Social Protection to have all our information.  Some people are opposed to the production by the State of a national identity card that contains all of our information.  I cannot understand that logic.  I would like to get the perspective of the Department.  It is clear from the documentation provided for this meeting that there has been an escalation in costs.  Difficulties have been encountered with the production of cards.  The deadline for the production and issuing of 3 million cards has been missed and just 2.23 million cards have been produced to date.  Reference has been made to an additional &euro;60 million.  The issues with the computer systems have been documented.  I think the precise reference was to "technology".  Will that be an ongoing issue as efforts are made to get out the full allocation of cards, or is it a one-off cost associated with upgrading existing technologies within the Department?</p></speech>

The actual cost increase is very small.  According to our projection for what the 2017 figure will be compared to what we set out, there will be a cost increase of &euro;3 million.  I absolutely accept that the cost of registering and delivering the card to individuals was not included in the initial cost.  If that cost is added on, it brings the entire cost up to &euro;60 million.  Contrary to what has been portrayed, it is not a cost increase of &euro;24 million or &euro;27 million.  The cost of the actual contract has increased by &euro;3 million or so.  There are specific reasons for that.  There have been delays in reconfiguring the production contract.  I referred earlier to all the things that delayed the project in taking a foothold.  Obviously, we had to reconfigure the financials with the provider.  We also had to pay for some enhancements to the card to deliver certain variants and to take account of other users, for example by integrating it with the Leap card, etc.  It costs more to build in additional functionality under the card.  The Government has accepted that it has always been our ambition to ensure the card itself is a relatively simple product, albeit an extremely secure one.  In other words, identity information but nothing else is contained in the card.</p></speech>

It is not that the card itself holds a whole data bank with respect to one's social welfare or health history.  It is simply a confirmation and a verification of one's identity.</p></speech>

The computer configuration that had to take place in the Department went way beyond the actual card production.  We had to redevelop our entire business in 2011-12 to take account of a range of additional businesses that the Government asked us to take on.  We then had to change the fundamentals of the computer infrastructure we rely on.  That once-off investment was not attributed to the card per se.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department faces the ongoing cost of having registration centres in place.  The benefits of this approach from our perspective accrue not only from fraud savings but also from administrative efficiency and the improved customer experience.  It is hugely beneficial for customers to be able to use the same token to access a range of services across the public service.  Those benefits will increase.  We know from our engagement with other public service providers that the functionality of the card and the information on which it is based will increase dramatically in the years to come.</p></speech>

I would like to ask about the ability of the technology itself to move with the times.  Difficulties can arise when technologies become antiquated and unusable within five to ten years of being produced and have to be redone.  I hate the expression "future-proofing", but I assume some sort of future-proofing is built into the production of this card.   I ask Ms O'Donoghue to enlighten me in that regard.</p></speech>

People will be familiar with such features.  The chip is where the future is at.  The magnetic stripe is very much a symptom of the older technology used to access payments, etc.  In the course of the development of the card, we upgraded the magnetic stripe because the technology enabled us to do so.  This was one of the additional costs.  The most critical element of future-proofing relates to the use of the data that underpins the card to allow people to verify their identity when they are accessing online services.  It is future-proofed to that extent.  We have built the infrastructure to allow us to do that.  Hopefully that is future-proofing us, certainly for a while.</p></speech>

One was that we had to extend our original expectation that we would be in production and have produced the three million cards by the end of 2013.  For reasons relating to the producers of the card and take-up of that, we have had to extend the contract so we have had to revisit the financial aspects to take account of it to a very small extent.  We updated the magnetic stripe on the card so that imposed an additional cost.  Due to the fact that we wanted the card to be used as a seamless token in integrated ticketing, we paid for an additional development to allow Leap card functionality to be built into the card.  We have also done similar work in terms of making the card ready to be used as a European residence permit so we have a public service card variant that is available for us in that context.  Again, certain functionality has been built into the card so we had to pay for that.  Those different things were taken together with the activation costs I spoke about to Deputy Connolly where we were required by the Data Protection Commissioner to put in place a process to verify that the individual who registered received the card.</p></speech>

The original thinking for the development of the card came from an inter-departmental group in the first instance but because of the client base of the Department and the fact that we had a token in place with a social services card that we figured we needed to replace and also hold PPS end data and client identity data, we were the logical lead Department together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

In respect of the tendering process, the company had to build a plant.  I would have thought the capacity of the company would have been one of the key issues in awarding the tender.</p></speech>

It is a very secure card that is built to the highest international standards.  If my memory serves me right, the tender involved an Irish company based in Bray and input from a Dutch technology company which is a world expert in this kind of secure card provision.  The company in Bray had never physically produced these type of tokens before so it had to build the facility in Bray to do that, which it did.  That has also led to other benefits.  The company has had other Government business on the back of that investment it made.  I cannot remember what the Deputy-----</p></speech>

The critical thing is that what we have built now is a facility for the agency providing the service to be able to verify the person's identity even though they are in an online environment.  I will not say it is new technology but we are at the leading edge in terms of being able to do this.  The facility that is now being put in place would not have been there in 2005.</p></speech>

We came to a conclusion some time ago that the activation process did not add any value but in a context where we were renegotiating with the card provider about an extension to the end of 2017, it was not an element of the contract we were going to turn off until we had concluded those negotiations.  We have stopped that now.</p></speech>

Some of that is to take account of the points about obsolescence and emerging technology and  if we need to include something additional.  Another factor is that we were able to evaluate that.  Five years was too short because of the functions of the card.</p></speech>

I take the point made by Deputy Connolly.  I must say that it jars with me as well.  It is very difficult when one hears the narrative about people not being tax compliant.  It is called aggressive tax planning and there is talk of loopholes.  Even the Government refuses to take an appeal involving a large amount of money.  There is a presumption of honesty in respect of taxpayers while there is a narrative around fraud when it comes to social protection.  I completely accept that the Department has a function in making sure people get what they are entitled to and nothing more but that narrative is important and it is important that it is balanced when it is being talked about.</p> <p>  There have been a number of changes in how the Department works.  The community welfare officers used to be related to the HSE but are now within the Department.  They had a much wider function but the number of offices people can visit has been seriously reduced and is being further reduced.  This means that people are finding it more difficult, for example, their phone calls are not answered.  Has this been a cost saving exercise?  Since some of the offices have closed, I have noticed that I end up answering far more questions.  You get the questions anyway but I think the Department is taking face-to-face interaction with the public out of the system.  Is that saving money?  What is the point in doing that?  If there is no point, why would the Department do it?  </p></speech>

The changes that have taken place have been with a view to improving the service and trying to ensure greater consistency in service delivery.  If the Deputy is seeing things that are different, I would welcome hearing about that so we can look at it.</p><p>Certainly from what we have looked at, we have consolidated into Intreo service centres where we can, which means that we can offer an appointments based service and we can offer our clinics over a much more prolonged period of time than we would have been able to do when we were dispersing the same number of staff or a smaller number of staff to a whole range of different clinics throughout the country.</p><p> The functions of the officers in the community welfare service have not changed.  They still have a statutory power of discretion in relation to payments.</p></speech>

This transfer will have freed up departmental staff.</p></speech>

Rent supplement, when it was put in place, was always designed to be a short-term payment.  The problem with rent supplement, particularly in the last number of years, is that the numbers involved and the length of time they stayed on rent supplement went way beyond anybody's consideration.  The difficulty from a rent supplement point of view was that rent supplement was only payable to somebody who was unemployed.  If one was employed, one was not entitled to rent supplement.  The design of the housing assistance payment, HAP, was to try to break that link and effectively make a supplement available to people who are employed.  What has happened so far is that I think somewhere in the order of 12,000 or 13,000 people have moved to the housing assistance payment.  We still have about 50,000 people on rent supplement.  HAP will never replace rent supplement entirely.  However, in servicing, we are very much in this transition period as HAP is beginning to move up and we are working with the local authorities in terms of identifying people and moving them across.</p></speech>

We are talking about citizens - I have a problem with the Department's practice of calling them "customers" - and while there is co-operation, sometimes it is not at citizen level.  I am not sure it saves time or personnel because it eventually ends up being done.  That should be viewed as a comment because my time is short.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that there is a large number of staff available and I wonder how the Department is managing this.  We are talking about the experience of people who have contributed all their lives and face an inordinate delay getting something to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

We have taken a whole range of different measures including trying to improve the technology that is at play, providing additional staff into those areas, diverting staff into them or looking at process improvements.  I absolutely acknowledge that the area where we are under pressure is the illness-related schemes because of a number of different things, including the legal aspects that changed in accessing illness based schemes and also the need for the medical intervention, as I think I said in my opening statement.  We now have improved our own capacity at medical assessor level so we are managing these and trying to address them and bring the figures down.  They are not at the level I would like them to be at but in other instances where we have experienced those kinds of problems historically, we have been able to address them and bring the processing times down to what is a reasonable level, bearing in mind all the different things that have to be satisfied.  We will be working to continue that.</p></speech>

Before we move to a second round of questions, I will ask some questions.  If Ms O'Donoghue does not have the information I seek, I ask her to have it sent to the committee afterwards.  The Department does not have a social welfare office in some counties.  Will it provide a list of its social welfare offices?  The position is similar to the position of An Post, which has offices in certain locations and contractors who also have offices.  County Laois, where I live, does not have a social welfare office.</p></speech>

While I do not have an issue with the service provided, it is unusual that the Department does not have a direct public office in County Laois.</p> <p>  We heard that the ballpark cost for the public services card will be &euro;60 million.  Is &euro;20 a valid cost for a public services card?  When it commenced, did the Department think it would spend &euro;5, &euro;10 or &euro;50 per card?  Did it have any idea of how much it wanted to spend on each card?</p></speech>

I think that works out at something like &euro;8 or &euro;9 per card.  Obviously, the registration process adds to that.  The registration process is about verifying the individual who is sitting in front of one so, yes, I am very happy that if one is taking that once-off registration process, the entire cost of that intervention is &euro;20.  That is very good value for the State.</p></speech>

I think in terms of people who are in receipt of payments, we have pretty high percentages of cover across most of our schemes.  Bear in mind again that what we did was we focused on the scheme where it was easier for people to register.  To take our customer base, if one likes, the kind of areas which we are focusing on at the moment would be people who are in receipt of illness or disability payments and they are a little bit more difficult.</p></speech>

It is basically to add to the Department's ability to provide employment services.  A contract called JobPath was signed by the Government.  There are two providers.

The outturn of that will only be measurable over a period of time because there is a 12 month engagement, during which the individuals hopefully will be placed in employment and obviously the payments and so forth related to that.</p></speech>

According to the chief appeals officer's report, in 2015 approximately 25,000 appeals were finalised and favourable outcomes were 58% of the overall outcomes.  A significant proportion of those would also have been decisions that would have been referred back to a deciding officer, so more information would have been available to allow them.</p></speech>

There are 25,000 appeals, so that is approximately 1% of the entire range of decisions that go to appeal.  Looking within that, in a very significant proportion of the appeals the people making the appeal provide additional information which allows for a different decision to be made either by the deciding officer or the appeals officer.  However, we have put very strong links in place to try and learn so that if there are process problems or misinterpretation problems, that will be fed back into the Department.  We have what is called a decisions advisory officer in the Department which has a strong link with the appeals office, not on individual case level but to examine trends and practices and see what learning is available.  That can be fed back into the training regimes for our deciding officers.</p></speech>

The difficulty I have encountered is that when people reach 66 years of age and claim their State pension the exact amount of their contributions can rule them in or out for the contributory pension.  It is absolutely crucial that what the Revenue Commissioners collect tallies with the number of contributions people believe they should have because if it does not, they can lose their entitlement to the State contributory pension.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this subject in the last week or two and I received a letter in reply.  I am sure the question was withdrawn once I received a satisfactory letter.  However, the letter stated that the Revenue Commissioners collect PRSI on the Department's behalf but they can only collect it for a full year.  They cannot collect it for part of a year.  That means that in the year the person joins the scheme the Revenue Commissioners collect it for the full year, which is 52 weeks.  Let us say somebody is coming to their retirement birthday, it is their last year in the scheme and they might have two weeks or 48 weeks in the last year before they reach their birthday.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot collect that because it is not for a full year.  People can lose their entire entitlement to the State contributory pension because, as the Department told me in writing, the Revenue Commissioners can only collect PRSI for a full year, which is 52 contributions.  It specifically stated that they cannot collect it for part of a year.  I want a detailed note on that because people can lose their entire entitlement on this basis.  Do you understand my question?</p></speech>

There was an interesting conversation on that here today.  I wish to discuss two debts - one is amounts owed to the Department by various claimants under the Vote and the other is amounts due to the social insurance fund from employers in respect of redundancy and insolvency payments.  I never hear the same level of animation about chasing the debts under the redundancy and employers insolvency fund.  I will outline the figures so people will understand what I mean.</p><p>Of the Social Insurance Fund, the amount paid out in 2014 in respect of which the Department of Social Protection made a contribution as a result of insolvency or statutory redundancy was &euro;41 million.  The Department recovered &euro;8 million from employers, but it wrote off &euro;19 million.</p><p> We will turn to the Department's Vote in respect of people who have been in receipt of payments.  The detailed note on this matter is on page 34.  Ms O'Donoghue knows the figures well.  The Department deemed that there were overpayments for various reasons of &euro;88 million.  That is fine.  The Department recovered &euro;65 million, but it wrote off &euro;2 million.  The amount outstanding on that account is &euro;377 million and the amount outstanding on the Social Insurance Fund from employers is &euro;447 million.  The amount that the Department has written off for employers under the fund is far in excess of what it writes off on the other side.  Some companies have gone bust and we understand that there are reasons for the Department being unable to collect money, but there has never been the same level of chasing people on that side of the house as there has been on the other.  Every Deputy is hearing from people who have stopped getting &euro;30 per week or 15% of their payments.</p><p> I must be critical.  The Department of Social Protection is one of the best Departments, but the issue of debt recovery has caused difficulties.  We are hearing from people whom, after working for years and reaching State pension age, the Department has told they owe it &euro;7,000 for the previous 18 years over a jobseeker's allowance or adult dependant payment, for example.  The Department hits them when they reach pension age.  It checks all of that, but it did not give them an opportunity during their working lives to repay the money.</p><p> The Department is swift.  I admire that.  I will cite an example.  The Department makes an attachment order on some people's bank accounts if they have money in them.  It correctly sent a letter to a person who called to my clinic on a Wednesday because there had been an overpayment of &euro;29,000.  The Department wrote to his bank on the Wednesday saying how much was owed.  He had exhausted the full process and arrived in my office 36 hours later on Friday morning.  When I telephoned the person who wrote the letter, I was told that the Department had got the money from the man's bank account the previous night.  The Department was able to activate an attachment order within one working day.  Would it try to do this on the other side of the Social Insurance Fund?  Some of the people involved on that side will reappear as employers under someone else's name the following month.  How many attachment orders has the Department made in respect of the Social Insurance Fund versus the Vote and what were the amounts recovered?</p></speech>

The redundancy and insolvency payment scheme came to the Department in 2011.  It had a long tail of debt attached to it.  We have added to that considerably because of the number of redundancies and insolvencies in the intervening period.</p> <p>  Pursuant to an audit conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2013 or 2014, we undertook to engage in an extensive review of the debt that was on our books.  We have completed that exercise.  Our difficulty is that the majority of the debt is attached to insolvent companies, so we are not in a position to recover it.  We cannot write that debt off while the insolvency process is ongoing.  It may not be the answer that the Chairman wants to hear, but the number will decrease considerably in 2017 or 2018 because of the number of firms that will have exited or concluded the insolvency process and we will not be able to recover that debt.  At a best guess, some 90% of that figure is probably not recoverable.</p></speech>

According to a note on page 12, the Department wrote off &euro;36.7 million on 1 January 2015 because the opening balance was not correct.  I have a problem with this.  The previous year's figures, as presented to the Oireachtas, were overstated.  According to page 13, a further adjustment to the redundancy debt figure may be required upon the completion of the internal review in 2016.  Ms O'Donoghue signed the account for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Department is essentially saying that the balances outlined in the set of accounts before us are not real.  Does Ms O'Donoghue get my point?</p></speech>

The situation grows more unsatisfactory the more we discuss it.  Ms O'Donoghue is telling me that some of the poor people who, for example, have been in receipt of disability allowance have been subjected to attachment orders whereas no attachment order has been issued in respect of anyone under the redundancy and insolvency scheme.  There is a disparity in the Department's approach.  It seems to go after the little guy and not the big guy.  It is confirming this through its inaction in respect of the fund.  If the Department sought to get &euro;5,000 back from someone because of a years old overclaim of disability payment only to have that person tell it that there was an ongoing process and that the situation would be reviewed when it ended in five or six years' time, the Department would not wait.  It does, however, wait when a company says that a receivership or insolvency has been put in place.  Why does the Department not move aggressively and get its money first?  Has the Department the authority to made an attachment order on a company that is going through an insolvency process or is being managed by a receiver?</p></speech>

I did not even quibble.  She was right, and I have no argument with the process, but she went through the process with the punter and not with the company.</p> <p>  We will come to the Comptroller and Auditor General, but I want to ask Ms O'Donoghue one other question on this account.  If the account is not a valid one and will magically banish some of these figures, such as the &euro;500 million owed, that is an issue we as a Committee of Public Accounts must consider.</p> <p>  Another question I want to ask Ms O'Donoghue - we will discuss it with the Comptroller and Auditor General in a minute - concerns a passage in page 15 of the same account.  I refer to the investment account for 2015.  People will find this intriguing.  We will have to follow it up.  Essentially, up to 2015, when funds were available in the account, they were lodged with the Central Bank.  The middle sentence in the paragraph is clear when it states that all sums are now payable into the current account and that in total there were five settlement transactions in the investment account in 2015, including a payment of &euro;35,682 in respect of the European Central Bank negative interest rate for 2014.  What that says to me is that the Social Insurance Fund lodged money overnight or for a period with the Irish Central Bank and because it was paying a negative interest rate, the Department's investment fund lost &euro;35,682 by merely lodging money with the Central Bank.  It is exasperating from our point of view that State organisations lose money by placing it with another State organisation.  I know Ms O'Donoghue will say, and I presume from what I have just read, that the Department has moved away from the Central Bank and is putting its money in some bank that at least will not take money off it.  I know we are in a negative interest rate, but is my reading of the account correct?  It is an issue for the Central Bank separately and not the Department's problem.</p></speech>

Therefore, to be conservative, one provides for liabilities one thinks will happen.  With assets, the conservative approach is, unless one is fairly sure of getting them, to not recognise them.</p></speech>

I am serious.  Has she not considered trying to recover some of this money by putting that debt book up for sale?  I suggest to her that it must be an option because, from what is being said, anything that will be got this way will be more than what will be got if it is not done.  Then let us see how it gets on.  Will it be as lenient with these companies?  It is out of our hands, and we might have got some money in these hard-pressed times.  Could Ms O'Donoghue make an observation on that?  It sounds flippant but it is probably so far outside the box that maybe we need to look at it.</p></speech>

The amount we recover of an overpayment in a year does not necessarily refer to the debt that arose in that year because the majority of overpayments are recoverable over a period of time, so there is very little write-off of that individual debt.  As far as we are concerned, if somebody has a social welfare debt, going back to the case the Chairman mentioned, that will live with people right up to time.  The difficult we have in cases of company debt, where companies are going through an insolvency process, is that first of all, it takes a considerable time to do that.  We are preferred creditors, as I have clarified, but it is a different process in terms of our ability to recover that debt than from an individual.</p></speech>

The other element is overpayments, which is actual cash where we have a deciding officer who has said somebody has been overpaid on the basis of the evidence provided to the extent of whatever the amount is and that is an overpayment.

The scheme we put in place is a little different from that in operation in the UK specifically because we wanted to learn from what happened elsewhere.  We contracted with an advisory group to specifically give us advice on how the model for the scheme should be developed.  The purpose of this scheme was to increase our capacity to provide activation services for people.  The aim was to add to the case officer cadre within the Department and the network of local employment schemes, LES, and JobsPlus and so on, which continue to be in place.</p> <p>  JobPath is a results based payment to the companies involved, subject to adherence to minimum standards of service.  There are commercial agreements in place in respect of the payments.  In terms of the service, a client is referred for 12 months; guaranteed a baseline service, including a personal progression plan; and given intensive support and guidance to assist him or her in gaining sustainable employment.  The client retains his or her social welfare payment while on JobPath.  If there are to be any changes in social welfare entitlements those decisions are taken by Department officials rather than JobPath officials.  Once a client is referred into the programme, participation is mandatory.  The supports from the providers continue while the person is in work.  During the period of initial attachment to work clients can participate in other education and training while in JobPath.  It is in terms of these elements that our scheme differs from that of the UK.</p> <p>  There have been a small number of complaints from the two providers, but in the context of 60,000 referrals, which breaks down to 30,000 to each of the two providers, there were 42 complaints in relation to one of the providers and 77 complaints in respect of the other one.  Some of the complaints related to the client or customer's reluctance to engage in the process and others were complaints about data protection, the attitudes of the people they are dealing with and so on.  We work closely with the providers to try to address any complaint that is brought to our attention.  As I said, there are minimum levels of service required as part of the contract.  An independent survey of client experience is under way, the result of which are expected to be available by the end of this year.  Payment penalties can be applied if the results indicate poor customer service.</p></speech>

Because JobPath is relatively new there had been some timing issues as it was rolled out, whereby people have been referred perhaps to T&uacute;s or community employment, CE, or whatever other course, and at the same time have been part of a referral into JobPath and the issue arose as to which took precedence.  JobPath is about getting people into employment and that is the first priority of the Department's strategy in activation, namely, to try to move as many people into employment as we can, but there are protocols.  I think the problems that arose at the beginning have diminished and there are protocols in place in relation to how to handle situations as they arise when somebody finds themselves caught between two options.</p></speech>

Before beginning, I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones as they affect the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, is appearing before us today.  I am pleased to welcome him on my behalf and that of the committee and I thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to address us on developments in the agriculture sector.  I also welcome his officials, Mr. Dermot Ryan, Mr. Tom Tynan and Mr. Gerry Kiely, head of the European Commission representation in Ireland.  I wish Mr. Kiely well in his new post and thank Ms Barbara Nolan, who served in that post, for her assistance to previous committees.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time constraints and I understand that the meeting is to conclude at 11.45 a.m. in order for Mr. Hogan to address the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  There will be a ten or 15-minute break for the changeover between this and the next meeting.  During that changeover, both committees will have an opportunity for a photo-call outside the room.</p> <p>  The Commissioner is well aware of the privilege position through previous experience.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p> As the Commissioner is aware, this committee is only in its infancy.  As part of our work schedule, we have prioritised a number of issues.  Obviously since the general election and the formation of this committee, Brexit has become the biggest issue and is a key element of our work programme.  The second issue we have prioritised is the volatility in all agricultural sectors and the third is the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We look forward to hearing the Commissioner's views on these issues.</p><p> Before I call on the Commissioner to speak, I must ask members to be focused with their questions.  We have a limited timeframe so I will be giving each member the opportunity to ask one particular question and in that way we will get value for money from the Commissioner today.  I ask members to put one question to the Commissioner initially and if we have time, we can go back around a second time.</p><p> I now invite the Commissioner to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be here again.  Since my appointment as Commissioner, this is the second occasion on which I have been in the Irish Parliament.  I have visited 20 national parliaments on the instructions of the President of the European Commission.  Commissioners have been told to engage with public representatives and national parliaments and I am very pleased to do so.</p> <p>  This visit takes place at a time when trust in the institutions of the European Union is falling and criticism, some of it unfair, is being heaped on the EU.  We need a debate about how the EU can better communicate with the citizens in a way that emphasises the positive contribution that the European Union can make to their lives.  The Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, is one of those policies that makes an immense contribution to the lives of millions of farmers and other beneficiaries in every country in the EU.  Without it, what kind of food policy or agricultural production system would we have in Europe?  What kind of rural environment would we have and what kind of vitality would our rural communities enjoy?  How would we guarantee the food security of our 500 million citizens?  </p> <p>  Agriculture and the broader agrifood sector continues to be a very important economic mainstay for this country, particularly in rural areas where employment prospects are not always plentiful.  Recently, I made a visit to Greece where I met the Prime Minister to discuss how agriculture and rural development can make a telling contribution to the economic recovery of his country and how it can be managed and supported.  As an Irishman, I was pleased to be able to use this country as an example of how this can be achieved.</p> <p>  In his recent state of the Union address, President Juncker spoke of a Europe that preserves our way of life.  He identified a number of characteristics that epitomise this way of life, one of which is our agricultural sector.  He specifically committed the Commission to standing by our farmers, particularly when they are going through difficult times.  The European Commission's solidarity with farmers in every country in the EU is illustrated by the fact that we have mobilised &euro;1.5 billion to support our farmers during the recent period of market difficulty.  We did so without invoking the crisis reserve of &euro;433 million per annum.  Producers were hit with an unjustified trade ban imposed by Russia and many farmers, including in this country, were hit by falling milk prices resulting from many factors.  Pigmeat producers have also been through a very difficult time but the European Union has provided almost &euro;130 million in additional support for the sector.  This, of course, is in addition to the existing CAP budget of &euro;56 billion per annum that is spent every year to help farmers in every country of the EU.  </p> <p>  I know that for some the level of support provided by the Commission will never be enough.  However, when viewed against the backdrop of the enormous pressure on any budget, particularly the budget of the European Union, in terms of dealing with the migration crisis, I believe that any reasonable observer would have to acknowledge that the Commission has honoured President Juncker's pledge to stand in solidarity with our farmers.  To put it in context, &euro;10 billion is being provided to help to address the migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016 while an additional &euro;3 billion has been provided to Turkey to provide shelter for 2.5 million migrants.</p> <p>  The CAP has been the mainstay of agricultural production in Europe for more than half a century and has ensured that the Continent has not had to experience the stress of food insecurity that it went through in the earlier part of the twentieth century.  The CAP has evolved into a much more market oriented policy than was the case in its earlier years.</p><p>This evolution has been embraced by Irish farmers who are outward-looking and export-focused.  The CAP is not perfect, however.  A new CAP came into effect in 2015 and even before it began to be implemented I was facing calls to simplify it.  Some of those calls came from the very same Ministers and Members of the European Parliament who had just negotiated it.  To date I have implemented over 20 simplification measures which have been widely welcomed by European farmers.  I can go into the detail on those simplifications with the committee later if members wish.  More simplifications are on the way.  Changes to market rules will substantially reduce 250 Commission regulations to around 40.  These simplifications make life a bit easier for business operators and help them to deliver on jobs and growth for rural areas.  </p><p> A further series of important actions and simplifications are being discussed at the moment in the context of the mid-term review of the multi-annual financial framework, the so-called omnibus regulation.  These measures were welcomed by the European Parliament last week.  They are aimed at further simplifying the policy and increasing its efficiency and ability to deliver results without compromising the policy orientation.  In particular, changes are proposed to the Rural Development Programme, RDP, to provide a sector-specific income stabilisation tool.  This will give member states the opportunity to design a tool that is tailored for a specific sector which, it is intended, will make it more attractive for farmers and member states.  The proposal provides better means to support farmers in times of market crisis and reflects recent difficult experiences in a number of sectors.  A further substantial change is being proposed to the rural development regulations to introduce simpler rules for accessing loans and financial instruments.  These changes are intended to give a necessary boost, to make better use of financial instruments in the agricultural sector and to provide farmers with greater access to capital, particularly young farmers for whom access to credit is a very big problem.  The proposals will require full co-decision of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  I have urged the legislators, in whose hands the proposal now rests, to ensure that these meaningful changes can be enforced by the start of 2018.  </p><p> I am also in the course of proposing a package of measures relating to the simplification of greening and I welcome the support shown by member states for the majority of the measures.  While I have offered a number of compromises which I believe address many of the concerns expressed, it is important to restate that the CAP is an economic, environmental and social policy.  The CAP has a strong environmental dimension and that is as it should be.  The simple facts are that the environmental dimension is here to stay and we will not lower our level of environmental ambition.  I would also point out that the greening and environment measures are worth &euro;14 billion a year to European farmers.  </p><p> Given the market orientation of the Irish agriculture and food sector and the importance of agrifood exports to this country, I would like to provide this committee with a short outline on the state of play in the markets at home and abroad.  When I addressed this committee in June last year, the focus was still very much on the sectors in crisis, namely, dairy, pigmeat and fruit and vegetables.  Today I am pleased to say that we are seeing something of a recovery in those hardest hit markets though we have yet to see this fragile recovery translating itself into money in farmers' pockets.  </p><p> The milk market has been the primary focus over the last year and a half.  The most recent information available suggests there is a now a general consensus on the improvement of market conditions once the adjustment in supply started to materialise.  That adjustment has begun and its effect in Ireland is beginning to show through a welcome price recovery in the last few months.  The milk reduction scheme, which is voluntary and which came into effect a few weeks ago, will help this trend.  I note the participation of one in four Irish farmers.  The scheme has proven to be very attractive and the high level of participation is a clear indication of the appetite for such a scheme.  It is particularly noteworthy and important for the success of the scheme that all of the main milk-producing countries are significant participants, including the 4,400 applicants in Ireland.  Indeed, in percentage terms, Ireland is the member state with the highest participation rate among milk producers, at 24%.  This new and innovative scheme has seen participation by dairy farmers across the EU, with the exception of Greece.  </p><p> The beef sector is of significant strategic importance to Ireland.  The sector is facing difficulties, some arising from developments in the dairy sector which have resulted in the culling of a lot of cows and slaughtering of heifers.  EU production also increased by over 3% this year.  This is affecting the supply-demand balance.  Exports remain dynamic, with an increase of 16.8% between January and July of this year.  New emerging markets, such as the Philippines and Israel, are contributing to keeping our trade balance very positive.  In addition, reasonable prices for raw materials and positive forecasts are keeping production costs within certain boundaries.  I am convinced that one way to ensure development and an improvement in price is to help livestock farmers to find new markets.</p><p> I will be travelling to Turkey in early December in an effort to increase access to the market there for live as well as fresh-meat exports.  I have already been to Mexico, Colombia, China and Japan to try to open new market opportunities for European farmers, while I will visit Vietnam, Hong Kong and Indonesia in two weeks.  As regards third-country markets, I will be proposing that we look at promotion.  In addition to dairy and pigmeat, I wish to have beef included as part of our external promotion programme in 2017.  We also must raise awareness of the high quality and sustainability of European agriculture, including the unique extensive livestock sector in Europe.  For that reason, I intend to include a targeted promotion programme for beef, with a budget of &euro;15 million in 2017, aimed at increasing awareness among members of the general public in the EU of the value of sustainable agriculture and the role of agriculture in respect of climate action, from which livestock will also stand to benefit.</p><p> I will offer a few comments on Brexit, on which I will elaborate further during my appearance at the Joint Committee on European Affairs after this meeting.  I am fully aware of the huge strategic importance this issue has for the agrifood sector in Ireland.  Trade flows of food produce between the UK and Ireland are larger than the bilateral flows that either jurisdiction has with any other country in the world and account for almost &pound;4 billion annually.  In the agrifood trade, half of all Irish beef goes to the UK consumer market.  Ireland is the UK's largest market and its second biggest supplier.  A total of 52% of Northern Ireland's food exports travel south to the Republic of Ireland.  I made these points in great detail to the European Commission's Brexit negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, a Frenchman.  I met him two weeks ago and I am aware that he has been in Dublin since then to discuss these issues with the Government.  Mr. Barnier is a former Commissioner and former French Minister for Agriculture, so he comes to the job with some experience and understanding of the issues, not least in the agriculture sector.  I am also satisfied that as a result of his role as Commissioner with responsibility for Structural Funds in the past, he understands the North-South dimension as well.</p><p> I have no new insight into what will happen arising from the consequences of Brexit.  The UK has yet to make up its mind on its negotiating position.  Cross-border relationships and the UK's future relationship with the EU will be very difficult issues with which to deal.  The truth is that nobody knows what the future holds, be it the conditions under which the UK will leave or the post-Brexit environment in which the UK and Ireland and the UK and the EU will be able to co-exist.  There will have to be a relationship of some type.  The most immediate impact of Brexit is on the exchange rate, with sterling weakening against the euro and the dollar since the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  The impact of a weaker sterling currency is already being felt by Irish farmers and specific sectors.</p><p> I will conclude on a more positive note by recalling the words of the Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, when he described our agriculture sector as a strong part of our European way of life that he wishes to preserve.  In his letter of intent for last week's work programme, he committed the Commission to the modernisation and simplification of the CAP to maximise its contribution not only to the Commission's political priorities but also to the sustainable development goals.  We should not ignore these political signals from the President of the Commission.  Aligning the CAP closely to the Juncker priorities in the context of the post-2020 discussions will provide policy options to ensure that we maintain a viable farming community and strong, sustainable rural communities in the years to come.  This process is already under way.  Last month I had the pleasure of holding a European Commission conference in Cork, which was attended by over 335 people representing all of the stakeholders.  It was a very successful meeting and a document entitled A Better Life in Rural Areas was agreed at it.  The latter contains a ten-point plan which advocates for investing in the potential of rural areas, not only in terms of jobs and growth but also for better integration into other policies.  I look forward to doing my part to build a stronger and simpler CAP and one that is able to respond to market difficulties in the future.</p></speech>

I know that an agricultural markets task force was established and I ask for an update on that.  National legislation was published to introduce a national food ombudsman but this really is an issue that needs to be dealt with at European level.  I ask the Commissioner to outline how things are progressing and how he sees this evolving in the period ahead.</p></speech>

He touched on the conference that was held in Cork three weeks ago, which I was privileged to attend along with the Commissioner, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and Irish MEPs, Deirdre Clune and Se&aacute;n Kelly.  It was a very important conference and what came out of it needs to be progressed.  Bringing the proposals forward will be the key issue.  The ten point plan and the other recommendations are key for rural communities across the EU and will enable the EU to engage effectively with those communities again.  The work programme from that conference is a key issue.</p> <p>  The Commissioner referred to commodity prices and the situation today.  However, he did not make any reference to grain prices and the cereal industry.  That industry, in Ireland in particular, has taken a battering.  Weather has been a major issue, as has pricing and questions now arise about the sustainability of the Irish grain industry.  Unfortunately, grain farmers have had four terrible years and the outlook for next year is not good either.  The grain industry is at the cliff edge in terms of its future sustainability.  I ask the Commissioner to give his views on this matter.</p></speech>

My question is also related to grain.  Most of what I wanted to say has been covered by Senator Lombard but I would add that on the west coast, along an imaginary line from Kinsale to Letterkenny in Donegal, a large quantity of the crop has been lost.  Irrespective of margins and prices, a lot of farmers in that particular area have no product to sell this year.  I ask the Commissioner to outline what may be available or what could be done in the short term to support those farmers who have lost the totality of their crop, or certainly 75% to 80% of it.  Some are still trying to salvage useless grain at less than one tonne per acre.  The grain harvest is essentially a write-off along the west coast and I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on what could be done in the short-term in what are exceptional circumstances.</p></speech>

In that context, 20 members states have decided to take individual action themselves, which signifies very clearly that this is a real problem.  We must see if, at European level, we can harmonise the rules in this area.  We do not want to have unintended consequences of distortions of competition, particularly as they would affect border areas.  The UK model is quite interesting.  We have had a number of hearings in the European Parliament on what is the best model to use.  These ideas are feeding into the agri-market task force which is chaired by the former Dutch Minister for Agriculture, Professor Cees Veerman.  That task force will report in the middle of November and will make recommendations.  Those recommendations will be both interesting and important in terms of whether we will have an EU-wide legislative framework.  There may be recommendations with regard to changes in contract law and with regard to transparency issues.  I look forward to that report and this area is one that will be high on my political list for 2017.</p><p>The Cork 2.0 declaration on rural areas was a successful conference.  Out of the conference will come an action plan from the Commission and this will feed in to the next reform proposals post 2020.  The work will start in 2017.  It was a timely conference and was well attended too.  It is not every day that we get farmers, people in the environment area and politicians going into a room and coming out with an agreement.  It was an interesting development in that respect as well.</p><p> Senator Lombard and Senator Paul Daly referred to the tillage crisis.  I note that &euro;4 million has been provided by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to leverage part of the money for the &euro;150 million loan scheme he is introducing.  The proposal has now been submitted to the Commission for approval under the rural development programme.  We are analysing the information we have received from the Irish Government at the moment.  I hope to have an early conclusion of the discussions with a view to having some money provided from this fund for the hard-pressed tillage sector as soon as possible.  There is no other proposal on the table - this is the proposal we are working with.</p></speech>

I will concentrate my questions on the UK decision to leave the EU and the implications for this country.  There is significant internal trade in this country with beef and milk in Northern Ireland coming down to the Twenty-six Counties.  Weaker sterling will have an impact on all sectors.  In recent weeks we have seen our mushroom sector come under extraordinary pressure.  What is the Commissioner's view?  When the Russian ban was introduced, the fruit and vegetable sector in Europe got an exceptional temporary measure put in place and producers in 20 countries were able to avail of it.  A total of &euro;400 million was drawn down under that temporary exceptional measure.  If our mushroom sector is to survive until the renewal of contracts in six months or nine months, it will need such a measure from the Commission to keep the businesses operating.  They have been caught offside with a political event that is completely outside their control.  No one envisaged this would arise.  They are trying to get better conditions from the major retailers in the UK, but it is not happening.  Their circumstances are very much like those at the time of the Russian ban.  I call on the Commission to look favourably on a temporary measure to try to help this sector to survive.</p></speech>

I am keen to know more about one issue.  The Government is undertaking a review of the areas of natural constraint scheme and what will happen in this regard in the coming period.  Many areas of natural constraint in Ireland correspond to the old disadvantaged areas.  Over many years the areas have spread and grown.  People in my part of the world in the north west are of the view that we are in a very disadvantaged area.  We have marginal land and higher rainfall.  Every disadvantage that can be put in our way is put in our way.  I am interested in the views of the Commissioner with regard to how to address this in a way to ensure that farmers working in these areas can get a fairer and better slice of the cake.  How do we ensure they will be supported better in future?</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue raised another issue.  It has always struck me that the Common Agricultural Policy is in place to support farmers.  In effect, it is the real hand interfering in the market.  At the same time, there are others who profiteer the most from food production.  However, no one is taking control or putting in any hand to deal with that.  Will that happen in future CAP reforms?  What about the big multiples and processors?  Will some hand be put in to deal with them as well?</p></speech>

The Commissioner will be aware that 4,500 hectares of spring cereals have not been harvested due to poor weather.  The Commissioner is aware of the crisis in the mushroom sector as well.  Representatives of that sector were before the committee recently.  They have been particularly impacted by the devaluation of sterling.  There is another issue for dairy farmers in Ireland as well as farmers in other sectors.  The common denominator is price.  This has been going on for years.  Primary producers in our country are not getting a fair price for their produce.  Recently, when the farm organisation representatives were before the committee prior to the budget I asked for their views on how to address this.  I assume that collectively all the members of this committee as well as farming organisations want to ensure a fair price for our primary producers.</p><p>They feel the solution rests with the Commission in terms of regulation and oversight of the industry and ensuring this matter is addressed.  The Commissioner referred to this but I would like a robust assurance from him that he is determined to address the issue once and for all because that is at the heart of the crisis our farming communities face.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Hogan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016102000002#G00200"><p>Deputy Cahill mentioned the impact of Brexit and I agree with him.  He has seen how the mushroom growers in his constituency have been affected by the impact on the currency already.  We did have exceptional measures for the Russian embargo when &euro;5.3 billion of exports were eliminated from the EU's agricultural trade at the stroke of a pen in 2014.  It was a Europe-wide problem.  All we can do is propose to the Minister, the sector and this committee that we will facilitate support for the <i>de minimus</i>arrangement we have in terms of giving up to &euro;15,000 per farmer or &euro;500,000 for a particular company over a three-year period.  If any member state makes a submission to us on those grounds, we will consider it on the basis of not having to conflict with state-aid rules.  This is the only way in which we can help the sector.  There are other ways to deal with this by negotiating with the Irish Bankers' Federation to see if the financial institutions involved can provide better terms.  The loan facilities being leveraged through the rural development programme are, perhaps, another way to deal with this.  A series of measures can be taken but there will no special aid directly from the EU in the sense of a fund being created for one sector over another.  It must have a Europe-wide dimension.  That is the difficulty.  It needs the support of all member states.<br/><br/>I do not have to tell this committee about the implications of Brexit for agriculture.  The trading relationships are very problematic and there will have to be some study of the North-South dimension because 50% of the processed beef in the country and 3 million litres of milk go from Northern Ireland to the South each day for processing.  All of these issues will be complicated but important to resolve, if we are to have a satisfactory outcome for the island of Ireland.  <br/><br/>In response to Deputy Martin Kenny there has been no submission from the Irish Government regarding areas of natural constraint, ANCs, or areas with other specific constraints.  However, we are examining the criteria relating to how we might adjudicate on this.  I have been in politics long enough to know that delineating boundaries is always difficult.  A total of &euro;1.35 billion is being paid into ANCs in Ireland over the programme period 2014 to 2020, of which an additional amount goes to the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.  The BMW region has done a bit better than the rest of the country but, nevertheless, it will want to know what is going to happen in the future.  This will be discussed in the context of the 2018 decisions that we have to make about budget in the EU and the criteria for ANCs.  We have to see the submission from the Irish Government first.<br/><br/>Deputy Kenny and Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the food chain.  They will understand that there are significant differences of opinion between northern European and southern European countries.  By and large, northern European countries, with the exception of the UK which was surprising, are against an interventionist approach to these issues while southern European countries are for it.  Nevertheless, I am of the view that we can work out an improvement on the current situation.  What is happening in respect of the producers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the processors and retailers is not sustainable.  We will be studying the outcome of the agricultural markets task force in November for the recommendations that we can implement in 2017.  I know that I have the support of President Juncker in this because he mentioned it twice in his state of the union address to the European Parliament.<br/><br/>In response to Senator Lombard, the tillage sector is part of the package now seeking approval from Brussels for the &euro;150 million loan facility.  We will not delay too long more in giving that approval to the Minister to help him discharge whatever he can to help these sectors, such as the tillage and the mushroom sectors.</p><p>There is always volatility, with the last crisis in the dairy sector occurring in 2008.  Farmers were getting 42 cent per litre of milk in 2013 and 2014 and everyone compares the price being achieved today with that benchmark.  Farmers are seeing reasonable pricing levels which, if they were more stable, would make them very happy.  However, the reality is that we are in a market-orientated situation, dictated to by unintended consequences such as Brexit, the Russian embargo and global overproduction.  The scheme we devised to seek to balance demand and supply came into effect on 1 October and is already oversubscribed.  At 14 cent a litre, farmers are voting with their feet to participate in that scheme.  It will take 1.2 billion tonnes of milk out of the marketplace and, as a consequence, we are now seeing competition for milk between the co-operatives participating in the scheme and prices starting to go up for the farmer.</p><p> The laws of supply and demand come into play in all sectors.  We must seek to drive up demand in countries outside the European Union and, at the same time, manage the market in such a way that we do not have overproduction to the extent we had in the past.  Farmers were told in 2014 to drive on and produce as much as they could but the market circumstances changed in 2014, with the Russian embargo, and again in 2015.  We have invested &euro;1.5 billion across all sectors, including the dairy sector, pigmeat sector and fruit and vegetable sector, to mitigate some of the financial damage to farmers.  I acknowledge it will never be enough but we are working to do all we can.  We have also put additional moneys into promotion measures to help us find new markets in the Far East and around the world.  That has resulted in a 6% increase in exports of food and drink products in 2016 to date, which is a major achievement for our agriculture and food sector in a context where we must find new markets to replace the &euro;5.3 billion we lost arising from the ban on exports by Russia.  We will continue to monitor the situation but I am glad to see the trend is in a better direction.  We have a long way to go to ensure that trend favours the pocket of the farmers who lost money in 2015 and 2016 to date.</p></speech>

I notice several former colleagues of mine sitting beside him, one of whom I have not seen since 1979.  In regard to voluntary regulation pertaining to the various links in the food chain, the unavoidable fact is that the major multiples will continue to run riot leaving a cohort of producers in their wake.  They will continue to embark upon various below-cost selling measures and implement a range of loss leaders.  Producers will be wiped out as a consequence of those practices.  There has been a fair attempt at doing precisely that in this country over the years, as the Commissioner knows.  A statutory regulatory framework must be put in place to deal with this issue.  I hope the report to which the Commissioner referred will recommend something like that.  It is vital that any such scheme such operate at EU level.</p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, the whole situation is gripped by uncertainty.  Everybody is pontificating but nobody has a handle on what exactly will happen.  It is not possible to have any meaningful discussions in the vacuum that pertains in advance of real negotiations.  I am sure Mr. Hogan has had discussions on the issues with his colleagues.  It is easy to be patronising and many of the politically-based people in the EU institutions are experts at displaying empathy, but do they really get how important the North-South trade relationship is to us and how a hard Brexit could unfurl damage equivalent to the recession from which we have just emerged?  For the agricultural sector specifically, there are issues like biosecurity and veterinary practices to consider, as well as the volatility associated with the currency exchange rate and its impact on our agricultural exports.  We have already had casualties in the mushroom industry, as alluded to by Deputy Cahill.  A major part of our concern is the fact the sector is so heavily export-orientated, with a particular reliance on the UK market.</p> <p>  Has the Commissioner looked at the impact of Brexit on his renegotiation of the overall Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget, which could potentially see a reduction of 37% or so, and on our allocation of &euro;1.2 billion?  There are a lot of ingredients in the melting point and when they are all put together we are left with a sobering scenario.  I hope the Commissioner is taking all those matters into account.</p></speech>

Agrifood trade between the European Union and Africa has become a deficit situation for the African countries, with potentially serious consequences.  The migrant crisis continues to rage and the imbalance in trade can lead to unemployment on African farmlands, food security risks, rural flight and migration, all of which are being experienced.  Will the Commission consider carrying out a human rights assessment of trade matters with Africa in terms of agrifood?  If we can support African countries to create jobs and make farming sustainable in the agrifood sector in their own countries, it will reduce the flow of migration towards Europe.  One of the Danish agriculture groups, Arla, has carried out a human rights assessment of its trade in terms of the impacts of that.  At a European level, is that something the Commissioner would consider?</p></speech>

As Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I have questions relating to Brexit that I will pose at the meeting following this one.</p> <p>  There are 3,000 farmers currently awaiting payments thanks to the eye in the sky.  There is no question that the Commission's surveillance, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is far better than that of the CIA.  People are coming to me asking when they will get their money.  Is every other department of agriculture in Europe as overly diligent as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  In terms of who is blamed for this, it is the Commissioner, Phil Hogan, with the eye-in-the-sky satellite checking the position.  The Commissioner gets little credit for all the good work being done but that issue is causing a problem.  A number of farmers in Northern Ireland voted to leave the European Union because of what they perceived to be the overbearance of the Commission.  I ask the Commissioner to give a direction down the line for people to lay off the farmers.  We are in enough trouble at present and we cannot afford what is happening.  I recently met a farmer at the races in Roscommon who has 1,000 sheep.  He told me that without the grant from the European Union, he would not be in business.  Sometimes we get the negative response from Irish farmers instead of the positive response, to which I believe the Commissioner is entitled.</p></speech>

It is more than likely we are facing a period of uncertainty and that there will be ups and downs.  As the Commissioner mentioned, we had a downward spiral in 2008 followed by an upturn.  We are down again now.  Nine times out of ten we are guaranteed that will happen again.  Can we be certain that the voluntary scheme introduced recently will remain voluntary, rather than mandatory, in the future?</p></speech>

We were restricted in terms of quotas for 30 years, and nobody here wants to go down that road again.  We want the scheme to be voluntary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Hogan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016102000002#J01100"><p>I can answer that question immediately.  There will be no return to quotas. The latest experience on the voluntary scheme, which was to manage supply, was very successful because it was led by farmers,. not co-operatives or member states.  If it was left to co-operatives or member states, it might not be as successful because they want a cheaper product and cheaper raw materials.  However, the price does not increase if there is not supply and demand in some form of equilibrium.</p> <p>  It is good to see Deputy Penrose again.  The issues he raised about the food chain are very much on our radar.</p><p>When 20 member states are doing their own thing, he rightly points out that harmonisation of these rules is required or there will be distortions of competition, particularly in border areas.  If somebody on each side of the border is doing something different, it will play hell.  </p><p> There is a huge vacuum in Brexit negotiations.  It is because the British Government has not decided what it wants.  We will not know until next March when it triggers Article 50 so we are not in any position to know what to say or do until we hear what are the proposals from the other side.  As I said earlier at another meeting, when the trigger mechanism from the British Government happens in March, the attention will turn to the 27 other member states and what they will do.  They will be the ones that will decide the outcome.  The Commission does not decide.  It proposes and it is then up to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to reject, accept or modify and that is it.  Sometimes, everyone thinks the Commission decides.  It does not.  It is the legislature which decides in the same way as it decides in these Houses.  I agree that the uncertainty and instability this is causing is not helping Ireland, particularly in the agrifood sector where currency movements have been very unhelpful.  I assure members that, since 23 June, I have been talking quite frequently to all Commissioners, including the president, and have met with Michel Barnier, the European Commission's negotiator on Brexit.  They fully understand all the implications of any deal and the particular circumstances of the island of Ireland.  It is important that they do understand and I am glad the Deputy asked that question.  I am happy to say that they now understand it very much.  At every diplomatic level, I assure the Deputy that the Irish diplomatic service is very much out there making sure every department in Brussels understands the implications of this.  </p><p> In respect of the absence of additional funding mechanisms from member states, of course, there will be implications for all budgets.  We will be expected to fight our corner in any multiannual financial framework negotiations in 2018 and 2019.  As the largest part of the budget at 38%, agriculture comes into the firing line as it always does in respect of what are the other priorities.  There are plenty of other priorities, sectors and policy issues that are looking for money.  We will do our best but if you have &euro;11 billion less in terms of the net contribution from the UK to the European budget, that is not a good starting place.  If member states want to propose ways in which the European budget will be able to fill that &euro;11 billion gap, that is open to discussion.  At the end of the day, we must operate on the basis that we will have &euro;11 billion less in the overall budget.  </p><p> In response to Deputy Pringle, the EU imports more from Africa and developing countries than the US, Australia and Japan together.  We have tariff-free access for many commodities from the African Continent in particular.  The Deputy will see that in the Valletta summit last November, the role of agriculture was recognised for the first time as making an important contribution to dealing with the issue of irregular migration.  Last December, I attended the World Trade Organization talks in Nairobi where we agreed that all export-distorting mechanisms for developing countries into the EU in terms of their products and the least developed countries are being eliminated.  They started on 1 January for EU countries.  Many positive things are happening that will help deal with the migration issue by helping farmers in Africa and elsewhere to be able to help themselves.  Otherwise, as the Deputy rightly says, we will have a bigger migration issue in the future if we do not help farmers and trade with them in the preferential way we do now.  They can impose tariffs on EU products going to Africa but we accept tariff-free imports and import large quantities of food tariff free from Africa.  We have a good story to tell here.  The recent agreement with six south African countries has certainly accentuated that.  It was approved by the European Parliament three weeks ago.  An increase of 335% in exports to those countries has been achieved in the past five years but there has been substantial trade in the other direction as well.</p><p>I realise that some in the non-governmental organisation, NGO, community get confused about these issues but the figures and agreements speak for themselves.  They also do not wish to acknowledge that we have eliminated the trade distorting measures.  I have regular conversations-----</p></speech>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing an excellent job, through its payment systems, in ensuring that farmers are paid.  A sum of &euro;1 billion will be paid out to farmers in October under the 70% advance payments which I authorised some months ago.  I believe Ireland is top of the league in making payments in the European Union.  French farmers are obliged to wait for considerably longer than their Irish counterparts to get their money.  At a time when farmers need cash flow and support during market difficulties I am delighted that the Irish authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are top of the league.  They have a great record.  In fact, 100% of the farm applications are coming into the Department online.  That is one of the bright spots.  Of course, there will always be some difficulties with the 1% - that will always be the way.  However, the Department has made substantial progress with its systems to pay people quickly and on time, and I am very happy with the situation.</p></speech>

Every state has the same level of surveillance and controls.  Some countries are not able to implement their controls properly, including the French Government, so we regularly have to give them time extensions to help them put their systems in place.  If a state does not invest in the IT systems, it will not get the payments out to farmers on time.  Ireland has made that investment over a number of years under successive Governments.</p> <p>  I referred to the question about volatility and to the fact that we do not wish to return to quotas.  It is interesting that farmers responded magnificently to the recent &euro;150 million scheme, with 4,500 farmers in Ireland deciding that they wished to participate in the dairy sector.  We are looking at the lessons we can learn from the crises of the last two years to ascertain what new market tools we will need in the future reform of the CAP.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  As time is particularly tight, we have only a limited period with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, and I suggest that we move directly to our engagement with him.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome him and the members of his team, Mr. Dermot Ryan and Mr. Tom Tynan, to their first meeting with the joint committee.  The Commissioner is obviously well known to the Houses and we look forward to working with him and his colleagues.  I also welcome Mr. Gerry Kiely, the new head of the European Commission office in Dublin.  On behalf of the committee, I congratulate him on his new role.  We hope to engage with him and his colleagues who are based in Dublin on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  This committee has a particular role and responsibility to apply appropriate scrutiny to the strategic direction of the EU and its institutions.  The state of the Union speech that the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, delivers to the European Parliament is a key part of that.  It is a single speech but also a set of documents of intent in that it signals what the European Commission intends to prioritise.  For this reason alone, it is important to us.  It also starts a process that results in the publication of the Commission's annual work programme.  My colleagues are interested in knowing where the Commission will lead us over the next year or so.  We might begin with that discussion before opening the floor to members' questions.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be present this afternoon.  I point to the appointment of Mr. Kiely as head of the EU office, which is based on Lower Mount Street.  It used to be on Dawson Street at the corner of Molesworth Street.</p><p>People on this committee are welcome to use those offices at any time.  As you have said, Chairman, it is an interesting time for all of us in the European Union.  As a Commissioner I can say there is never a dull moment.  Circumstances are changing at home and abroad.  In the same way as the election this year in Ireland dramatically changed the political landscape, so too is the political landscape changing in Europe.  New elections or referenda bring new challenges and it is becoming topical to claim that the European Union is in crisis, or even an existential crisis, something the EU Commission President, Mr. Juncker, acknowledged recently, at least in part.  Commentators lay all the problems on top of one another, such as terrorism, refugees, the euro, poor economic performance, high unemployment and Brexit, and they look for solutions.  The Prime Minister of France, Mr. Valls, did it recently when he argued for an approach to Europe by our politicians and citizens that emphasises our European identity, shared values and European patriotism.  This is an opinion I share, for it is high time we stopped blaming the Union for everything that goes wrong while taking credit nationally for everything that goes right.  In his state of the Union speech Mr. Juncker also spoke of the European way of life, something he said was worth preserving.  What we often do not realise is that the European Union is the people of all the member states.  Blaming the European Union for all of Europe's ills is a lopsided attitude which has caused disconnect with the people.  It has done a great deal to erode their confidence in the European Union and fuels some wrong-headed opinions we hear today.  It is also a lazy narrative that does not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p> Yet it is naive to argue that all is well with the European Union.  To echo the words of Mr. Juncker, we must start with a sense of realism and with great honesty.  First of all, we should admit that we have many unresolved problems in the European Union.  Today I am keen to discuss some of the issues that feed the narrative, one at a time.  This will help us to see that perhaps we are on the way to sorting some of them out.</p><p> Brexit is a special case.  It is a headache for the Union but a full-blown crisis for the United Kingdom with the high risk of collateral damage for Ireland.  I will come to that at the end of my remarks.  Mr. Juncker has acknowledged that the Union has problems.  He has acknowledged that the Union has work to do to improve its management of the economy and the currency, to accelerate inclusive growth and to raise employment levels.  We are making progress from the darkest days of some years ago.  I will outline three or four initiatives under way.  These actions are intended to help improve some of the fundamentals of our economy, as well as correct some of the faults that have emerged and persisted in the course of the current economic slow-down.</p><p> Jobs, growth and investment are the Union's top priorities.  There are signs that our efforts are beginning to pay off.  Europe is delivering on youth employment.  The performance of young people in the Union's labour market overall has surpassed expectations since 2013.  There are 1.4 million fewer people under 25 years of age unemployed and 900,000 fewer young people not in employment, education or training.  These trends suggest the Union's actions are beginning to make a difference with the help of member state programmes.  Approximately 9 million young people took up an offer, the majority of which were offers of employment.  The youth employment initiative has had an impact in Ireland.  Since its entry into force in 2013, the youth employment initiative has mobilised &euro;68 million in additional EU resources.  When combined with matched European Social Fund moneys, this means we have seen &euro;136 million in targeted EU assistance to tackle the problem of youth unemployment in Ireland.  We still have a long way to go before we reach a satisfactory position on youth employment in Ireland and the Union as a whole.  Similarly, we have a way to go on other issues.</p><p> The investment plan for Europe is delivering clear results.  The European Fund for Strategic Investment focuses on removing obstacles to investment, providing technical assistance to investment projects and making smarter use of new and existing financial resources.  It has already raised &euro;116 billion in investments in the first year of operation.</p><p> Economic growth is picking up in the EU, investment is increasing and unemployment is down.  The trends are positive, thanks in part to this new Juncker fund.  Another example of the ongoing efforts to increase our economic opportunities is demonstrated by our ongoing efforts to conclude trade deals that are good for Europe.  One such trade deal is the deal proposed with Canada.  The deal, known as Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is a good deal.  It stands to benefit European Union exporters, especially small businesses and the food sector, through new protections and new opportunities.  As the most globalised open economy in the Union, Ireland will benefit.  Indeed, the benefits will be more certain bearing in mind our strong historical, cultural, linguistic and economic ties with Canada.  I was surprised, therefore, when the Seanad rejected CETA recently.  Such an event was widely reported by media sources in Europe.  Is rejection of a good trade deal a view Ireland should be conveying to the world?  This is relevant not only in terms of our being open for investment but also in terms of our relationship with a country that gave an outlet for many of our young people during the recent economic crisis.  It is difficult to see how rejection of this trade deal is in the interests of the citizens of Ireland.</p><p> Raising the proposed trade agreement provides a relevant bridge to Brexit.  As I have said, the leaving arrangements and the future UK trade arrangements are critical to Ireland.  It is no exaggeration to suggest that Brexit concerns Ireland almost as much as it concerns the UK.  I will set out some examples.  Since the UK Prime Minister, Ms May, announced that she will give formal notice of the UK decision to leave by the end of March things have begun to clarify.  The pound has weakened.  We have also seen signs of how Brexit will raise food prices in the UK.  One example was the Marmite spat between Unilever and Tesco.  Unilever sought to put up prices and Tesco has resisted, at least for the time being.</p><p> The land border is another question.  Until 1973 the trade or economic aspect of the Border was an Ireland-UK affair.  Then, when both countries joined the European Economic Community, it became an EU-affair.  Now, for the first time in history, the trade or economic aspect of the Border is about to become an EU-UK affair or an EU-Ireland-UK affair.  Committee members should reflect on how important the European Union aspect will become if the United Kingdom turns again to a cheap food policy as part of its drive to become more competitive in international markets.  North of the Border will be cheap food and a different way of supporting farm incomes, while south of the Border will operate under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.</p><p> There is not a great deal we can say about it at this stage because no one knows exactly how it is going to finish.  However, we must get used to the salient facts.  Last week the EU Council President, Mr. Tusk echoed the words of Commission President, Mr. Juncker, from the week before: the choice of the United Kingdom is between a hard Brexit and no Brexit, and only no Brexit can give us the Border we have now.  This is something to which I, as European Union Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, am giving attention, and I know that Ireland is doing the same.</p><p> These three issues justify the claim that Brexit concerns Ireland as much as the UK, but there are many others.  I predict that conversations between Dublin and Brussels will be almost as significant as those between London and Brussels.  The first public estimates are as high as &euro;40 billion for the UK debt to the EU for past promises.  Reflecting EU accounting rules, unpaid promises have built up in recent years and now the United Kingdom must make good its share of this backlog.  How is this going to be resolved?  To the extent that the UK escapes this commitment, other member states, including Ireland, will have to stump up extra contributions.  This is another reason for Ireland to be wary.</p><p> I do not intend to speculate further.  The position of the European Commission remains as it has been since the referendum.  Until Article 50 notification is received, the negotiations cannot begin, although a great deal of preparatory work is in hand.  The Commission's Article 50 task force is operational and is being led by Michel Barnier, a former French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and a former European Commissioner.  He is preparing and conducting the negotiations.  It is no coincidence that one of Mr. Barnier's first visits was to Dublin last week.</p><p> The extent of economic integration on the island of Ireland is unmatched anywhere else in the European Union.  Thus, the level of potential disruption from a so-called hard Brexit will be considerable.  This is already acknowledged by the Irish Government in the recent budget.  Before the referendum vote, I made clear some of the mutual risks in a speech at Queen's University, Belfast in May.  My position remains the same: there are serious potential negative outcomes.  For example, 40% of all Northern Irish milk is processed in the South.  More than 50% of Irish beef and cheese goes to the United Kingdom.  A total of 40% of Ireland's exports go to the United Kingdom.  Ireland's all-island energy market, cross-Border health care, fisheries and aviation will all be potentially affected by a hard Brexit.</p><p> On the other hand, a hard Brexit might bring some opportunities for Ireland.  What will happen to Britain's financial sector if it loses its all-important passporting provision?  Will inward investment choose Ireland rather than the United Kingdom?  Although these possibilities do not, for the moment, seem to offer a consolation for the difficulties Ireland is already experiencing due to the decline of sterling, they raise unanswered questions.</p><p> There are other delicate political issues not least of which is the status of the Good Friday Agreement, which is underpinned by reference to European Union law.  There are questions over the future of the common travel area and the status of Irish citizens in the United Kingdom - this is of concern given the present weight of opinion against European Union citizens working there - as well as British citizens resident in Ireland, of whom there are more than 250,000.</p><p> Ireland and the United Kingdom are joined together in many ways and that is not going to be changed by Brexit.  However, the fact remains that Brexit is going to throw many old issues into a new light.</p><p>Ireland and the European Union must be quick to understand this and find ways to deal with it because it is vital for our future and for the future of the United Kingdom, UK, not least in a 21st century globalised economic system where geographic proximity still matters.</p><p> Why does Britain trade more with Ireland than with China, Japan, Russia and Brazil combined and why are we so linked together in Brexit?  Time zones still matter, the ability of professionals in the services sector to travel freely and easily by short-haul air travel is still important for the professional services sector, one of the most important sectors in the UK economy.  Britain and Ireland are trading nations and the UK's departure presents challenges to both.  We still do not know what kind of post-Brexit relationship the UK and the EU will have, but the EU is clear that it wants the UK as a close partner and we look forward to the UK confirming its intention in this respect in March.  Ireland has developed an almost disproportionate trading dependence on the UK and must now seek to increase its contacts with the rest of the EU.  </p><p> What is clear above all, is that any deal, by its nature, will be inferior to the deal that the UK currently enjoys due to its membership of the EU.  The UK is going to learn a hard lesson, it is not going to have its cake and eat it.  The posturing and fancy talk of Brexit is already beginning to collide with reality.  Brexiteers in Britain argue that strong industrial interests in France and Germany will lean on their governments to conclude a quick deal with the UK.  We shall see.  All I would observe in this connection is that the referendum discussion was characterised by half-truths and some outright lies.  We already see some features of Brexit becoming evident, even though they were dismissed in the referendum debates as scaremongering.</p><p> In conclusion, Chairman and members, I repeat that the EU is working its way through its problems.  There are positive signs.  As I said, the President&rsquo;s state-of-the-union address showed how the Union is prioritising jobs, growth and investment.  This blueprint is bearing fruit.  I want to leave committee members under no illusion but that the Union is clear-headed when it comes to dealing with the United Kingdom in its Brexit negotiations.  With patience, solutions can be found to the issues that will arise, particularly in respect of the island of Ireland.  </p><p> I want, however, again to underline that these negotiations are almost as much about Ireland as they are the United Kingdom.  I know the Irish Government is working hard to bring this home to the EU institutions and to Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator but time is short.  </p><p> Ireland must use the days from now to next March to make its case clear and heard; and ensure it is taken into account.  As a member of the European Commission I want to reassure the committee and the Irish Government that the Commission understands the difficulties Ireland faces.  We are in this together as we fight for the best possible outcome for Ireland and the EU as a whole.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said he gave it to us very straight and from the shoulder.</p> <p>  Given the shortfall of the order of &euro;11 billion, and the collateral damage to Ireland, that will arise from the loss of Britain to the Union, if it happens, will the Commission be able to do with less?  It will be down from 28 to 27 members.  How will it make up the shortfall?  What advice would the Commissioner give to Ireland?  He said the arrangement between Ireland and Britain will be as important as that between Britain and the EU.  Is he encouraging a bilateral deal in advance of Britain's invoking Article 50 in the hope that afterwards the Commission might give it its blessing?  So much is bound up here, such as the Good Friday Agreement and the tie-in with European law; as the Commissioner suggested, we may need to get busy in that regard.  I will be interested in his commentary on that. </p> <p>  A few days ago this committee and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement met the Brexit committee from the House of Lords.  It was an informal meeting but they seemed to be very concerned with a case in the High Court in Britain, which they expect will go to the Supreme Court.  I got the distinct impression that while their constitution is unwritten their lordships and the House of Lords would be very concerned with the supremacy of parliament.  They seemed anxious to get into the debate in parliament following the outcome of any Supreme Court hearing.  They seemed to think that the Prime Minister and British Government will not get their own way in the outcome of the case. </p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA.  I agree that it was unfortunate the way the Seanad vote went.  Our good friends in Fianna F&aacute;il made a very strong speech in favour of it but abstained in the vote.  </p></speech>

He has given the most comprehensive response I have heard from anyone in respect of the future after Brexit.  I am delighted that he is so knowledgeable about this and have confidence in him as our Commissioner.  I know he is working for the European Commission but he can never forget where he came from.  He is well aware that the common travel area has existed since 1922, comprising 499 km of open border.  We are entering an impossible situation.  It is uncharted waters.  I asked President Hollande at the European Council last week whether he felt we should have a representative on the negotiating team.  There is nobody from Ireland on it.  It will be holding secret negotiations, will report to the Commission and the prime ministers and presidents but we have nobody monitoring the day to day negotiations and we are the most affected.  We should have an observation or participation role.  We are the only country with that border with the UK.  I know the Commission will be involved in the negotiations which will go on for approximately two years after Article 50 kicks in next March.  This is the most significant event since the foundation of the State.  I am delighted that the senior members of the media will print the Commissioner's speech today and that the diplomatic corps representatives will have it too.</p></speech>

The committee is very preoccupied with Brexit and the Commissioner dealt with that.  Does he believe the Commission understands and appreciates the special and unique position of Ireland in respect of Brexit?  The Government and the Parliament are trying to get that message out but I would be interested in knowing if that work is succeeding and the Commission understands our position in respect of the peace process, the Border, free trade and the common travel area.  What is his view of newspaper reports that the Irish Government will seek legal protection for the special status of Northern Ireland to guard against the threat of a hard border on the island?  Perhaps there is a possibility of the North remaining within the Single Market and the customs Union thus safeguarding the free movement of goods and people on the island, irrespective of Britain's future status.</p><p>It is a practical solution that is being floated and I am interested to hear the Commissioner's view on it.</p><p> We heard in the news in recent days that draft proposals are due to be published by the European Commission next week on a common consolidated corporate tax base.   The latter part of these proposals represent a significant threat to Ireland's tax sovereignty.  Consolidating the tax base will hand the Commission too much power and influence over the tax rates of individual member states.  It is tax harmonisation through the back door.  This is an issue that will be very much in the news next week.  The Commissioner will appreciate from his time in public life in this State that our 12.5% corporation tax rate is very important to us and a fundamental aspect of our foreign direct investment policy.  Will he comment on that?</p><p> On the migration issue and the EU-Turkey deal, there tends to be a focus here in Ireland on the humanitarian aspects of these matters.  However, it seems the EU is looking at the issue more from the perspective of simply stemming the flow of migrants.  The proposal was that 160,000 people would be relocated but, thus far, only 5,000 such relocations have taken place.  Will Mr. Hogan give his view on whether Europe has moved away from a humanitarian response to the crisis?</p></speech>

I appreciate that he has an excellent knowledge of matters pertaining to Ireland given his background in politics here.  Although he is now a Commissioner, he is an Irishman true and proud.  Setting aside Brexit, the greatest single challenge to this country is the politicisation of the Commission, as seen by its straying into the matter of tax harmonisation.  In the long run, the potential damage to the economic foundations on which we have built our State is far greater from that development than from Brexit.  The misguided approach taken by one of Mr. Hogan's colleagues on the Apple tax case shows there is very much a politicised way of thinking on this topic within the Commission.  I am interested in how Mr. Hogan views the Commission's stance in these matters and its straying into what is a national issue, namely, the right to set taxes.</p> <p>  There is a concern about how representative of the directly affected member states are the various subgroups and negotiating teams within the Commission.  It is very important that Ireland has the strongest possible voice in the Brexit negotiations.  If this were happening on the far side of the Continent, with another member state being left as the only one with a land border with a state that was leaving the EU, I cannot envisage a situation where there would not be direct involvement by a representative of the affected state in the process of negotiations with the departing state.  Reporting-back processes are all well and good but there is not yet sufficient recognition within the EU of the effect of creating this border.  Mr. Hogan made a very interesting observation in his opening statement, namely, that only no Brexit can maintain the current Border situation.  If that is the Commission's view, it is a very worrying one.  There will be an impact on the island of Ireland in so many ways, including import-export practices, free travel and all the things we value as an island nation.  That impact cannot be overstated.  I am very concerned there might not be a willingness to accept the need for a special consideration in respect of Northern Ireland in the negotiations.  I accept there are conflicting views among member states regarding federalism, regional autonomy and so on.  However, the case regarding Northern Ireland must be heard by the Commission.</p> <p>  In terms of the Commission's dealings on trade, I agree with Mr. Hogan that we are an open trading country and stand to be a principal beneficiary of trade deals.  However, recent events in other member states have clearly shown there is a disconnect between the way ordinary people see the European Union now and how it is seen by senior people within the institutions of the Union and by members of the Commission and the Parliament.  That disconnect very often has to do with how financial and trade policies are not only developed but portrayed and the impact they have on people's everyday lives.  The Commission has singularly failed to communicate the benefits to citizens of living within the European Union.  We are very much at risk of putting ourselves in a situation where what is perceived as the interest of the European establishment does not correspond with the interest of its peoples.</p> <p>  That is one of the greatest threats to the European project and it ties into my last point.  We are very much focused at this time, and rightly so, on the impact on Ireland of Brexit.  However, the reality is that the negotiations conducted by the EU with the UK, if not done correctly, could ultimately lead to the dissolution of the EU.  If we are left with a situation whereby the UK seems better off materially in almost every way by leaving the EU, there will most likely be a domino effect as certain other member states seek to follow its lead.  I am particularly interested in Mr. Hogan's view on how the Commission can reconcile that problem with our requirement for a recognition in the negotiations of the particular impact on Ireland of the UK's departure from the Union.</p></speech>

He has given a forthright assessment of the scene that is unfolding before us all in Europe and, in particular, its implications for this country and the UK.  He is correct in his conclusion that the best thing that can happen in respect of Brexit is that it does not happen.  Unfortunately, we all have underestimated the impact if it should take place.  More details in this regard are likely to emerge in the coming months, none of them positive.  I do not see how there can be a better situation for Ireland, North and South, for Ireland Inc., for the UK and for the European Union itself in the wake of the departure of the UK.  There has been no reference today to the degree to which the Union may be damaged by one country jumping overboard for whatever reason.  I strongly concur with the reference by my colleague, Deputy Brophy, to the politicisation of the European Commission.  This goes back to the decision to have a single Commissioner for each member state, something that was very much sought by this country.  I was one of those who strongly opposed that development, my view being that the 15 Commissioners should be representative of the entire Union, each directly and equally accountable to all member states.  Together with the increased powers for the European Parliament, that development represents a huge threat to the position of smaller countries within the Union.</p> <p>  I do not like being lectured to by Members of the European Parliament on what we in this country should do about our taxation policy.  We are an independent country which has always adhered to and contributed to the European project.  When I see people clicking their fingers and admonishing us for allegedly departing from the script in a way that is inconsistent with the European concept, I ask myself who they are to raise these questions and whether they are qualified to do so.</p><p>Have they a record that is sufficient to convince us that they are to be taken seriously?  I refer, in particular, to Members of the European Parliament who have opined that there can be only one outcome to the so-called Apple tax issue, namely, that Ireland will lose.  One presumes the honourable and enlightened MEPs also have access to the judges at the European courts.  I do not think so and I reject and resent being treated this way by anybody in any position of authority.</p><p> The question of common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, has been referred to.  I am not alone in thinking that there is a concerted effort to punish our country for having a 12.5% corporation tax.  It is appalling to see representatives of this country denigrating their homeland on the international stage.  There are plenty of other people willing to do so.  There is no need for our own people to do it.  They can make a trade of it and it is good press for them but it does not do Ireland Inc. any good.  Why is there such resentment?  We all know profits earned in other member states and non-EU states are included in the totality of what is levelled against Ireland.  Ireland is allegedly being given the responsibility for collecting taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions.  Ireland has no function in this area and the EU does not have the authority to tell us that we do.</p><p> I completely agree with the positive points the Commissioner made.  There are other negative aspects, however.  Some years ago, an insurance company came to this jurisdiction.  It was registered in another European country.  It left in a hurry with unpaid debts which must be carried by the motoring public here.  As far as I am aware, nobody admonished the company.  I see no sign of it from any quarter.  Some years ago, and prior to the end of the boom, certain banks introduced themselves to this jurisdiction.  They traded profitably but undermined the Irish banking system.  Afterwards, they walked away, back to their home jurisdictions and nobody admonished them.  It is unfair and undemocratic that Ireland, as a small country which has always contributed to the European project, should be treated in this fashion.</p><p> I have spoken about migration before.  The saddest emblem of the EU's response to migration was the razor wire that was seen to be the iconic response to the refugees who were swarming across the borders.  They were running away from something which was not happiness, health and good fortune.  While the EU, as an entity, did not do this, individual member states - by virtue of their influence and geographic position - influenced it.  It is an everlasting image of the EU's attitude to something to which it should have taken a totally different attitude by virtue of its own history.  I hope there is the will to change all those things.  The question for the future is whether we have free trade, the Single Market, common trade over a wide area or return to the days of tariffs.  If we return to trade tariffs, which some people would have us believe are the answer to our prayers and problems, the smaller countries, again, unfortunately, will suffer heavily.</p><p> I am sorry for going on for so long.  I remain totally committed to everything the EU sought to achieve over the years.  I have become a little cynical in recent times that we tend to lose the sight of the target and go down side roads, much to the detriment of the European project.</p></speech>

I will pick up where Deputies Colm Brophy and Bernard Durkan left off.  Like Deputy Durkan, I am a committed Europhile, and always have been.  However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to be the person who sells the European ideal and pushes the EU agenda in the member states.  There is an increasing level of disconnect in Brussels, from the European Commission primarily.  I am not necessarily talking about the 28 Commissioners but the officials, in one degree.  There is a disconnect from what is really happening in the member states.  The Commissioner is right that far too many people in member states are happy to claim responsibility for the good news and blame Brussels, or wherever else, for the bad news.  There is a requirement for the EU to get back to basics and truly demonstrate, across the EU, what the EU is delivering for the people.  This is very apparent in the trade deals that are being negotiated and that will negotiated.</p> <p>  I agree that CETA is a great deal.  TTIP has the potential to be a good deal.  During last week's Seanad debate, which was narrowly lost given that some people decided to abdicate their democratic responsibility, I argued at length that the way the deals were negotiated was no longer fit for purpose.  Non-transparent negotiations behind closed doors do not cut the mustard anymore.  We need to get the public involved and get agreement.  Telling Oireachtas Members or MEPS that to view negotiation documents they must go to a secret location on Kildare Street and hand in their phones does not pass.  It is very difficult for us, as pro-Europeans who believe in free trade and who are not anti-globalisation to sell the deals if we are constantly having to dispel images of conspiracy theories lurking in the corridors.  Those deals are vitally important, especially in light of Brexit.</p> <p>  Given the Commissioner's portfolio, and the importance of trade to it, what other deals are in the pipeline?  What other options are presenting themselves to Ireland and the wider EU?  The Commissioner mentioned that 50% of Irish beef is exported to the UK.  It is great that we have reached new deals with China and the US.  Where else in the Far East can we look for deals?  Last week, the Irish Government has confirmed a deal on exporting lamb to Iran.  While all these are very welcome, Ireland's biggest export is pharmaceuticals.  We need to see where all the deals are.</p> <p>  The sanctions on Russia in light of its activities in Ukraine have worked.  While they have hit certain economies and producers, including pork producers in Ireland, they have been important in light of President Putin's action or inaction in Crimea, depending on which way he says it.  This debate has moved on to the situation in Syria.  If matters in Ukraine and Crimea were to sort themselves out, will sanctions stay in place in light of the Russian Government's activities in bombing so many innocent civilians and humanitarian workers in Syria?  If not, what can the European Commission to do in order to put pressure on Russia?</p> <p>  Again, I thank the Commissioner for his contribution and his work in the Commission so far.  Some years ago, I watched his performance before the agriculture committee of the European Parliament and it was a master-class.  I belatedly congratulate the Commissioner on it.  He is very deserving of the position he holds.  I look forward to his responses.</p></speech>

I thank him for his very detailed and forthright presentation.  One of the issues we have been discussing here in previous meetings is how aware the EU needs to be about the complexities, given the recent vote in the UK to leave the EU, particularly regarding exports.  Ireland, being such an export-driven country, especially in the food industry, many of our exports go to Europe via the UK, and there are potentially issues for the future, given Britain's decision.  This particularly relates to the food industry, which is a massive industry in Ireland, and the revenue that comes in from it.</p><p>It is regarded as a high end, value added product.  How aware is the EU of the complexities of that and the difficulties it potentially could pose for the future?  Obviously, we wish to avoid that because it is such an important factor in the Irish market and economy.  With regard to being over-reliant on the UK market, I have stated previously in the D&aacute;il that we must become more focused on getting a market in other EU countries in order to become more vibrant and viable, rather than being so dependent on the UK market.  To that end, I have called on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to consider putting a fund in place so we can promote our products better in Europe and to make ourselves more independent and less reliant on the UK market.  Perhaps the Commissioner would give his views on that.</p></speech>

At that conference I got the distinct impression that there was a definite desire to teach the UK a hard lesson.  While 26 of our partners might wish to do that, a hard lesson for the UK will be a very hard lesson for Ireland.  Does the Commissioner accept that?  Does the Commission have a clear set of principles under which it will negotiate with Britain under Article 50, and does the Commission have the confidence to carry through those principles?</p> <p>  I will deal with the nationalism aspect shortly, but I am concerned that part of the problem that led to Brexit is the desire of governments to distance themselves from the negotiations they enter into with the European Union.  When they return home, they claim they were told by Brussels to do whatever it is, so Brussels is seen as the director of the worst possible inflictions that can be put on the Irish people.  Has the Commission any plans to bring the governments together and get them to accept the fact that they negotiate these issues and must take responsibility for the results?  It is not a question of the Commission imposing things on us but of our governments negotiating with the Commission and bringing back whatever they manage to negotiate.  If they are poor negotiators, they should admit it.  That is my view.</p> <p>  There is one area where the Commission has failed, and I wonder if the Commissioner agrees with me on this.  There has been a rise of populism across the western world and a rise of extremism to a certain degree.  That is fed by half truths and distortions.  Why have the Commission and the European Parliament not done more to provide empirical evidence for citizens?  The Commissioner might say they already do that, but for some reason it is not getting through.  It is fair to say that the European Union is probably hated and loved equally by all citizens throughout Europe.  We see it as dictating our daily life.  When one walks into any major building or drives on a major road, one will see a sign stating that the project was funded by the European Union, yet we hate it.  I find that paradox hard to reconcile.</p> <p>  Some of my colleagues have spoken quite eloquently about the Commission and the Apple case.  The problem is that when the report emerged it was not a little more honest that several countries have allowed that to happen with Apple, if there was a tax case to be answered.  My view of Ireland's membership of the European Union is somewhat similar to what I hear being said with regard to Britain's desire to keep trade open following Brexit.  One cannot be a member of the club and not participate in it.  One cannot be a member of the European Union and put nationalism ahead of that.  Some people in Ireland would probably shoot me for saying that, but if we are members of the European Union we must have European citizens in every European city and village in the common area.  We must sign up to be a part of Europe.  We do not want to be just a part of all the nice things one can get, and not a part of all the things one does not like.  We must try to work away from nationalism and towards a common goal.</p></speech>

It is not.  Spain has a land border with Gibraltar.  That must be taken on board.  We might regard it as a tiny part of the UK, but it is nonetheless a part of it.  Anybody who has ever travelled to Gibraltar and sat for an hour and a half or two hours in traffic will be aware of that.  It is as much a part of the UK as Northern Ireland or any other part.</p><p>Finally, I agree with my colleague Deputy Durkan on migration.  Quite frankly, the European Union has been disgraceful in how it has handled migration.  I believe that when the <i>LE Eithne</i>, the <i>LE William Butler Yeats</i>or whatever other ship it is picks up migrants in the Mediterranean they should be brought back to Ireland.  They are on Irish soil the moment they are brought onto one of those ships.  We should take responsibility.  We talk about humanitarianism all the time, yet we sit idly by watching entire cities being bombed to extinction.  Incidentally, I do not wish to see the creation of a European army to protect our borders, which I heard mentioned in Brussels last week.  I would love to see the creation of a European police force to stop the thugs living in Spain sending people to Dublin to murder others.  I would be quite happy with that, but certainly not a European army.</p><p>I realise the Commissioner is in a hurry.  I will conclude and thank him for his attendance.</p></speech>

Is it not a fact that the European Union is now facing an existential crisis of its own making and that the deep alienation felt by millions of citizens across Europe, which is growing, is due to the European Union's failures on a range of fronts?  The most obvious one is the role the European Union played as austerity boot boy for the financial sector which was responsible, with the assistance of the European Central Bank and not without the active collusion of the political establishment and property developers here, for creating bubbles in this country.  The European Central Bank, through its interest rate policy and then in its response to the crisis by essentially protecting the banks and the finance industry, inflicted cruel and unjust austerity, by any standards, on people who bore no responsibility for that crisis, be they in Greece, and the things done to the Greek people are beyond obscene, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and so forth.  That is one of the primary reasons the alienation in the European Union is so intense.</p> <p>  One instance of that, which the Commissioner has intimate knowledge of, is the issue of water charges.  I hear members of this committee yet again stating that we must stand up for Ireland's right to set its own corporation tax rates, but when the European Union wants to bully us in a particular direction on water charges and our right to decide democratically how we pay for water services, suddenly the voices for democracy from certain quarters over here go silent.  I put it to the Commissioner that if Europe engages in boot boy or bully boy tactics when there is a clear democratic mandate in the House to get rid of water charges it is making a deep mistake that it will rue.</p><p>It will increase alienation.  I cannot understand the Commission's view about the established practice when it comes to water charges.  There is a big legalistic dispute-----</p></speech>

By no stretch of the imagination could anyone conclude that it has since become established practice because nobody is paying the charges and the electorate made its view very clear in the most recent election.  If the Commission fails to grasp that, is it not deepening the democratic deficit that is growing between citizens and the EU?</p> <p>  My next question concerns fortress Europe and foreign policy generally.  Again, I hear the one-sided and partial criticism from voices here and throughout the EU of what is undoubtedly the appalling behaviour of Russia in Ukraine and Syria, where its actions in Aleppo in supporting the Assad regime are beyond disgusting.  However, are member states of the EU and, in the case of Ukraine, Europe itself not responsible as well for interfering in that country and, essentially, reigniting the Cold War with Russia by having ambitions in eastern bloc countries?  Members such as France, the UK, Denmark and others, including its big ally, the US, are also responsible for bombing Syria and killing innocent civilians, have been involved in staggering levels of arms sales to regimes like the Saudi regime and continue to treat with the Egyptian regime, which tramples on human rights on its country, and say nothing about that.  </p> <p>  Is it not an appalling vista for the EU, which claims to be an attempt to ensure that we do not have a return to the horrors of the 1930s, to have concentration camps with razor wire and barbed wire surrounding them penning in the most desperate and vulnerable people at Calais and on the Greek islands?  There is no other word for them.  They are concentration camps.  When one thinks about the numbers the EU has talked about accepting - 160,000 people - in light of the millions displaced in Jordan or its attempts at outsourcing the issue to a Turkish regime the human rights record of which is beyond disgusting in terms of its treatment of its own people, one must ask whether it is developments of this type that have led to the deep and growing disillusionment with and alienation from the EU?</p></speech>

The budgetary situation post-Brexit is an issue.  The UK is a net contributor to the EU budget to the tune of &euro;11 billion.  In the absence of member states providing another source of income to the European Commission and the institutions in order that they might deliver programmes, there will be reductions in expenditure to the value of &euro;11 billion across all the various programmes.  What will happen in the negotiations in 2019 will determine what level of funding will be given out of the smaller pot to the various programmes.</p></speech>

However, I do not expect that there will be any side deals.  It will be very open.</p></speech>

I do not want to adjudicate on the supremacy of the UK Parliament because it is subject to court proceedings and I do not know what will be the outcome of the case.  I will defer to Senator Paul Coghlan's superior knowledge on these matters in respect of the interaction he might have with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  These are very important legal proceedings and have been contested by the UK Government.  There is a tension between the UK Parliament and the UK Government about these issues, which will be resolved by the courts.</p> <p>  There are other trade agreements.  Many members have mentioned this.  If one were to write an agreement to satisfy the political philosophy of Deputy Boyd Barrett, the best one would be that with Canada.  Human rights, environmental issues and labour and food standards are very important for people and one could not write a better deal than the CETA agreement between the EU and Canada.  We have reached a stage where the Belgian Government is the only one that is not in agreement because of the regional governments' influence over the federal Government's decision-making in the institutional and constitutional arrangements in that country.  It is, however, an excellent deal.  The negotiations with the US in respect of TTIP are paused and will resume in the future depending on the attitude of the new US President.  That is the latest state of play and I have nothing further to report on the proposed arrangement.  We have opened up an enormous number of negotiations for free trade agreements and to upgrade some involving Mexico, the Philippines and Indonesia.  Next year, we will look at opportunities regarding New Zealand and Australia.  We attended meetings yesterday with the Chinese Government relating to an investment deal between the EU and China.  A deal with Japan may be concluded by March 2017.  Much work is ongoing on the trade side.  In respect of whether member states want a trade deal, it is a question of whether it is an EU competence or a mixed deal between the EU and the member states.  Members can see the difficulty we have in getting approval for even the one that is probably the best deal we ever did, which is the one between the EU and Canada.</p> <p>  The EU is its member states.  People often forget that.  It is not the European Commission.  It is the member states and the European Parliament.  This is where I agree completely with Senator Craughwell who said that we have to take responsibility for decisions.  If one is fed a diet of statements that Europe is a problem and Europe is bad over a 30-year period, as the UK citizens were, one would not expect to get a positive result in a referendum when the proposal was put.  The same is happening in a number of member states.  Prime ministers and governments across the EU have to make up their minds about whether or not they are going to be part of the project, and there are very good reasons why they should be, working collectively to deal with common issues.  They have to take responsibility for decisions they make that might be good for the country on some days while on other days, there might be difficulties in respect of citizens' engagement with a decision.  Warts and all, we must look at an overall strategy for these issues.  I encourage all member states to think long and hard about the collective responsibility required to deal with many difficult issues in the EU.  They are economic, social, environmental, migration and foreign policy issues.</p><p>A number of members asked about the possibility of an Irish person being on the negotiating team.  There will be no one from any member state on the negotiating team.  The chief negotiator just happens to be from France.  A task force will be established as an advisory group and there will be interaction between it and the team on a regular basis.  Ireland will be represented on the group.  That was always going to be the case.  As to the question of Ireland having someone on the team due to Ireland's importance <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK, that will not be the case.  I will describe the process.  The European Council, of which the Taoiseach is a member, will make the decision about the negotiators' mandate.  The Commission will do the work and the European Council will make the final decision.  We are an executive body that is doing the work for our politicians.  The European Parliament must decide as well.  As such, we must have a balanced agreement.<br/><br/>There is a strong view among the European institutions as well as the political institutions that will make these decisions that the four freedoms should be protected, those being, freedom of movement of people, good, services and capital.  This is the starting point.  It is why the European project exists.  The Single Market and the single mechanism - the European Union - that we use to deal with these movements comprise the reason for the project and for member states pooling some of their sovereignty with a view to taking a collegiate and common approach to many of our issues.<br/><br/>Deputy Haughey and others asked whether the Commission and other institutions had an appreciation of the Irish island approach and issues arising from our history, the Good Friday Agreement and the need to protect the gains that had been made through peace and reconciliation.  They have.  At the highest level, the European Commission is fully informed and satisfied with the situation in Ireland, namely, that there will be a unique set of circumstances on the island.  There are unique sets of circumstances on the island of Cyprus and in Spain in terms of Gibraltar.  I mention these as examples of unique situations that need to be resolved.  The Irish Government, which met Mr. Barnier last week, has made its views known.  They are also being made known at diplomatic and ministerial levels.  The special position of Northern Ireland and the North-South and Ireland-UK relationships have been, and will continue to be, well explained.<br/><br/>Many members stated that we should be making more progress on migration.  I agree.  The European Commission tabled many proposals in the past two years.  A proper migration policy was one of the Juncker priorities.  Member states did not agree.  The Commission's proposals are being rejected by member states.  The EU did not erect a wire fence anywhere, which Deputy Durkan alluded to and which is a sad reflection on the way the EU is in the collective sense.  Several member states made that decision, not the Commission.  It is all very well to say that Brussels did this and Brussels did that, but we have made substantial proposals to deal with the migration crisis.  We did a deal with Turkey to provide the best facilities that we could to address a humanitarian problem in that country arising from the displacement of people following the war in Syria.  We have had to do the same in Italy, Greece, Lebanon and Jordan.  We are major financiers of these projects.  We would prefer it if we did not have to make these moves and implement these policies, which are a significant cost to the European taxpayer, but these are the circumstances.  Families and individuals in war-torn regions are being displaced.<br/><br/>Given our history, we should know better than most the importance of helping people.  Over the years, we have been to the fore in providing humanitarian assistance through our missionaries and through our own emigrants to other shores in times of difficulty.  Through NGOs and overseas development aid, Ireland and other countries are doing a considerable amount of good work.  The European Commission has made available a significant amount of financial resources to deal with this difficult issue, which will only be resolved at a political level.  We are waiting for all sides to come to the table for meaningful discussions.  The committee knows how difficult it is just to keep the negotiations going.  The European Council is discussing these issues in terms of Russia, Ukraine, trade, Syria, etc.  It will be interesting to see the outcome.<br/><br/>A number of committee members mentioned taxation issues in the context of the recent high-profile Apple case.  There is nothing new in the way that the Commission conducted its investigation into the tax rulings.  The decision has nothing to do with tax rates or tax law in Ireland, rather Commissioner Vestager's decision has to do with the boundaries of aggressive tax planning being pushed out and constituting state aid.  This is the view of the Commission.  It resulted from the information supplied by Apple and the 2015 hearings in the US.  In our view, the company's effective tax rate varied from 1% to 0.005% of its profits.  It should not be surprised that this became an issue.  Ireland has the benefit of a 12.5% corporate tax rate.  The 1991 and 2007 tax rulings should have alerted authorities everywhere that this was an issue if they were being pursued to the extent of being aggressive tax planning.  This is not about interfering with a member state's tax rates, rather it is about how taxation was used for the purpose of constituting state aid where the treatment of the company in question and the rules of engagement concerning its tax planning were not available in a significant way to all other companies in Ireland.  The Commission has asked Ireland to collect the money because the head office was deemed to be in Ireland.  That head office is acknowledged by Apple to have been in Ireland.<br/><br/>Issues regarding the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, will be discussed by the Commission next week.  They do not concern tax rates, rather they concern establishing a CCCTB and rules around how tax is calculated in member states.  The CCCTB has been in the pipeline for the past ten years and has been discussed many times.  Taxation policy is not legislatively a part of the EU <i>per se</i>, but part of what we are considering are the rules on how one calculates tax.  We are engaging with governments to ensure that there is a constructive realisation, based on a number of tax rulings in many member states in recent years, that we have to find a way to work together to simplify the rules in the Common Market.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made a start on this in 2013.  With the help of the OECD, he was able to develop a scheme around base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, solutions and the knowledge box.  I was a member of the Cabinet when those matters were discussed in 2013.  Ireland is ahead in reforming its taxation laws in order to comply with some of the issues that are now on the agenda.<br/><br/>Many members expressed their concerns about the rise of populism in the EU.  I share their concerns.  Europe has come through a difficult time in terms of fiscal consolidation arising from the financial crisis.  Many simplistic solutions were proposed, but we need a banking system that works and is funded.  Whatever one's views are on how policy was applied and what instruments were used at European level, Ireland and other countries have come through those difficulties.  I was in Greece recently.  Its leader once had a different view of the world than he does today about the solutions to the problems in the financial affairs of the EU.</p><p>He is implementing with gusto some of the reforms he opposed three years ago.  There is a political party in Spain which had solutions similar to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's.  It lost ground in the recent elections in Spain.  Its vote decreased significantly.  There is a gradual realisation that it is not easy to fix all these fiscal, financial and economic problems.  The public is becoming aware that we need stability to have a growing economy.  We need stability for investment and certainty.  I welcome that governments realise they need to pay their way and that the gap between income and expenditure must be bridged to ensure we have a competitive European economy and a sound and stable financial system.<br/><br/>I could go on for a considerable time answering questions.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett raised the water charges issue.  Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, put a question to the Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Karmenu Vella, who is the relevant and appropriate Commissioner.  He received the following reply from the Commissioner:</p><blockquote>The Commission was informed by the Irish Authorities of the temporary suspension of water charges, pending a review by an Expert Water Commission.  The Commission reiterated to the Irish authorities its view on the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD)(1) and the need for Ireland to establish a robust funding system that secures the long-term quality of water and water services, especially as investment in water is clearly acknowledged as necessary by the Irish authorities themselves (2).<br /><br />It is now for the Expert Water Commission to get on with its task of assessing the funding of domestic public water services in Ireland and to make recommendations to the Irish Parliament on water pricing policy which comply with WFD requirements and allow Ireland to be able to finance the necessary improvements in water quality and infrastructure.</blockquote><p>I have nothing further to add.</p></speech>

His opening statement is very reassuring.  I thank him and his colleagues, Mr. Dermot Ryan and Mr. Tom Tynan, and I welcome Mr. Gerry Kiely, the head of the European Commission office in Ireland.  We look forward to meeting them again.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has invited the committee to go to Brussels to meet the Commissioner, maybe early in the new year, for further discussions and an update on what is happening.  The committee has a lead role in our response to Brexit.  We are attending the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for European Affairs, COSAC, meeting in November to put across the message on where we stand.  Everybody with influence must express where we stand in the difficult negotiations ahead.  The Commissioner is doing this in the Commission, although he has responsibility for all 28 countries at the moment.  We wish the Commissioner a safe journey back to Brussels and we look forward to seeing him again in the new year.  We thank him for his time, patience and response.</p></speech>

However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I call the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#A00500"><p>I welcome this opportunity to address members on recent developments at the Foreign Affairs Council.  A large number of issues were addressed by the Council on which I will provide an update to the committee.  In addition, I will look ahead to the November Council meeting.  Following that I would be happy to address any questions or issues the Chairman or the members may have and hear their perspectives on the foreign policy issues and challenges we currently face.</p> <p>  I will commence with the situation in Syria, which has remained a matter of constant concern at the Foreign Affairs Council over the past 12 months.  The European Union has sought to play a positive role and to work with all parties in the planned negotiations which were convened by the United Nations at the commencement of this year.  I very much regret that the Assad regime, with apparent backing from Russia and Iran, refused to engage in these talks and devoted its energies to undermining the talks and engineering a return to violence, without any regard for the suffering of the Syrian people.</p> <p>  I remain firmly of the view that there is no viable military solution in Syria.  Assad&rsquo;s total reliance on mass murder and torture shows that the only basis for his power is terrorising the Syrian people.  He can never hope to hold authority through the support of the Syrian population.  I expressed this recently in a D&aacute;il speech and I would note that this is also the consensus view of the international community from my many discussions with my EU colleagues as well as in my recent meetings at the United Nations in New York.</p> <p>  I believe the only viable and sustainable way forward remains a comprehensive end to violence and a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led political resolution based on a real political transition process.  That remains my objective and that of the European Union, which is reflected in the conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council at its most recent meeting on Monday last in Luxembourg.  EU Foreign Ministers called on Russia to demonstrate all efforts to halt indiscriminate bombing by the Syrian regime, restore a cessation of hostilities, ensure immediate humanitarian access and create the conditions for a credible and inclusive political transition.  This is critical to saving the lives of the Syrian people, particularly those who remain in the city of Aleppo.</p> <p>  The situation in Iraq remains extremely challenging.  The European Union repeatedly made clear its strong support for a democratic, non-sectarian, unified and independent Iraq.  There can be no peace in Iraq while Daesh remains in control of large areas of the country, subjecting millions of Iraqis to its totalitarian and barbaric cult of hate, murder and violence.  This will need major support for the victims of the conflict in Iraq, including the large numbers of Iraqis displaced by fear of Daesh, and both Ireland and the European Union are assisting the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population.  The EU is working to support the implementation of the Government of Prime Minister al-Abadi in reforming Iraq to achieve the national reconciliation which is so vital to securing the future of Iraq.</p> <p>  More broadly, on the matter of counter-terrorism, the Foreign Affairs Council has discussed the issue on a number of recent occasions, in particular, the need to counter Daesh.  In July, in the aftermath of the horrific Bastille Day attack in Nice, the discussions highlighted ongoing support for France, most practicably with regard to Article 42.7, first invoked following the November 2015 attacks in Paris.  Ireland responded to that call for aid and assistance through a commitment to increase the number of Defence Forces personnel involved in the EU training mission in Mali from ten to 18.</p> <p>  The earlier Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May focused on the regional strategy for Syria and Iraq and the threat of Daesh.  The conclusions unreservedly condemned the actions of Daesh and committed to engage in ways to prevent indiscriminate and targeted attacks, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2249.  They also outlined actions to enhance its counter-terrorism action further in a human rights compliant manner, including through high level engagement with MENA countries, Turkey and the western Balkans, reinforcing technical assistance to priority third countries in the development of national strategies to prevent and counter violent extremism, as well as strengthening measures to curb the recruitment and movement of foreign fighters, in particular through enhanced external border controls.</p> <p>  The past year has seen continued stasis in the Middle East peace process.  It was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in January and again in June, and EU Foreign Ministers also discussed it with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, in July of this year.</p><p>Outside the Council structures, there were two developments of note.  At the beginning of June, the French Government launched an initiative to inject some much-needed momentum into the Middle East peace process.  I was one of ten EU foreign Ministers to be invited to attend the initial meeting in Paris, along with others, including the United States, the United Nations and important regional players such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.  I commend the French Government on its efforts, which are continuing.  We will continue to support it in any way we can.  At the beginning of July, the Quartet published a long-awaited report which focused on the impediment to the two-state solution presented by the continued expansion of the settlements in the region.  While the report came in for some criticism, what is clear is that if its recommendations were implemented, it would represent a clear measure of progress.<br/><br/>I visited the region in mid-June and met Israeli and Palestinian leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and Prime Minister Hamdallah.  In all of my political meetings, I made clear my support, and the support of the Irish people, for the French initiative.  In my meetings I also made clear the interest of the Members of this House and of the Irish public in the matter of the Middle East peace process.<br/><br/>I was at the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, summit in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia when I heard of the attempted coup in Turkey on 15 July.  Along with other foreign Ministers, I swiftly condemned the failed coup and the associated loss of life and violence.  Since then, the situation in Turkey has been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council as well as at a specially convened meeting of the Council of Europe with the Turkish foreign Minister, Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avuolu, on 7 September at which I made Ireland's position clear.  I reiterated that the attempted coup was an attack on democracy.  I expressed my concern that some of the actions taken since the coup are contrary to democratic norms.<br/><br/>The scale of the post-coup purge in Turkey, which has seen large numbers of people detained or suspended from their jobs, the arrests of journalists and the closure of media outlets, is very worrying.  I also condemned the spate of terrorist attacks in Turkey, including those carried out by the so-called Islamic State or Daesh, the PKK or their affiliates in Turkey.  Ireland supports a stable and democratic Turkey.  We understand the depth of feeling that this attack on the core of democracy in Turkey has provoked.  However, it is critical that legal due process is a cornerstone of the Turkish authorities' response, and in that context, the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial remains essential.  The human rights and basic freedoms of minorities, including the Kurdish minority, must also be upheld as core principles.  It is critical for all sides to cease hostilities and return to dialogue in order that the political process to resolve the Kurdish issue can be resumed.<br/><br/>The EU and Turkey are working together to address the challenges of the migration crisis, where Turkey plays an invaluable role, as host to approximately 3 million refugees.  Migration remains a key challenge facing the European Union.  The Union has made substantial progress in addressing the migration crisis through a range of measures, including its relocation programme, the deal that EU leaders agreed with Turkey, dialogues with countries of origin and transit to tackle the root causes of migration, and Operation Sophia to deal with the problem of people smuggling in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The deal agreed with Turkey by EU Heads of State and Government in March 2016 has been a major element in the EU's migration response.  The reduction in the number of lives lost in the Aegean Sea as well as the reduction in the number of migrants entering the European Union from Turkey since the deal was agreed suggests that it is achieving its aims.  The need to comply with European Union and international law was at the heart of the discussions leading to the deal and this issue was a matter of deep concern to us.<br/><br/>We in Ireland have been playing our part.  We have resettled 486 refugees from Lebanon while 69 Syrians have been relocated from Greece, a number which I expect to rise to 60 to 80 people per month soon.  We can be extremely proud of the work undertaken by our Naval Service in the Mediterranean, which has rescued more than 13,000 people.  We have also provided to date a sum of &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syrians and the region since 2012 and we have also contributed to other humanitarian funds.<br/><br/>Last month, Ireland co-facilitated a UN summit in New York to address large movements of refugees and migrants with the aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and co-ordinated approach to the issue.  The results of the summit, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, will now be built on with the aim of securing international agreements on both refugees and migrants in 2018.<br/><br/><b></b>I wish to turn to the matter of Ukraine and the eastern neighbourhood.  The Council had a discussion in January on Ukraine where the focus was on the country&rsquo;s reform process.  Ministers acknowledged the achievement of the government in moving forward with the reform programme in most challenging circumstances.  At the same time, they stressed the need for continued implementation of key reform measures, in particular those related to the justice sector, the matter of public administration, the issue of decentralisation and the continuing fight against corruption.<br/><br/>Ministers underlined the significant assistance being provided for the reform efforts by the European Commission and by member states.  They also agreed that the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement in place since 1 January 2016 has opened up new opportunities for Ukraine to benefit economically from closer trading links with the European Union.  The Council reiterated the strong support of the European Union for sovereignty in Ukraine, the territorial integrity of its borders and its continued commitment to help end the conflict in the eastern Donbas region.  The need to move forward on implementation of the Minsk agreements was also highlighted.<br/><br/>On Monday of this week, I met foreign Minister Klimkin at a Friends of Ukraine meeting which took place before the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg.  The Minister provided an update on the current security situation in eastern Ukraine and the important political and economic reforms that the Ukrainian Government has introduced.  I assured Minister Klimkin of Ireland&rsquo;s full support for Ukraine as it continues on a reform path that is difficult but necessary for the future prosperity of the country and its people.<br/><br/>On the matter of Russia, at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in March, Ministers had a comprehensive exchange on EU relations with Russia.  There was broad agreement that a change in the relationship was not warranted, given Russia&rsquo;s continued support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine and its role in the conflict in Syria.  Ministers approved a set of five principles to guide European Union policy towards Russia, including confirmation that implementation of the Minsk agreements would be a key condition for any substantial change in the European Union&rsquo;s stance.  It was also agreed that the European Union would step up support for Russian civil society and strengthen people-to-people contacts.<br/><br/>Ministers acknowledged that selective engagement with Russia could only be pursued on foreign policy issues and specific sectoral areas of interest to the European Union.  I underlined the full support of Ireland for the guiding principles and stressed the importance of continued EU unity in our dealings with Russia.  On economic sanctions, there was broad agreement that the lack of progress on the Minsk implementation and Russia&rsquo;s unwillingness to engage constructively in the trilateral contact group negotiations made it inevitable that the restrictive measures would remain in place.<br/><br/>Since the March discussion, developments have taken a turn for the worse.  In June, the Council extended the European Union economic sanctions for a further six months up to and including 31 January 2017.  This decision was taken in light of the deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine with daily firefights between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian armed forces.  According to the OSCE special monitoring mission, August recorded the highest number of ceasefire violations in the past 12 months.  Intensive efforts within the framework of the OSCE trilateral contact group to make progress on the security and political strands of the Minsk agreements have made little headway.  The situation has improved somewhat in the past four weeks after both sides agreed to a back-to-school truce on 1 September which, I am pleased to say, is largely holding.  Agreement was also reached last month on a roadmap which envisages moving forward on parallel political and security tracks.  The first step involves implementation of a disengagement plan, initially at three key locations before being rolled out along the entire contact line.  I believe it is vital that the disengagement plan is implemented speedily as without a secure ceasefire there is no prospect of the Ukrainian Government agreeing to move forward with legislative proposals for the holding of local elections in the Donbas region and the granting of special status to the region, two key provisions of the Minsk agreements.<br/><br/>It is too early to assess if this latest initiative, on which OSCE, French and German negotiators have worked so hard, will result in a secure ceasefire and the full withdrawal of weapons.  Hopes have been raised before of a breakthrough only to be quickly dashed.  Later today, the European Council will have a strategic discussion on relations with Russia.  Given the lack of progress in eastern Ukraine and Russia&rsquo;s military actions in Syria, a change in the European Union's position is not expected.<br/><br/>Turning to the eastern partners, an eastern partnership ministerial meeting was held prior to the Foreign Affairs Council in May and EU foreign Ministers met again with the foreign Ministers of the six eastern partner countries at the informal Foreign Affairs Council in Bratislava in September.</p><p>The Eastern Partnership will also be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, in November.  The EU supports reform to meet the expectations of the Moldovan people and continues to press for improvements in the human rights situation in Belarus.  The November FAC is expected to consider the conduct and outcome of recent elections in both countries.<br/><br/>In order to assist the EU to meet the challenges and opportunities posed by ongoing instability in the international context, the High Representative and Vice President, Federica Mogherini, presented a new EU global strategy on foreign and security policy to the June European Council.  The preparation of this new strategy was led by Ms Mogherini.  She consulted closely with the member states but presented the strategy on her own responsibility to the June European Council.  Ireland was actively engaged in the consultation process for the strategy, including at the FAC.  The strategy sets out a vision for the EU's foreign and security policy and commits the EU to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  It aims to mobilise all aspects of the EU's external action &ndash; diplomatic, economic development, trade and peacekeeping - in pursuit of coherent policy objectives.  Irish perspectives and concerns have been taken on board to a large extent in the document.<br/><br/>The strategy stresses the importance of promoting and protecting human rights, development co-operation, conflict resolution and global governance to address the root causes of the challenges, such as migration and extremism, currently facing the EU.  Other positive elements from an Irish perspective include a focus on the Middle East peace process, disarmament, gender, the UN and the importance of multilateralism more generally.<br/><br/>The June European Council welcomed the presentation of the strategy and invited the High Representative, the Commission and the Council to take the work forward.  These conclusions make clear that any implementation of the strategy will be negotiated and agreed with the member states.  Last Monday, at the FAC, I emphasised that all strands of the strategy should be progressed to realise its stated ambition to promote &ldquo;peace and security, prosperity, democracy and a rules-based global order&rdquo;.  I also welcomed the commitment in the strategy to continue to mainstream human rights, women, peace and security and gender equality across a range of EU policies.  These two important elements were reflected in the conclusions adopted by EU foreign Ministers.  An implementation plan for the security and defence strand of the strategy will be presented to foreign and defence Ministers at the November FAC meeting.  This will focus on enhancing the EU's peacekeeping capacity in support of the United Nations through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy as defined in the Treaty of Lisbon.<br/><br/>The worrying situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was discussed at the FAC on in June.  Along with our European partners, we remain concerned about the ongoing political instability, but welcome the efforts of the political parties to redress the situation and introduce a measure of reform.  We are pleased that the political parties have agreed that elections can take place on 11 December.  I also had a bilateral meeting with the Macedonian Foreign Minister, Mr. Poposki, <i>en marge</i>of the OSCE ministerial meeting at Potsdam on 1 September, at which I recognised the efforts of the political parties in implementing the July agreement and urged them to continue the commitment to reform and progress.<br/><br/>I welcomed the adoption of the Council conclusions on China at the FAC on 18 July, which provide the policy framework for EU engagement with China over the coming years.  I also welcomed the outcomes of the EU-China summit, held in Beijing on 12 and 13 July.  A number of items were discussed at the FAC in July, including the verdict of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague on the South China Sea maritime dispute between China and the Philippines; foreign policy issues including bilateral security co-operation; the EU's China strategy and the positive prospects for enhanced EU-China co-operation; China's desire for World Trade Organization, WTO, market economy status; Brexit; and the ongoing important issue of human rights.  Ireland continues to support a broad, positive approach to continuing co-operation with China and stresses the need to speak with one voice on China.  This will help both sides focus on the challenges and opportunities arising from this very important relationship.<br/><br/>The FAC last discussed Colombia in April, when we had an opportunity to receive a briefing from the Colombian Government's High Commissioner for Peace, Mr. Sergio Jaramillo, and from the EU special envoy to the Colombian peace process, my predecessor and former D&aacute;il Member, Mr. Eamon Gilmore.  We also briefly discussed progress in the peace talks at the FAC in July.  There have been significant developments in the months since then, not least the conclusion of negotiations between the Government and FARC, the signature of a peace agreement, and its subsequent unexpected narrow rejection by the people of Colombia in a plebiscite on 2 October.  The message we have been stressing to our Colombian interlocutors is that the decision of the Colombian electorate to narrowly reject the peace agreement must not deter the two sides from pursuing peace.  As we know from our own experience here in Ireland, peace processes are difficult, complex, complicated and can suffer unexpected setbacks.  They are never linear.  We are, therefore, urging all parties in Colombia to remain committed to the peace process and focused on their ultimate objective of bringing peace to their country.  I am pleased to see that the various parties have begun a process of consultation in order to identify how the process might move forward.  The role of the EU's special envoy, Mr. Gilmore, is of particular importance and in that regard, he has been working with both sides in Havana to encourage constructive solutions.  In meetings at EU level in the weeks since the plebiscite, Ireland has been to the fore in encouraging the EU to maintain a positive approach.  We have made clear Ireland&rsquo;s intentions to remain fully committed to supporting the Colombian peace process, including through supporting the special envoy, Mr. Gilmore, assisting the efforts of NGOs working to promote and defend human rights and facilitating Colombian access to lessons learned from the peace process in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>More broadly, developments in Latin America and the Caribbean were discussed briefly at the FAC in July and the main focus, aside from the Colombian peace process, was the humanitarian situation in Venezuela and the political dialogue and co-operation agreement with Cuba.  On Venezuela, Council conclusions were agreed which called for an urgent, constructive and effective dialogue between the Venezuelan Government and the parliamentary majority to address the country&rsquo;s many challenges.  Ireland, along with the rest of the EU member states, remains concerned about the humanitarian situation in Venezuela and in particular issues connected with human rights defenders and civil and political rights.  On Cuba, it is hoped the political dialogue and co-operation agreement between Cuba and the EU will be signed by the end of this year, and it is further anticipated that a bilateral memorandum of understanding between Cuba and Ireland will be finalised before 2017.  These advances are evidence of an ongoing rapprochement between Cuba and the EU, as well as Cuba's reopening to the world in more general terms, which we warmly welcome.  On the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York this September, I was pleased to have bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Argentina, as well as the vice-foreign minister of Bolivia.  This is all part of a stepping up of our engagement with the region, as foreseen in the programme for partnership Government.<br/><br/>Ireland supported the Council conclusions for continued climate diplomacy in 2016 agreed at the FAC held in Brussels on 15 February 2016.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is underlined by our own national response in terms of policy and legislation and the planning processes we have under way for both mitigation and adaptation.  It was also demonstrated when Ireland agreed, ahead of other member states, to the EU ratifying the Paris Agreement.  This contributed to the upcoming entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which will take place on 4 November 2016.  We have this week started the process to ratify the Paris Agreement.  At COP21 in Paris the Taoiseach committed Ireland to scaling up climate finance and announced that Ireland will provide at least &euro;175 million in public funding, mainly for adaptation in developing countries, by 2020 and additional contributions to the least developed countries fund.  In 2015, my Department provided &euro;36 million to the poorest countries of the world for climate related redevelopment programmes and a contribution of &euro;1 million per year is being provided to the least developed countries fund.<br/><br/>Ireland supported the adoption of the Sahel Council conclusions in June, which reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to the region.  Support for the Malian peace process remains essential for a stable and secure Sahel.</p><p>A number of terrorist attacks across the G5 Sahel countries - Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - continue to remind us that terrorism remains a critical issue in this region.  The Council condemned attacks on civilians and members of the UN peacekeeping force in Mali.  It also supported a comprehensive approach to tackling other challenges faced by the countries in the Sahel, including development, irregular migration and organised crime.</p><p> Ireland has supported the comprehensive EU position in the Sahel in a number of ways.  Eighteen members of the Irish Defence Forces are participating in the EU training mission in Mali at present.  The objective of the mission is to assist in the reconstruction of effective and accountable Malian armed forces.  Furthermore, Ireland supports the civilian mission in Mali in its goal of ensuring constitutional and democratic order and fulfilling conditions for a lasting peace in Mali through the deployment of two advisers.  To further show our commitment to security in the region, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will visit Mali on 25 and 26 October.  Ireland has participated in technical discussions regarding the migration compacts and the proposed programme actions of the EU trust fund for Africa, to which we have committed &euro;3 million for the 2016-20 period.  In addition, Irish Aid has provided over &euro;16 million in humanitarian and development funding to the G5 Sahel countries since 2013.</p><p> I thank members for their time and patience in allowing me to review the agenda the Foreign Affairs Council has faced in recent months.  I think they will agree that it has been a varied and diverse agenda.  I have focused my remarks on the Council&rsquo;s deliberations, as we agreed I would do.  I will be happy to address any questions or queries that members may have.  I look forward to hearing their perspectives on these issues and other issues they might wish to raise in the time allocated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.792" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his detailed presentation, which reflects the huge number of serious issues on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The continuing senseless loss of life, relentless bombing and inhumane attacks on civilians in Syria demand that the international community, through the UN and other international bodies, bring the horrific five-year war in that country to an end.  We have all received correspondence from citizens on this island who are concerned that humanitarian assistance is not reaching areas like eastern Aleppo.  The Government must continue to speak out in the strongest possible terms in reflection of the strong concerns of the Irish people about the inhumane attacks on civilians in Syria.  The bombardment of civilian populations has to be stopped.  An end must be brought to the humanitarian crisis.  The Minister concluded the section of his speech on Syria by saying that the conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council are "critical to save the lives of the Syrian people, particularly those who remain in the city of Aleppo".  Sadly, that sentence reflects the fact that we are witnessing the wipe-out of a city and its people.</p> <p>  I ask members to try to confine what they have to say to the asking of questions, if at all possible.  If their contributions are relatively brief, it might be possible to for them to have a second round as well so that we can have a full engagement with the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.793" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#D00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.  I will do my level best to be brief.  The Minister's statement covered a multitude.</p> <p>  I want to focus first and foremost on the situation in Syria.  As the Chairman and the Minister have said, we condemn the ongoing military actions of the Syrian regime, aided and abetted by Russia, in the strongest possible terms.  I am particularly concerned about how our Government is responding to this crisis through the Minister.  When was the last time the Minister met the Russian ambassador to convey the concerns of the Government and the Irish people regarding the ongoing situation in Aleppo and the use of bunker-busting bombs on hospitals, schools and medical facilities?  On 4 October last, my party leader directly asked the Taoiseach whether he or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade had "summoned the Russian ambassador or discussed the summoning of same to convey our views and raised the matter at European Union level with a request for common action".  In his reply, the Taoiseach said that "the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Russian ambassador last Tuesday and left him in no uncertain terms as to how this country feels".  The Taoiseach concluded that reply by saying "I repeat that our Minister last Tuesday called in the Russian ambassador, leaving him in no uncertain position as to the way this country feels about the humanitarian catastrophe that has afflicted Syria for some time and Aleppo in particular".  That did not happen.  The Minister did not call in the Russian ambassador.  I put it to the committee that the Taoiseach misled the House.  I met the Russian ambassador to convey my party's concerns about his Government's role in what is happening in Aleppo.  The Taoiseach, who is the Minister's party leader, told the House that "the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Russian ambassador", but that did not happen.  When was the last time the Minister met the Russian ambassador?  It was clarified in response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Crowe that two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade conveyed the concerns.  Was that meeting specifically about Syria?  Why did the Taoiseach feel it was appropriate to tell the D&aacute;il that the Minister had called in the Russian ambassador when that had not happened?  I would like to know when the Minister last met the Russian ambassador.</p> <p>  Following on from that, can the Minister confirm that Ireland will vote against Russia's election to the UN Human Rights Council?  From an EU perspective, existing diplomatic efforts have not delivered a ceasefire.  The Lavrov-Kerry initiative is probably the way forward.  What specific pressure can the EU apply on the warring parties?  As we all know, this is the most major humanitarian crisis on our borders.  We could do a lot more.  The very least this crisis deserves is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to personally convey our disgust at what is happening in Syria.</p> <p>  I would like to ask briefly about third party or third-country arrangements, particularly the EU-Turkey arrangement.  I reject fully the Minister's assertion that "substantial progress" has been made through the EU-Turkey deal.  The Minister told us that 69 Syrians have been relocated to this country, but 14 months ago the Government committed to taking 4,000 people.  The Minister said he hopes to increase the number of relocations to this country to between 40 and 60 per month soon.  I heard that in March of this year.  The position is not improving.  Can the Minister confirm that none of the &euro;20.9 million given by the Irish Government on behalf of Irish taxpayers towards the EU-Turkey arrangement is being used for security and containment measures?  Can he confirm that all of the money in question is being used for the well-being and security of refugees?  It is my party's belief, and my belief as my party's foreign affairs spokesperson, that these third-country arrangements completely undermine the rights of asylum seekers, migrants and refugees.  The EU-Turkey arrangement is one of a number of arrangements that the EU is looking to enter into.  Most recently, the EU proposed to relocate 80,000 refugees to Afghanistan.  Turkey has its issues but - God almighty - Afghanistan does likewise.  I would like the Minister to address these questions in the first instance.  I hope to come in again in the second round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.794" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#D00400"><p>While I will not go back over everything Deputy Darragh O'Brien has said about Syria, I want to emphasise that our efforts at the diplomatic level need to be much stronger.  I refer not only to our diplomatic efforts with Russia and Iran, but also to our efforts with all the countries that are involved in the bombing of Syria.  Some of those countries are members of the EU and the Foreign Affairs Council.  I think the point has to be made to all of them that the indiscriminate bombing has to stop.  At the very least, there should be a strong call for a lengthy ceasefire of at least a week so that medical evacuations can take place and medical facilities and food can be brought in.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on whether we are doing enough at diplomatic level, including with the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  Are our views and those of the EU as a whole about the need for this to stop being heard?</p> <p>  I would also like to speak about overseas development aid.  Can the Minister clarify exactly where the &euro;10 million increase went?  It has been acknowledged that there has been a decrease in percentage terms.  We are moving further away from the 0.7% target.</p><p>How will the Minister and Government move back towards the 0.7% target?  </p><p> I was at the launch of a book last night on the work and impact of Irish missionaries through Misean Cara.  It has to be acknowledged that our missionaries were Irish aid before there was Irish Aid.  The work they did to ensure our reputation when it comes to providing aid is being undermined by the way in which we are buying into certain trade agreements.  We are not looking at the impact of those trade agreements on the countries of the global south and beyond and their ability to feed themselves.  These trade agreements can have a detrimental effect on the ability of countries to feed themselves.  It is leading to rural flight.   Can we do a human rights assessment, as the Danish group Arla has, of the effects of EU and Irish investments, particularly agricultural investments?  They are having a bad effect on African farms and farmers.  The line we are taking on trade is inconsistent with our Irish Aid policy.</p><p> My final point is on Cuba.  It was good to see it included in the Minister's speech but the economic, commercial and financial blockade of Cuba continues and is having a detrimental effect on Cuban society.  It is great that President Higgins will go to Cuba in February.  Ireland is part of the resolution to ban the blockade but are we doing enough?  Will this also bring about a real change that will see the sanctions being lifted?  Will it have an impact on our banks' ability to do business with Cuba because at the moment they cannot?  If there is any account in an Irish bank with the word Cuba in it, it is stopped.  I would like the Minister's response to that.  Are there plans for a trade mission to Cuba at some stage?  How can we have one if the banking issues continue and America is telling Irish banks with whom they may do business.</p></speech>

It is timely given the very great concern that has been expressed and which we all share about the mounting casualties in Aleppo and Syria.  I echo the words of the Chairman and colleagues on that.  On the initiative of Labour Party Senators and I, there is an all-party motion before the Seanad today condemning the attacks in Syria, calling on the Government to continue to use all available diplomatic means to raise the issue and to work towards an end to the aerial bombardment and a genuine cessation of violence.  It echoes the words of the EU Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week.  While the Minister says it represents a consensus view of the international community, unfortunately, as we know, the consensus is not shared by Russia which is deeply complicit in the war crimes being committed in Syria, particularly in Aleppo.  The Russian foreign Minister's article in the British press at the weekend expressed the very clear view of the Russia Government that it will continue the bombardment.  It will continue unless we scale up diplomatic action against it.</p> <p>  The Minister is right that there is no military solution but we need to work harder.  Ireland needs to do more and express in stronger and clearer terms our condemnation of not only the Syrian Government, but its backers, notably Russia.  Last night, the French and German heads of Government, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande and Angela Merkel, ramped up their language, with Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande calling what is happening in Aleppo a war crime and calling for maximum pressure to be placed on Russia.  Will Ireland support what seems to be a French and German push for enhanced sanctions against Russia?  It is up for discussion at the meeting of the European Council this afternoon.  Will Ireland share that view?  As Deputy O'Brien asked, will we vote against Russia's election to the United Nations Human Rights Council?  Will we support the continuation of sanctions beyond 31 January 2017?  Deputy O'Brien also called on the Minister to call the Russian ambassador in directly to put those questions to him and express Irish support for the French and German position.  It is very important that we do so.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the back-to-school truce in Ukraine, which is currently holding.  Can the Minister say what the consequence will be for Russia if it does not hold?  How long will the truce be tested to see if it is holding?  What position will Ireland take to ensure Russia is held to account for the appalling treatment of civilians in Ukraine?</p> <p>  On the issue of refugees, which others have raised, the resettlement programme from Lebanon has so far led to 486 persons being admitted.  That is welcome but we are still nowhere near the 4,000 that was promised.  The Minister pointed out that 69 people have been relocated through the relocation programme from Greece.  There have been serious problems with operating the planned relocation from Italy.  Irish personnel have not been allowed to work in Italy to ensure the facilitation of admission of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other countries through Italy as was originally anticipated.  The Minister says he hopes to see an increase soon.  We have been hearing that for some months now.  Can the Minister give a precise timeframe?  Can he say whether progress has been made in ensuring that the relocation programme will operate from Italy as well as from Greece?</p></speech>

We all welcome the eight-hour humanitarian corridor that has been established in Aleppo but there are already reports in the media that it has broken down.  Will the Minister join me in demanding that all these allegations of war crimes are investigated?  What is the view of the Irish Government on the allegations of war crimes?  Are we doing, saying or proposing anything different to address the allegations of war crimes coming out of Syria and Iraq?  On Saturday, 8 October, the UN Security Council highlighted its structural dysfunction, when two resolutions on Syria were defeated.  The draft resolution by Russia, which did not include a bombing halt, was rejected and so too was the other motion.  There is a view that sustained and repeated pressure is required to ensure the war in Syria is stopped.  What proposals are coming from Ireland in this regard?  What are we doing with like-minded states outside the EU?  What states are we working with?  There has been some suggestion that a no-fly zone be put in place to end the aerial bombing of Aleppo.  Does the Irish Government have a view on that?  Who would enforce it?  Would it be Russia, the Turks, or the US?  That is the big difficulty with that suggestion.  If one talks about the human casualties in Aleppo, one must bear in mind that what is happening in Mosul is similar and there is probably a bigger population.  There are difficulties with that.  At the end of the day, people want to come up with resolutions that will actually work.</p> <p>  CETA and the proposals resulting from it were discussed yesterday.  Does the Minister share my concerns that neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade nor the D&aacute;il had any real input into the discussions on it?  With many of these trade agreements, the only opportunity Members have to discuss the deal is at the end.  Does the Minister or his Department have a view on that?</p> <p>  There is some concern about Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution, which states: "The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann."  CETA will introduce an investment court system for the first time in Ireland which could place significant charges on public funds.  Has the Minister any concerns about that?  There is some suggestion that the Government's support of the provisional application of CETA without D&aacute;il approval violates Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution.  I am interested in the Minister's response to that.</p> <p>  The issue of refugees has been mentioned by all contributors.  Only 69 Syrians have come to Ireland from Greece.  The Minister mentions in his note that the figure will increase to 80 per month very soon.  What has changed to allow for this increase?  Can the Minister give us a separate note on the difficulties being experienced with regard to the issue of refugees?</p><p>We are constantly being told that there are difficulties, but I have no sense of what they are.  This information would be useful for us.  Going through it in this format would be difficult, but I would appreciate it if we could be given a sense of the problem.  There is general support across the House regarding the refugee crisis.  It is important that we be informed so that we can inform our electorates, including those who have concerns.</p><p> Italy, one of the front-line states, has been mentioned.  Why is no one coming from Italy?  What is the difficulty?  More than 6,500 people were rescued in one weekend by various international naval services.  It puts the small number that we are accepting in context.</p><p> I am concerned about the situation in Yemen.  The Saudi-led coalition stands accused of war crimes.  On a Saturday, there was an air strike on a funeral hall that killed some 150 people.  There has been mention of the use of cluster bombs and so on.  Does the Minister support an international and independent investigation into these suspected war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition?</p><p> I have mentioned the civilian population of Mosul in Iraq.  The UN is preparing for what could be the largest man-made humanitarian crisis of recent times.  How will the Department help with that response?  We have been fairly good to date.</p><p> The difficulties in Turkey have been mentioned.  Is the Minister aware that 60 party activists of the leftist and pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party, HDP, and the Democratic Regions Party, DBP, were recently arrested?  I have concerns about this.  Does the Minister support the notion of a dialogue?  Will he join me in calling on the Turkish Government to grant immediate access to lawyers and families for those accused?  I call on the Turkish Government to end its campaign of arrests.</p><p> I will revert to the Minister with some other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.799" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  This has been a wide-ranging discussion.  We have spent an inordinate amount of time on Brexit but, to keep it on the agenda at every opportunity and emphasise the fact that the EU is its own peace process, I note we have an ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland.  By any measure, Brexit has a destabilising effect on it.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of Palestinians, settlement building and the sale of settlement goods despite all sorts of resolution at international level, will the Minister tackle it at EU level?</p> <p>  We have agreed to take in 4,000 refugees.  Is there a target date for meeting that figure?</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of EU militarism, I note the Minister's statements on the Common Security and Defence Policy and peace and capacity building.  I was in Rome with the Minister's current ministerial colleagues, Deputies Breen and Stanton, when the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, stated that we would be scaling down Mare Nostrum because it was saving too many people in the Mediterranean.  As a consequence, hundreds of people died when the weather improved the following year, so work had to be scaled up again.  Ms Mogherini knew that, by scaling down Mare Nostrum and the rescue missions, people were going to die.  The EU does not have much real concern about humanitarianism in any way, shape or form or in peace and capacity building.</p> <p>  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, was more honest when he stated that we had to move towards common military assets.  That does not sound like peace building.  Time and again, the Italians have stated that the EU needs to replace the US on our borders.  We have seen much of what the US has done in the Middle East.  We cannot agree that we should replicate such military adventures.</p> <p>  I noted something with considerable disappointment.  It is amazing that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's statement of strategy 2015-17 mentions all sorts of matters - the UN, the EU, peace and capacity building and values - but it does not mention Irish neutrality.  When I asked for a reply, I was told that the statement of strategy was not solely a policy document, but an articulation of how we intended to implement our programme.  If neutrality is a core value of this State, one imagines that a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade statement of strategy that does not mention it says much more than anything else could.  I am concerned about the EU's intentions and its aim to set up a military headquarters and increase common military assets.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to keep raising the issue of Ibrahim Halawa at European level.  This committee will discuss it again at another point.  His legal team is to appear before us.  It is an important issue, given that an Irish citizen is in jail in Egypt.</p></speech>

He has been a busy man in recent months.  As he knows, my role in the US is to represent the Irish undocumented and try to get legalisation for them, but I have learned that Ireland has many thousands of undocumented immigrants.  The Minister might help me in trying to establish the exact number.</p> <p>  I wish to bring another matter to the Minister's attention.  Refugees were found in a container only a couple of days ago.  More than 4,000 people are in direct provision in Ireland.  What moves are being made to accelerate their cases for adjudication?  Families have been in one hotel in Galway for more than ten years.  Their plight is diabolical and the conditions in which they are living are terrible.  Their children can attend secondary school, but they cannot receive third level education.  What are we doing in this regard?</p></speech>

I am amazed that there was nothing about neutrality in the Minister's statement.  I get the sense that, behind the scenes as opposed to through the Minister, there is a constant fear that we might be regarded as outsiders in Europe because of our stance on neutrality.  Our neutral position is so important that we have contributed much through the UN in peacekeeping missions around the world.  We should be proud of the role that the Defence Forces play in peacekeeping missions, be it a 500-person mission in Lebanon or a 20-person mission in other parts of the Middle East or elsewhere.  The missions are equally important.  The most important thing that this country can contribute to world peace is to continue our neutrality.  While we are full members of the EU, there is no obligation on us to join in with European policy on building up a European force or anything else.  Our neutrality is something we should protect very carefully.  When the Minister gets the opportunity to reply, will he assure us that the independent and neutral role we play, and the importance of it, will never be undermined as long as we hold our position on neutrality?</p></speech>

The current situation in Aleppo is somewhat beyond description.  We know that the Assad regime has, since the beginning of the conflict, used military force against the civilian population, which is totally unacceptable.  It has shelled food markets, bakeries, schools and hospitals and has used chemical weapons repeatedly and indiscriminately.  The use of starvation and a denial of humanitarian relief as weapons against the Syrian people is outrageous and has killed thousands.  What we are seeing is a clear escalation of the deliberate policy on the part of the Assad regime of fighting a war against its own civilians.  I have discussed this matter as recently as Monday with my foreign affairs colleagues in Luxembourg and there was a clear consensus that the situation is appalling and that the action of the regime and its allies, including Russia, may well amount to war crimes.  We stated that and I have said it publicly.  After a four hour debate on Monday, we agreed a very strong statement.</p> <p>  The Russian offer of an eight hour window of respite from bombing in Aleppo is small relief to a civilian population under siege and bombardment.  I do not think that the Russian offer of an eight hour ceasefire is sufficient at all.  It will not even allow for the evacuation of those who wish to leave the besieged city.  I have made the position of the Irish Government and people clear in repeated statements.  </p> <p>  On the matter of the Russian ambassador, I would say to Deputy Darragh O'Brien that it is normal practice for a foreign Minister to have his or her views conveyed to an ambassador through his or her most senior officials.  In this case, on two occasions, that was done, exclusively and specifically with regard to the situation in Syria.  I have made my views known on the record of this House and have made them known at the Foreign Affairs Council.  Indeed, I played an active role in crafting the strong statement following the meeting of the council in Luxembourg.  I know that Deputy O'Brien feels very strongly about the situation in Syria, as we all do, but I am really surprised that he is focusing his attention on what is a semantic issue.</p></speech>

That is exactly what the Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il, namely, that I had called in the Russian ambassador.  The latter was told in no uncertain terms how I, the Taoiseach and the people of this country feel about the ongoing human catastrophe unfolding in Syria and particularly in Aleppo.  That is exactly what the Taoiseach said and that is correct.  On my direct instructions, the ambassador was called into my Department and my concerns were fully and clearly communicated to him by two of my most senior officials.  I am very happy to meet the Russian ambassador but I believe the Irish public would rather see a constructive discussion on the substantive issues at play in the horrific conflict in Aleppo and Syria rather than time being spent in the D&aacute;il and at this committee on an attempt by the Opposition to embarrass the Government.</p></speech>

We have released &euro;62 million since the conflict began and we are using our influence in the United Nations and the European Union to support a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p> <p>  I am happy to meet the Russian ambassador.  I have discussed the crisis in Syria and Aleppo with the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Frederica Mogherini, and with all of my EU foreign ministerial colleagues.  The bottom line is that there is no doubt as to Ireland's views on Syria and Aleppo.  We will continue to raise this issue at every level.  I have referred to the humanitarian support.  There are currently 13.5 million people in Syria in need of critical humanitarian assistance.  Our voice will continue to be heard and we will continue to do all we can to influence what is an appalling situation in Aleppo.</p> <p>  A number of Deputies raised the issues of Turkey and migration.  Deputy O'Brien referred to Turkey, migration and the matter of aid.  Activities funded in Turkey to date have been primarily in the areas of humanitarian assistance, health and education.  Of particular note are contracts for direct grants worth a total of &euro;600 million, approximately &euro;300 million of which is for education and the remainder for health.  Deputy O'Brien stated that he has some concern about the manner in which this money is being expended.  I would be very happy to hear from him if he has evidence of any abuse of spending.</p></speech>

At a recent conference in Brussels, participating states, including Ireland, pledged the sum of &euro;13.6 billion in support of Afghanistan over a four year period from 2017 to 2020.  EU-Afghanistan co-operation on migration is addressed in the strategy, Joint Way Forward on migration issues between Afghanistan and the EU, which was signed in Kabul on 2 October.  The strategy aims to provide a smooth, dignified and orderly return of Afghan nationals who do not fulfil conditions for remaining within the European Union, provided all relevant international law and legal procedures are fully considered.  The strategy document provides for re-integration assistance with specific humanitarian consideration for vulnerable groups, including women and children.  I am happy to keep the House fully informed of developments in the implementation of that strategy.  </p> <p>  Senator Ivan Bacik mentioned Ukraine and she is right in arguing that the situation there is most fragile.  It is important that due consideration is given by all parties to the provisions of the Minsk agreement.  Senator Bacik mentioned the current situation with regard to sanctions over Ukraine and asked whether sanctions should also be applied in response to Russian activities in Syria.  This is an issue that may well be under consideration but I have not seen any proposals as such.  I note the Senator's comments regarding initiatives on the part of France and Germany but without having seen firm proposals, it would be unwise of me to speculate on any measures at this stage.  The situation is currently under review.</p><p>I believe there is an urgent and overwhelming need for legal accountability for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and what can be described as genocide in Syria.  The referral of the conflict in Syria to the International Criminal Court is not only appropriate but is in fact overdue.  I will support efforts in that regard.</p><p> Senator Bacik raised Ireland's contribution to dealing with the migration crisis and the progress on the settlement of asylum seekers and refugees.  Members will be aware from previous discussions that the Government has agreed to accept 4,000 asylum seekers.  We have now settled 486 out of a target of 520 people under the refugee protection programme.  I agree with members that progress on the relocation programme has been slow in Ireland, as well as in all our partner EU member states.  To date a total of 69 Syrians have come to Ireland from Greece.  We are actively engaged to ensure that these numbers are increased.  The situation in regard to Italy is problematic.  I have been speaking about these difficulties to my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, who attended a meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council recently.  We are concerned at the bureaucratic nature of the delays in dealing with the situation in Italy.  We hope the issues can be dealt with early but I share Senator Bacik's concern.  In regard to the humanitarian response, it is important that we acknowledge the work of our Defence Forces and the Naval Service personnel who have rescued more than 13,000 people in the Mediterranean since last year.  As Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, a former Minister for Defence, noted, we are all very proud of the role of our personnel in that region.  If we can do more, we certainly will.  I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's comments on the appalling situation in Aleppo.</p><p> On the matter of overseas development aid, ODA, I was pleased that a further &euro;10 million was allocated to our budget in the recent budget  which means we have been given an extra &euro;50 million in the past two budgets.  I share Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's concern regarding the need to ensure that we can reach the target of 0.7% GNP by the target date of 2030.  As our economic fortunes improve, I hope we will make every effort to ensure that we might be able to reach that sum prior to the target date of 2030.  Obviously this will depend on our economic growth and resources.  The Government remains committed to that target.  Based on the Department of Finance's forecast of GNP for 2017, the allocation of &euro;651 million is estimated to deliver an overseas development aid GNP percentage in the region of 0.3%.  It is important that we continue to make every effort to increase that ratio.  I acknowledge that we are in a position to provide an extra &euro;10 million this year.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's comments on Cuba.  I acknowledge that the blockade remains a matter of serious concern and hope every effort could be made by all parties involved to ensure the situation can improve for the benefit of the people in the region.  I note her comment regarding a trade mission and I hope we will be in a position to announce a high-level visit to Cuba early in the new year.  I am happy to keep the Deputy informed on that.  It is important that the negotiations on political dialogue and co-operation with Cuba would continue.  We will continue to play our part in voicing our concern about the embargo, which we have been doing for many years.  Our position on the blockade is both clear and long-standing.</p><p> Deputy Crowe, let me repeat my comments on the situation in Syria.  Ireland will continue to speak out on these issues.  I strongly support the efforts to end military flights as a means of protecting civilians.  The enormous suffering inflicted on civilians because of the airstrikes is contributing significantly to the unacceptable level of suffering in the region.  I am not calling however, for the setting up of a no-fly zone as this would require a mandate of the UN Security Council.  I think it is clear that cannot be agreed, given the existing divisions between Russia and other Security Council members.  I do not think that is something that can happen under the current make up of the council.  Enforcing a no-fly zone requires the credible threat of the use of force against planes which violate its conditions.  I hope that the efforts to which Senator Bacik and other referred will ensure there will be an opportunity and a window for talks.  Ireland will continue to play its part in so far as possible.</p><p> Deputy Crowe mentioned in particular the Saudi intervention in the war in Yemen.  This was discussed recently and we are very concerned by the situation in Yemen.  My primary concern is for the civilian population and the longer the conflict continues the more suffering is imposed on the people of Yemen.  We share the concern of our EU colleagues, which was noted in the conclusions of a recent meeting.  I strongly echo the appeal to all parties to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law.  I will have an opportunity between now and the end of the year to visit the Gulf and I will be happy to convey the concern expressed by members</p></speech>

We have provided financial assistance through an international NGO, which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs and by journalists and advisers who continue to work for peace.  It is important that all sides move towards ceasing hostilities and return to political dialogue so that a peaceful resolution can be reached in that regard.</p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned Brexit.  I agree this remains an absolute priority.  We have embarked on the implementation of the plan.</p><p>The new Cabinet committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and will involve representatives of almost all Departments, met again yesterday.  We have augmented our team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The new second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach is leading a new integrated division in that Department which will be responsible for Brexit matters.  The all-island conversation regarding Brexit is continuing.  As members of the committee will be aware, the first meeting of the civic dialogue will take place on 2 November in Dublin.  I urge all interested parties across all political divides to get involved in and assist that forum.</p><p> We are working closely with the State agencies.  I chaired a meeting of the Export Trade Council earlier this week involving representatives of agencies, heads of Departments and a number of Ministers.  We will continue to ensure we are fully prepared for this most serious challenge across a range of Departments.  I am engaging with my colleagues in the EU, the UK and Northern Ireland.  I will have a number of direct meetings with stakeholders in Derry tomorrow.  I acknowledge the assistance and advocacy of Members of the Oireachtas.  I know the Taoiseach will continue his engagement with all party leaders.  It is important for us to continue to prepare the ground as best we can before the negotiations commence at the end of March.</p><p> I share Senator Mark Daly's concern that the recent court hearing in the case of Ibrahim Halawa did not take place.  Since that date, I have had an opportunity to discuss the matter further and to relay once again the concern of the Oireachtas and the Irish people in this regard to a number of my EU colleagues and directly to my Egyptian counterpart, Mr. Shoukry.  I will be happy to keep the committee fully informed of developments.  The Government's priority is to secure the early release of Mr. Halawa from custody and, in the meantime, to make every effort to ensure his health and welfare are looked after.</p><p> I welcome Senator Lawless to this committee and to the Seanad.  I know he has an important agenda as he deals with the ongoing issues of the undocumented Irish in the US and the health, welfare and circumstances of all our diaspora across that country.  The appointment of Senator Lawless to the Upper House was an important one.  I acknowledge the work he has already undertaken in that regard.  I do not believe significant progress will be made on this issue between now and 8 November.  I assure the committee that as soon as the new US Administration is settled, I will be happy to commence a further round of high-level contacts on this issue.  I acknowledge the assistance and influence of Senator Lawless in that regard.</p><p> Senator Lawless also raised a number of issues regarding direct provision and undocumented immigrants in this country.  I would be happy to discuss these issues with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is responsible for them.  It might be appropriate for Senator Lawless and the T&aacute;naiste to have a bilateral engagement on the issues raised by the Senator this morning.  I would be happy to convey his comments and concerns directly to the T&aacute;naiste following this meeting.</p><p> I acknowledge the remarks of Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Sean Barrett and Senator Mark Daly regarding the statement of strategy on Irish neutrality.  There is not and should not be any doubt about the position of Irish neutrality.  The long-standing policy of Irish neutrality is continuing.  It is acknowledged in the European treaties, particularly the Lisbon treaty, that there can be no European army.  Some people inside and outside this House have suggested that there could be such an army.  I acknowledge the role of our peacekeepers and the importance of our membership of the UN.  I agree fully with Deputy Barrett's comments.  As far as our neutrality is concerned, Ireland continues to exercise a large measure of influence on the international stage, particularly at UN level, precisely because of our objectivity and neutrality.  That is the view of the Government and this Parliament.  It is certainly my view.  I do not see any circumstances under which that might change.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.819" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016102000002#J00300"><p>I will be very brief.  I do not deny in any way, shape or form the disgust of the Department and the Minister at what is happening in Syria.  I do not question their commitment to this issue.  I merely put it to the Minister that I find it strange and confusing that he has not spoken directly to the Russian Government's representative in this country.  He mentioned that he has spoken to everyone else on this issue, including the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.  The Russian embassy is down the road in Rathgar.  I would have thought that the Minister would have made it his business to convey personally the Irish Government's concerns to the ambassador.  I am not engaging in semantics when I put the very clear statement we heard on 4 October last, and what it led us to believe, to the Minister again.  I have the transcript and I will read what it says again.  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that "the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Russian ambassador last Tuesday".  In fact, the Minister did not meet the ambassador.  The Taoiseach said that the Minister "left him in no uncertain terms", but how can that be the case when he did not meet him?  I ask again: when has the Minister met the Russian ambassador?</p> <p>  I am aware that Russia is not the only party to the problems in Syria.  I accept that US intervention in that region has also been detrimental.  No country has more influence than Russia over the Syrian Government and the Assad regime.  It is not semantics to say it is inexplicable that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has not sat down to meet the Russian ambassador on this issue.  My clear view is that the Minister should be doing his job.  I asked the Minister to confirm that Ireland will vote against Russia's election to the UN Human Rights Council, but he did not answer that question.  I appreciate that the Minister covered a great deal of ground in his statement here today and that he has a lot on his plate.  Our job is to put forward our views on issues.  I agree with the Minister's stance on many other issues and I applaud the work he is doing, but my job is to let him know when I do not agree with him.  I would expect the Minister to do likewise.</p> <p>  I also asked the Minister about the &euro;20.9 million that this country has given towards the third country arrangement between the EU and Turkey.  The committee has written to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to confirm that all of that money is being spent exclusively on humanitarian aid.  I am not producing evidence in this regard and I did not suggest that I would.  I am asking the Minister to confirm that this is the case.  If it is, things are absolutely fine.  I reiterate that from the perspective of my party and my own perspective as Opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, these third party arrangements undermine the basic rights that refugees and asylum seekers deserve under international law.  They do not represent the way forward we should be taking.  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and detailed statement.</p> <p>  I will conclude by asking about Brexit matters.  I welcome the opportunity to attend the forum on 2 November.  I would like to hear the Government's view on the fact that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has not seen fit to afford the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, a permanent seat at the Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit in London.  While I appreciate that this is a decision of a sovereign Government, I suggest it speaks volumes about the views of the Prime Minister and the London Government about their priorities with regard to Northern Ireland.  I welcome the Minister's engagement in the North of Ireland and his visit to Derry to meet stakeholders.</p><p>I, too, have spent time in the North over the past few months.  The Government should approach Brexit from a position of strength.  Ireland is a big market for Britain and we have a &euro;10 billion trade deficit with Britain.  In terms of our market, Britain doing business with us is as important, if not more important, than our dealings and business relationship with Britain.  We should be careful that we are not used by the British to forward their position with our European partners. </p></speech>

What role can the Irish Government play in this matter?  He did not mention the war crimes in Yemen.  Would he similarly support a referral to the international court of the war crimes in Yemen?  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that there is funding for the peace process in Colombia.  Is the offer still on the table?  Does he view as positive the fact that negotiations have opened up with the guerrilla group called the ELN?  </p> <p>  I ask the Minister for an explanatory note on the hurdles and roadblocks in terms of refugees.  </p> <p>  An all-party motion was passed in this House and showed that there is unanimous support for the official recognition of the state of Palestine.  Has the Minister thought any more about the matter?  Does he view it as a positive step?</p></speech>

The continuation of the relic that is the Cold War has had a detrimental effect on the Cuban people.  President Obama has acknowledged the harm that has been done and been progressive about other aspects.  The US Congress is the stumbling block.  It has made time for legislation to continue the sanctions but not for the Congress men and women who want the blockade ended.  I ask that Ireland, whatever opportunities it has, in discussions with the United State acts as a voice for Cuba and indicates its support for the lifting of the blockade.  As we know, 98% of UN countries will vote to have the blockade lifted yet it continues.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister said about Ireland's commitment to a 0.7% overseas development aid target.  I also acknowledge Ireland's role in the sustainable development goals.  Has there been any more done with them?  At a recent AWEPA event Mr. Michael O'Brien from Tr&oacute;caire was in attendance.  On that occasion it was suggested that we arrange an Oireachtas debate, for which I would like the Minister's support, on how Ireland can progress the sustainable development goals because there are issues about financing them.  Ireland, in its policy document entitled One Work, One Future, has committed to a biennial report on policy coherence.  We need to follow through on that commitment so that we can see the effect policy coherence has on trade agreements.</p> <p>  In respect of the Middle East and Palestine, we talk about peace and there are talks about peace but settlements continue to be built.  Can there be a strong voice that at the very least the settlement building stops while we move towards peace?</p> <p>  In terms of Syria, we need to do more at a diplomatic level, not just with Russia and Iran.  We know the role that they have played but there are other countries involved in the bombing, including the United States.  They all have to be brought to task if there is to be a ceasefire and a lasting peace.  </p></speech>

I know that he will give a response on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  I should have raised the matter given that a motion on CETA was passed in the Seanad at the behest of our colleague, Senator Higgins.  I ask him for an update on the Government's response to the motion.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his full answers to my questions on Syria.  Does he have the timeframe for the relocation?  He has said that we are close to the original resettlement target for Lebanese refugees.  Given what he called the bureaucratic obstacles in Italy, can he say for sure if there is a timeframe for reaching relocation targets even though he expects to soon see numbers increase?  </p> <p>  On the Palestine issue, I echo the words of others on the recognition of the state of Palestine.  Can the Minister comment on the reports raised in the media about the closure of a bank account in respect of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign?  My colleague, Senator Norris, has raised the matter in the Seanad.</p> <p>  Finally, members have talked about Turkey.  The Minister mentioned in his statement that there is a need to ensure, among other things, "that the political process to resolve the Kurdish issue can be resumed".  All of us share a concern about the rights of Kurdish minorities, particularly since the repressive crackdown by the Turkish Government following an attempted coup.  Can the Minister state Ireland's position on the recognition of the rights for the Kurdish minority?  Does it extend to support for an autonomous Kurdistan, an independent state or autonomy within Turkey?  </p></speech>

Senator Bacik referred to the CETA motion in the Seanad but it was also the subject of a D&aacute;il debate last week when my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills outlined the national approach by Ireland.</p> <p>  We are fully satisfied that the provisional application of the CETA agreement will in no way conflict with Ireland's legal or constitutional requirements.  I want to add that an agreement between Canada and the European Union would be good for trade, Europe, Ireland, our people and our people seeking employment.  It will help Ireland continue what is a very fragile but positive road to economic recovery.  I am happy to keep the House informed of further developments.  It was an issue that I had the opportunity to discuss with some colleagues in Europe on Monday.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned Colombia.  It is important that Ireland continues to play a strong role as far as its influence and experience is concerned.  I am in regular contact with my former colleague, the EU Special Envoy for the Peace Process in Colombia, Mr. Eamon Gilmore.  As soon as the result was announced efforts were made to ensure that dialogue continued.  As the Deputy has said, it is important that Ireland and the international community continues to rally around the people of Colombia.  Since the plebiscite the Nobel peace prize has been awarded to President Santos.  The award should act as a further act of encouragement to all who continue to strive for peace.  There is an EU trust fund to which Ireland has made a contribution and I have encouraged some of my EU colleagues to participate in what will be an important arrangement.  I am happy to keep the House fully informed of developments.</p> <p>  On the status of Palestine, members will be aware that the D&aacute;il has on two occasions, in October and December 2014, passed motions on the matter of recognition as has the Upper House.  I refer members to the programme for Government in which we stated that the Government is committed to recognising the state of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict in the region.  I keep this issue under continuous and constant review.  Whether the immediate recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, prior to its real and lasting achievement on the ground, could be helpful is something to which we must at all times give consideration.  Will it help resolve the conflict in the region that has bedevilled the citizenry over a long number of years?  I was in the region in June when I had an opportunity to meet President Netanyahu and Prime Minister Hamdallah.  The matter is part of Ireland's ongoing consideration.  I know that the members opposite have been present and I refer them to the importance of the French initiative.  I expect that there will be further developments on the initiative between now and the end of the year.  I am committed to ensuring that Ireland makes every effort to influence what is a serious conflict in the region.</p><p> As for the bank accounts, this is a commercial matter for the banks.  I do not have evidence for why this act took place, but I have written to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in general terms because this concern was brought to my attention.  I hope these issues can be resolved but, really, they are outside of my control.  They are commercial decisions taken by the banks.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the ongoing issue of the settlements.  They are not only illegal but also an obstacle to peace in the region.  I had the opportunity to say that directly to the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, in June last and also to the chairman of the Israeli foreign affairs committee, Mr. Avi Dichter, who was here recently and also met members of the committee and the Chairman, Deputy Smith.  I hope the Middle East peace process will remain high on the agenda at European level, notwithstanding the huge challenges and crises around the world.  I will continue to raise these issues.</p><p> In response to Deputy Darragh O'Brien on Brexit, I acknowledge his support on this issue, and particularly the support of his party leader.  I do not wish to comment on the involvement or membership of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in any committee under the UK Government.  The Secretary of State was appointed in mid-summer and I have spoken to him on at least four occasions in the time since then.  I assure the committee that I will continue high-level engagement with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Mr. Davis, who was here in September at my invitation.  I had a constructive meeting with him.  I have also spoken to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Johnson, on a number of occasions and I expect that he will visit Dublin early next year, if not towards the end of this year.  There is constant high-level engagement in London, Belfast and Dublin on the part of senior officials.</p><p> I am sure there will be a further opportunity on Question Time next week to comment in detail on the priorities of the Government on the matter of Brexit.  Those priorities are the economy and trade, the situation in Northern Ireland and the peace process, the preservation and maintenance of the common travel area between our respective jurisdictions and Ireland's position within the European Union, with Ireland firmly remaining an active, positive and constructive member of the Union at the negotiating table with our 26 EU colleagues discussing and negotiating the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

With regard to our position on migration, I can inform the committee, on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, that every effort will be made to ensure that our targets are met.  It is not possible to put a firm timeframe on it.  Ireland is not the country of choice of many suffering refugees.  We have undertaken to receive a total of 4,000.  I am anxious that the appropriate details can be worked out to facilitate their reception in Ireland.  Irish people would welcome the alleviation of suffering.  Obviously we will play our part as far as the reception of refugees is concerned, but our priority must be addressing the root causes of migration and the fact that so many millions of people are displaced in the first instance.  This is also something I am sure we will return to on Question Time next Tuesday.</p></speech>

I was in Enniskillen last Monday evening to meet people from Fermanagh and Tyrone who are involved in business and politics.  There is a genuine concern in those communities about the urgent need to ensure their interests are advocated very strongly by the Irish Government.  Unfortunately, the two parties in the Northern Ireland Executive took opposing views in the referendum.  The fact that it took the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, ten weeks to respond to a letter from the First Minister and deputy First Minister regarding concerns they outlined about Brexit would not fill one with confidence about the interest there will be in Northern Ireland when Britain is negotiating.  There is a huge onus on the Government and, indeed, on all of us in public life in this country to ensure that the interests of all of the island are strongly advocated in the future talks.  I hope the Minister will have a good engagement with civic society.  The people are anxious to have that communication and engagement with the Government and with the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  We will adjourn until Thursday, 3 November 2016, when we will hear a presentation from the National Union of Journalists in regard to media freedom and particularly concerns about Turkey.</p></speech>

In accordance with Standing Order 141(2), the select committee is scrutinising the provisions of this Private Members' Bill, in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath.  As members are aware, the European Central Bank has been consulted on it, and we are awaiting the outcome of that consultation.  In our first session today, we will hear the views of the Minister for Finance on the proposed legislation.  In the second, we will hear from the members of the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign, which has been campaigning on the issue.  It is also planned for the coming weeks to engage with the Central Bank of Ireland on this Bill.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  As Deputy Michael McGrath is the sponsor of the Bill, I invite him to make an opening statement to the committee, following which the Minister will be invited to respond.  Members will then be invited to participate in the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.841" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#B00300"><p>I am delighted the finance committee is now examining this legislation on pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was not a requirement but I agreed to it because it may be helpful and result in the Bill being improved over the coming weeks.  The other relevant point is that the Bill is currently with the European Central Bank as part of the consultation we are required to do, as the Chairman has indicated.  I understand it is not due to revert to us for another few weeks, or until mid-November.  The pre-legislative scrutiny will not delay the taking of the formal Committee Stage of the Bill.</p><p>I acknowledge the dedication and expertise brought to the issue by individuals and campaign groups, such as the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign, whose representatives, led by Mr. Brendan Burgess, are present today and from whom I look forward to hearing later.  Many commentators in the media, such as Mr. Charlie Weston of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, have highlighted the issue in recent years.  We welcome the support of other Opposition parties and Independent Deputies who have used their parliamentary time, including in term of the previous D&aacute;il, to advocate for variable rate mortgage holders.</p><p>This legislation is necessary to deal with the issue of excessive standard variable mortgage rates.  This issue has been the subject of a public debate for the past couple of years or so.  There has been ample time for the banks to move to bring their rates into line with market conditions.  Market forces, competition and new entrants have been cited by those opposed to the Bill on many occasions as the best ways of achieving progress on standard variable rates but it has not materialised.  Therefore, legislation is necessary.  As I stated in the D&aacute;il, I wish legislation such as this were not necessary but I have reached the conclusion, to which I stick, that it is.</p><p>There is a widely held view, both in the Government and Opposition, that many of the variable interest rates being charged by banks in the State are unacceptably high.  Where we differ is on how to tackle this problem.  I emphasise that I am very much open to this Bill being amended over the weeks ahead.  I do not claim it is perfect; it is an honest attempt to help variable rate mortgage holders who, in my view, continue to pay well over the odds on their mortgages.</p><p>There are a few key issues I would like to highlight.  The first is the different treatment by the banks of existing mortgage holders as opposed to new mortgage holders.  Over the past year or so, in particular, banks have reduced their standard variable rates for new customers, but some have not extended those reductions to their existing mortgage customers.  This is fundamentally unfair and should not be allowed to happen.</p><p>Variable rates should change in line with market conditions.</p><p>When market conditions are favourable, people expect rightly that variable rates will fall.  When they are adverse, variable rates should move in the other direction but that simply has not been happening to the extent that is justified by the prevailing market conditions.  It is well documented that variable relates in Ireland are out of step with those charged elsewhere in the euro area.  With regard to new business, as will be demonstrated by the presentation we will examine later from the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign, the difference is at least 1.5%, but it is much greater in many cases for existing customers who are trapped and who do not have the option of switching their mortgage.</p><p> I reiterate that the Central Bank is not properly fulfilling its role in the area of consumer protection.  It seems to prioritise its role as a prudential regulator above and beyond its role of protecting consumers.  If it was giving that role the attention and priority it deserves, then we may not have to introduce legislation of this kind.  Switching is not possible for every mortgage customer.  Those who can should do so and some have, but for many mortgage customers, because of a change in circumstance, negative equity, reduced income, for example, switching is not an option and they are trapped and have to pay rates that are unjustifiable and, ultimately, unsustainable.</p><p> The banks that have steadfastly refused to reduce their SVR cannot be allowed to hide behind improved fixed rate offers.  A number have improved such offers.  I have highlighted the case of Bank of Ireland in the past, which has stuck rigidly to an unjustifiable variable rate of 4.5% for many existing customers.  In a presentation accompanying its year end results for 2015, the bank's cost of funds was quoted at 0.8%.  It is, therefore, charging its SVR customers more than 5.5 times its own cost of funds.  This is an indefensible position.  If the Central Bank will not vindicate the rights of those mortgage holders, the House should move to do so.  Fixed rate mortgages are an entirely different product from an SVR.  If customers lock into a fixed rate, they will lose out if the variable rate falls below the fixed rate and they will also lose a great deal of flexibility because while a fixed rate is suitable for many mortgage holders, it may not be for others.  In addition, if a new competitor enters the market offering a much lower variable rate, these customers face substantial penalties if they seek to switch their mortgage.</p><p> The position of Dankse Bank customers is even more precarious as they are paying a SVR of 4.95% but because the bank has departed the personal banking market, there is no incentive for it to reduce the rate.  It is not concerned about its reputation in the personal banking market.</p><p> The situation facing approximately 46,000 customers whose mortgages are now owned by non-bank lenders should also be highlighted in the context of this Bill.  Many of the mortgages are owned by vulture funds which bought them from IBRC special liquidators and foreign banks departing the market.  If the funds decided tomorrow morning that the SVR should be increased to 6%, 8% or higher, these mortgage holders could do nothing about it, particularly if they were not in a position to switch.  More worrying, the Central Bank could do nothing about it based on its existing statutory powers.  That is not a tenable position.  This exposes these mortgage holders, in particular, to an unacceptable risk.  I would like to address the question of whether the Central Bank wants the powers to intervene in the market and this will come up again during the debate.  The fundamental point about this is the Oireachtas decides the powers given to the Central Bank.  We decide the regulatory framework and the Central Bank regulates within that framework.  There is a division of responsibilities and, therefore, we should not shirk our responsibilities.</p><p> Under the legislation, the Central Bank would be required to carry out an assessment of the state of the mortgage market, taking into account factors such as the banks' cost of funds, reasonable profit expectations, concentration within the market, and the ease with which customers can switch mortgages between lenders and the extent to which they are switching.  Should the Central Bank conclude that there is a market failure, it would be empowered with a range of tools under the legislation to influence the SVRs charged in the market.  The Bill's provisions are modest and many people who believe the Central Bank should intervene suggest that we go much further.  It is a modest Bill, which has become essential.  I am open to amendments to improve it during its passage, hopefully, through Committee Stage in a few weeks.</p><p> The inescapable reality underpinning the Bill is that the cost of funds for banks has fallen dramatically in recent years.  Their net interest margin is increasing all the time and the main banks are strongly profitable again, which I welcome.  Some of the rates that continue to be charged are unjustifiable by any yardstick and need to be addressed.  They are charging those rates because they can get away with it and they are treating many of their existing customers in an extremely unfair manner, which must be addressed.  Fair treatment of customers should be a cornerstone of consumer protection.  Unfortunately, it is not in the current framework within which the Central Bank is operating.  A strong legislative framework is needed to ensure this happens.  The banks cannot be allowed to continue to rip off customers safe in the knowledge that they will not be subject to any sanction or intervention by the House or the Central Bank.  The position is clear.  If the banks wished to avoid legislation of this kind, they had ample opportunity do what was necessary and treat customers with a degree of fairness to ensure the variable rate charged was in line with the market conditions they faced.  They have fundamentally failed in that objective and, for that reason, this legislation is necessary to strengthen consumer protection provisions and to ensure further downward pressure on variable rates, especially when they are unjustifiable and unacceptably high.  I will be happy to take questions on the Bill following the Minister's contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#C00200"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to participate in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which has been proposed by Deputy McGrath.  I look forward to working with the committee and contributing to its important work.  There is a responsibility on all of us to critically, but also fairly, evaluate all proposed legislation coming before the Oireachtas, irrespective of whatever side of the House it emerges from.  There was a constructive Second Stage debate last May to which many Members from all sides of the House contributed, and the D&aacute;il then decided that the Bill should move to Committee Stage for further and more detailed deliberation.  I can assure members that the Government will constructively engage with the issues raised by the legislation as it is further considered by the committee and the Oireachtas.  However, it is also important to acknowledge and recognise that this is not a Government Bill.  It will, therefore, not be the responsibility of Government to progress the Bill through the parliamentary process, or to answer questions on the overall objective or detailed provisions of the Bill.  That responsibility rests with the Bill&rsquo;s proposer.  While the Government will actively contribute to the work of this committee, it cannot assume a responsibility for the progression of Private Members' Bills once they have passed Second Stage.</p> <p>  As I indicated on Second Stage, I fully understand that the intention behind the Bill is to help people with their mortgage repayments.  As the economy improves and as the banks stabilise and come back into profitability, borrowers will rightly feel that their mortgage and other loan rates should come down.  Depositors and other stakeholders in the banks will also want improvements in their positions.  These are the natural tensions which play out in a competitive banking market.  However, on Second Stage, the Government outlined a number of significant concerns it had with the Bill as proposed.  These concerns remain and it is considered that it would be of benefit to the legislative process if the committee would consider these and also concerns that were raised by others in the House and outside in the pre-legislative scrutiny which is now commencing.</p> <p>  One of the points I raised was the requirement under the EU framework to consult the European Central Bank, ECB, on the content of the Bill.  D&aacute;il Standing Orders have since been amended to provide that in the case of a relevant Private Members' Bill such as this, the relevant Oireachtas committee will conduct this important consultation function.  I welcome the fact that this consultation process has been initiated.  However, it is unfortunate that neither this committee nor the House has yet had the benefit of that ECB opinion before it further considers this Bill.</p><p>Such an opinion, when it is to hand, will obviously be a very important contribution to the pre-legislative scrutiny work that members of this committee are now undertaking.  Also, depending on the content of the European Central Bank opinion, the Bill's proposer may wish to consider if amendments are required to the Bill as it currently stands.  The Bill will need to be carefully considered to ensure it complies with all the requirements of European Union law.  Section 5, for example, in permitting the Central Bank to impose a cap on the standard variable mortgage rate that applies to one lender but not to the market generally could potentially be considered to enable competitive distortions in the market or to enable the prevention of the free movement of services or be subject to criticism under state aid rules.</p><p> Significant constitutional issues are already raised by this Bill.  I sought to flag these concerns during the Second Stage debate not to seek to make a political point, avoid a fair consideration of the merits of the Bill, or more importantly, to somehow prevent an improvement in the position of variable rate mortgage holders, but to raise a genuine concern.  Real constitutional issues will need to be considered as this Bill is further progressed by the Oireachtas.  As it is drafted, the Bill will clearly have an impact on the existing property rights of some creditors.  Likewise, there are concerns about the process and decision-making procedures set out in the Bill and whether they provide for "fair procedures" and a "fair appeals" process to any affected parties.  Overall, it will be important to ensure that any proposed legislation that interferes with private property rights would be a proportionate measure in the interests of the common good.</p><p> I am not saying the Bill as drafted is unconstitutional but rather the issue is that it is not possible to come to a considered view on the matter at this point.  When the Government initiates a Bill, the constitutional and legal aspects of the Bill will be considered by the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government.  Where a concern about the constitutionality of a Bill arises, the Attorney General may seek a very detailed analysis in terms of the rationale for the policy measure and possible impacts from the initiator of the proposal in order to assist it in forming an assessment on whether the proposed restriction on property rights or some other rights are proportionate to the social good which the proposed Bill seeks to achieve.  Such a detailed assessment is also likely to contain an assessment of whether an alternative measure or measures could be deployed to achieve the same or similar desired objectives but without impacting existing property or other rights.  This will be an important issue for the committee to consider further in its pre-legislative deliberations.</p><p> Likewise, it will be important to consider the detailed drafting of Private Member&rsquo;s Bills, and I note that the report of the D&aacute;il reform committee called for a greater role for the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor in the drafting of Bills.  I do not know what involvement that office had in the drafting of this Bill.  Nevertheless, while this is not the time for a detailed line by line consideration of the Bill, there are some detailed drafting, technical and other issues.  These include the precise "interest rate" that will be assessed in the determination or otherwise of "market failure"; the feasibility of restricting the regulatory measure to mortgages for the "primary purpose of purchasing a principal dwelling home" as opposed to a loan provided for another consumer purpose but which is nevertheless also secured on the primary home; what precisely is meant by a "fixed" and "not fixed" interest rate; how the Bill will link with existing national and European provisions governing housing loans such as the Consumer Credit Act, the mortgage credit directive and the Central Bank consumer codes; whether the Bill will apply to local authority mortgages; and whether the requirement to conduct an assessment of the mortgage market each quarter is unduly proscriptive and excessive.  These and other issues will need to be considered in some depth by this committee in due course.  Consideration also needs to be given to whether there are unintended consequences to this Bill, such as acting as a deterrent to new entrants to the Irish market and thus ensuring that there is less choice available to consumers.</p><p> Another area of concern relates to the respective responsibilities of the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The Bill requires the Central Bank to assess whether "market failure" exists in the principal dwelling house mortgage market.  This is not a power sought by the Central Bank and it does not have a competition mandate.  That mandate rests with the competition commission.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is the independent authority charged with tackling anti-competitive business practices and with the assessment of business competition issues.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank will have an important interest and role in the operation of the residential mortgage market.  Committee members will therefore be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government indicates that the Central Bank and the competition commission, having due regard to their respective remits, will work together to set out options in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the level of competition and consumer protection.</p><p> The Government remains of the view that competition represents the most favourable method of driving down interest rates in a sustainable way without giving rise to possible unintended consequences.  The latest monthly data from the Central Bank indicates that the interest rate on new mortgage agreements continues to decline.  Banks are expanding the range of mortgage products for customers, including a wide range of fixed interest rate products.  The Government is of the view that there is further scope to generate more competition and switching behaviour in the mortgage market and which has the potential to deliver more savings to customers.  Therefore, in addition to the work requested from the competition commission and the Central Bank that I have just referred to, the programme for Government also wishes to promote a greater level of switching in the market for existing mortgages.  A Central Bank economic letter published last year suggested that a significant number of existing variable rate mortgage customers could achieve financial savings by switching their mortgage provider.</p><p> I believe competition is a better solution to this issue because it benefits all banking customers and will help to avoid potentially unintended consequences that could arise from the imposition of administrative controls on some mortgages rates.  We also continue to have concerns about the constitutional implications of the Bill as currently set out.  Consequently, I welcome the pre-legislative scrutiny this committee will now conduct on this Bill.  I also welcome the fact the committee will obtain the views of the European Central Bank and other interested parties on this Bill before it proceeds to further consideration by the Oireachtas.  If the committee decides to proceed, I will pledge our co-operation to improve the Bill if it is the desire of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

One of the questions I have had on my mind for some time has been where the Central Bank is in respect of its position on mortgage pricing in Ireland.  There was a report from 2015 but is there an updated report in that respect?  I do not necessarily need the answer now.  It seems there is a very clear position within the Central Bank on bank profitability.  The report states that equity investors, whether the State or others, cannot be expected to inject capital if a return in the form of profits is not in prospect.</p><p>The report stated:</p><blockquote>That is why it is unrealistic to imagine a regime even in the long-run in which mortgage lending rates do not build in not only a sufficient spread (over the cost of funds) to cover the credit risk being undertaken, but also make an adequate contribution to profits.  It is likely, however, that the rates in effect for most banks at the end of April 2015 [which is when the report was published] were higher than would be necessary in the long-run for a bank unburdened by a poorly performing mortgage back book.</blockquote><p>Could we get a perspective from the Central Bank as to whether this view point has been updated?  It would be pertinent regarding dealing with the issues of competition as elucidated by the Minister.<br/><br/>There is an issue regarding how the property rights of some creditors would be affected.  Can we have a deeper dive into the dynamic of the property rights as they affect those people who paid 6% or 7% on variable rates?  In one case I am familiar with, it will add approximately &euro;100,000 to the cost of the mortgage over its lifetime.  I wonder how somebody like me could explain to the person that it is a constitutional issue in which the property rights of the bank or financial institution take precedence.  It is a little unclear.</p></speech>

There is nothing more recent.  As the Deputy said, he is taking legal advice on the other question.</p></speech>

The Central Bank position is well known.  There are some interesting points in the report.  For example, it says, "Their boards and management need to recognise that charging spreads that excessively exploit the current weak competitive environment risks being counterproductive if they bring down upon themselves Government policy reactions".  The banks have not heard this message and responded accordingly, and this is the problem.  The Bill passed Second Stage unanimously in the D&aacute;il in May without a vote.  The Government did not oppose the Bill.  Perhaps the Government was anxious to avoid a parliamentary defeat so early in its lifetime.</p> <p>  On the question of constitutionality, I am not a senior counsel, and I welcome Deputy Pearse Doherty's suggestion that we refer to the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Government introduced amendments to the personal insolvency legislation whereby an insolvency court could impose a solution on a lender, including a write-down of the mortgage amount owed.  Although the Government said for a long time that it would not be constitutional, the Attorney General must have passed it.  If it is constitutional, I cannot see how the measure in this Bill could be unconstitutional.  We will await the judgment and opinion of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p> <p>  The key measure in the Bill is defining a market failure.  It follows the Central Bank's assessment which can result in it issuing a direction to a lender or group of lenders whereby, as stated in section 4, the rate being charged is "higher than the Central Bank considers can be reasonably and objectively justified by reference to the factors set out in section 3".  Those factors deal with all the issues contained in the Central Bank's report on variable rate pricing.  The benchmark is whether the rate a bank is charging to the customer can be "reasonably and objectively justified" by reference to those factors.  Undoubtedly, there are rates being charged in the Irish market that are exploitative and cannot be justified by reference to those factors.  The Bill is particularly designed to deal with those outliers, those egregious situations in which people are paying rates that cannot be justified.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that there was a desire not to have a Government defeat so early in the life of the Government.  There was also an agreement on the principle of the Bill.  Everybody thought certain lenders were applying mortgage interest rates that were too high and there was a common purpose in seeing if we could get the rates reduced.  That was the purpose of the Bill, and on Second Stage one is voting on the principle, not on the detail.  The principle was close enough, as described by Deputy Michael McGrath, to the Government's view.</p> <p>  I would have thought the application of competition would have achieved the same end without legislation.  To a large extent, in terms of new mortgages, it has, particularly in AIB where the State is a 99% shareholder.  The AIB rate is quite good.  The Deputy is right that the outlier is Bank of Ireland, especially regarding mortgages that are already written and the differential between the treatment of new mortgage applicants and historic mortgages.  There is a gap there.</p> <p>  I have no advice that the Bill is unconstitutional.  The test is whether the response in the Bill is proportionate to the public interest advantage that is gained by enacting it.  This is the criteria on which a senior counsel would examine it and it is in this space that one would get legal advice.  All I am saying is that there is an issue and that legal advice is needed.  We will work our way through it and see if we can come up with a solution.  I do not disagree with the analysis.  Some lenders are charging too much.  There are other issues.  We do not want to distort the market.  If our legislation results in a reduction in the profitability of mortgage books, we would like to avoid a situation in which a bank would move to recover profits elsewhere in the market by charging more for SME lending where we need economic activity to create jobs.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues.  The Deputy has done the House service, especially under the new rules.  We will work our way through it, not with the intention of obstructing the Deputy in any way but of assisting in the discussion.</p></speech>

In the Minister saying the Second Stage position was not so far from the Government's position, there is a bit of rewriting of history going on regarding the Bill, which we supported.  On the first night of the debate, the Minister said if we took the total value of the Irish taxpayer's holding in the banks, the publication of Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill decreased it by 10%.  Does the Minister stand over the statement or does he withdraw from it?  If he is saying the Government's position is not so far from the position of the Bill, how can it be explained?</p></speech>

Traditionally, everything was opposed by Irish Governments regardless of the merits of what came from the Opposition.</p><p> On the principle of the Bill, we share the aspiration to reduce variable mortgage rates.  As they pinch hardest for historic mortgages because the new offerings have reduced interest rates, we share that objective.  We expressed our views very strongly as did the supporters of the Bill.  Statistically, that is what happened.  We can give Deputy Paul Murphy the piece of paper.  The advice I received was that there was a cause-and-effect relationship in the context of the drop in bank shares.</p></speech>

What the Minister said was that the publication of the Bill led to it dropping by 10%.  Does the Minister still believe the publication of a Bill proposing that there should be some measure of relief for mortgage holders caused bank shares to drop by 10%?</p></speech>

That created concern in the market.  Anyone connected to the lenders would have been made aware of that concern.  I am saying there was a cause-and-effect relationship.  It is very difficult to explain market movements but there was a cause-and-effect relationship and the advice I received was that there was a 10% reduction, on average, across bank shares at the time and it was attributable to the D&aacute;il being willing to enact such a Bill.</p></speech>

There is no evidence whatsoever to back that up.  I looked at that claim in some detail at the time and it was not borne out by the facts.  On 11 May there was a trading statement by Permanent TSB and immediately following that there was an 11% drop in the bank's share price.  That trading statement set out a number of major challenges the bank is facing.  It did not refer to variable rate mortgage pricing.  It was a bogus claim and the Minister should not try to defend it.  Back in May 2015, when the Minister met with the banks, he issued a statement following those meetings and threatened to impose legislation on interest rates on the banks.  He said if they did not play ball, the result would be a levy or legislation.  To hang it all on the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill of May this year is not borne out by the evidence.  The Minister should not try to stand over it.</p></speech>

We support the Bill.  We supported the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill previously.  We think it would potentially give some element of relief to mortgage holders.  It does not deal with the fundamentals.  The approach in the Bill is to say the issue was market failure whereas the market is the failure in this circumstance.  The fundamental problem is that there are banks - including State-owned banks - that are set up to maximise profits.  That is what the banks are doing.  They are taking losses or are not making as much as they would like in other areas.  Therefore, in an area where they think they can get away with it, such as that relating to standard variable rates, they are keeping rates high at a significant rate higher than the European average.  Fundamentally, they are acting as profit-maximising companies do and shareholders act as profit-maximising individuals or companies.  Is the alternative approach to say that particularly where a large segment of the banking sector is already State-owned, we should have banking that is publicly owned, democratically controlled and used in the interest of society as opposed to society being used and run in the interest of the banks, which is what happens?  With a democratically-controlled Central Bank and democratically-controlled banks, we can direct credit to where it is needed in the economy and can ensure that mortgage holders and others are not being ripped off.</p> <p>  What is proposed tinkers around the edge of the problem.  It would potentially make some difference and we welcome that.  In presenting the thing as a market failure, it ignores the point that the banks are doing what they are set up to do which is to maximise their profits and that is the nature of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.891" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#F03200"><p>Banks are commercial organisations and they have to be profitable.  What Deputy Paul Murphy is suggesting is that the State would set up a mortgage lender.  Credit unions in Ireland can lend but are constrained by regulatory limits on the proportion of their loan books that can be lent out over a long period.  Some of them want to invest much more in that side of their business.  Some people disagree with that approach but I think it would have some potential.  What we are trying to do is deal with the reality that the banks are commercial and that they have to be profitable, which I accept.  The question that arises is whether they are abusing their position and whether the rates charged to customers reflect market conditions.  I accept that inherent in any variable rate is the fact that the rate falls when conditions are good and when they are less favourable, it increases.</p><p>The rates being paid to savers are at rock bottom.  The banks have not been slow to cut the returns they are paying to savers but they have been slow to cut the rates they are charging borowers, including not only mortgage holders but SMEs, farmers and so on.  The budget announcement of a &euro;150 million fund for farmers to access credit at a rate of 2.95% is a recognition on the part of Government that the rates being charged in Ireland are out of step with reality.  I know the banking system is repairing itself, that the banks have a high level of impaired loans, that they did not fair too well in the European Central Bank, ECB, stress tests and that they also have a high percentage of tracker mortgages, which is a reality that cannot be ignored, but there is no fairness in their targeting one cohort of customers, many of whom are trapped.  The Minister is correct in saying that for new business there have been improvements.  Those improvements must be recognised.  The Allied Irish Bank rates are now between 3.1% and 3.5%, depending on LTV, which is an improvement that must be welcomed.  AIB has reduced its rates for existing and new customers but other banks have drawn a distinction between what they are doing for their new customers and what they are doing for existing customers and they are being allowed to get away with this.  The Central Banking in allowing this, in my view, is not properly fulfilling its consumer protection role.</p><p> The reality is that the banks are accessing money at next to 0% and yet they are continuing to charge, in the case of Danske Bank, rates of just under 5%.  We are not in this regard speaking about the sub-prime area in respect of which rates of 6% and 7% are common place.  We are speaking about mainstream lenders in Ireland charging 4.5% because they can get away with doing so.  We are allowing them to get away it and we should not be doing so.  I come from a different perspective to Deputy Paul Murphy on this issue in that I would rather that the market resolved this situation but it has had ample time to resolve it and it does not appear it will do so.  The banks have known for a couple of years what they need to do.  We are only asking them to be fair and reasonable.  We will hold them to task.  They will be appearing before this committee in the next few weeks and we will be putting all of these questions to them.  That is the premise of the Bill from my perspective.</p></speech>

That is effectively the argument the Deputy makes.  The letter to which Deputy Paul Murphy and a number of other Deputies, including Deputy Michael McGrath, referred is the Central Bank letter of May 2015 under the heading &quot;Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland&quot;.  In regard to the Central Bank's view in May 2015, with the permission of the Chairman, I would like to quote a paragraph from that letter as follows:</p><blockquote>Nevertheless, the mortgage business as a whole is not profitable for the Irish banks.  This is not just because of the emerging loan-losses on the back-book, but also because their profitability is further hampered by low-yielding tracker mortgages originated during the bubble.  The ability of the banks to partially compensate for the burden of the trackers by retaining higher spreads on variable rate lending is likely to be transitory; as such spreads will in time encourage entry.</blockquote> <p>In that regard what the Central Bank is saying is that the banks are moving in a compensatory way but they are doing so within the mortgage books.  They are compensating for fixed rate trackers, which are probably showing a loss or very close to a loss, by an extra charge on the variable rate.  That is the issue.  This is not about lending to SMEs or lending elsewhere.  The argument then is the competition argument.  In this regard, the Central Bank letter states: &quot;New entrants could charge lower rates without incurring a loss of interest on the back book.&quot;  New entrants would not have the tracker legacies so they would be in a position to compete.  Again, care needs to be applied to ensure that we do not do anything that would discourage new entrants from coming into the market.</p></speech>

Specifically for the reasons outlined therein I asked for an update on the position.  Given the Minister's intervention, it is clear that the <i>modus operandi </i>of the Central Bank is, to all intents and purposes in relation to mortgage lending, to take a<i>laissez-faire</i>approach.  The question for us then is whether we can legislate for the cost of funds and a percentage over and above that.  For the purposes of this engagement we are fairly clear at this juncture that there are two courses of action open to us in terms of our seeking legal advice and further engagement with the European Central Bank, ECB, on this matter.  From my perspective, at this juncture we should move on.</p></speech>

In his opening remarks the Minister said that the intention behind the Bill is to help people with mortgage repayments.  Essentially, that is what we are talking about.  Having listened to the Minister and the general debate on the Bill it would appear to me that the banks are continuing to screw particular mortgage holders, that the Central Bank is turning a blind eye to this practice and that while we continue to talk about the matter and try to encourage change there is little change coming about.  As that happens, people's lives are affected.  Alongside this is the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act and the manner in which that is playing out in the courts, in terms of the aggressive approach being taken by the banks, which is almost an abuse of their position, which is shocking.  It is unforgivable that we, as legislators, would allow this to happen.  The banks are being allowed to rebuild their balance sheets at an enormous pace, using aggressive and abusive means to do so, and we are not prepared to step in and put some sort of block in the way to reduce the speed at which they are doing so in order to bring some sort of balance into the situation such that the life of a mortgage holder in distress can at least be given consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister referred more than once in his opening remarks to new entrants to the market and switching, an issue which has also been raised more than once thus far in this discussion.  The people paying these higher interest rates are not able to switch.  I would like to see any of them go into a bank and ask for a switch.  Nobody is interested in them.  They appear to be being dumped on a pile and nobody is paying a blind bit of notice to what is going on in their lives.  The Central Bank, accompanied by representatives of its consumer protection section, appeared before us in the context of our discussion on the insurance industry.  They were less than impressive.  They have no interest in the consumer protection end of this matter and they had little or no interest in terms of the consumer and the insurance premiums bar that the companies had to rebuild.  We are offering up the consumer in this case in order to ensure that the banks rebuild their balance sheets.  I think that is appalling.  This Bill should be supported.  It was supported in principle on Second Stage and I would urge greater consideration of it, with a greater input from the apparatus of Government, to ensure it is enacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.897" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#G00600"><p>I get the feeling that we are again fighting the battles we had on Second Stage of this Bill.  As has been said, this Bill passed Second Stage unanimously despite the reservations that the Government had.  I think the Minister has been fair, frank and honest with us today in terms of his own views on the Bill.  In terms of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, what is key is that we get this right.  There are areas of the Bill about which the Minister has raised concerns.  We also have to wait to hear the European Central Bank's opinion on the Bill, although we are required to only note its concerns.  Obviously if issues are identified that would lead to a challenge in the future we will need to ensure they are addressed.  The committee has already agreed to seek legal opinion on the Bill.</p><p>I acknowledge the statement the Minister made at the end of the written part of his contribution.  He repeated that he will engage with this in a very honest way to strengthen the Bill if that is the joint committee's desire.  The Minister is well aware that in 2015 I published my own Bill which was debated in the House and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, Independents and a number of other parties at the time.  It was voted down by the Government.  It sought to do the same thing.  Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill has the support of a number of parties without reservation.  We need to move on because there is a clear support for the principle.  I argue that the principle is not the same as the principle the Minister spoke about on Second Stage.  There is clear support in terms of numbers for the principle that enough time has passed and enough effort has been made by the Government to reduce variable interest rates.  Acknowledging that some lenders have reduced their rates, now is the time for decisive action and legislation that will empower the Central Bank with an extra set of tools that will allow it to intervene in the market.</p><p> The Minister pointed out in his opening statement a number of concerns.  This is new.  We discussed earlier that this is not the first Opposition Bill that will have passed if this Bill passes, but it is the first time we will have had pre-legislative scrutiny in terms of an Opposition Bill.  What role is the Department, through the Minister, going to play in relation to the expertise on the Government side and its resources which are beyond the collective resources of the Opposition to ensure that we do not just point out issues in terms of section 5 or 7 but actually come forward with concrete suggestions based on the fact that the principle of intervening in the market and deeming a market failure is the dominant view at this time?  That is why we are in committee.</p></speech>

Since 1922, there has never been a minority Government to the degree we have now.  If one looks at what happens in the US Congress, one will see that Bills carry the names of the proposers quite frequently.  That gives one an insight into the process.  Very often it is across the aisle.  A Democrat and a Republican get together, see that there is an issue of concern and seek to address it by way of amending legislation.  They then try to build a majority behind the Bill.  They have their own independent office as we will have here shortly, I presume, for financial matters and they have their own legal office.  They have the resources without going back to Government Departments to enact legislation.  What will we do?  This morning, we are co-operating fully with the committee.  We analysed the Bill on Second Stage.  This morning, I am recording the primary concerns my officials have about the Bill.  I am also, however, saying that if there continues to be a majority in favour of this approach after the committee has heard various witnesses and taken the advice of the ECB and Central Bank, we will work with it if the members require amendments.  I reserve the right to put down amendments myself.  I do not know whether I have the right within Standing Orders to do so or whether we will put the amendments down through members of Fine Gael.</p> <p>  I am not too sure how this is going to proceed or where it is going to land.  The general intention, however, is to use the resources of the Department of Finance to remove any faults we perceive in the legislation.  Of course, we will have to do that with the consent of the majority of the members of the committee.  I acknowledge that there is a new process.  It is a new world and a new departure, but my primary concern is to legislate to make things better rather than to make things worse by accident or mistake.  I will fulfil that role.  I will not be taking a primary role in it.  It is Deputy McGrath's Bill and he is entitled to take the primary role.</p></speech>

However, we all acknowledge the role and expertise of the Department of Finance and the resources it has at its disposal.  I welcome the Minister's commitment there again.  Notwithstanding the reservations the Minister mentioned on Second Stage and the position the Government would take if it had a majority, is the Bill workable in terms of the principle of market intervention?  The Minister referred to strengthening the Bill and improving it if it is the decision of the committee to move to the next stage, which is formal committee consideration.  Is it the Department's view that the Bill can be strengthened to address the areas of concern it has and in such a way as to allow for the key principle, which is that the Central Bank would have the power to intervene in the market in relation to interest rates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.901" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#H00400"><p>That is the kind of thing we need to tease out here.  I have said there are concerns about the Bill and we need to tease them out.  I do not want to make any pre-emptive statement here, however, which might be taken as an indication that I would not co-operate.  I will co-operate if we can.  If this is enacted, it will not give any executive function to the Department of Finance.  The executive function is being given to the Central Bank which is independent in its statutory basis and in the way it operates.  I cannot direct the Central Bank, but the Oireachtas can regulate.  The Deputy is right that very early on the committee has to get the Central Bank people in and ask them about it.  The Central Bank made it clear publicly at the time Second Stage was being taken that it had not requested this power.  It also seemed to hint, if it did not say so bluntly, that it if it got the power, it might not use it.  There is no point in giving the Central Bank a power that it is not going to use.  It is not my place to advise the committee, but in my view that is a key question.  Will the Central Bank use the power if it gets it?  Next, consideration must be given to whether the Central Bank perceives an adverse effect of the legislation despite its advantages.  Could it assess the effect it might have on new entrants entering the mortgage market?  There is a range of genuine issues.</p> <p>  I agree with the committee that variable mortgage rates for existing mortgage holders of historic mortgages are too high for certain banks.  Other banks have moved and are providing very competitive rates.  The market for new entrants is pretty competitive now.  One can argue about small percentages, but there is no huge discrepancy there.  However, there is the discrepancy Deputy Michael McGrath pointed out, in particular in relation to banks like Danske, which has quit the market and is trying to collect as much as it can from its historic loan book, and Bank of Ireland which, no matter what way we talk to it, will not move on the very high rate it has for older mortgages.  It has moved significantly, however, on new mortgages.  It is not for me to call it but I will use the resources of the Department to help the committee and will comply with any request.  If finance spokespersons need briefing in the Department outside the ambit of the committee, we can arrange that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.902" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#H00500"><p>I will turn to certain points in the Bill in a moment.  The Minister has said today that certain banks are charging standard variable interest rates beyond what is acceptable.  We all agree on that.  We also acknowledge some of the movers in recent times.  The Minister mentioned Bank of Ireland, but it is not just that bank.  Permanent TSB is a State-owned bank yet it seems all of the threats have not worked.  I use the word "threats" because the Minister has stated publicly that he will bring in a penal levy if the banks do not reduce their interest rates.  He said he would bring in legislation like the legislation we are discussing this morning.  Nevertheless, Permanent TSB, a State-owned institution, is absolutely fleecing its customers.</p><p> In terms of what the Central Bank has stated publicly and what it has hinted at, as the Minister stated, one of the major concerns in terms of whether it wants the powers or not, and it is the Oireachtas that decides the powers the Central Bank should have and it is then up to the Central Bank to decide how it uses them, is that it will not use those powers.  If it does, we, as legislators, will have to consider what we do next, and my party will not be found wanting in that regard.  A commitment we gave to the campaign group prior to the election, which other parties have given also, is that we would go to the next step.  However, in terms of banks owned by the State charging 4% for loan to values of 80%, that is not much lower than that charged by Bank of Ireland.  In the absence of this type of legislation, what action can we take to ensure that the banks the State owns stop fleecing its existing and new customers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.904" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#J00200"><p>When the banks got into trouble it was part of the bailout programme that the Government entered into contractual arrangements with all the banks.  They were framework contracts, and interference in commercial decisions by the shareholder is excluded from the powers of the Minister.  The Deputy will see the reason for that when he thinks about it.  We have to allow the banks make commercial decisions, not political decisions.  If we went down that road someone would have to go to their local Deputy before they would get a loan, which is the ultimate abuse of it.  Under the terms of the framework document we cannot intervene.  The Deputy is being hard on Permanent TSB, PTSB, because it introduced a new product range based on loan to value rates.  Its loan to value rates for certain customers are quite attractive, but the purpose of today's meeting is not to examine the practices of any individual bank.  We are examining legislation, and I do not believe we should examine the practices of individual banks except in passing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.905" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#J00300"><p>That is what we are doing.  The Minister opened the discussion in terms of Bank of Ireland's rates being excessive, and Bank of Ireland has also introduced fixed term products similar to what other banks have done.  I am making the point that the arguments presented heretofore by the Government, which is that we should leave this to it and it will put pressure on the banks, have not worked in some circumstances, and the Minister's response today, in terms of the framework document in place, tells us that it cannot work.  He is not going to direct the banks because of that document.  Nobody is suggesting he should.  The banks do not have to listen to the Minster, even if he goes in with the bata m&oacute;r and tells them they should reduce their variable interest rates.  He is on record for a number of years with regard to that, yet we have stubbornly high interest rates not only in non-State owned banks but banks in which we have significant shares such as Bank of Ireland and those in which we have majority ownership such as Permanent TSB.</p> <p>  If the Minister wants to respond to that he can, but I want to return to the legislation and deal with the Minister's concerns in terms of section 5.  He said that permitting the Central Bank to impose a cap on standard variable rates which applies to one lender and not the market could potentially be considered as competitive distortions in the market and would enable the prevention of free movement of services and state aids.  Where does that sit in terms of the Central Bank currently having the power to set interest rates for individual providers when it comes to the issue of moneylenders?  With regard to moneylenders, the Central Bank has the power and utilises the power, and we can see from its website that different rates are applied to individual companies.  The Minister mentioned its potential but it does not lead to the concerns about competitive distortions.  It is not a case of one-size-fits all.  In a way, we have already done this for financial institutions, if we want to call moneylenders financial institutions, in that the Central Bank has the power to set the maximum interest rate applicable.  The interest rates are crazy, and I brought forward legislation on that a number of years ago to stop the Central Bank allowing moneylenders to charge up to 187% APR, but, nonetheless, some of them have APRs less than that and it is deemed to be on an individual case basis.  Given the power that already exists under statute and the power the Central Bank has, why is that not considered to be a competitive distortion yet the Minister believes that section 5, which similarly allows him to impose a standard variable rate on one lender but not on the wider market, would potentially result in competitive distortions?</p></speech>

I am not stating categorically that the difficulties I am pointing out cannot be overcome but what I am saying is that they have to be addressed by the committee.  I am not saying either that the difficulties are insurmountable.  It might be able to be done with a different draft.  Clearly, when I say that under natural law there should be an appeals system, what could be done is to bolt an appeals system onto the Bill.  All I am saying is that if this was Department of Finance legislation, at this point the assessment would be identifying issues and asking if we have to drop a section or can we amend it, can we change it, can we get the same effect by approaching it in a different way?  That is all I am doing.  I am signalling to the committee that there are areas that need to be examined, and then I am saying I am prepared to work with it to find solutions.  If my advice is that the issue does not present an insurmountable difficulty, there is a way around it by changing the legal approach by way of amendment on Committee Stage, we will work on it.  However, the underpinning issue all the time is the attitude of the Central Bank and the opinion of the Central Bank on the effect this might have on the wider market.  I cannot call that for the Deputy, but I can signal to him that there are concerns.</p></speech>

Is that about the competition element?  The point I was trying to make earlier was that these are very much concerns one would make in a Second Stage speech.  The Bill passed Second Stage in May.  We are now into October.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is something the Minister requested on Second Stage.  We are now at this point, yet what we are getting are Second Stage issues of concern instead of asking the experts, through the Minister, to come before the committee and give us something more concrete, such as the question I asked earlier.  The Central Bank already does that.  It intervenes with individual lenders and sets interest rates.  How is that different in terms of doing it for moneylenders?</p> <p>  There does not seem to be any meat on the concerns the Minister has raised.  I expected something more from the Department in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to engage with the committee, and he is a member of the select committee in terms of Committee Stage, but his contribution has not enlightened us much more beyond what has been said on Second Stage in terms of his concerns, the detail of those concerns and how they could be addressed in his view.</p></speech>

It is not a Committee Stage debate.  If it was I would be coming forward with detailed suggestions of amendments, but my view of it was that we were not at that point yet, so I have gone beyond the Second Stage speech in the D&aacute;il by focusing on particular areas of concern.

The law of unintended consequences may arise here.  The Deputy stated the Central Bank of Ireland would intervene if an entity charges an interest rate that is one third higher than the average variable mortgage interest rate.  Could this have the unintended consequence of preventing other mortgage providers from entering the market?  Perhaps the Minister or his officials will indicate how many new mortgage providers have entered the market in the past year.  Given the small number of providers, I am concerned that there will be a lack of competition in the market.  The provision with respect to charging an interest rate one third above the average interest rate would result in people paying a higher rate than they would pay if there were an appropriate number of new entrants in the market.  Will Deputy Michael McGrath respond to my point that this measure could have the unintended consequence of creating a barrier to entry for mortgage providers seeking to enter the market and would not have the desired effect of driving down interest rates?</p></speech>

In such circumstances, it could intervene and set a cap on a particular rate.

In recent years, Pepper has started lending some mortgages in the market.  I understand Frank mortgages has also applied for permission to lend, although I do not believe the application has been fully processed in the system.  As I stated, some credit unions wish to lend in the mortgage market but are precluded from doing so by lending restrictions that apply over longer terms.  I do not accept the premise that the option available to the Central Bank under section 5(d) would result in rates increasing.  The Central Bank may never need to use these powers.  It is my view that having these powers on the Statute Book would deter the type of practice that currently prevails in the market.  That is the important point.  The Central Bank is a policy taker, rather than policymaker.  It should also be listened to and we will listen to it when it has an opportunity to appear before the committee.  However, I do not accept the assertion that the option in section 5(d) would result in rates going up.</p></speech>

What I said was that if one has new entrants in the market, one would expect interest rates to come down.  If one has a barrier to new entrants, the worry would be in respect of a Central Bank review that finds that providers are charging a rate that is more than one third higher than the average variable interest rate charged by all mortgage providers.  If there are only five or six mortgage providers on the market and the average rate is 5%, the rate can be one third higher than that.  Let us assume, however, that there are 20 mortgage providers in the market and the average rate suddenly fell to 3%.  The only issue of consequence would be that if the legislation acts as a barrier to entry, someone could end up paying a higher rate because the average rate would be higher.  In such circumstances, the one third rule would not work because if more entrants had entered the market, the average rate would be much lower.</p></speech>

I am trying to do due diligence on the legislation.</p> <p>  When insolvency legislation was before the House, Deputy Michael McGrath was a vociferous advocate for the inclusion of an appeal mechanism in the Bill.  Section 11 of this legislation, however, specifically prohibits any form of appeal mechanism.  Not only does it not provide for an appeal mechanism, but the Bill specifically prohibits the establishment of such a mechanism.

The Senator raises a point of detail.  We will consider amendments if members believe an appeal mechanism would render the legislation constitutionally stronger.  While I would not be against that in principle, any such mechanism would have to be meaningful.  In the Bill, where the Central Bank arrives at a decision, an appeal can be made to the Central Bank.

There is no policy in the Department or at Government level to boost bank profits artificially in order that the shareholding base owned by the State will be more valuable.  That is not in the mix at all.  The primary interest is that the banks would operate to provide the kind of banking service a modern economy needs and would have the normal interplay of competitive banking offers in a market to support economic activity and jobs.  Once that happens the shareholding will have its value anyway.  There is no policy to conduct a fire sale of the shares or get money out of them because we do not need to anymore.  If it were three years ago, that might be a tempting option, but not now.  Was that the point the Senator raised?</p></speech>

The point I made was straightforward.  We are here today because the banks in certain cases are fleecing mortgage holders, many of whom are first-time buyers.  My question squares the circle.  How do we get a mechanism where banks do not charge a disproportionately high variable mortgage rate to boost their lack of profits in other areas yet maintain a balance in the market to attract new entrants?  The common thread among us all is that we believe the banks overcharge certain mortgage holders.  How can we stand over such a situation?</p></speech>

Second, they would say that they wrote a substantial number of tracker mortgages which are either are unprofitable or certainly were two years ago.  Maybe as we moves towards negative interest rates, the tracker mortgages may be showing slight profitability.  The banks will show figures that, taking the totality of their mortgage books, they are not profitable because the drag of the bad loans and the drag of the trackers.  It is one of the reasons they give for having variable mortgage interest rates higher than what would be the norm across Europe.  We all know they went bust, that they had to be rescued by the State and that they are working their way through the bad books.  That is the argument.  The Central Bank would agree with that analysis but it is not for me to speak for the Central Bank, and the committee will have it in here.  </p></speech>

Switching banks costs money and it is unlike switching one's electricity bill.  Who pays the piper?  Is it the bank that pays?  The Central Bank advocates switching.  Is it the customer who pays?  Will the bank pay the bill on a substantial mortgage as switching can cost a substantial amount?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#L02900"><p>First, I will respond to Senator Burke's question.  Yes, the Central Bank has calculated that 21% of mortgage holders would have savings if they switched, which is quite a high figure.  To encourage switchers, there was a campaign late last autumn and there another from about March up to April of 2015 to encourage people to switch.  A person with 20 years gone on 25 year mortgage who is dealing with the same crowd at very small money will not switch.  There is a kind of an inertia in the system.  Unless the savings are significant, people will not break with their traditional bank and that needs to be taken into account as well.</p> <p>  Since we started talking to the banks about these issues, many of them are now prepared to pay the switching costs.  The new lender, the bank being switched to, is prepared to pay the switching costs.  There are different offers across the banks.  In talking to constituents, there are serious offers in the system which can save serious money and the receiving bank will pay the switching fee.</p> <p>  Will Senator Horkan remind me again of his question?</p></speech>

I know from contacts with the Department that the banks are concerned about this legislation.  That is to be expected.  To my knowledge, they have not gone into the specifics of their concerns.  Some of those concerns came through in my Second Stage speech.</p> <p>  I put it to Senator Conway-Walsh that it is not true to say that the actions taken by me and my Department have not had results.  They have had very strong results in some banks, such as AIB.  Deputy McGrath quoted the rates, which are not much more than 3%.  I think one can now get a mortgage from AIB for something like 3.25% or 3.3%.  The rates here are getting into a space where they can compare with what is happening in some European countries.  They are certainly at the bottom.</p> <p>  AIB is not the only bank that is doing this.  Other banks have various offers.  PTSB is moving to a loan-to-value system whereby a customer pays a higher rate on a 90% mortgage than on a 50% mortgage.  If I have headroom because of the equity in my house beyond the level of my mortgage, I am a lower risk.  The banks are pricing for risk.  This suits some people but not others.</p> <p>  It is not true to say there has been no movement.  There are outliers that have moved on new lending to new mortgage holders but have not moved on their historic or legacy mortgages.  That is the difficulty.  This is now a new issue.  The programme for Government provides that the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, having due regard to their respective remits, will work "to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending".</p> <p>  Perhaps the committee should add the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to its list of invitees.  As the authority with responsibility for competition, it might have a particular perspective on many of these issues, which relate to competition.  In general terms, I am simply giving my position on the matter.  I do not disagree with the fundamental principle of what the Senator is saying, which is that variable interest rates seem to be too high in the cases of certain mortgages and we should continue to bring those rates down.</p></speech>

I believe that if we can get new entrants into the market and if we can have more competition between the existing people who are offering mortgages and new entrants, that will push interest rates down.  Deputy McGrath is frustrated about how long it is taking some lenders to bring their rates down.  He is advocating that we legislate to force rates down.  The objective is the same.</p></speech>

I want to underline my own views in so far as supporting this Bill is concerned.  Individuals and families out there are suffering greatly because of the attitude of the banks to providing assistance to solve problems between banks and borrowers.  Some of them are unhelpful to a degree.  It is almost impossible for some people, depending on their status, etc., with the banks, to deal with them.  This problem is still the same.</p> <p>  The banks refer people very quickly to the courts.  As I said earlier, as legislators we should go down to see some of those eviction courts.  They are outrageous.  People are not given an opportunity to defend themselves or explain their cases.  The various initiatives that have been taken, such as house purchases by voluntary housing agencies and the mortgage-to-rent scheme, are just not working.  The banks are not playing ball.  They are favouring new borrowers who are coming in because such cases involve dealing with new sets of figures on a new page.  They are not willing to assist borrowers on their books who are in really deep trouble.  Until they are driven to the point where they are forced to deal with such borrowers, we will continue to have this problem with the banks.  We can imagine what it is like to deal with sub-prime lenders as they are just outrageous in their behaviour and their treatment of people.</p> <p>  In my opinion, the State was more than good to the banks when it bailed them out and gave them an opportunity to continue in the marketplace.  This was done because it was decided the banks were essential in terms of the availability of money.  The behaviour of the banks does not show any sign of change.  As the banks are getting back on their feet, they are even more aggressive and have no consideration for people.  That is certainly what I am finding when I speak to people who are dealing generally with the banks.</p> <p>  The manner in which evictions are coming about is an outright disgrace.  The way people are treated when they end up in one of those courts is an outright disgrace.  The banks are taking people's houses even though those people have done their utmost to work with the banks to try to keep their houses.  It appears that the legislative system and all of us in this House have failed.  The banks have got up off their uppers and are back at the same game again.  They are treating people in an abominable fashion.  I cannot stand over their activities.</p> <p>  We will take it up with the banks and the Central Bank when they come in here.  No one is assisting consumers in this area.  The Central Bank's consumer protection efforts are not working for people.  Like other members, I am dubious about what we are told about switching accounts.  People cannot switch their accounts unless they have the muscle to do so.  Otherwise, they are locked into their banks and no other bank is interested in them.  New entrants into the market will show no interest whatsoever in someone who is in difficulty.  Therefore, customers are at the mercy of the banks they are with.  The banks show no mercy.  That is the awful disgrace of this.  As they rebuild their balance sheets, the people who are most marginalised and affected by this are being shown no mercy whatsoever.  I have to put that on the record.</p></speech>

I have welcomed the Bill previously.  In particular, I welcome the intention to take any amendments or alterations that would enhance the Bill in any way.  My question relates to vulture funds.  I am rather concerned about mortgages, including variable rate mortgages, that are being bought up by vulture funds.  Will this Bill give those affected any assurance in terms of rate caps?  Will the Bill cover them?  Earlier, Deputy McGrath referred to regulated and unregulated categories.  What category do such mortgages come under?  Are they captured in this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.999" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102000002#N00900"><p>This is an important issue.  There is a gap in the existing legislation around credit servicing.  Many of the vulture funds that bought loan books are not directly regulated in Ireland.  However, they must appoint an intermediary, which is regulated, that is to say, a credit servicing firm.  Pepper is probably the best-known example.  The legislation could only apply to regulated entities and, therefore, it would apply to the intermediary.  All contact from a customer in respect of a mortgage is with the intermediary.  I have argued that the actual owners of the loans should be regulated and I gather Sinn F&eacute;in holds a similar view.  Currently, they are not and I believe that is a deficiency.  This Bill will apply to regulated entities and, therefore, it will apply to the credit servicing firm with which the customer has all contact.</p> <p>  Another body of work remains to be done to bring all the funds within the ambit of Central Bank regulation.  Currently, they are not.  I have argued that the owners of the loans make all the ultimate decisions on those loans.  If there is a decision on interest rate policy, accepting or restructuring of a mortgage or a decision about going down the enforcement and legal routes, then the decision is made not by the intermediary but by the owner of the loan.  However, currently, the owners are not required to be regulated under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015.  That gap has to be bridged first before we can bring the funds into this legislation.  The legislation does cover the credit servicing firm, which is an intermediary.</p></speech>

It is of no use having that relationship with the intermediary under this Bill.  Am I correct?  Would it have any impact, even some limited impact, when we refer to the intermediary as opposed to the owner?</p></speech>

Therefore, it would come under the legislation.  The customer's direct relationship is with the intermediary, even though the intermediary does not own the overall loan.  It is only a matter of a short time, I hope, before the Oireachtas will deal with the issue of bringing the owners of loans directly within the ambit of regulation.  They are not currently and, therefore, we cannot do it in this Bill.  That would require a separate Bill.</p></speech>

Can the owner decide on the rate without any reference to how the intermediary might be bound by this legislation?  Is that the position regardless of whether the rate is 5%, 7%, 10% or whatever?

There is a gap, however.  It is a gap that can be traced back to last year's legislation.  The Central Bank was of the view that the funds themselves should be regulated.  The Department and Minister took a different view and just brought the intermediaries within the scope of regulation.  To my mind, what I refer to is an anomaly that should be addressed.

I do not subscribe to the view that there is more competition if there are more entrants to the market.  I remember speaking on this very subject quite a number of years ago when there were new entrants in my home town, Castlebar, a small town.  There were 14 places where one could borrow money and everything went belly-up after that.</p> <p>  The Minister has expressed reservations about the view of the Central Bank and the constitutionality of the Bill.  We are at the pre-legislative stage now.  Second Stage has been completed in the D&aacute;il.  What are Deputy Michael McGrath's views now after his having heard the Minister's views on the Central Bank and his views on constitutionality, which he expressed on Second Stage?  There is a considerable amount of work to do on the Bill if we are to bring in the Central Bank representatives and get the legal opinions required to allay the fears over a constitutional problem with the Bill.  All the other Stages must then be completed and the Bill must then proceed to the Seanad.</p></speech>

As we are not in the business of advancing legislation that is unconstitutional, that issue will need to be clarified.  The Bill is with the Parliamentary Counsel so we will get an opinion from that source.  The Government also needs to get an opinion from the Attorney General.  I do not believe the Bill is unconstitutional but I am not a senior counsel and am not qualified to hold an informed opinion on that.  This issue has to be addressed and it will be done through the Parliamentary Counsel.  I encourage the Department of Finance to refer the Bill to the Office of the Attorney General for advice also.</p> <p>  My overall view on the need for the Bill has not changed.  Ultimately, it is about helping mortgage holders who are paying over the odds.  Many of them are trapped and are being taken advantage of.  The proposed powers are necessary.  The Bill will provide the Central Bank with extra tools.  We cannot compel it to use them because it is ultimately independent but we will see what shape the final draft of the legislation takes.  I am very much open to ideas to improve and strengthen the Bill.  As I stated, it is an honest effort to address a problem.  No one in opposition has access to anything like the resources on the Government side, including civil servants, the Attorney General, parliamentary draughtsmen and so on.  We have done a good job in bringing the Bill to this point but now the Oireachtas has to take ownership of it and make it the best Bill it can possibly be.  It is designed to help mortgage holders, and that really is a litmus test as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

At that stage, Irish mortgage rates were 1.9 percentage points higher than average eurozone interest rates.  There was no justification for that at all.  Today, two years later, Irish mortgage rates are 1.6 percentage points higher than those in other eurozone countries.  While mortgage rates have come down, they have come down throughout the eurozone and not just as a result of our campaign, although I would like to believe the campaign we have been running for two years has resulted in the 1% reduction in the nominal rates in Ireland.  A good part of the reduction is attributable to quantitative easing, as mentioned earlier.  Rates have decreased across Europe but the gap has hardly moved at all.  That is completely unjustified.</p> <p>  Over the two years, a person on a mortgage of &euro;200,000 has already paid approximately &euro;6,000 more than he or she should have.  He or she will continue to pay at a rate of &euro;3,000 per year for the next number of years while he or she has the mortgage.  The payments will reduce as the capital is paid off.  There is a huge charge being imposed on ordinary Irish families as a result of these interest rates.</p> <p>  There are two separate aspects to this Bill.  They are separate but equally important.  The first part concerns section 7, which prohibits discrimination against existing borrowers.  If the Houses decide the rest of the Bill is unconstitutional or undesirable, it does not stop them passing section 7.  I hope the whole Bill can be passed.  Section 7, on its own, would be a huge step forward, however.  It is the section that makes sure lenders offer the same rates and incentives to existing customers as to new customers.</p> <p>  What has happened in the market is that Allied Irish Banks and Ulster Bank offer existing customers the same rate as new customers.  When they compete, they bring the rates down for everybody but the other banks, including KBC, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and, more recently, EBS, have introduced completely new lower rates for new customers and just tell existing customers they cannot avail of them, or they keep all their rates high and compete by giving incentives, such as 2% cash back.  We are talking about the new business rate having fallen to 3.5% or whatever it is, but many customers of Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB are currently paying at a rate of 4.5%.  As mentioned on numerous occasions, there are customers of Danske Bank paying at a rate of 4.95%.  If section 7 were passed, it would be helping very many people.</p> <p>  The other aspect is equally important.  We have been working on this for two years and have got almost nowhere.  As Deputy Michael McGrath has said, I would much prefer if the banks had responded and if this legislation were not needed.  I would be a free market capitalist.  I want to see markets working but I am not an ideologue.  If the markets are not working, I want to see the State intervening to make them work.</p><p>This market has not worked.  People are being put in a very difficult position and the Central Bank says it is nothing to do with it, let competition resolve it.  Competition will not resolve it.  I have heard the Minister say that competition benefits all bank customers.  It does not benefit the 46,000 people who are customers of vulture funds or the customers of Bank of Ireland who are on 4.5% who cannot switch.  We are hoping Frank Mortgages will start lending.  If it does, it will lend 80% loan to value mortgages to people on 3.5 times income.  It will be a very small niche market lender and people who have a bad credit record, who have 90% loan to value will not get any benefit at all from that sort of competition.  They are just the highlights.  I will ask Stefan Goor to say a bit about his situation.</p></speech>

We looked into the various options on how the different types of mortgage worked and we went to a broker for some extra reassurance and in case we had questions.  At the time we got a 60%-80% loan to value mortgage at a particular rate.  Shortly after we took out the mortgage that rate was cut but we did not receive a reduction in our payments.  This seemed contrary to the general understanding of variable rate mortgages.  We queried it with the broker who also seemed surprised and was not familiar with that scenario but the bank in question suggested that this was available only to new customers.  Since we took out the mortgage there have been four cuts, totalling 0.6% and we are currently paying a &euro;100 per month more than a customer who would take out the identical mortgage today.  Over the term of the mortgage we will be paying approximately &euro;30,000 more than somebody who got an identical mortgage today.  This is only a comparison between our mortgage and someone with the same lender who took an equivalent mortgage.  If we compare it with the eurozone average that Mr. Burgess spoke about we are paying almost &euro;100,000 more over the term of our mortgage than someone on the average eurozone rate.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we cannot switch.  Recently I became self-employed, as I was in the fortunate position of starting a company with some colleagues, but that prevents me from switching mortgage.  We would also like to go to a fixed rate but the fixed rates available are not appealing, especially when one considers that elsewhere in Europe we could get a ten year fixed rate at approximately 2%.  We feel that what is going on is unfair.  New customers get better rates than existing customers.  Even existing customers are on different rates and are treated differently.  The banks want to attract new business but show no concern for existing business.  Competition will not fix this for us.  If another bank comes in we cannot switch.  If a new bank comes in it may act in the same way.  Not all banks act in this way but without some intervention they could.  We believe this is a breach of the consumer protection code.  We have made a complaint, which was dismissed and we are currently in the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, dispute process but that is a very long and time-consuming process and many people would not have the time or be able to spare the effort to do it.</p> <p>  Section 7 is very important and would save many people from this unfair scenario.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to raise this and the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign and Mr. Burgess in particular for representing so many mortgage customers. </p></speech>

I represent an average story that thousands of mortgage customers and families have gone through and are still going through in this country.  I have heard the word relevant a lot today.  I hope my family and my money are relevant.  My mortgage rose quickly for no other reason than that the lender ran its business badly, to put it mildly.  Now I am going to help fix it.  The lender's attitude is that it is my tough luck if I do not like the arrangement because it has the deeds to the house where I and my family live.  The interest rate went from 3.8% in January 2010 to a colossal 6.25% in August 2011.  At that stage, from memory, AIB and Bank of Ireland were charging 3% and 3.25%.  That rate increase on my mortgage made a 20% increase in my monthly payment.  As if things were not tight enough, my lender certainly saw to it that it would make things worse.  A steady rise to 6.25% saw things getting very tight.  To add insult to injury, repossession proceedings were issued because of the arrears despite the arrears being small and decreasing.  The final smack in the face was the court charge of &euro;1,200 imposed on my mortgage account despite the registrar's throwing out the case against the bank and not awarding costs to either party.  I did not receive a letter stating that the account was being charged.  The &euro;1,200 is on the loan principal, which amounts to &euro;1,800 over the term of the loan.</p> <p>  Having the ability to increase the cost of a product with little justification other than we can and we will is a truly unique business to be in.  If any other business did that the customers would shop around and leave swiftly.  Why not move?  Many mortgage customers in this country do not have the clean slate that new business or better offers demand.  This leaves a very large portion of the mortgage market at the mercy of the existing lender to extort when it sees fit.  If I walk up to someone in the street and demand &euro;50 from that person criminal charges could follow.  When a bank writes to a customer and extorts an increase in the lending rate nothing happens.  The word extort is accurate, it means the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats.  Apart from physical harm, there are few threats greater than losing one's home or one's home being at risk.</p> <p>  The basic nature of a consumer is to shop around.  Few people buy from the person who is too expensive.  These rules do not apply to a mortgage.  Moving a mortgage costs the customer money if he or she can move at all.  Depending who one asks, the figures are fluid but one thing is for sure: tens of thousands of mortgage customers are stuck where they are.  Being stuck with a mortgage lender who squeezes one is like wearing concrete shoes.  Recently I have moved three of my five utility bills because it was free, easy, saved me money and I could.  The emphasis is on "I could".  Other banks offer better deals than the one I have but I am firmly stuck.</p> <p>  The proposition of competition to deter overcharging lenders might work if everyone had good credit records, better wages and met the now stringent criteria set down by the banks, all of which suit the demands of the lender, a far cry from their historical standards.  Despite having 60% loan to value, LTV, I do not have a fitting credit record.  I have called other lenders and when they hear I was in arrears they tell me there is no point in applying.  The painful irony is that the main reason I was in arrears was the high mortgage rate.  Even if the drop in my income caused me to go into arrears I would have cleared these arrears much earlier had Permanent TSB been charging me a fair rate.  A recent phone call to a lender with better rates than my own proved that a lender can have the pick of people to lend to.  That rules out a huge part of the mortgage customer base because of reduced income, credit history, increased living expenses and a list of other factors that tips the scales to the lender.  If a customer like me with 60% LTV cannot move there are new levels of bias at work.</p> <p>  The Central Bank estimates that 21% of borrowers, that is approximately 144,000 mortgages, could save money by switching to a new lender.  What it does not say is how many borrowers actually can switch.  An article states that only 38 people switch every month, a tiny fraction of the mortgage market.</p><p>I am one of them.  I could switch to five different lenders that are cheaper than my existing lender, saving me between &euro;45 and &euro;100 per month, but none will touch me.  A letter from Permanent TSB in 2012 stated &quot;I want to make it clear that I don't believe that permanent tsb has performed to an acceptable standard in recent years.&quot;  It went on to state:</p><blockquote>many of the bank's customers suffered financially because of the impact of decisions which should not have been taken.  I apologise for the mistakes which were made and I am determined to do all in my power to rectify them.</blockquote><p>This came from a company which gouged about 75,000 variable rate customers over the course of a year and a half.  I rang the bank shortly after receiving this letter and asked whether I would get a refund on the over-charging since it was sorry.  There was a graveyard silence on the phone.<br/><br/>I will now deal with help from the Government at the time.  The mortgage interest supplement was a quick political injection to help struggling mortgages and was, of course, means tested.  Not much came from banks.  In fact, the only thing that came from banks was restructuring; some forbearance, by which I mean that it will bide its time; threatening letters; interest rate hikes; and a waiting game until increased house prices gave the banks back equity to threaten people with repossession.  <br/><br/>The Minister claimed this Bill was unconstitutional and that there was no need for it.  Is it in accordance with the Constitution to allow a small group of companies which have a huge impact on thousands of families and which repeatedly squeeze their customers to continue doing so?  Why is the can constantly kicked to the customer to bear the brunt of the bill to fix things that were mostly not their doing?  A headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>asks &quot;why banks have been so reluctant to reduce variable mortgage rates&quot; and the simple answer is that banks charge high rates because they can and are allowed to.  It is not complicated to understand that they will not reduce their rates because the banks make millions more with high rates.  The Government does nothing about it and that is why there is a need for this Bill.  Gas, electricity, bus fares, taxis, airport charges, pensions and insurance are regulated.  In fact there are few financial products that are not regulated or have not been regulated in the past.  Bank interest rates are not regulated.  Banking operations were rumoured to be regulated in the day but this is a rumour.  That is why legislation is needed.</p></speech>

I think they have all confirmed what we have all been expressing over the past number of years and why legislation like this is needed.  Mr. Burgess said that European banks' interest rates are far lower and that customers can get long-term loans in other European countries at much lower interest rates.  How can those banks do that and Irish banks and European banks operating here cannot?</p></speech>

The Irish banks would be very profitable lending money at 2% to Irish borrowers.  They choose not to because, as Mr. McNally pointed out, they do not have to.  There is no real competition there.  The lowest rate is 3.1%.  That is for people with a clean credit record with less than 50% loan to value.  Irish banks could lend at 2% and would make plenty of profits at that, so they just choose not to.  There is more competition in other countries.  There are plenty of banks competing actively for it.</p> <p>  The link between the cost of funds and the mortgage rate has been broken in this country.  About four or five years ago when Permanent TSB was charging Mr. McNally 6.25%, AIB and Bank of Ireland were charging 3%.  At the time, they were paying about 3% for deposits and they also had to pay the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, on deposits.  I argued at the time that those mortgage rates were unsustainably low so I am not here saying that I want everything to be as low as possible and I want tracker mortgages for everybody.  I was criticised for calling on banks to raise rates to an acceptable level.  They did start bringing them up and then they just way beyond what they should.  There is nothing to stop Irish banks charging a fair mortgage rate.  </p> <p>  One of the reasons given in the Central Bank report mentioned by Deputy Sherlock and the Minister was that the Irish banks are still recovering from the bad losses they made.  The Irish banks have fully provided for home loans in their accounts.  They have set reserves aside in full so for last year and the previous year, their profits were boosted by writing back profits.  The bad loans in the past have actually been a source of profits for the Irish banks and they should serve to bring down mortgage rates and not be used as an excuse for raising them.  </p></speech>

The Central Bank does not have clean hands in this area.  I would prefer if we had a properly functioning Central Bank that was interested in protecting the consumer or balancing the interests of consumers and banks.  I do not want to see bad banks because we want low rates just for mortgages.  You cannot hand control of mortgage rates over to the Department of Finance so the only institution that could do it is the Central Bank.  I agree there may be stage two in respect of this matter.  If the Central Bank ignores the wishes of the Oireachtas and does not do what it is supposed to do and make sure fair mortgage interest rates are charged, it may be necessary to revisit the legislation and put in place some form of hard cap.  As I said, I would prefer if this legislation was not necessary and I certainly would not like to see a hard rate like the ECB or cost of funds plus 3% in the legislation but if it is required, it must be done.</p></speech>

What would be natural and fair rates?  The presentation referred to the Netherlands but given what we have been through, is there an argument that Irish rates should be higher than other wealthy western European countries for the foreseeable future as a result of the legacy?  Is there a legacy cost or do the witnesses think we should just draw a line under that and that there should be no impact going forward?  Is it fair to expect a legacy cost to be factored in to Irish mortgage rates?</p></speech>

I do accept that if you lend 90% loan to value, it is a riskier loan than if you lend 60% loan to value.  When lending that money, the bank does not know which of those will default so they must charge the 90% person more.  I accept that but I do not see why a bank should charge Mr. Goor more money because it gave me a tracker ten years ago.  If I went into Doheny &amp;amp; Nesbitt to ask for a pint of Guinness and was told it was &euro;10, I would reply that it should not be &euro;10.  It would be as though I then was told they had served a lot of people that morning and as a mistake in the till meant they had charged everyone &euro;1, they had to make up the profits.  Then, the Central Bank would come along to say it had looked at Doheny &amp;amp; Nesbitt's accounts and as they were the same average profits as other banks on that stretch of the road, it would ask what I was complaining about.</p></speech>

There is however, no doubt about it that it is very difficult for a bank in Ireland to actually repossess a home.  There is not a huge sanction for people who do not pay their mortgage.  A 90% loan-to-value is far more risky to a bank.  In the UK a 90% mortgage is about 1% more expensive than a 50% mortgage.  It looks to me as if there should be a risk factor of about 1%, or somewhere around that, going from a 50% loan-to-value up to a 90% loan-to-value.  I would work on the current rate, which is about 2%, and I would raise it for higher, riskier loans.</p></speech>

There were all sorts of issues.  The switching code put a requirement onto the old bank to co-operate.  In switching mortgages, however, there is no requirement for the old bank to co-operate.  A person could go in to the old bank with the cheque from the new bank for the outstanding mortgage amount of &euro;326,000 and then that person is finished with the old bank.  The only real problem and difficulty for the switching of mortgages lies with the credit procedures of the new bank and there is also the legal paperwork etc.  There is also the general inertia - there are a lot of borrowers who could save money by switching, and they do not do it.  I have not decided if I should have sympathy for those people.  While it is okay for me and I would be quite happy and comfortable with switching, somebody else might not be comfortable going through that process and they just stay.  I have spoken to some people who have no idea and they do not understand they are being overcharged.  I tell them they are paying 1% more than they should be.  One person paying a mortgage of &euro;200,000 asked me how much was 1% of that.  I was very shocked at that.  I assumed that everybody knew that 1% of &euro;200,000 was &euro;2,000 and that would be the amount to pay but he did not understand that.</p></speech>

Mr. McNally made the point that part of the reason he was in arrears was because of the high rates and now because of the arrears he cannot switch.  It is really a double whammy.  He is a prisoner of Permanent TSB.  He is on a low loan-to-value and he has cleared the arrears but no bank will touch his loan.  They just look at the Irish Credit Bureau record and if there is a mark that says a person was in arrears within the last five years then that is it and there is no further discussion.  The banks do not need to know what a person's income is or why they were in arrears - that is just it.</p></speech>

For example, if somebody has children then child care costs must be factored in or - like me - a person might become self-employed.  Even changing jobs can preclude a person from being able to switch.</p></speech>

With regard to quantitative easing, I have grave concerns about what happens when the European quantitative easing stops.  I do not think that people fully understand the extent of the quantitative easing and how that has been played.  It has almost been put under the radar.  It is propping up the whole system which is extremely vulnerable.  What does Mr. Burgess believe will happen when quantitative easing ends?  It has to at some point, when the ECB rates go back to normal levels.  Has Mr. Burgess carried out any assessment on what that would mean for mortgage rates?</p></speech>

Two years ago it was 0.15% and now it is zero.  While it has fallen by 0.15% rates have fallen by far more than that because with quantitative easing the banks are full of money.  They have nobody to lend it to, or they will lend it at whatever rates they can get.  I would be concerned that when quantitative easing stops and when mortgage rates rise - and if we do not fix this problem before the ECB rate starts to rise again - one can be quite sure that the banks are going to pass on every interest rate rise.  Mr. Goor thought he was taking out a variable rate mortgage but KBC seemed to think that variable was only upwards.  Mr. Goor could have fixed at the time and could have had the benefit of fixing, but he now has the worst of both worlds.</p></speech>

A person takes out a variable rate mortgage loan assuming its movement will be linked to the cost of funds, the competition etc., but it is not.  The variable rate is at the bank's discretion.</p></speech>

I was concerned about the 80% cut-off because at 80% people, generally speaking, pay an interest rate of about 0.2% to 0.5% lower.  The 80% cut-off would have forced people to borrow 80% when a 79% mortgage would be cheaper.  I am glad it is being brought down to 70%, which I read in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  That is good.  It will stop people taking out excessive mortgages.</p></speech>

Consider somebody who is buying a house at &euro;400,000.  Under current Central Bank rules and without any exemptions being in place they would need a deposit of &euro;58,000 but somebody who had a loan-to-value ratio of 70%, would already have savings of &euro;120,000 and &euro;20,000 of that could come from the help-to-buy scheme.  Would the witness acknowledge that this drop in the loan-to-value ratio is providing a grant of &euro;20,000 into the back pockets of people who can nearly double the amount of savings that are required under the Central Bank's rules?</p></speech>

On the one hand I believe that people should be encouraged to save and put a deposit together.  By and large I support the Central Bank's rules.  The overall 80% is a good idea as is the exemption for first-time buyers, that is, the 90% for first-time buyers up to &euro;220,000 and the various exemptions.</p><p>I am not a fan of the Central Bank but I believe it has got this right.  I have mixed views on the first-time buyers grant.  I would prefer if the Government was not interfering with the market, but 12% of the sale price of new houses goes on VAT so I view the 5% as almost a partial refund of the 12%.  I do not have the same big problem with that as do other people.  The &euro;600,000 ceiling appears to be mad and way too high.  I would probably reduce it to &euro;300,000, which is a different way of answering the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

We will see what is in the Finance Bill on that measure in the next couple of hours.  To return to the issue at hand, I commend the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign.  It has done sterling work in raising this issue in a focused, concentrated way.  I was glad to be invited to some of the campaign's events and I appreciate the advice it has given us in the past.  As Deputy Michael McGrath acknowledged, there are a number of key people.  Obviously, many people have been on the receiving end of being fleeced by interest rates, but a number of prominent individuals, particularly in the media, such as Charlie Weston and others have continued to raise this issue.  Hopefully, all of this, including Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill and my Bill in 2015, has created some pressure on some of the lenders, which we have acknowledged, but some remain stubbornly on a higher rate.</p> <p>  The presentation is excellent and succinct, and gives us the data in the condensed pack that are required.  The fact that the banks are charging too much and that certain people cannot switch is well established.  Now, we must figure out what to do about it.  What is before us is the direct intervention - the determination of a market failure and the subsequent intervention by the Central Bank.  With that in mind, and with regard to the legislation presented by Deputy Michael McGrath and following what the Government has said or not said today, does the campaign have any suggestions to the committee as to how the Bill could be strengthened and on whether it needs to be strengthened or otherwise?  For example, the appeals process has been raised.  It has been stated, and rightly so, that there is not an appeals process for every mechanism or body.  Does Mr. Burgess have views on where we should seek to strengthen the Bill, if it requires it?</p></speech>

There might be some minor issues.  It states: "In setting a variable interest rate for a group, class or category...".  I would delete the word "variable".  In setting a rate, whether it is fixed or variable, I do not wish to see just good variable rates, but long-term fixed rates as well.  I would certainly feed in some things such as that.  On section 7 on the prohibition of discrimination against existing customers, I do not know if anybody is arguing with that or if it must be checked with the ECB.  I do not know if there could be a constitutional challenge to it.  Is there any way to get that through as an emergency measure and then let us see the arguments in the Supreme Court about the constitutionality of the other provisions and whether the Central Bank wishes to approve it?  That alone, and there are only approximately 20 words in the section, would be a huge help to many people and it would answer many of the points the Central Bank and the Minister make with regard to competition affecting all customers.  That would mean the competition would be helped.  That is one point.</p> <p>  I had not thought of the appeals process until Senator O'Donnell raised it.  There is probably a natural justice issue but I do not know enough about the area to know whether it is standard in legislation.  I certainly would not object to it in any way.  If Senator O'Donnell thinks it is a good idea, it probably is.</p></speech>

He can look back on the record.</p> <p>  What if the Central Bank sends out a signal to say in effect, "Let them do whatever they want and give us the power, we will not do anything about it.

You have restored your balance sheets at the expense of these guys so let us start playing ball at this stage.  We do not want that legislation".</p></speech>

I thank the campaign group for all the work it has done over the last few years.  It started with the Permanent TSB issue and the rates of over 6%, which affected Mr. McNally.  I thank Mr. McNally and Mr. Goor for sharing their personal stories.  They are representative of many thousands of others who are affected by high variable rates.  There is an onus on us to act and I believe we have made a good start.  There has been some progress.  Some of it is attributable to the campaign's work and the pressure in the Oireachtas, which in turn forced the Minister to meet the banks and raise the issue.  It had not even been on the agenda until all of us worked collectively to get it there.</p> <p>  I have some brief questions for Mr. Burgess.  The issue he highlights, the discrimination between existing customers and new customers, is a key one.  Is that particular to Ireland?  In Europe fixed rates are far more common, with many customers on long-term fixed rates.  However, that discrimination undoubtedly exists.  Perhaps the Central Bank already has the power to deal with that under the consumer protection provisions, but I am not sure.</p> <p>  If all of the rates in the market were around 3% to 3.5%, where AIB is positioned currently, would legislation such as this be warranted?  Will he give us an idea of the cost of funds the banks are currently enjoying in the market?  They do not get all of their money from the ECB; it is a combination of wholesale funding, deposits and some ECB money.  Mr. Burgess is something of an expert on this issue.  What is the cost of funds the banks typically face now?</p></speech>

The UK is the market I probably know most about, as I keep an eye on what is happening there.  It has standard variable rates and high standard variable rates but it has a very active switcher market.  Where people are on variable rates in most eurozone countries and in the UK they can switch.  The existing mortgage rates might be higher but there probably is no need to introduce legislation in those countries.  The problem is quite specific to Ireland.  Negative equity, mortgage arrears and restructured mortgages mean people cannot switch so existing customers must be treated fairly.</p><p>If mortgage rates decreased to 2.5% or 3% and people could switch, there would be less of a need for the legislation.  Tomorrow, one of the vulture funds could decide it wanted to charge 10%.  Mr. McNally knows what it is like for a bank to increase its rate to 6.5% over a few months while other banks are charging 3%.  There is nothing a mortgage holder can do.  Mr. McNally attended the permanent tsb AGM and complained about it.</p></speech>

An ordinary consumer should not have to do this to highlight an issue.  Although there would be less of a need for the legislation, the Central Bank almost needs the weapon in its quiver.  I would prefer the Central Bank to have it and not use it than not to have it.</p> <p>  According to the interim reports of the three banks, as of the first half of 2016, permanent tsb's cost of funds was 0.75%, Bank of Ireland's was 0.73%, and AIB's was 1.28%.  Bank of Ireland said it was making 0.37%, 37 basis points, on tracker mortgages.  All the banks are making profits on tracker mortgages, notwithstanding the argument about the drag of the legacy issues.  While the profits are not as big as the profits on non-tracker mortgages, they are very profitable.</p></speech>

A new lender that enters the market will never be interested in those.  There are 300,000 non-tracker mortgage holders, of whom at least 150,000 are either in negative equity, an LTV of more than 80%, arrears, a restructured loan, or their job has changed, or something else.  The target mortgage book for a new lender is very small.  It is no more than 150,000, and if a new lender got 10% of it, which would be an extraordinary achievement, it would be 15,000 borrowers which is not enough to sustain a large UK lender such as Nationwide.  Nationwide could not come into the Irish market.</p></speech>

The Central Bank can then move in.  If the average is kept high due to a lack of competition in the market, there could be an unintended consequence.

We do not want lenders to come in to take money at 4.5%.  The legislation will not stop the likes of The Frank Mortgage.

They are both going to speak to us on the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions.  I propose that we hear from Dr. Anthony Soares first, followed by Mr. Peter Sheridan, and then I will take questions.</p><p>I need to advise everybody of the privilege rules.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l) </i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I thank our guests for joining us today.  I invite Dr. Anthony Soares to make his opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to present the Centre for Cross Border Studies' views  on the implications of the recent UK referendum decision for the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions.  If the committee is agreeable, I will present a summary of the statement prepared by our director, Ruth Taillon, who unfortunately was not able to be present with us here today.<br/><br/>As I believe the members will be aware, the Centre for Cross Border Studies was established in 1999 to support and promote cross-Border co-operation on the island in the context of the imperative for cross-Border co-operation embedded in the Agreement.  Strand two was and is a reflection of the centrality of the Border to the conflict and, in turn, to the peace process.  Much of the public debate since the referendum has focused on the physical Border and whether it will be hard or soft.  While we agree that there is a strong consensus among most people and their political representatives that there should be no return to the Border of the past, which at one time was the most militarised border in Europe, we would certainly share concerns about any outcome of the negotiations that would result in the land Border becoming a barrier to free movement in any way.<br/><br/>Prior to the referendum there were already indications of the potential for the Border to become a focus for increased political tensions.  All academic commentators have also expressed serious concerns about the implications of the referendum decision for the peace process.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies shares many of these concerns about the possible implications for the stability of the peace process.  We are also alarmed at the prospect of changes to the Agreement and its institutions that could arise as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<br/><br/>The Agreement specifically provides, under stand two, Article 17, for the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, to facilitate co-operation and co-ordination in EU matters.  The NSMC&rsquo;s remit in this area would clearly be altered by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  However, rather than its EU role becoming redundant, it may become of greater importance, providing a mechanism to address emerging impacts of the withdrawal process.  In addition, provision for the views of the NSMC to be represented at relevant EU meetings through Irish Government Ministers and officials could provide a continuing platform for the Northern Ireland Executive to raise issues and have an input to EU policy-making.<br/><br/>The future operation and development of the North-South implementation bodies would clearly be challenged with Northern Ireland outside the European Union.  The presumed ineligibility of Northern Ireland for continued access to EU Structural Funds would appear to end the current role of the special European Union programmes board, SEUPB, after the closure of the 2014-2020 programmes, although it could find a continuing role in the delivery of funding schemes for co-operation between EU members states and non-EU members states or other funding mechanisms that the Governments may want to consider.  The remit of InterTradeIreland to promote cross-Border business and trade would also face considerable challenges in the event of the UK having restricted access to the Single Market post-Brexit.  In the longer term, growing policy divergence between the UK and the Republic would potentially impact on the work of <i>safe</i>food, Waterways Ireland, and the Loughs Agency.  Regardless of policy changes, the day-to-day operation of the bodies, which draw staff from both sides of the Border, would be complicated by any departure by the UK from EU employment law.<br/><br/>The east-west institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, including the British-Irish Council, would face similar challenges in the delivery of their EU remit.</p><p>While not directly linked to the withdrawal from membership of the European Union, we are also very concerned about the proposed withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, which could place Britain in breach of its international obligations under the<b></b>Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>The repeal of the Human Rights Act could require revisions of the Good Friday Agreement and of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, especially if its proposed replacement &ndash; a bill of rights and responsibilities &ndash; is not recognised as being fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/><br/>The Centre for Cross Border Studies and a number of other organisations involved in cross-Border co-operation have come together to discuss the challenges for cross-Border co-operation in the context of the referendum decision.  We are acutely aware of the centrality of the Border to the conflict and the dangers that could materialise as a result of uncertainties about the nature of the Border.  Also, as migration and citizenship issues emerge in the context of any economic stagnation or decline, social cohesion in the Border region and other disadvantaged areas will likewise be threatened.<br/><br/>Our first concern is that the commitments for cross-Border co-operation embedded in the Good Friday Agreement remain a priority for both the UK and Irish Governments.  Cross-Border co-operation will be increasingly important to address the challenges resulting from economic, social and political uncertainty and instability.  It is essential that the soft infrastructure that has been established to support cross-Border co-operation &ndash; the statutory cross-Border bodies, links at departmental and local government level and within civil society networks and projects - be protected and nurtured.<br/><br/>We are concerned, therefore, to ensure that the interests of the Border region remain central to the deliberations of both the UK and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive prior to and following the notification of Article 50 to the EU.  In particular, we believe it essential that measures be taken to ensure the sustainability of cross-Border and transnational projects that are currently funded under EU 2014-2020 programmes; that existing EU directives and regulations that have been transposed into UK or Northern Ireland law should remain in place until such time as any proposed change has been subject to comprehensive territorial, equality and environmental impact assessment; that means should be found to ensure the eligibility of continued participation by Northern Ireland, and those parts of Wales and Scotland currently involved in INTERREG programmes with Ireland, in the European territorial co-operation programmes and transnational programmes such as Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, Life and Europe for Citizens; that whether or not the UK is excluded from EU programmes and projects, the Irish and UK Governments must take steps to ensure new and sufficient resources are available for the social and economic development of the Border region, including local authority and civic society-led projects.  On the UK side, additional funding allocations should be derived from the UK&rsquo;s current contribution to the EU budget that will revert to the Treasury post-withdrawal from the EU and not from the block grant.  Additional funding should be allocated by the UK and Irish Governments to the PEACE IV programme specifically to address the challenges of inter-community conflict and cross-Border relationships in the context of political and economic uncertainty and instability arising in the post-referendum context.  Finally, a PEACE V programme funded by the UK and Irish Governments should be developed in consultation with civil society organisations and local authorities specifically to address the challenges of inter-community conflict and cross-Border relationships in the context of political and economic uncertainty and instability arising in the context of UK withdrawal from the EU.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Sheridan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#C00300"><p>At the outset I should say that many people in the room will know of Co-operation Ireland, particularly colleagues in Northern Ireland, but for the record, we are an organisation that has been involved in peace building in this island since 1979.  For a number of years we have seen a core part of our business as building reconciliation, underpinning the Good Friday Agreement, normalising the relationships between Britain and Ireland and between people in the North of Ireland and the South of Ireland.  We see that as critically important.</p> <p>  I have a very diverse board and the chairman is London-based.  The former Taoiseach, John Bruton, is my Vice-Chairman.  I have people such Peter Robinson, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, on the board, and several people from America and from the Republic of Ireland.  Some of them will not have taken the same view as others on the board so we took a neutral position.  Some people were of the view that we should leave Europe and some were not of that view, so we took a neutral position on it.  However, we were able to have general agreement on many of the issues the members would be aware of already, but it is worth putting those on the record.</p> <p>  As an organisation, we are fortunate in that we are a company limited by guarantee, both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, and we have separate charitable status in the United States.  However, that means that whatever happens, we will remain an EU partner because we have our base here in Dublin, as well as an office in Cork.  The board members see our role as continuing to work to ensure that the relationship between Ireland and the UK remains and that there is no diminution in that.</p> <p>  The protection of the peace process is critical.  It is only last year that we had the Fresh Start agreement and, the year before, the Stormont House Agreement, which shows the still-fragile nature of politics in Northern Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement is a guarantor of that agreement, therefore, an important part of our work is to ensure there is no diminution or unravelling of the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not want to overstate it but there is a danger that, ultimately, this could lead to some civil unrest, particularly with regard to the Border.</p> <p>  The board members are agreed that we want to avoid the risk of economic isolation and on the need for measures to protect the economy, particularly in Northern Ireland.  They want to minimise barriers to trade and people movement across the Border.  The maintenance of the common travel area is important, and there is recognition that leaving the EU could raise issues of identity in ways that none of us can yet see.  It would be fair to say that many people in the North, particularly northern Nationalists, had become settled after the Good Friday Agreement within the context of Northern Ireland within the context of Europe.  I do not believe that was the same as being satisfied to be within Northern Ireland within the context of the UK, so that issue of identity could be raised again.  Many northern Nationalists saw devolution as part of that and in terms of any recentralising of devolution, for example, given that agriculture, energy and so on are devolved matters, how are they to be negotiated by a central Government that no longer has the same control?  That raises matters of identity again for us.</p> <p>  The board members are clear that they want to protect the positive relations built in recent years between North and South and between east and west.</p></speech>

The Irish Government and most people in the Republic were very concerned about the result of the referendum as they wanted Britain to remain in the EU.  It has happened now, and Britain will leave.  The Prime Minister has said that Brexit means Brexit, but what exactly does Brexit mean?  I do not believe the political establishment in the United Kingdom understands what it means.</p> <p>  Committee A of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly had a meeting with Professor Michael Dougan, who is head of European law in the University of Liverpool, and what he said was very worrying.  He said that regardless of what happens, there are actions that simply cannot be done.  People are talking about trade agreements and freedom of movement but he said there are things that cannot be done and that Europe will not be putting the boot in to the United Kingdom, but I do not believe people fully realise the position in which we find ourselves.</p> <p>  In terms of the island of Ireland, how do the witnesses believe the Border will work?</p><p>Will there be a border in the Irish Sea, with the effect that people will need to use their passports to get to the United Kingdom?  With modern technology, is there some way of policing a border?  We cannot allow a hard border to occur again between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  I am totally against that.  </p></speech>

Brexit is Brexit.  We do not know the terms of the exit yet so we do not know what it means.  The Senator is right from that point of view.</p> <p>  Sometimes the phrases "hard border" and "soft border" conjure up things in people's minds.  Particularly for those who live in Northern Ireland or along the Border counties, a hard border brings up images of Border checkpoints that were there in the past during the Troubles.  I do not for one minute believe it will ever come down to that again.  We will not see Border checkpoints.  Even in terms of customs, much of it can be done electronically.  There might be a need for some spot checks but in some ways that happens now.  A few weeks ago I was on a bus and a Garda officer got on and was checking people who were crossing the Border so there are controls there already.  </p> <p>  There is some debate about whether this border will be along the 300-odd mile Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland or down the middle of the Irish Sea.  Interestingly, there are people on my board who do not want one or the other because they come from different sides of the debate on it.  In terms of the movement of people, I do not envisage there will be demonstrable change in how we move across the island, particularly if the common travel area is protected.   </p> <p>  I gave evidence at a House of Lords committee the other day and I said there are officially no border controls between Germany and Switzerland.  Switzerland is not in the EU although it did sign the Schengen Agreement in 2004.  One can fly from Berlin to Zurich using an identity card; one does not need a passport to travel between the two countries.  They have what is called inland flights, like we have domestic flights here.  One can walk from Basel across the border without any documentation.  There are models that do not necessitate the things that conjure the idea of a hard border in people's minds.  We will be arguing for as minimal an effect as possible, particularly in the movement of people, but also in trade.  The difficulty is that if one is outside the customs union and one moves goods into the customs union, there will have to be some sort of checks.  Even if there are no trade or tariff differences, there will have to be some sort of checks.  We tend to look at this from our perspective but what about the rest of Europe and how it would envisage the Border?  Britain and Ireland might decide on a particular type of border but it will be a European border as much as a UK one.  It depends how the rest of Europe views that Border.</p></speech>

It has provided an opportunity for the two Governments, North and South, to strategically collaborate in terms of how they approach EU matters.  It should not just be about EU funding but about influencing EU policy that will have a direct effect on the two parts of the island of Ireland.  The UK's withdrawal from the EU will alter the operation of that part of the NSMC.  It does not mean it becomes defunct or that the NSMC will no longer look at EU matters, it is just that the balance will be different.  Of the two, the only Government represented at the EU will be the Irish Government.  In some ways, as in a lot of other matters, there will be a lot of responsibility placed on the Irish Government because it will become a channel for Northern Ireland through to the European Union and former partners within the European Union.  It places some responsibility on the Irish Government and creates some imbalance because only one side will have a presence in the EU when the NSMC is looking at EU matters.  Uniquely within the European Union, Northern Ireland has a European Union special task force which is a direct channel between Belfast and Brussels.  That will come to an end and the only direct channel will be through the Irish Government.</p></speech>

The opportunity will be there.  The Irish Government will be present at both the North-South Ministerial Council and within the European Union as a member state.  It could possibly listen to the concerns of the Northern Ireland Executive and political representatives within Northern Ireland about EU policy matters.  The question is whether the Northern side will want to explore that opportunity and whether the Irish Government is prepared to take on that responsibility.  I hope it would be in a position to do that.</p></speech>

Both of their organisations are important, particularly in the Border region.  I compliment Ms Ruth Taillon, who is not here, and her predecessor, Andy Pollack, on what he has done in looking at issues right along the Border.  I will not focus today on the issue of a hard or soft border but on the financial implications and employment issues centring on the funding sources.</p> <p>  My questions on the finances are centred on the various funding that Dr. Soares referred to, whether INTERREG or PEACE funding, and the fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is already putting break clauses into letters of offer to communities being funded.  They do not know where they will stand after the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget and in terms of their requirement for funding, they fear the money will not be coming.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  On employment, I will not focus on the impact of trade and all the associated issues.  Has a study has been done by the Centre for Cross Border Studies or otherwise on the number of jobs that will be lost in the communities if this funding is not kept in place?  I could give the example of an organisation in Newry that is almost totally dependent on funding.  If one of the funding streams does not continue, those jobs will go.  I can see that right across my community in north Louth and into south Armagh but I am sure it is a situation that exists right across the 370-odd mile Border that Mr. Sheridan referred to.</p><p>We need to present figures to show what the impact of jobs losses will be for community workers and the various agencies that receive funding through the local authorities and otherwise and also to show how many of these job losses will not be trade related.</p></speech>

In answering his question I will also refer to Senator Feighan's comments that Brexit means Brexit but that we do not know what Brexit really means.  In our work, together with our co-operation with other organisations, we are not waiting to find out what Brexit means.  We are planning with other organisations for the various scenarios and trying to come up with proposals as to how we might take matters forward, which includes funding that is currently received from the EU which supports many community organisations, North and South of the Border.  It is not only a question of the number of jobs involved, and accurate figures for the number of jobs involved is very difficult to ascertain.  We have not undertaken that, but with respect to the area North of the Border, I would point the Deputy in the direction of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, NICVA, which undertook a survey that came up with some figures, but I would consider these carefully.</p> <p>  It is not only a question of the jobs of the people working in these organisations that are currently in receipt of EU funding, it is that many of these organisations provide vital services to the communities in which they work.  It is an issue not only for the people who work in these organisations but for the services they provide, which are vital in areas such as youth unemployment, drug addiction, women in vulnerable situations and working with women to bring into the jobs sector.  They do all sorts of work that is vital to their communities.  If a loss of funding is not replaced in a sustainable manner as we move forward, the issue will be not only the loss of the number of jobs of people directly working in these organisations but the loss of services to the communities they serve.  Even if they are temporarily lost and at a later point money is found to provide these services, the people who worked in these organisations, who had skills and a knowledge of the communities in which they worked, will have gone and we would be starting again from scratch, which would be a very difficult task.  It would be sad if that were to happen.</p> <p>  We in the Centre for Cross Border Studies are focusing on cross-Border co-operation or wider North-South co-operation.  We have come up with suggestions on how we can take matters forward, depending on the different scenarios in terms of whether the UK continues paying into the budgets for the Structural Funds.  We have proposals and I hope that those responsible will examine them seriously.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that a significant proportion of the &euro;1.5 billion, which was part of the EU's Northern Ireland PEACE programme, went to Border counties and it is difficult to see how that gap will be filled in the future.  I do not want to misquote what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in Westminster today but it was to the effect that structural and investment funds would be protected up to the point of Britain's exit from Europe.  The Brexit Minister, David Davis, also made some comment about open borders and maintaining open borders.  I am sure the committee will see these in due course.</p></speech>

It is imperative that an early commitment be requested, through this committee, of both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and our Government that this would be resolved.  Dr. Soares referred to the continuity of the services these organisations deliver in their communities, but that will all be for naught unless there is a clear path as to how these groupings can progress.  That is the first issue that needs to addressed.  We will spend a long period talking about hard and soft borders, trade and all the rest of it, but as I have said previously, let people put their money where their mouths are, so to speak, in this regard if they are serious about the importance of North-South co-operation and how we operate on this island, both North-South and east-west, in terms of commitment to the peace process.</p></speech>

Brexit is the great unknown.  The only plan is there is no plan.  At least that is what I was told at a meeting in Brussels last week.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and we seem to be focusing on the relationship between the UK and Ireland.  We seem to be forgetting there are 26 other jurisdictions that have some very clear views and, I have to say, not a whole lot of sympathy from what I saw at a recent conference in Brussels.  I brought up the issue of the unique position of Ireland and the Border at that round-table meeting where there were a few hundred people in attendance, but the only people who spoke in favour of the Border problem were the Scottish and Gibraltarians, which left me a little scared.  The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Affairs told us at the Joint Committee on European Affairs that Britain is about to learn a hard lesson.  If Britain learns a hard lesson, it is my view that we will be trounced in that hard lesson, and the Northern Ireland economy, in particular, will suffer desperately because I cannot see the funding that comes from Europe coming from Westminster.  It may come up to 2020 but after that, we are in serious trouble.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p> <p>  The only commonality I see across the European area is between Gibraltar, Scotland, ourselves and Northern Ireland.  I noticed at the meeting to which I referred that Mr. Carswell, MP, from UKIP adopted a terrible softening of his party's position.  He was no longer talking about Britain being the great and good.  He was talking about free trade and free movement of workers, which was an interesting change of opinion.  If there is an indication that UKIP is softening its approach, and I can only base it on one man so there is no empirical evidence to support that, is there any indication in the North of Ireland that there is a softening towards Brexit as well?  Would the witnesses agree that there is no clearer set of principles than that, either in the UK or in the European Union, that we know of which will be key to the negotiations under Article 50?  Despite all the tough talk on either side, I am not sure that either side has the confidence to bring this forward.  One of the points made at that conference was that while Article 50 exists, nobody ever expected it would be used.  We are now entering into the great unknown, there is no pathway and no clear vision.  There was some talk of a derogation for Northern Ireland and Scotland to respect the democratic vote that took place there.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' opinions on that.</p> <p>  I have three further brief points.  We have called a forum in Dublin and clearly the DUP has decided it will not participate in it, unless I am slightly behind the curve on that.  How do we get all interested parties around the table?  There is some suggestion that the business community has moved ahead of the political world and I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.  As a centre with cross-Border interests, is the centre modelling different scenarios such as a hard Border versus a soft Border, the free movement of labour across the two and the possibility, as I have raised previously, that either Dundalk or Belfast would become a major refugee camp, as Ireland is the nearest land border to Cherbourg, for the want of a better place?</p><p>I apologise for throwing a lot of stuff at the witnesses.  I would be interested in hearing their views on the matters I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Sheridan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#F00200"><p>I will make a start on some of them.  I have to say I have not detected a softening in the "Leave" position.  I think it is a conversation that happens daily with people, particularly those who said they were voting "Leave".  All of us are interested in whether there will be another referendum.  I have not detected a move in that direction.  I spoke recently to a businessman who voted "Leave".  I asked him why he did so.  He said he built his case on the fact that there are 65 or 69 words in the "Our Father" - I cannot remember what the exact number was - but there are 29,000 words on the storage of cabbage in the EU.  That was his only reason.  When I asked him whether he was still of the view that the UK should leave the EU, he said he was.  I have not detected any softening in this regard.  I heard Mike Nesbitt say recently that he took a group from his party to Brussels for a fact-finding mission, but they came back without finding any facts.  I think that is probably a fair comment about this issue.</p> <p>  If Senator Craughwell's suggestion about a refugee camp were accurate, one would have to ask why there is no refugee camp at the Border now.  At the moment, there is nothing to prevent the people who are currently in Calais from camping in Dundalk.  Why has that not happened?  What would change after Brexit to make it happen?  I am not sure that would be the case.</p> <p>  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, spoke on the issue of Brexit at the Northern Ireland Economic Conference in Derry yesterday.  I asked him a question not dissimilar to the question asked by Senator Craughwell.  The logic is that the negotiation will happen between the UK and the EU Council.  The Republic of Ireland represents one twenty-seventh of that.  As much of the negotiation activity will centre on trade and economics, I am not sure to what extent we will be able to get issues like the Good Friday Agreement and the Border on the agenda.  Given that there are 1.7 million people in Northern Ireland and 60 million people in the rest of the UK, one can guess where attention will be focused.  There are 4.7 million people down here.  I imagine the Irish Government will put its own people first and centre in this process.  I have a personal concern about how we can get Northern Ireland on the agenda.  I have heard politicians, including the Prime Minister, saying it is a significant priority for them.  I am not saying I disagree with them, but I wonder how relevant Northern Ireland will be when the negotiators get into the heat of the discussions.  Northern Ireland was not particularly relevant in the referendum, so it is difficult to see how it will be relevant in the negotiations.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked whether the business community has moved ahead of the political world.  I think businesses are struggling because they do not know what the terms will be.  Some movement of businesses is probably evident already.  I read an article the other day which suggested that many lawyers are starting to set up in Dublin.  While that might be great for Dublin and the Republic of Ireland, it starts to build tensions that might not be particularly helpful in the future.  None of knows what the impact of this will be, or where it will go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#F00300"><p>I thank Senator Craughwell for his questions.  He made a very good point about the focus on the UK and Ireland, given that another 26 member states are involved here.  I return to the point that the Irish Government will have a huge burden on its shoulders as we go forward to achieve the best possible resolution for the UK and Ireland and obviously for Northern Ireland.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies is concerned that if the UK approaches the negotiations in an aggressive manner, that will affect whatever Ireland tries to do to protect its own interests.  I emphasise that we believe the best approach would be some sort of flexible arrangement, or whatever term one wants to use, that would allow Northern Ireland to have some sort of continuing relationship with the EU.  That connection could take any form.  It does not need to be formal.  Ireland should be making the argument to the Commission and the other member states that its own interests need to be protected because of its geographical position and because it is a co-guarantor with the UK of the 1998 Agreement.  Ireland should be arguing that case.  The UK and Northern Ireland should not be trying to argue that case themselves.  In our view, it should be Ireland doing that.  If that is the approach Ireland wants to take, it is clear that whatever the UK says will have an effect.<br/><br/>I agree with Mr. Sheridan that there is no indication in Northern Ireland of a softening in the &quot;Leave&quot; position.  The &quot;Leave&quot; voters in the agrifood sector to whom I have spoken, including a number of farmers who told me before the referendum that they intended to vote &quot;Leave&quot;, have said since the referendum that they do not regret the decision to vote in that way.  I do not notice any softening there.  In that context, although the First Minister and deputy First Minister have shared with the Prime Minister their common concerns for Northern Ireland in terms of what might happen in the future and what they would like from the negotiations, we would have liked to have seen some firm proposals on how to take things forward, rather than mere expressions of concern.<br/><br/>This brings me on to the Senator's question about how to get all interested parties around the table at the all-island forum.  Before one can think about how to get everyone around the table, one must identify who has not accepted the invitation.  Then one must speak to those parties to ascertain why they do not want to participate.  I hope they will participate in the future.  I think people could be more welcoming of such an invitation if they saw the forum as something that will come up with concrete proposals on how to move things forward, rather than just voicing the concerns that were listed in the run-up to and since the referendum.  The concerns are known, they are out there and it seems to some people they have been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Now it is time to consider how to move things forward.  We have to prepare for the different possible scenarios.<br/><br/>The Senator also asked if we are preparing for different models.  We are taking a twin-track approach.  I think we have to be realistic here.  Political revolutions have been going on throughout 2016 on this island, both North and South, as well as in Great Britain and America.  The centre is keeping a close eye on what is happening in Westminster.  We just do not know whether Article 50 will be triggered.  We have to be prepared for that vague possibility.  We have to prepare for various scenarios, depending on whether the UK maintains access to the Single Market or stays within the customs union.  The decisions and choices that are made will have an effect on the Border, on trade and on the movement of people.<br/><br/>In the run-up to the referendum and after the referendum, some Ministers in the UK Government portrayed the common travel area as something that will carry on because it has existed since the 1920s.  It is not up to the UK and Irish Governments to decide whether the common travel area will continue.  The EU will have a say on whether the common travel area carries on and the way it carries on.  That is going to be difficult.  The UK, outside the EU, can make any decision it likes on the rights it wants to give to Irish citizens, who currently have privileged rights under UK law.  It will be able to decide what it wants from a position outside the EU.  The Irish Government will not have the same flexibility in terms of the rights it can cede to UK citizens to move to the Republic of Ireland to work, study and draw their pensions.  All of those things currently happen with no real complications at all.  It will be up to the EU whether to allow the Irish Government to provide rights to UK citizens who will no longer be within the EU.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  The committee has been focusing on the long historical relationship between Britain and Ireland.  I put forward the view that instead of deputations going from both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas to Britain, or from Northern Ireland down here and from Britain over here, we really need to go on a love-bombing campaign around the other 26 member states.  I am looking for the witnesses' opinion on this.</p><p>We need parliamentarians from Northern Ireland, the Republic and Britain, if it wants to join, to go and explain the situation to member states.  Having attended a conference in Brussels last week, I definitely came away with the impression that there was a concerted effort to give Britain a bloody nose in order to show the other 27 member states what would happen to them if they were to try this.  I would be terribly afraid that a sort of nationalistic European "let's get Britain" would start.  If that were to happen Northern Ireland would be crucified and the economy of the Republic of Ireland would be set back years.  I would be interested in the view of the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#G00200"><p>The Centre for Cross Border Studies has noted a change in mood even within the European Commission itself in the past couple of months.  We have a working relationship with parts of the European Commission and initially the voices from the Commission were emphasising the level of sympathy they had for the situation North and South in terms of the Border and the Good Friday Agreement and referring to the fact there are non-EU member states involved in INTERREG programmes and all sorts of European territorial co-operation programmes.  Now they are no longer saying that and the indications are that Northern Ireland will be out of the EU, will not be eligible and therefore Ireland will not eligible because the only border we have is with the UK.  The mood has changed.  We were also involved in a network with European partners - Germans, Italians and French - where there is enormous sympathy for us.  For example I was in Germany a few months ago - shortly after the referendum result - speaking to business leaders and when talking to them about the argument that German manufacturers, German industry needed the UK market more than the UK manufacturers needed the German market, they just started laughing.  Their attitude is yes the UK market is important but we have the ability, the flexibility to change direction.  One can see that in terms of exports performance.  One can compare the UK and the German export performance in terms of sales to China.  One of the priorities of the UK market is exploiting the Chinese market and saying that leaving the EU would make that easier.  However, Germany, which is inside the European Union, outperforms by far the UK in terms of exports to China.  From the German perspective that argument by the UK was not seen as feasible.</p></speech>

I compliment them and their colleagues in both organisations who have done exceptionally good work over the years, much of it under the radar.  During the previous D&aacute;il, they had the opportunity to make a presentation to this committee as well, which was worthwhile.  I am very glad that both these witnesses are with us today to speak on a subject we did not think would confront us.  Dr. Soares spoke at a conference that I organised in Cavan on this subject matter back in July 2015.  He outlined the scenarios of the issues we are now discussing.  At that time we thought that we would not have to discuss those issues post June of this year.  With regard to Mr. Sheridan's comments on the free movement of people between Switzerland and Germany, I presume that is facilitated by the Schengen Agreement.  I do not envisage that Ireland will be a member of the Schengen area and Britain will not be a member either.  There is a real difficulty in regard to the movement of people.  I think that as a country, Government and Parliament we want to send out a clear message to the British early on that we will not be the control zone in regard to potential immigration or possible emigration to their island, Britain.  That will not be the job of the Irish people, the Government or our authorities.  We want to make that very clear from early on.</p> <p>  Mr. Sheridan made the point that the EU Council comprising the other 27 member states will be negotiating with Britain and that we will have one twenty-seventh of an influence.  I sincerely hope that it will not be reduced to that.  Take the example of Estonia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, I am sure they are not losing sleep at the moment about Britain leaving the European Union.  They are not worried about the obstacles or difficulties for us on the island of Ireland.  I sincerely hope that other countries with whom we have had good relationships for many years will be taking a keen interest in the potential and the difficulties, the obstacles for our island.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence, I meet ambassadors from the European Union states and in fairness to those whom I have met in the past few months, most were anxious to know our views on what we see as the major obstacles and difficulties.  They were interested in what we need to put in place to try to deal with the adverse impact of Brexit and to try to ensure that the progress that has been made on this island, particularly since the 1990s, is not lost.  Dr. Soares would have heard me make the following point in July 2015 during our conference in County Cavan that as a country, both North and South, we have underestimated the progress that has been made.  I would have been arguing at this committee and in the D&aacute;il during the previous Government that we were not maximising the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  Let us leave that point to one side.  We need to do a great deal of that yet and in terms of the successor agreements to the Good Friday Agreement.  At the same time on the positive side, there has been significant progress.  I think the authorities, both North and South have not measured adequately the progress that has been made in economic terms in the great improvement in North-South trade and in east-west trade as well.  People from my county and from Deputy Declan Breathnach's county right across the southern Ulster region were sourcing jobs in Northern Ireland and similarly people from the northern side of our province of Ulster were coming South as well to seek jobs in Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal or elsewhere.  </p> <p>  We have not estimated sufficiently the progress that has been made.   Much of that progress was made with a significant contribution by the European Union.  In fairness to the other member states in the European Union, they were not mean in the allocation of funding and were not begrudging. To a member state, I think they were supportive of the efforts of the Irish and British Governments and the political parties on the island to reach that agreement and ensure we built on it.  That goes back to Dr. Soares's concluding remarks on the need to continue that work.  We are not there in the peace process yet.  We have to be mindful that we need to keep nurturing and cultivating it because it is a relatively young process.  We need to make further progress particularly for the less advantaged in our communities.  There are many areas in Northern Ireland, in the Border counties, that are severely disadvantaged and thankfully programmes funded by both Governments, and very much supported by the European Union, have made a significant difference in many of the less advantaged communities in rural and urban areas.  I fully endorse the point made by Dr. Soares on the need for commitments by the Irish and British Governments to a PEACE V programme.  Had Dr. Soares been present at our last meeting he would have seen the Minster for Finance from the Northern Ireland Executive, M&aacute;irtin &Oacute; Muilleoir and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan make presentations and engage very strongly with the committee.  The message coming from the then Chancellor at Downing Street was of the significant doubt about even honouring the commitments made in regard to the present INTERREG and PEACE IV programmes.  My colleague, Deputy Breathnach and I had secured special debates in the D&aacute;il on that issue.  We never got enough clarity as to whether the programmes that have been put in place and commitments made by both Governments in terms of the European Union would be honoured regardless of when Britain exits the EU.</p><p>Solemn commitments have been made and programmes have been drawn up on that basis.  I entirely agree with the proposition that post-Brexit we should talk about a PEACE V programme to be funded by the British and Irish Governments.  I am pessimistic about what we heard at our last meeting but that is not to take away from the great value that could come from further programmes.</p><p> On the issue of whether there will be a hard or soft Border, I hope we get to the position where there will not be a visible Border or visible controls and checks.  Even if there is none, there will be costs on businesses and it will make some of our businesses less competitive.  When Britain leaves the European Union, the position will be that if I have a product leaving counties Cavan or Monaghan and going to northern Europe or another continent, it will go first to Britain, which will be a non-EU member state, and then enter the European Union again.  We do not have a ferry service to the north of Europe.  As an island, we send a lot of product to northern Europe and we depend on sending it through Europe to other destinations.  Much of that product transits Britain.  Do we envisage a situation where there will have to be trade agreements between the EU and Britain and other countries?  Do we envisage a situation where a product leaving Cavan will go to Britain, which will be a non-EU member state, then to another EU member state and may exit that state to arrive at its final destination?  Do we not think there will be a check on that product at some stage?  Every check that takes place creates additional costs and makes our products less competitive.  That is my big worry.  I sincerely hope we do not have a hard Border.  I grew up in a Border parish so I know what it is like as a youngster, for example, going to a football match and being stopped and not having free movement of people, goods or services.</p><p> I compliment Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Soares and their colleagues in their organisations for the excellent work they have done over the years, a lot of which is not known to the public.  They have informed all our thinking on the potential in this situation.  Mr. Andy Pollack spoke often and spoke well, as did Mr. Sheridan and Dr. Soares in the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, on the need for us to maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  We would love to be here today talking about that and not talking about possibly going backwards.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right that enormous progress has been made economically and socially through what has been achieved under the Good Friday Agreement and the peace and reconciliation process.  The name of this committee tells us something.  The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is an ongoing process that is continually implemented.  We continually have to look after the peace and reconciliation process in terms of its formal institutions but also, which is important, the soft structure that enables the operation of the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  The UK's departure from the EU has the potential to undermine and suck away at the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to work hard to make sure that does not happen.</p> <p>  On the question of the hard or soft Border, the Deputy is right.  Any introduction of controls on trade will be a burden on business, which will reduce the competitiveness of businesses North and South of the Border.  It also means that those costs will have to be passed on to someone else, which is the consumer.  It will have implications for businesses North and South.  We hope that in its negotiations with the Commission and the other member states the UK Government adopts an approach that will ensure there is some way the UK will retain access to the Internal Market and at least be within the customs union.  That will still mean costs to business.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned his interactions with ambassadors from the other European Union member states and said they are keen to find out the Irish Government's position and its view on the future.  I cannot characterise the situation in general but I get the sense there is increasing antipathy towards the UK Government from some member states and from particular sections of some member states.  Other member states are keen to see that what happens with the Border is positive.  The Deputy is absolutely right that the Irish Government, as an EU member state, should make sure that when it addresses the Commission and the other member states it secures its own interests and its particular circumstances.  The Deputy is absolutely right that as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, the EU has invested financially and politically, which is a positive in terms of how we move forward.  The EU and other member states who were so closely involved in ensuring the peace process progressed positively are not ready to give it up so easily.  That is a positive thing we have to work on together.</p></speech>

There are about 54,000 people who commute across that border every day without having to show any identification.  If one travels across it, one can only bring back two bottles of wine.  Any goods that one buys in one country have to be declared on the way out again.  I am not for a minute suggesting we take that route and that we start declaring goods again when we move between North and South.  I completely agree with the Deputy and I said in my opening remarks that the need to continue to build relationships will be critical.</p> <p>  By coincidence, on the day of the referendum result, the annual general meeting of Co-operation Ireland was held in the premises of ConnectIreland.  All board members who were there, even those who had voted to leave the EU, were adamant the organisation needed to continue to build informal relationships as formal ones are withdrawn.  We need to upscale what we are doing, for example, among teachers and councils.  Whatever it is, we need to continue to build those relationships.  The Deputy is right about complacency.  Neither the EU, the UK Government nor any of us here want a conflict on the Border again.  It is easy to dismiss it and say it will never happen, but as I pointed out earlier, it is still a fragile peace process.  There are already protests along the Border.  The history of the place is that protests can become much more dangerous as this goes on which is why I raised the issue of identity and people feeling their identity is being threatened or compromised.  We need to be careful of those things and not be complacent about them.  I do not want to overstate that there will be some sort of conflict arising but we have to be aware it is not that long ago we were in conflict over many of these issues.  The first shots that were fired were fired at Border checkpoints.  We have to be careful we do not put anything in place that creates the issue of identity for people again.</p></speech>

I will not go over ground that has been covered already.  It is a huge issue.  I travelled with Senator Feighan to Liverpool as part of the British-Irish delegation and we had a very good engagement with Professor Dougan.  His views on Brexit are concerning and we learnt a lot there.  It is a massive question and the witnesses have covered much of it in their responses.</p><p>I would like to understand, in terms of the peace process itself, the challenges that Brexit presents.  What are the views of the witnesses in this regard?  The witnesses have said they work with different organisations.  How have they progressed the issue of Brexit?  Given Mr. Sheridan's last few comments on the peace process, it is fragile.  I would like to know what type of work has been done, including behind the scenes, to consider the impact of Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#J00200"><p>I thank Mr. Sheridan and Dr. Soares for their comments.  This committee has committed to having a series of engagements and meetings on the Brexit issue as it evolves.  As Brexit develops it would be useful if we met the Centre of Cross Border Studies on a regular basis, given the research the organisation has undertaken.  It would help our engagements to be a bit more informed or as best informed as we can.</p> <p>  In terms of my questions, a growing consensus has emerged in the North on the democratic aspiration and vote that the majority wish to remain.  There is a growing consensus about a special status for the North to remain within the EU along with the rest of Ireland.  Can Dr. Soares tell me whether there are similar examples for us to consider in terms of best practice or adopting the position?  </p> <p>  A legal challenge is under way.  I shall not ask anybody to pre-empt the legal challenge because none of us can do so.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the potential outcome.  Is there a mechanism available?  There is potential to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  Can a legal challenge prohibit or allow for the retention of the Six Counties to remain in the EU?</p> <p>  Many colleagues have talked about the trade issues and the movement of people, which is very fundamental in terms of concerns.  The other issue for us, as Mr. Sheridan will be acutely aware, is the importance of PEACE funding and the impact it has on communities and the stability of the peace process.  We must look at the evidence available.  The Government in London has already cut &pound;4 billion from the block grant.  I do not see it stepping in to replenish funds that we will lose from the EU, whether that is in the form of capital or in other ways.  I ask Mr. Sheridan to speak more about the impact the loss of PEACE funding will have on issues of political stability, peace building and moving forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#J00300"><p>In terms of Deputy Carey's questions on the peace process, the challenges that Brexit presents and what work have we done in terms of speaking with other organisations, I will preface my comments by saying we have focused particularly on the area of cross-Border co-operation.  That means at the Border and also North-South co-operation more widely.  We have spoken to other organisations in terms of how do we see things moving forward, what kind of proposals can we come up with in terms of how do we support that type of co-operation at the Border but also more widely in terms of North-South co-operation.<br/><br/>We cannot forget that the Good Friday Agreement was about North-South and cross-Border co-operation but also east-west co-operation.  We are also looking at how to maintain relationships or build on them North and South on this island but also between this island and Great Britain at civic society level and various other levels.<br/><br/>We have engaged with organisations like Co-operation Ireland and others, including some local councils at the Border, to come up with various visions on how we can take things forward.  It also comes back to the last question although I shall not pre-empt it because I shall leave it to Mr. Sheridan to answer the question on the UK Government replacing funding that is lost.<br/><br/>We are coming up with proposals because if Brexit is to be deemed a success then it has to be a success, not an aggregate success as in for one part of the United Kingdom or one sector of society.  It has to be a success for every single part of the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland.  If Brexit is to be a success it has to be a success for Northern Ireland as well.  It has to be a positive.  I cannot see even the <i>status quo</i>as being a success.  It has to be a plus for every single part of the UK, for every sector of society in the UK and a plus for our relationships North and South, and east and west.  In order for that to happen we must come up with proposals and pass them to the UK Government that says Brexit means Brexit.  It also means we are going to get back the funds that the UK sends to Brussels and, therefore, that is going to be re-invested.  We say, &quot;Here are the proposals, if it is a success then you have to fund these various options.  If you are not going to fund those options then you have to explain why not and that means Brexit is not a success.&quot;  We believe Brexit has to be a success for every part, including cross-Border co-operation and wider North-South co-operation.<br/><br/>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked about a special status for Northern Ireland.  I must admit the Centre for Cross Border Studies does not find the term enormously helpful, especially at this stage.  We prefer to look at exploring flexible arrangements and relationships.  The term &quot;special status&quot;, at this stage, may not be acceptable to people or various parties within Northern Ireland but definitely not to parties in the UK.  I do not think the UK Government is in favour of granting special status to any part of the UK.  There are member states in the European Union that would not welcome the term &quot;special status&quot; being granted to a member state.  We would rather use different language.</p></speech>

With respect, this is not an issue of semantics.  It is an issue of practical legislative mechanisms that could allow for that.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of citizenship with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality at two different committees recently.  I am resident in the North.  I retain my Irish citizenship under the Good Friday Agreement and, therefore, retain my EU citizenship.  Am I then, as I live in the North post-Brexit and Article 50, entitled to the same rights and entitlements in terms of work and human rights?  I appreciate this is an unknown to some degree.  Am I entitled to access European protections and laws that would apply to me as an Irish citizen who lives in the North?  That is an obvious potential subversion of the Good Friday Agreement and the rights it affords to me and many other people who are Irish citizens, and an increasing number of Irish citizens, who live in the North.  The terms "special status" was mentioned in the press.  I am a remainer and I think the North should remain.  </p></speech>

We must face the situation as it is and make plans for it.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about the situation that pertains and how citizenship rights developed following the constitutional set-up of the Good Friday Agreement.  Someone who resides in Northern Ireland but has an Irish passport and is an Irish citizen is, therefore, according to the treaty a citizen of the European Union.  He or she has those rights as a citizen of the European Union.  The question is how does one have entitlement to those rights when one lives in a territory that is not in the European Union.  Some discussion must take place on how to accommodation the situation.  The Senator has said that it is not a question of semantics.  We must be careful with the language we use.  In order to achieve what we want, we need to use certain terms.  How do we accommodate the arrangement?  It is an arrangement that pertains to Northern Ireland but it also pertains to the Republic of Ireland as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  Ireland will continue to be a member state of the European Union.</p><p>I am sorry I keep emphasising the onus of responsibility that is on the Irish Government.  The position and circumstances of Ireland as a member state will need to be looked at positively by the other member states and the Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Sheridan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016102000002#K00200"><p>Deputy Carey asked about the challenges for the peace process.  We have been through some of them.  One of the challenges relates to funding.  I will come back to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question in this regard.  When we speak about the fragility of the peace process, we are not suggesting there is a threat that all of this will break out again.  It is not going to break out again.  Nevertheless, for each of the last two Christmases, the Secretary of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have had to hunker down to try to get relations going again because the Executive was on the verge of collapse.  There is still a great deal of work to be done in this respect.</p> <p>  Deputy Carey also asked about the work that is being done behind the scenes.  Some of this can lead to frustration.  I doubt that very many people in this room are aware that we brought 5,000 young people from 400 schools across Northern Ireland to the Maze-Long Kesh on 21 September last to mark the UN International Day of Peace.  I will not ask those present to indicate whether they were aware of this.  A further 2,000 young people participated at five satellite venues, one of which was as far south as Cork.  The events at the Maze-Long Kesh were beamed live on the Internet.  Young people from 22 other countries throughout the world were beamed in so that they could take part in these events, which focused on the role of young people in building peace.  We started our work on this project approximately a year ago.  The Executive Office, which was known at the time as OFMDFM, took a risk with this and funded it.  None of us knew where it would go, but it worked incredibly well.</p> <p>  At the end of last year, the UN passed Security Council Resolution 2250.  This historic resolution relates to the role of young people in building peace.  That is what we have been doing.  The UN youth ambassador contributed to our event.  The need for this work, which is continuing, brings me on to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question about PEACE funding.  Of course there has to be continued PEACE funding, not because there is a threat of violence breaking out again - that is not why we are saying this - but because sectarianism, which is the breeder of violence, is alive and well in Northern Ireland.  People in the Republic of Ireland sometimes think there is no sectarianism here.  That is true until one scratches the surface.  Then one has a different viewpoint and realises there is plenty of sectarianism around.</p> <p>  Sectarianism is still alive and well with us.  I will give some examples.  Some 95% of social housing in Northern Ireland is segregated.  There is little chance that is going to change any time soon.  Our education system is segregated.  Just 5% of kids go to integrated schools.  That is not going to change any time soon because parents have a right to choose.  A few years ago, the Institute for Conflict Research published a paper on the number of peace walls in Northern Ireland.  We prefer to call them "walls of division".  There were 18 of these walls before the Good Friday Agreement, but there were 88 of them at the time when the paper was published.  That means 70 walls had been built since the Good Friday Agreement.  Some of them are termed "security obstacles" or "barriers".  They are not called "peace walls".  The point is that we have put barriers between communities, our housing is segregated and we send our kids to separate schools.</p> <p>  There is a lot of work yet to be done in the peace process.  When Bertie Ahern was on the board of Co-operation Ireland, he used to look down the table at me when I said this, so I have to be careful.  The Good Friday Agreement was largely about agreeing on a system of government and the institutions of government.  What it delivered in respect of Stormont was an agreement for the first time ever about how we were going to be governed on this island and these islands.  We got there.  We are now in a period of trying to work out how to underpin the political deal by normalising relationships between Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and internally within Northern Ireland.  I think it will take another 25 or 30 years to do this considerable amount of work.  I do not share the notion that this will somehow go away because Europe has stopped or we have moved out of Europe.</p> <p>  To some extent, the Good Friday Agreement took the view that peace was about an absence of violence.  It was predicated on the idea that if a way could be found to get the IRA to stop, then the loyalists would stop.  We do not see peace as being about an absence of violence.  We see peace as a place where people can learn to live together like citizens.  That takes a considerable amount of time in the post-conflict environment.  Various issues, including the legacy of the past, are still outstanding.  While the institution at Stormont is functioning, it is still being built.  We have only recently had the development of the Opposition there.  It is still a pretty immature place.  There is still a lot of work to be done there.  We do not want to settle for communal division or some sort of separatism.  That is why the work has to go on.</p> <p>  I have set out the arguments we need to make to the British and Irish Governments.  It is not the case that people are going to take out guns again because of this.  There may be some people who would walk in that direction if we gave them an opportunity to do so.  We should not make it too obvious for them with what we do around the Border.  The rest of it - all the outstanding issues - is much more important.  That is our argument for continuing PEACE funding, regardless of whether it is called PEACE V or something else.</p></speech>

They have created a separate discussion which is partly beneficial.  I would like to pick up on Mr. Sheridan's point about the Irish Government looking after its "own people" first.  We are the Irish Government's "own people" in the North.  The business people in the North and the South are also the Irish Government's "own people".  There is a danger that complacency will set in with regard to the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit.  There is a concern that the South will look after its own.  That is one of the reasons we do not have that much faith that the South will look after the North in a post-Brexit situation.  A forum has been set up, but people are being taken to it kicking and screaming.  They were refusing to take part and trying to block it.  They did not agree to it at first, but a date has now been set.  There is no great enthusiasm for the work of the forum on the effects of Brexit in the North.  Perhaps there is some enthusiasm for its work on the effects in the South.  We need to look at this on an all-Ireland basis.</p> <p>  It is very important to examine how we can get Unionists to this forum or to the new forum that has been set up.  I suggest that one way to do this is to intensify the existing structures of the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the complaints of Unionists is there are enough structures in place already.  We need the new forum because the existing structures do not relate to Brexit in particular, but we also need to intensify the structures that are in place under the Good Friday Agreement.  As Dr. Soares has said, the business of this committee is the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement is not being implemented.  A number of outstanding issues have not been dealt with.  There is no urgency to deal with them or put them in place.  We need to look at the role of the Good Friday Agreement at the present time.  Are we cradling it along until it collapses at some stage?</p> <p>  I think Mr. Sheridan and Dr. Soares were right when they said there has been no softening of positions in relation to Brexit.  Those who voted "Leave" are confident that they made the right choice.  Some people seem to think farmers are the most responsive in this regard, but it seems to me that members of the farming community are confident that Brexit will be beneficial for them.  I do not see any softening of positions.</p> <p>  I would like to respond to the point Dr. Soares made the special programmes body.  I cannot see any role for the Special EU Programmes Body if Brexit happens.  In such circumstances, it would no longer be a cross-Border body and would not be funded by both Governments.  I do not think its role should be reinvented in such a situation.  We need to look at the role it should have now in trying to move forward the implementation of the present funding as speedily as possible.  I have to say from my own particular position that the Special EU Programmes Body has not been very helpful as we have been trying to deliver funds to communities on the ground.  Other EU structures have been more helpful in that regard.  I do not think the Special EU Programmes Body has been helpful to local communities at all.</p> <p>  On the issue of controls, the Irish Sea and the structures like the ports cannot just become a new border to police Britain's problems.  I think it would be a major mistake to go down that road.  There is an indication that people are in danger of heading down that road because they think this can be dealt with by keeping people out.  That would not deal with the problems.</p><p>There is a danger of not dealing with or recognising the issue of the Remain votes.  It is about how to police it instead, and in that case the South would just become a policeman for the British Government.</p><p> In all the research, where are the positives within Brexit?  There must be positives within this as well.  Everybody is looking at the negatives.  How can Brexit move the peace process forward?  How can we look at all-Ireland institutions to deal with this?  Ultimately, partition was the original problem and it is still a problem.  Brexit reinforces that partition is still a problem.  I was an Irish citizen before the Good Friday Agreement.  Although that may have been reinforced by the Good Friday Agreement, it did not make me an Irish person.  It is the fact that I live on the island of Ireland is what makes me an Irish person.  Partition has always been the problem I have seen, not whether we are in or out of the European Union.  We must examine the positive ways of moving this forward.  We are a number of years past the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process has been long and drawn out in it but we have not dealt with the fundamental problem of partition in this country.</p></speech>

I represent a Border constituency in Newry and Armagh.  Large numbers of people travel into the Twenty-six Counties every day from Newry and Armagh, particularly south Armagh.  There is one difficulty that people will have.  Currently we have a low-wage economy so a large number of people who work in the South claim tax credits that are a British benefit.  There are major issues with that for various reasons.  People working in the South who claim tax credits become what are called complex cases, and they become more complex daily.  I cannot envisage they will become less complex if and when Brexit happens.</p> <p>  The other difficulty is that under European Union regulations, contributions are transferable employment contributions.  If somebody does not have enough, he or she claims the likes of child benefit or sickness benefit, especially where he or she works.  That will again raise major problems.  If there are not enough contributions, such people may have to claim the likes of income support or the universal credit, if that ever happens, which is highly unlikely the way things are going now.  It will create major problems for large numbers of people daily.  We can speak about travel and tariffs but people will be affected in their lives every day.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has raised the issue that as we have Irish passports, we will be European citizens, but what happens to the medical protection?  That was not addressed during the course of referendum campaign and afterwards.  It seems the British Government did not have a plan A and it certainly does not have a plan B, which is part of the difficulty.  I have worked in the advice sector for many years and European protection is all that has come in.  The Tories, as history will prove, are intent on undermining employment rights, particularly union rights and the right to strike.  What happens in that respect?  That will come down the line to us as days go on.</p></speech>

He indicated he cannot see any role for the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, going forward.  We think there might be a role, although the name might have to change.  Again, this is about looking for different scenarios and trying to take things forward.  It goes back to the comments from earlier.  Some of the issues we are dealing with now existed before membership of the European Union and the Good Friday Agreement.  They exist now and will continue to exist, whatever happens.  For our organisation, the need for cross-Border co-operation was there before, it is there now and it will carry on, as there will still be a need for cross-Border co-operation with the UK outside the EU.  Whatever the complexities of the UK not being in the EU, we still need cross-Border co-operation to address some of the issues.  For example, Mr. Brady spoke about cross-Border workers.</p> <p>  We see the possibility of a role for the SEUPB as one of the cross-Border implementation bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement, but that will need creative thinking.  For example, it could deal with programmes funded by the EU under the European neighbourhood policy.  They are for EU member states bordering a non-EU member state.  Again, if we think creatively, the Irish and UK Governments should support cross-Border co-operation with other activities related to the Good Friday Agreement.  If they come up with the funding for that, the SEUPB would have a role.  I would not necessarily see it as not having a role.</p> <p>  I am not saying this is because we must keep the SEUPB no matter what.  Anything we keep in terms of North-South or cross-Border co-operation must have a practical element.  It is what that co-operation is about.  It is around practical issues, coming out with outcomes and not just existing for the sake of it.  In terms of its current role and delivery of current funds, that is a question for the SEUPB to answer.  I can see that any organisation that has to deal with, accommodate and address the concerns of two member states or two governments and administrations, along with various Departments, would be complicated.  It is a question for the SEUPB.</p> <p>  On the issue of border controls at Irish ports, this goes back to an earlier question around the Border being placed in the middle of the Irish Sea.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies has another suggestion.  No matter what happens, the Irish Government, as an EU member state, cannot deny entry to EU citizens of other member states.  Whatever it wants, the UK Government cannot stop EU citizens entering Ireland.  As far as we can see, there is no way the European Commission or other member states would agree to a position where Ireland could deny entry to other EU member state citizens.  In terms of maintaining a soft border and the movement of people, the argument is that we would allow any EU citizen entering the Republic of Ireland to travel to Northern Ireland in the knowledge of whatever regulations and restrictions are placed by the UK on EU citizens.  For example, the people moving into Northern Ireland would not have access to employment and welfare rights.  They would only be there as visitors.  That is where the argument comes in that we can control it if the people try to get into Great Britain.</p> <p>  Why would this happen?  If it is okay to allow those people to enter into Northern Ireland under those circumstances, surely it should be all right for them to carry on and travel into Scotland, Wales and England in exactly the same circumstances.  Therefore, one does not need to introduce border controls.  If it is acceptable for Northern Ireland, it must be acceptable for the rest of the United Kingdom as well.  That is one argument we would put forward in terms of not having a border at the Irish Sea.</p> <p>  Mr. Molloy asked about positives.  The issues that the Good Friday Agreement deals with were there before, they exist now and they will exist in future.  The positives are about being creative and engaging the governments in Dublin, Belfast, London, Scotland and Wales to strengthen the relationships that exist at all levels.</p><p>This goes back to the comment that the Good Friday Agreement has not been entirely delivered in terms of some of the institutions, for example the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland and the North-South Consultative Forum are still outstanding issues.  </p><p> How we deal with the United Kingdom leaving the EU is a concern not just for governments, political parties or business leaders, but for civic society as a whole.  Civic society has a role in terms of moving things forward.  Another positive is to strengthen the voice of civic society and how it interacts has a direct influence.</p><p> In terms of cross-Border workers, we have a border people project within the Centre for Cross-Border Studies that deals exactly with all those issues.  Mr. Brady is quite right, some of the issues currently are complex with the UK and Ireland both members of the EU.  We can always fall back on the common regulations under the EU as the EU set up structures and introduced specific rights for cross-border workers, posted workers, employment rights, social security co-ordination and so on.  It is correct that things could become even more complex, especially if there is policy divergence between the UK and Ireland as an EU member state.  I am not trying to sell our border people project that we run but that project and other centres that give advice on these things will be more necessary in the future and need to be supported.</p></speech>

The practical reality when one gets into the detail of the negotiations is how we keep the unique issues of Northern Ireland on the agenda when we are not there.  I have no reason to believe that the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State are not genuine when they say they will look after our interests but one wonders as one gets into the complexity of details how many of the issues in Northern Ireland will get continued publicity or efforts around them.</p> <p>  On positivity post-Brexit, Dr. Soares and I were at a conference of 25 persons with Welsh, Scottish and Irish academics in the Europa hotel a few weeks ago.  I would say they were all glass half full type people, but we struggled to come up with concrete examples of an opportunity.  We were genuinely trying to come up with opportunities.  That being said, I think the positives are the opportunity.  I have not detected anywhere among political parties in Northern Ireland people who do not want to ensure that the British-Irish relationship continues to grow.  I have not detected anybody who does not want to protect the peace process.  I have not detected anybody who does not want to ensure we do not become an economic basket case in Northern Ireland and that the economy is protected.  I have not detected anybody who wants to maximise border controls, rather they want to minimise any controls on the Border and likewise in terms of the common travel area.  There are a host of positives that all of us can galvanise around because it seems to me, and I think it is the same here, that those are issues people can have a common view on and we should use those as the positives rather than always going into the negatives.  We can coalesce around those positives.</p> <p>  I wish I had the answer to some of the issues that Mickey Brady raised.  I would probably be worth more than I am now because I do not know what will happen to the Ell medical services card.  It strikes me that if one is outside the European Union, that medical card is not valid anymore.  I do not know that.  Likewise, I do not think anybody knows about the situation around welfare at this stage.  I live in Derry beside Seagate.  Half the workforce live in Donegal and travel that Border every day.  We need to ensure that post-Brexit they can come and go to Seagate with no difference.  That is the win we need to concentrate on.</p></speech>

I think the witnesses are right in what they say about the need to be creative in terms of our approach to this with Britain benefiting with a &euro;10 billion trade surplus.  They have a lot in terms of what we do for them and we must consider what needs to be done.  It is hugely complex.  I take the point about the meeting in the Europa hotel.  What does victory look like when one leaves the EU?  How does it get better?  The point about Germany trading with China was well made.  It is not the EU that is holding the UK back, that is one of the fallacies that was put out.  The clear message from both Dr. Soares and Mr. Sheridan is that we need to be very creative on the solutions for what will be a very protracted problem.</p></speech>

It is one of the most important issues and it is very important that we implement the Good Friday Agreement.  The reality is that if Brexit damages that in any way, we are in serious trouble.  I am concerned that we are in a crisis.  Given that we have to implement the Good Friday Agreement and keep it strong, and cannot let anything get in the way of it, what do Dr. Soares and Mr. Sheridan suggest we can do?  Do we need to designate a Minister with responsibility for this issue?</p> <p>  They referred to the Prime Minister saying there will be no hard border between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I suppose it is the EU that makes that decision.  What is the reality of what will happen between the North and the South?  What are we talking about?</p> <p>  Dr. Soares referred to a change of mood when he had these conversations post Brexit with the European colleagues.  What does that mean?  He said that initially there was empathy and sympathy, is he now saying that these people do not care?</p></speech>

Given the tie-up with European law, which Commissioner Hogan touched on earlier at another committee, what would be their view on that?  Mr. Mickey Brady, MP mentioned that the Brits do not have a plan A or a plan B.  That is understandable in one sense because there is a very important court case going on which will go to the Supreme Court and many politicians from the other side that we and the Chairman met recently at the Lords Brexit committee seem to believe that the Prime Minister and the Government will not get their way on that case; that the supremacy of parliament in Britain will be upheld by their lordships in the courts.  That might not be until nearer Christmas.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?</p></speech>

There are significant issues in that decision in that the population has benefitted from the European Union yet a substantial number of the people voted to leave the Union.  The European Union has to find out why that happened.  I agree we need to be creative.</p> <p>  On the importance of implementing the Good Friday Agreement and how Brexit might damage it and what can we do to implement the Agreement, it was suggested that a UK Minister could be invited to appear before this committee.</p></speech>

There are suggestions and I have heard comments, including from people within Westminster, that people in Westminster, in London, are not aware of the circumstances of Northern Ireland.  They might have heard of the Good Friday Agreement but how many people in Westminster, who have their own constituents and concerns, know much about it?  They need to respond to the voice of their constituents.  How much knowledge do they have of the Good Friday Agreement or of the our Border issues?  Even some political representatives, South or North, who do not live close to the Border might not be that familiar with them either.  There are some issues with which only people who come from the Border region are familiar.</p> <p>  There are legal implications in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Although Brexit might bring some demands to redress the Agreement in some ways, of more concern is the possibility of a withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, which is not an EU matter.  That would have more serious legal implications for the Good Friday Agreement and for the Northern Ireland Act.</p></speech>

We need to keep it on the agenda and to keep raising it at every level.  Whether the committee invites in one Minister or 15 Ministers, we need to keep alive the importance of the Agreement.  As to why people have not softened around the issue of Brexit, I met a stranger as I was travelling on the train to this meeting and he told me he had voted to leave the Union.  He asked why, if it was so good in Europe, do we still have so much employment and problems.  We had a debate around it but he was not moving from his position.  Even though he could not tell me what the opportunities would be, his concerns were still the same around it.  He was a decent guy and had made a legitimate decision on it, even though it might have been different from that of most of us.  On the issue of European law, the Good Friday Agreement was lodged not only in Europe but in the United Nations.  As I am not a lawyer, I do not know what the impact of all of that will be in terms of the negotiations, but the Agreement was lodged in the United Nations as part of an international Agreement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Paul Carroll, who heads up employer engagement activities in the Department, and Jim Lynch, who heads up our operations and service delivery in the Limerick region.  I note that this is a new committee.  We appeared before the previous committee in the previous Oireachtas on a number of occasions to speak about activation.  While I do not want to appear to be teaching grandmother to suck eggs, members will forgive me if it appears that way.  I thought it would be better to outline the general approach to activation.  I would be happy to come back at any stage if the committee wished to discuss any particular aspect of activation.</p> <p>  It might be useful to briefly describe what the term "activation" actually means.  In short activation refers to the process of engaging with people to encourage and support them in the pursuit of employment.  In the first instance it typically comprises the provision of case-managed personal profiling, employment planning and job-search-assistance services.  In addition it involves offering jobseekers opportunities to undertake employment-relevant training and education, to undertake work experience and to participate in what are generally known as State employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s.</p> <p>  In addition to these services an activation policy can also involve the provision of employment incentives and financial supports both to jobseekers, for example in the form of the back-to-work family dividend or increased payments when participating in certain schemes, and to employers, for example in the form of the JobsPlus and wage subsidy schemes.</p> <p>  A comprehensive activation policy will also include a significant level of engagement with employers in order to identify job opportunities for unemployed jobseekers and to promote the recruitment of people who are on the live register or in receipt of another welfare payment.  Where the jobseeker is in receipt of jobseeker payment activation also involves the principle of rights and responsibilities.  In other words the jobseeker has a right to receive a jobseeker payment and the right to receive activation services from the State, but also has a responsibility to engage with those services.  Where a jobseeker fails to engage with these services his or her payment may be reduced or suspended. </p> <p>  In terms of impact, international research indicates that early engagement with unemployed jobseekers is key to reducing transitions into long-term unemployment.  It also shows that the most effective intervention is employment planning and job-search assistance, followed by work-relevant training and work placements.  General education supports and State employment programmes are generally found to be ineffective and, in some cases, have been shown to have negative impacts on employment progression.  The research that has been undertaken in Ireland would support these findings.  </p> <p>  In noting these findings it is, however, important to recognise that services and supports provided as part of a labour-market-activation regime have an important social or active inclusion role.  In this sense the provision of education options and employment programmes is not only designed to address labour market issues, but is equally informed by the recognition of the role which occupational activity and further education play in improving the quality of life of people with disadvantages or with a restricted ability to take up employment.  The provision of occupational outlets in schemes like community employment to people facing significant barriers to gaining open labour-market employment is also an important element of the social and community fabric in many localities across the State.</p> <p>  The recognition of this active or social inclusion aspect to activation also points to a difference in emphasis in the approach to activation during different phases of the economic cycle.  During a time of recession, given scarce Exchequer resources, the primary focus of activation policies is necessarily to help unemployed people, who are in receipt of a jobseeker payment and on the live register, to compete for such job vacancies as arise and reduce their individual duration of unemployment, although overall levels of unemployment may not fall significantly; to bias employers' recruitment activity towards people who are unemployed and on the live register; and to ensure that the labour market operates efficiently as the economy recovers so that employers are proactive in offering employment opportunities and that those people who are unemployed are ready, willing and capable of taking up employment.</p> <p>  During a time of economic recovery or prosperity, as the labour supply tightens the focus of activation policies typically shifts to minimising frictional unemployment and increasing active labour-market participation by all people of a working age, both to help ensure a supply of labour, which is a very narrow economic view, and to offer greater support to people from non-jobseeker cohorts to access the labour market and achieve some level of financial independence, which would typically be called an "active inclusion" view.  </p> <p>  Ireland has been through a period when the primary and overwhelming focus of activation policy was informed by the deep recession of the period from 2008 to 2013.  Ireland entered this recession with an activation infrastructure that was not operating in line with best international practice and had been the subject of some critical reports from the ESRI and the OECD among others.  While this situation was not an urgent priority during a period of full employment the collapse in the labour market brought the service weaknesses into sharp relief.</p> <p>  Accordingly, the Pathways to Work policy was developed in 2011 and 2012 to, among other things, design and implement the institutional, service and process changes necessary to remedy the identified deficiencies in the public employment and welfare services.  These changes were implemented in the first instance to help unemployed jobseekers in receipt of a jobseeker payment and on the live register to compete for and find work.</p> <p>  Among the changes implemented were the merger of the community welfare service, Department of Social Protection and F&Aacute;S employment services involving over 2,000 staff moving and taking up new terms and conditions of employment; the development and roll out of the Intreo model of one-stop shops involving the build or refurbishment of over 60 Intreo offices; the doubling of the number of case workers through internal redeployment within the Department; the establishment of an employer relations division; the implementation of new engagement processes, including jobseeker profiling, group information sessions, one-to-one case management and the social contract of rights and responsibilities supported by a reduced payment regime for people who do not engage with the service; the introduction of new jobseeker services including JobBridge; JobsPlus; MOMENTUM; GateWay, and the back-to-work family dividend; and the roll-out of the JobPath contracted employment service to complement and supplement Intreo in delivering intensive case-work services to long-term unemployed people.</p> <p>  As a result of these changes, which were arguably the largest single public sector reform initiative over the past ten years, the delivery of employment and activation services to jobseekers is now unrecognisable from that which prevailed up to 2011.  For example, in terms of service standards jobseeker claims are now processed in less than a week compared with a minimum of three weeks in 2011.  All jobseekers are now profiled and invited to a group information session to be briefed on the various services and supports available to them, typically within a week of registration with the service.  Jobseekers, who are profiled as having a high risk of remaining unemployed for 12 months or more, and all jobseekers who are under 25 years of age are invited to a one-to-one meeting with a case officer typically within a week of the group information session and are assisted in preparing a personal progression plan.  Other jobseekers are now scheduled for a one-to-one meeting typically at about three months.</p> <p>  The number of engagements with jobseekers has increased dramatically.  For example, since 2012 we have held over 20,000 group information sessions and more than 1 million one-to-one meetings.  In the same period over 48,000 people have availed of JobBridge, more than 6,000 people have benefitted from JobsPlus and 60,000 people are now receiving intensive case management support from the JobPath service providers. </p> <p>  Feedback from clients is also very positive.  An independent customer satisfaction survey conducted last year saw customers rate the service a score of 4.38 out of 5, and more than three quarters said that the service helped them towards getting a job.</p> <p>  In terms of employment impact, the changes have coincided with significant improvements in labour market conditions that are not typical in a post-recession environment.  Total unemployment has fallen from over 15% to just under 8%; long-term unemployment has fallen from 205,000, which was 9.5%, to 95,500, which is 4.5%; youth unemployment has fallen from around 83,000, which was 33%, at peak to 32,400, which is 15.9%, today; and the proportion of people of working age living in jobless households has fallen by nearly a quarter from 16% at peak to 12.4% now.  In parallel with these overall improvements the persistence rate on the live register, which is the measure of the number of people who make the transition from being short-term unemployed to long-term unemployment, has reduced from 35% to 26% and the exit rate from the live register of those unemployed over two years increased from 25% to 42%. </p> <p>  Given the progress I have outlined, the Government initiated a major review of the Pathways to Work approach during 2015 to determine an appropriate strategy for the next five-year period.  This review which involved an extensive consultation process culminated in the publication earlier this year of new Pathways to Work strategy for the period up to and including 2020.  Taking account of the feedback from the consultation process this strategy acknowledges the following.  Although the labour market situation is improving very long-term unemployment of three years or more and youth unemployment remain significant concerns, as does the challenge of inter-generational jobless households.</p><p>Although service delivery has improved considerably, there is still a level of inconsistency in the quality of service delivery that needs to be addressed.  The focus to date on process and throughput needs to be augmented by a similar focus on service quality over the next four years if the process changes implemented are to be sustained and deliver value even as the operating environment changes from recession to recovery.  It also recognises there is a demand from other non-jobseeker cohorts for access to activation services and a desire for a "parity of esteem" with jobseekers in terms of the priority and effort invested into the delivery of services.</p><p> Accordingly, the new strategy sets out a two-pronged approach.  The first prong is about consolidating the recent reforms to the public employment and welfare services and prioritising provision to maximise outcomes for clients.  This means ensuring that the long-term and youth unemployed cohorts continue to be prioritised and adequately supported in regard to activation services and also that the implementation and delivery of activation services is of high quality, effective, efficient and sustainable.  The second prong is to gradually expand access to activation services over the 2018 to 2020 period, as resources allow, to other non-employed people of working age.  This will contribute to increasing employment across working age households, promote the principles of active inclusion and improve labour supply.</p><p> This approach is to be delivered through 85 actions grouped into six logical strands.  I will not go through all of them but I will mention them.  There is enhanced engagement with unemployed people; increasing the employment focus of programmes; making work pay or incentivising work; continuing to incentivise employers to offer opportunities to unemployed people; building organisation capacity both within the Department and other agencies; and building work force skills, which is a new strand focusing on the further education and training sector, improving the alignment and delivery of those services with labour market requirements.</p><p> Together with these strands of action the strategy sets out a number of targets to be achieved over the course of the programme period and also for 2016.  These targets relate primarily to rates of employment progression, for example, to move 20,000 long-term unemployed people into employment during 2016.  Updates on performance against these targets are posted on the Department's website and I can confirm that we are in line to meet or exceed most of the targets.  The Labour Market Council reviewed the strategy and published its opinion.  In general, it is supportive of the approach taken but has recommended that the Government set some more ambitious targets in regard to overall employment, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment rates.  The Minister has accepted these revised targets, with some slight modifications, and progress against these targets will also be reported on in future updates.</p><p> Although the topic of activation is very broad, I hope that in setting out the general approach I have addressed at least some of the issues of most interest to the committee.  Together with my colleagues, I will pleased to address any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for him and I will probably set out my stall relatively quickly.  I have a problem with the idea that people have to work for social welfare and from an ideological perspective, that is wrong.  With JobBridge and labour activation measures, there has been job displacement and exploitation from the start.  JobBridge has been controversial from the start, as has the idea that one should work for a certain amount of extra money on social welfare.  It has not worked in general.  Will the witness comment on that and specifically job displacement?  I and other members have seen what were supposed to be full-time jobs replaced by JobBridge and job activation measures, which is completely wrong.  What is the future for community employment schemes?  Community employment is quite good but it appears to be on the decline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016102000002#E00400"><p>The first issue was displacement and exploitation.  The Deputy mentioned both JobBridge and community employment, and, of course, the issue of displacement could be made in the context of community employment as well.  The argument is that if community employment was not providing some services, would other service providers give those services?  It is important to understand the role of most activation schemes is to try to help people who might not otherwise get a job get a foot in the door.  It is about trying to encourage employers to give people a chance.  Measured against those terms, JobBridge has been successful.  We have just published an independent report by Indecon, which was separately independently reviewed by the Labour Market Council, that showed very strong employment progression from JobBridge into paid employment.  It indicated 79% of people ended up in employment and 64% are still in employment.  That uplift was 32% against a matched control group.  For example, that would have compared John McKeon against somebody who was unemployed with the same background, qualifications and experiences, meaning that person had a 32% better chance of getting employment and sustaining it having gone on JobBridge.  There are independent experts on the Labour Market Council, including some eminent international economists, and they see that as the best performance they have seen anywhere in Europe.  Measured on that metric, it has been successful.</p> <p>  I accept the issue of payment and I know the concern raised by the Deputy that people must work for their welfare.  The condition in the social welfare regulations is that people must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Nobody is required to work for their welfare.  For example, the JobBridge scheme is entirely voluntary, as is the community employment scheme.  People do not have to participate and there is no penalty if they do not participate.  People do not have to work for their welfare but they are presented with opportunities to work if they wish to do so, with a top-up payment, and then to use that experience, in effect, as a testimony for other employers.  It tells them what the person can do.  I do not know if that has addressed the question.</p></speech>

With schemes like Gateway, the issue is about encouraging people to engage in the labour market and gain experience which, as I stated, they can use to demonstrate and prove their worth to other employers.  The Deputy's question is whether it should be compulsory.  There is another way of looking at it, and this is a Government decision.  The alternative is that if people are available for work having been unemployed for a long time, it is better to have them occupied than not.</p></speech>

I must concur as much of the feedback I receive is very positive on the question of building activation infrastructure, Intreo offices, engagement with case managers and trying to match people who find themselves unemployed with an opportunity to get back into the work force, training and education.  I compliment the Department and I have had dealings with Mr. Lynch which have been helpful and useful.</p> <p>  There is an area that comes to my attention every now and then.  This is where people might be illiterate and cannot read or write.  They might suddenly become unemployed.</p><p>They could be asked to partake in a particular course or do whatever and it is not suitable.  The person is embarrassed that he or she cannot read or write, and it is not something that he or she would be public about.  Has the Department any policy to deal with such cases?  It is prevalent, certainly in my clinics.  I would have cases where the spouse of an individual will come and tell me that this is a real issue.  I would also have cases where engagement in formal education for particular cohorts is not an option.  They would be better placed if they were working manually.  The formal educational setting may not suit them.  The witnesses might share their views on that.</p></speech>

As a general point, I would say we try to ensure if clients are being referred to training or education courses that those courses are suitable for them, both in terms of their competence to undertake them and in terms of the employment prospects, and where we find mismatches we try to resolve them.  Often clients do not disclose such difficulties, particularly around literacy, and it is only when they are faced with the difficulty that the issue arises.</p></speech>

Sometimes it manifests itself in obvious ways when someone comes to us to fill a form, we ask him or her for some subsequent information and our staff member who is dealing with the person at the window can see the difficulty.  Our front-line staff who deal with such applicants would generally be sensitive to such matters and part of the awareness training we will have done with them is to be conscious and sensitive of those matters.  They would be conscious of that.</p> <p>  When it comes to such persons' interaction with a case officer from the point of view of activation subsequently, one of our referral mechanisms in trying to enhance their skills would be a referral to the education and training board, ETB, for adult learning or the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA.  We are conscious of the referral afterwards that we cannot refer those clients to somewhere where reading and writing might be necessary.  We are conscious that we need to bring their skill level up to the stage where they can take advantage of that.</p> <p>  I would be the first to admit it can be difficult.  There is embarrassment on the client's side and on the side of our case officer to find a suitable intervention for the person.  We try to work with clients and bring them along where we can.  We know the way the employment environment has gone.  If a person is not literate, his or her chances are minimal.</p> <p>  We build up good relations.  I would like especially to compliment some of the community employment supervisors who operate in this area.  Some community employment supervisors and sponsors can be very conscious of this, and if we have such one-to-one contact, we can ask them to take a person on board or to consider him or her whereby literacy can be addressed as part of the community employment training.  We find that works well.  In the example Deputy Carey used in connection with somebody who has manual skills and many not be good at numeracy, we would see a community employment intervention as an ideal intervention to bring that person to the level where he or she could participate or achieve something out of it, and he or she will be doing something as well at the same time.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

If possible, I will group together a few questions regarding JobPath.  In Dublin, there are more than 5,000 participants and it will be rolled out to 60,000 nationally.  Will JobPath be seen eventually to replace all the other schemes?</p> <p>  I want to touch on sanctions and travel.  Who determines what is a reasonable distance and what sanctions will be taken?  Is it indirectly a private company that decides ultimately whether the sanctions apply?</p> <p>  I want to touch on the rules of governance on JobPath as well.  What conditions govern the procedures of the programme?  Is there any code of practice, for instance, within the private companies relating to vulnerable persons?  What auditing process takes place?</p> <p>  I have a few concerns about the private companies operating the programme.  In a case I have seen, for instance, I had a 62 year old lady come to see me who is on the programme.  She found herself very distressed.  She went to see her adviser and she was given a sheet with 15 vacant slots on it to which she had to go and present.  She then had to bring that sheet back so that it could be said she had looked for employment.  It had to be stamped by employers.  This was her second occasion to do this.  At that age, she felt it was a little degrading to be knocking at the door of places.  I took the day to go with her.  We got only two signatures and two stamps because companies now do not have management available.</p> <p>  Is there another way of looking at this?  Can persons present forwarded e-mails to show that they have been contacting companies?  As the officials will be aware, when a person presents at the local supermarket, he or she is always told to send a CV to head office.  I am wondering about such issues because it is not nice to be going around knocking on doors and asking for an employer to stamp the form.  In this woman's case, many of those she met were a lot younger than she was and she did not find it good.</p> <p>  Will the officials also explain the complaints procedures if somebody has an issue?  Have there been many complaints regarding the programme?</p> <p>  The officials mentioned the report that was to be published.  We all expected a report in the second quarter of 2016 regarding the impact of cuts to those under 26.  At what stage is the report and when will we be looking at it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016102000002#F00600"><p>Maybe I will describe JobPath.  It is not to replace any other programme.  JobPath is a service where we contracted in additional casework support.  JobPath is a casework or case management service.  Although the live register is falling, we still have many clients who are long-term unemployed.  I mentioned in my opening statement that international evidence and our own research indicates the most effective support in helping clients get back to work is the job search assistance, the counselling and the personal progression planning.  That is hugely resource intensive, when one has a large live register and a large number of clients who are long-term unemployed.  JobPath is simply a way of contracting in an additional resource to provide that service, the same way our own case managers in Intreo provide a service and the same way local employment service staff provide a service to complement and supplement that capacity.</p> <p>  JobPath is not a programme.  It is a service to jobseekers where we have people who will meet them, help them identify their own strengths and weaknesses, identify what jobs in the market are suitable for them, and help them with getting access to training and delivering some training, particularly around softer skills, such as writing a CV, doing interviews, etc.  That is the service.  It is no more or less than that.</p> <p>  In terms of the contract itself, it is what we call a payment by results contract.  We only pay the contractors if they get clients into work and that work is sustained.  The payments are made for every 13 weeks that a person is in employment of more than 30 hours per week.  The person has to get into work, that job must be a 30 hours per week job and it has to last at least 13 weeks.  Then they get a payment, and there are potentially four payments over 12 months, one payment per quarter.  The job has to be sustained.  It is not merely a matter of putting somebody into a job, ticking the box and then six weeks later the person leaves the job because it did not suit him or her.  There is no point in trying to force somebody into a job he or she will not stick at.  That is one of the controls.</p> <p>  We have other controls.  For example, there is a code of practice, what we call a customer commitment or customer service charter, that every JobPath company has to abide by.  They have to publish it.  They are meant to hand it to the clients.  We have an independent customer satisfaction survey and the first one of those is in the field at present asking those who have been referred to JobPath their opinion of the service.  If they do not meet a minimum level on that survey, their payments to JobPath contractors are reduced.  Therefore, there is a penalty payment regime.  We have inspectors who inspect the services to ensure they are being delivered in the way that they are meant to be delivered.  If the inspectors find that the schemes are not working, we can impose payment penalties on the JobPath providers.</p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell raised a question about sanctions.  The JobPath providers cannot impose sanctions.</p><p>Where a person is not engaging, it is referred back to our deciding officers who will look at it afresh.  The process we take in the Department on sanctions is a two strikes and you are out approach.  I hate to use this language but it is just to explain.  A person comes in and is told that the evidence indicates he or she has not been looking for work or that he or she has not been turning up for meetings with his or her case officer and that if this keeps up, a penalty will have to be imposed.  We ask that the person engage with his or her case officer and explain that if he or she comes back a second time, a penalty will be imposed.  It is a two strikes and you are out approach.  It is only the Department that can do that.</p><p> The example was given of a 62 year old.  I will follow that one up.  Everybody who is on the live register regardless of age is supposed to be looking for work.  That is the condition of the payment.  Given that we are increasing the pension age, 62 now is not the same as it was 15 or 20 years ago.  There are many people in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in government who are a good bit older than 62, for example.  Everybody has the potential to work.  We expect them to take, as we do, a pragmatic approach.  There is a general process which is applied but there will always be people at the edges and about whom one must be a bit more sensitive and deal with differently.  As such, I will take that up.</p><p> I have met the JobPath providers frequently and I have been genuinely impressed by them.  I am not saying that just because I am within the Department.  The feedback we get is very positive in general.  I was asked about the number of complaints.  At this point in time, 60,000 people have been referred to JobPath and we have received 117 complaints, which is less than 0.2%.  There is a complaints process which is published and the offices I have visited have had it on display.  If one has a complaint, it sets out the route to take.  In our own service and in local employment and community employment services, we refer complaints received within the Department back to the front line in the first instance because that is the best space to resolve complaints.  We then get a report on whether the complaint has been resolved.  To date, approximately 70 of the 117 complaints have been resolved and the balance are outstanding.  The biggest complaint is, "I do not want to do this.  I have been unemployed for 12 or 15 years."  Many people are in that category and they would ask whether we would not be better off trying to activate a younger person rather than them.  That is not necessarily from 62 year olds.  It is from people in their 50s as well.  People might initially be a little fearful of this but once they get over that, our experience is positive on the whole.  I emphasise that it is just about case work.  It is not a programme.</p></speech>

Whether that person is employed by the State directly or indirectly through local employment services, which are also private companies, or by a commercial private company is, to a certain extent, less important than whether the person is qualified, knows what they are doing and can help me get a job.  We are within the European Union and there are public procurement rules.  We have to go to tender for this type of work and it is a very rigorous procurement process.  There were independent members on the assessment panel for tenders.  That is the process we had to go through.  We work with whoever comes through that process.</p></speech>

I might then come back to my original questions.  It is very important that we are clear on that question.  Mr. McKeon cites European public procurement rules.  While I recognise that there have been some ameliorating attempts in the way the contracts have been designed, there are a couple of fundamental issues.  Leaving aside some of the bigger questions on the role of private companies in JobPath and how the targets work, I am concerned about the question of education outcomes.  What potential is there through the JobPath system for an education outcome for an individual?  Is it the case that after a certain period, say two years, the only outcome is to be processed to a job?  There is a concern about that model.</p> <p>  We have to be very clear that we are not obliged under EU public procurement directives to contract out for this.  It was very regrettable that the Department put this on the agenda in advance of the transposition of new European directives in March this year which make explicit provision that member states have the right to exclude areas of social protection.  These are clear areas which governments are not required to put to contract or tender.  There is a very serious concern about this.  I would like to know if the Department has carried out an impact or risk assessment as to what this means for the Department and this area of social protection.  It is a new step to introduce private contractors.  How does that affect the public policy options that will be open to Government in future?  If we go ahead with the trade agreements we are negotiating, there will be a ratchet clause which will make it very difficult for any area that has been into private contract to be restored to public contract.  Without going back to subjects like water and whether we opted for the derogation, there are clear and explicit options for social protection as one of the areas which can be reserved for public delivery.  I would love to know if the Department has looked, is looking or will look at a risk assessment in terms of not just delivery right now but what it means for our public policy options in future.</p> <p>  I cite the Oireachtas's own research as to why this is important.  The research of the Library and Research Service in the Oireachtas shows that European services which have done this have found mixed outcomes.  While I appreciate that an experiment is being tried, it is also about the attached risk.  A large-scale French experimental study found that public employment services had a positive impact on employment rates which was twice that of a private provider.  In Sweden, increased interaction with private providers did not improve overall chances of finding a job.  Recent research in Germany has found that public provision provided better outcomes than contracting out employment services.  I appreciate that the Department was trying to respond to demand at a time of huge unemployment and during a public service freeze when the necessary staffing was not available.  I recognise that there has been a very genuine desire to ensure and improve times and engagement.  This decision was made in that context.  However, I am cautious.  What is the exit strategy?</p><p>If this private contracting does not work out and the Department wants to hire case workers and retake that area of work into its direct delivery, what is the route?  I will come back to my overall questions later.</p></speech>

We engaged expert consultants called the Centre of Economic and Social Inclusion from the UK, which is a not-for-profit organisation and a recognised, for want of a better term, left leaning consultancy group in the UK.  We engaged Professor Dan Finn from the University of Southampton, who would be from that kind of background, to advise us on the design of it.  We held a number of open consultative forums where trade unions, local employment service and community employment service providers contributed to the design.  We involved the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  Again, people from NUI Maynooth attended meetings with us.  The best report written on activation, probably in many countries, is the report by NESC in 2011, which was called Activation, Supports and Services for Unemployed Jobseekers.  It suggested that we need to contract out and that we should examine other contract models.  We did a good deal of research.  We are aware of the research findings, which are mixed.  The Senator quoted research where it is stated that these models do not work, but there are other research findings which state that they do work.  Therefore, the findings are mixed.</p> <p>  We tried to design the contract on the basis of what the evidence showed worked best.  We tried to design it on the basis of how will we get the best outcomes for people.  For example, in the contract there are specified minimum levels of employment outcomes that contractors are expected to provide.  If they do not reach those levels of employment outcomes, we reduce their payments - there are penalty payments - and they are 60% in excess of the counterfactuals at the time the contract was signed.  They have very high performance targets to hit.  If they do not hit them in terms of getting people into sustained jobs - 12 months in employment as a minimum - there are payment penalties.  We will see whether that comes to pass.  </p> <p>  It is a four-year contract.  There is no obligation on the Department to extend or renew it.  There is a two-year work-out from it because the last referral is at the end of the fourth year.  A person is with the provider for 12 months and if he or she gets a job on the last day of that 12-month period, he or she is down their payments for the subsequent 12 months.  It is a four-year contract with a two-year work-out provision.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a question about education.  Probably uniquely among these contracts around Europe, this contract provides for the providers to send people on into training and education and we have what is called a stop the clock mechanism.  There is an incentive to providers and they are facilitated in sending people on to training and education.</p></speech>

The model provides that if a person becomes unemployed and works with our Intreo service for 12 months, potentially they would then work with a JobPath provider for 12 months.  That is the model.  During that period, the provider can send somebody to an education programme of up to six months duration and apply the stop the clock mechanism.  That is deliberately done because if we allowed it to be a longer period, the contract could ultimately end up , being four years plus five or six years instead of being four years plus two years at the end because someone went into long-term education.</p></speech>

It is also because all the research evidence bar none shows that the training that works best in terms of getting people into employment is short, specific skills-based training.  The Economic and Social Research Institute did a study last year on the back to education allowance scheme and it found that the employment prospects of people who went onto the back to education allowance and undertook long-term training courses in second and third level were significantly reduced even four or five years after completing the programmes.  That same outcome is to be found all over the world, not only in Ireland.  In terms of focusing on employment outcomes, having a six month, specific short skills training course is a much better investment than a long-term general education course.</p></speech>

It is important to state that there is a difference between further education and higher education for somebody coming straight out of college.  The research evidence shows that for somebody who was working but who becomes unemployed.  The Senator should think of it in these terms.  Generally speaking, when people go on a long-term education course, they cease job search during that period.  If someone has been unemployed, say, for two years and he or she then does a four or five-year course, when he or she goes back to employment, he or she has been out of the labour market for six years.  It is what is called the lock-out effect.  Unfortunately, I am not making this up.  The evidence shows that the progression from that is lower than the lock-out effect.  There are many research papers that show that.</p></speech>

In terms of the company in the UK, up to 18 companies have provided services at different points in the UK.  Some of them were investigated, and there are one or two notable examples of, frankly, behaviour which nobody could condone.  The two companies that are involved in Ireland were not part of that.  Complaints were made against them and they were investigated by the Department of Work and Pensions in the National Audit Office in the UK but they were not upheld.  The amounts involved in both those cases were very low in any event, but they were not upheld.  The Department of Work and Pensions in the UK has issued statements basically exonerating them.  There were one or two companies - they are not involved in Ireland - where, frankly, one's eyebrows would raise and chin would drop but we have not engaged with them at all.</p> <p>  There are a number of controls in the contract which I have already mentioned.  There are minimum performance standards and customer service guarantees that are required.  The payments are subject to and contingent on satisfactory scores in customer satisfaction research, which is not a feature in the UK.  The employment outcomes are 30 hours a week whereas in the UK it is 16.  The employment outcomes have to be for a minimum of 13 weeks in Ireland; in the UK, it is four.  The bar we set for contractors to hit is far higher in Ireland than it was in the UK and we have also provided for inspections.</p> <p>  The other element we have in Ireland, which they did not manage to get in the UK, is that much of our checking is automated so when a provider submits a claim for a payment to us, we can automatically check if that person has commenced employment based on Revenue Commissioners' records.  We can check if that person has left the live register.  In the UK, certainly for the initial period of their contracts, all of that was done manually.  We have many automated checks.  We are fairly confident about that aspect.  We took the best international advice we could get on the design of this contract and other countries, including Australia, are now looking at the Irish model as an example of best practice.  The proof will be in the pudding.  </p> <p>  Senator Higgins raised the question of risk, and there is risk in every contact.  She asked why we would contract out this service.  We already contract within the Department, for example, where we contract with local employment service providers who are also private limited companies.  Contracting was always part of the Department's solution in this area.  We wanted to expand the contracted provision because we did not have the capacity within the Department.  We looked to see if we could get the capacity, and we considered the amount of time it would take to build that capacity ourselves.  We looked at the financial costs of building it ourselves against a payment by results model where we only pay if the outcomes are achieved as opposed to another model, for example, in the case of employment through the local employment services, where we pay regardless of outcome.</p><p>Best practice in this space would be to contract.  When we have decided to contract, we then move into procurement, at which point any country in Europe can compete.  They all have to be assessed equally.  The reversibility relates to the contract duration.  It also relates to the performance of the contractor.  If we assess the performance is not satisfactory, we can terminate the contract.  That deals with the reversibility issues.  We have not reduced our own number of staff.  As I mentioned earlier, we have doubled the number of staff we have on case work.  It has to be seen in that context.  There was an organisational challenge in doubling our number of staff on case work duties.  It was not sufficient to meet the requirement.  We had to contract in extra resources.  I will put it in these terms.  In a normal environment, where the number of people on the live register has returned back to a level of approximately 150,000, we would have enough capacity between ourselves and the local employment services.  We are maintaining that capacity.  When the number of people on the live register exceeds that level, we need to supplement our staffing numbers.  It is then a question of whether to supplement our capacity to deal with peaks through permanent recruitment, or to do so through temporary contracting.  Our decision was influenced by such factors.  Purely and simply, we will not renew the contract if we do not need the resources.  </p></speech>

I apologise for spending so much time on that question, in particular.  I welcome Mr. McKeon's statement that he may come back in on more specific detailed questions, so I am not going to ask many of them.</p><p>I would like to reflect on the crucial and fundamental principles and assumptions that are at work here.  I am noting a fundamental issue and question that arises here.  There is a role for employment activation and support and there is a role for social protection.  I believe there would be a benefit from bringing those two roles closer together.  That is very different from making one conditional on the other.  The leap that has been made in this regard is different.  It is a very different question when the idea of sanction comes in.  The social protection payments we have, including jobseeker's allowance, are not designed simply as a reward for jobseeking.  They are designed to ensure every citizen has a basic and appropriate level of income which protects them.  It is important that we embed this conditional question.  There is talk here of rights and responsibilities.  Fundamentally, if we go back to the 1800s, we will find the <i>laissez-faire</i>model, which had problems, and we will find models that involved compulsory or targeted work.  None of us is looking for any of these models to be adopted.  We need to be saying that in a modern designed system, we must ensure the social protection component is never jeopardised.  When we look at payment reduction, we are looking at compromising the well-being of the poorest people in the State.</p><p>It is important to reflect on the assumptions behind the current approach.  There seems to be a core assumption that we need to emphasise the push factor among a certain cohort.  The research we have seen, including the ESRI research from a couple of years ago, found that the vast majority of people want to work and are better off working.  Even if they are not better off working, most unemployed people would choose work.  This is the research.  We are always told about disincentives to work, etc.  The fundamental fact is that there is a large cohort of people who really want to work.  There is a focus on the push dynamic, rather than the pull dynamic of supports and engagement.  I realise that work has been done on pull factors as well.  I recognise that there have been absolute improvements in Intreo offices, in experiences and in times.  I believe those pull factors are being undermined by a strong perception that supports cannot be accessed without sanction.  I am just saying that this is a very strong perception.  There are some people who do not engage with the jobseeker system because they are afraid of some of the conditions.</p><p>The question of availability has been mentioned.  Full-time availability is still a core component even though we know that people in a huge cohort of society have part-time availability.  That does not necessarily mean availability at a casual or low-skilled level.  Some people have high-quality part-time availability.  The system takes an &quot;all of nothing&quot; approach at the moment.  It considers that people are either available full-time or they are not available at all.  There has been some waiving of this requirement, for example involving people on the jobseeker's transitional payment.  There has not been a recognition of the value of building labour market attachment.  For example, people may move in and out of the labour market at various stages of their lives.  Somebody who is available on a part-time basis now might become available on a full-time basis at a later stage.  I think some of the outcomes we have seen from the education and community employment schemes that have been mentioned are linked to that too.  Sometimes, people are sent on courses that are not suitable or they go on courses that are not suitable because they can manage the hours of those courses with their other responsibilities.</p><p>I am very concerned about the scepticism with regard to educational outcomes.  I do not believe we can give up on the potential of citizens to achieve.  It is not just a question of the numbers who end up in employment; it is also a question of the quality of the employment they end up in.  There is a fundamental principle of choice here.  Engagement might be required.  In some of the better systems, where sanction is used it is used only in the context of ensuring people are engaging.  It is getting narrower here.  It is not just a question of whether people are engaging; it is also a question of whether they are engaging with the list of options under Gateway, or with a specific list of courses.  People are asked whether they have been engaging with something that fits the model of a certain company, having been referred by JobPath.  One does not choose to refer to JobPath; one is referred to JobPath.  What is the route back for somebody who says &quot;I am sorry, I know you think I am going to end up in employment quicker if I take a six-month training course in assembly with a view to working in a factory, but I genuinely want to go back to do a college course and have a different outcome for my life&quot;?  That is fundamental.  The choice issue is crucial.</p><p>The question of negative assumptions versus positive assumptions arises in this context.  I think there is a huge issue associated with this assumption.  We are losing out on a vast number of people who want to seek voluntary activation.  I was concerned by the presentation in this respect.  It is one thing to say what was done in the recession, and I appreciate that some good things and some bad things were done, but it is another thing to say that only at non-austerity or non-recession points in the cycle - in times of surplus - will we see whether we might provide activation supports.  This assumption exists right across Europe, where the question of qualified adults is being considered.  Thousands of qualified adults, who are predominantly women, might be interested in accessing voluntary supports and activation measures.  Many groups, including people with disabilities, have been asking and begging in many cases for education and training opportunities and activation measures to enable them to return to the workforce.  Are they are a backup force or reserve?  Are they meant to sit aside for five or six years because the authorities are only prepared to work with people on the live register during recessionary periods?  Every citizen should have the same supports.  We need to keep it in focus that every time somebody enters a job, that is a positive outcome.  I would be very concerned about anything that would suggest this as a pattern.</p><p>I am also concerned that it is not planned to start giving access to activation measures to these groups until 2018.  I know the departmental officials will say there is always access.  I had this discussion with them a few years ago.  I would like this form of access to be prioritised and put in place.</p><p>It is set out from 2018 to 2020 but needs to be brought forward because people have been waiting for four or five years.  Every person's life is precious and every person wants to live a full life.  I am sorry if it sounds very philosophical, but we will come back with detailed questions and the specifics of courses.</p><p> It is welcome that the new Indecon research on JobBridge is better than the previous research because of the control groups.  It is, therefore, more valuable.  Some of the proposals put forward by the Minister, as reported in the newspapers yesterday, are constructive.  They are a start.  We need to see more, but they are constructive.  It is appropriate that there be an employer contribution, that it be time limited and that it be 30 hours rather than 40, giving people a period of time in which to seek other employment.  These are positive steps and I am sure we will get a chance to look at the details of the scheme.  I apologise for my lengthy intervention.</p></speech>

The purpose of the social protection system is to provide people with an income when they have a contingency, in other words, when they cannot generate an income.  Fundamentally, defining it in its narrowest and most basic sense, that is what the social protection system is for.

There is a new sanction which is in addition to the previous one - the stopping of a payment.  Every year the payments of thousands of people were stopped.  This sanction was always available and it still is.  What has been introduced is an intermediate sanction.  As of today, out of the approximately 300,000 people who could potentially be subject to sanction because they are in receipt of a jobseeker related payment, 1,100 or approximately 0.3% are on a penalty rate or a reduced payment.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the perception.</p></speech>

Mr. Lynch can speak about his experience, but the staff in offices do not behave in this way.  It ill behoves anyone to take small examples and characterise them as being the generality because it is not.  I believe very strongly that this is fear-mongering.  We need to be temperate in the language we use.</p></speech>

Perhaps there might be a need for a stronger information programme in which we can look to clarify the position.  I would happily be able to support it if we were able to have such a programme.</p></speech>

By any measure, that is a small percentage.  It is important to recognise that.it is not an aggressive sanctions regime.</p></speech>

There is a process whereby it can be appealed.  With this in mind, deciding officers and those who speak to people on a daily basis do not easily arrive at the decision to stop or reduce a payment.  As Mr. McKeon explained, we first have a chat and explain to those involved what they said they would do.  It is very important to remember that in the activation measures the first part of the process is attending a group information session and that the second is a one to one meeting at which a personal progression plan is agreed to.  We can only apply a sanction where someone is in breach of his or her agreement with us.  He or she agrees that this might be a proper course of action to pursue, but it could mean waiting for three months for an education and training board course to become available and until the person concerned does not show up on the first day of the course.  We are then back to having a conversation and asking why he or she did not start the course.  We also explain the implications.  On a practical level, we give a person every opportunity to comply and the application of a penalty rate is a last case scenario because on a human level deciding officers are very aware of the impact and implications of reducing somebody's money by &euro;40.  It is, therefore, very much the last option for us.</p></speech>

There are the casual jobseeker's allowance and the part-time job incentive, both of which are available to persons who are working part-time.  We very much see working part time as a step towards working full time.</p> <p>  On extension to other cohorts, if I gave the impression in the way I represented the approach during a recession as opposed to that in a recovery, that somehow we ignored people with disabilities or other cohorts, we do not.  In fact, people with disabilities have access to a very wide range of employment supports and services which are more generous than jobseeker's payments.</p></speech>

What I have always said - this is something that is not well known, for which the Department might perhaps be criticised - is that it is always an option for qualified adults to split their claim with their partners and become a claimant in their own right, in which case they would have full access to all services.  It is an option for any jobseeker, regardless of his or her status, to walk into an Intreo centre where he or she will be met by a case officer who will work with him or her.  A good number of the available supports and services are available to everybody, regardless of status, including access to training courses.  Our approach has always been that those who engage on a voluntary basis are not denied a service.  We are speaking about trying to be more proactive in the next two years, as opposed to being reactive in services being available when sought.  We have been proactive with people with disabilities.  I do not have the figures with me, but a good number of people receive a wage subsidy, which is more than &euro;10,000 year.  A good number of people also receive workplace adaptation grants, which are significant.  We fund an employability service with specialist providers.  Our colleagues in the further education sector provide an entire suite of specialist training courses.  The feedback we received during the consultation process was that all of these services were available, but all people here want us to speak about are jobseekers.  In terms of being proactive, it is a parity of esteem rather than a service issue.</p></speech>

There is reference in the opening statement to the Pathways to Work scheme in the period from 2016 to 2020.  The targets relate primarily to rates of employment progression.

The target is to move 50,000 people who were long-term unemployed on 1 January 2016 into employment by the end of the programme.

We have agreed to include them.</p><p>One of the targets related to the overall employment rate among adults of working age in this State, which is approximately 65% at present.  I suggested that we should set a target of between 71% and 73% by the end of the relevant period and that has been agreed.  The Labour Market Council suggested that we should set a target of between 5% and 6% for the overall unemployment rate and we have agreed to incorporate that.  The council also suggested that we should set a target of reducing the long-term unemployment rate to 2.2%.  This is the only one we modified a bit.  I think it can be inferred from current Government documents that there is a target of just over 3% at present.  We have agreed to reduce that to 2.5%, rather than 2.2%.  A target of 2.2% would be a very significant stretch.  We have agreed to 2.5%.  If my memory serves me right - I ask the Chair not to quote me on this - the council suggested that we should set an overall target of 12% for the youth unemployment rate and we have accepted that.</p></speech>

Seventy-nine organisations were suspended from participation in the scheme over the entire period.  Obviously, they represent a small fraction of the total number of host organisations that participated in JobBridge.  We conducted approximately 13,500 monitoring visits over the five-year period.

The Minister said "the Department will now hold a consultation process on the principles proposed by the Labour Market Council, that a new programme should" be developed.  I was surprised that one programme was stopped before the next programme was developed.  This seemed to happen very suddenly.  I am not saying there should not be a new programme.  There is a suggestion that it will be some time before the new programme comes into play.  What is the reasoning behind this approach?  When is the new programme likely to start?</p></speech>

Even though JobBridge scored well in 18 of the 20 aspects that were measured, there were significant levels of dissatisfaction among participants with regard to certain aspects of the scheme.  It is important for any new scheme to reflect that.  The gap between the end of JobBridge and the start of the new scheme will allow for the orderly wind-down of the JobBridge scheme and facilitate a period of consultation with people before the new scheme is finalised.  I think it is quite reasonable for there to be a gap between the two schemes.</p></speech>

I suggest an unemployed person who believes an internship would benefit him or her in finding a job, regardless of whether this would be under the old scheme or a new scheme, would find it peculiar to be asked to wait for six months or 12 months because one scheme has been brought to an end and the new scheme has not yet been put in place.  If the JobBridge model is seen to have been successful - according to Mr. Carroll, it has been underpinned by Indecon - I cannot understand from a practical point of view why the new scheme was not designed to be up and running before the closure of the old scheme.  If JobBridge has been successful, why are we taking a timeout?  If it has been unsuccessful, we should get rid of it.  If the Department wants to modify elements of it as part of a new scheme, should that not be designed with an orderly transition rather than a timeout period before the original scheme is finished?  I understand Deputy Carey wants to come in on the same issue.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, the Chairman is quite right.  The internship scheme will close to new entrants tomorrow.  We decided not to allow that scheme to continue, despite its success and bearing in mind that issues were raised, because the new scheme will be fundamentally different.  It will last for a shorter period.  Participants will work for 30 hours, which is a shorter period of time.  The most significant difference is that employers will be required to make a contribution.  Difficulties could arise if the new scheme was to start on 1 June 2017, for example, and the other scheme were to be allowed to run up to that date.  For example, a host organisation that signed up on the basis of one scheme might have to participate in a fundamentally changed scheme the following week.  At present, employers do not make contributions, interns are required to work up to 40 hours a week and schemes last nine months.  If the new scheme were to be initiated as soon as the old scheme concludes, people starting a week apart would operate under completely different terms.  I accept the Chairman's point about the short window during which we will finalise the scheme.  Although an internship scheme will not be open to people, a range of other opportunities will be available.</p></speech>

I am not trying to start a philosophical debate to doubt what they are saying.  It is important that we look at these assumptions.  I have a question about equality monitoring.  At the moment, we have a public duty when it comes to equality and human rights.  What mechanisms are being put in place across the Department to look at the equality of outcomes for different cohorts?  I refer, for example, to equality of employment outcomes for women compared to men, or to equality for Travellers, etc.  I understand there are some mechanisms in place.  I would like to get a sense of how they are being monitored.  There should be a focus not just on the numbers entering employment but also on the quality of outcome that is there.  I should also say while I am commenting on the question of quality of outcome that I welcome strand 3, which deals with the question of making work pay and incentivising work within the plan as it goes forward.  I wonder whether an additional ambition is needed with regard to in-work poverty.  Maybe it is under way.</p><p>We are talking about measures designed to alleviate in-work poverty and a number of in-work supports have been developed.  I refer to the Department's leverage in pressing for decent pay for decent work, as it has significant leverage and is engaging heavily with employers.  It is offering a number of employment and employer incentive schemes, for example, through JobsPlus.  What leverage might it be able to use in that regard?  I note the programme for Government commits the Government to address, through the Low Pay Commission, the issue of in-work poverty.  How is the Department actively engaging with the other half of that equation?</p><p> There is the question of choice.  We did not get an answer in terms of those schemes where there is constrained choice, such as Gateway and JobPath.  What is the route for an individual who is given a limited set of options to get engaged again with the system to look at a wider range of options?  Is the Department considering a waiver of the full-time availability or strengthening voluntary engagement with respect to qualified adults rather than moving them towards the live register model?  How can we engage with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-20a.1292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016102000002#M00200"><p>With regard to Deputy Mitchell's first question, we have not published the value of the contract.  It was a competitive tender process and we have two providers with two different sets of prices.  We want to try to keep it that way as we believe there is leverage, to the Department and the State's benefit, in not letting one provider know what the other provider bid to win the contract.  It is a payment by results contract so we will not really know the full picture until we see the results.  The value of the contract is entirely dependent on how well they do, so the only element we could publish is what prices they gave us.  From a procurement perspective, we would prefer not to publish the prices because it is possible it would distort the market if and when we ever went again.  The Department's Revised Estimates will have what we estimate as the total cost next year.  We would prefer not to publish the prices.  In the Revised Estimates we have multiplied the prices by what we think they are likely to do.</p> <p>  I will go through Senator Higgins's questions in reverse order.  She asked about in-work poverty and decent pay for decent work.  There are two aspects to the Department dealing with that.  The main Department leading this is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and it is responsible for the Workplace Relations Commission, the Low Pay Commission, national employment rights and so on.  It is an issue that we raise with that Department.  We are members of the senior officials group on economy, trade and jobs and our Minister attends the Cabinet committee.  We certainly make our views known quite forcibly.  Most of the time, they are taken on board, to be fair.</p> <p>  The Labour Market Council intends in the next year to consider this issue; that is sponsored by our Department and we provide the secretariat, so there will certainly be an outcome on that.  There are two aspects to incentivising work, as we have always argued, and one tends to get much press attention, particularly from the tabloids.  This relates to welfare rates, spongers and all of that.  Our view is to ask what work will pay, meaning there is a second part to the equation.  As the Senator stated, all our evidence is that the welfare rate is not an impediment to anybody going back to work.  We certainly approach it from that angle.</p> <p>  The equality of outcomes is something we monitor and the Central Statistics Office does a good job of it as well.  All the data are broken down by age and gender.  Generally, the issue of concern from a gender perspective might be the level of female participation in the work force.  The outcomes in terms of people we engage with are relatively gender-neutral.  There is no evidence in the data of bias.  It is really a wider labour market issue about female participation.  That is tied into the issue of child care, the lone-parent family payment and arrangements around that.  Sometimes it is difficult to say it but I will say it anyway, as when we examine micro-data in the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, to which our statisticians have access, we see that quite a few women who do not participate in the labour market answer "No" when asked the follow-up question as to whether they want to participate.  I absolutely acknowledge child care issues and the way in which society is framed that makes it more difficult for women.  I would never deny that.  There is another issue about choices, and perhaps that is a cultural element.  I do not know and I cannot explain it.  Perhaps it takes generations for that to work its way out.</p> <p>  There was a question about constrained choice and I will deal with JobPath first.  I emphasise that JobPath is simply meeting a case officer; it is just they happen to work for another company rather than directly for the Department.  People do not have a choice in meeting a case officer.  Mr. Lynch explained that if a person is asked to a meeting, he or she should go and engage with the process.  If the person does not engage, warnings and so all will follow.  I emphasise again that the level of penalties is tiny.  We find that people engage and in general feedback, they are very positive about the engagement.</p> <p>  Where people have a particular issue, we will always look at it.  For example, 200 people referred to JobPath have been taken back.  It is done on a case-by-case basis of whether it makes sense for the individual and if a particular circumstance applies.  The same is true with our own case officers or anything else.  The same applies for Gateway, community employment and all of those as well.  We look at them on a case-by-case basis.  We have the general rule, which is to participate, but if there is a very good reason not to, we do not impose the rule in an unthinking or unfeeling manner.</p></speech>

Perhaps it could come further down the line, as the witness mentioned, in addressing perceptions.

For example, some people have said they do not want to go to community employment, JobPath or a one-to-one meeting with a case officer.  We have told them they have to go.  If there is a good reason - and it must be a very good reason - that may not happen.  Some people have said they are uncomfortable, afraid, do not know about it or do not understand but that is not a good enough reason to be left alone.</p></speech>

It may be an issue of having to care for somebody else.  The referral in that case might be to carer's allowance and we would suspend intervention until such stage as the person transfers on to the other payment.  We need to know the reason.  I always suggest that people be open and give us honest reasons.</p></speech>
