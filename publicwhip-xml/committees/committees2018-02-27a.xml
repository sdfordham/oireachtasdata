    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members for inviting the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, to address them today.  As stated by the Vice Chairman, I am joined by the chairman of IFA's farm forestry committee, Mr. Pat Collins, and Mr. Nicholas Sweetman, our Wexford representative on the IFA farm forestry committee, as well as by Mr. Damian McDonald, director general of the IFA.  Before discussing the Coillte farm partnerships, it would be useful to give a brief overview of farmers' involvement in the forest sector.</p> <p>  Farmers began planting their land in the mid-1980s.  Following the introduction of improved grants and premiums in the early 1990s, farmers became the driving force of the afforestation programme, surpassing the public afforestation programme.  Today, they continue to be the dominant player in the programme.</p><p>It is estimated that 18,000 farmers have planted land and manage in excess of 170,000 ha.  The age profile of farmers who plant tends to be older as forestry is less labour intensive than other agricultural commodities.  Forestry is a long-term crop, with rotations of over 30 years for fast growing conifers and up to 100 years for slower growing broadleaf species.  Many farm forests have only recently reached the stage where further management is required.  However, timber production is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years as these forests reach maturity.  Timber production is forecast to grow from 3.1 million cu. m in 2015 to 7.9 million cu. m by 2035, with almost all the increased volume expected to come from farm forests.</p><p> Forestry is a relatively new crop for farmers and as a result they have limited knowledge about the crop.  Many lack an understanding of the management requirements of their forests as to when it should be thinned, the volumes that need to be harvested, the product types and the value and market for the products.</p><p> When Coillte introduced its first farm partnership scheme in 1992, many farmers were attracted to the scheme, as Coillte was viewed as a safe pair of hands to manage their forest.  Coillte, as well as being a State-owned company, is Ireland&rsquo;s largest and most experienced forest company.  Coillte has the management and marketing experience, as well as economies of scale, to maximise the value of the timber crop.</p><p> Many of the features of the schemes appealed to farmers.  Coillte was viewed as an extension of the State and, therefore, a trusted partner.  Coillte took full responsibility for the management of the crop, including thinning, pruning, building of roads where necessary, maintenance, harvesting and sale of the crop.  There was continuity in income after the expiry of the 20 year forest premium and farmers retained ownership of the land.</p><p> A total of 630 farmers entered into partnerships with Coillte from 1993 to 2012 to manage in excess of 12,000 ha of forests.  There are seven different farm partnership schemes in operation.  However, modifications to the agreements were negotiated by individual farmers and, therefore, agreements vary from farmer to farmer.</p><p> As stated to previously, forestry is a relatively new crop for farmers.  Many of them entered into the farm partnership agreements without a full understanding of the future value of the crop and the methodologies used by Coillte to determine the annuity payments.  The information provided to farmers was unacceptably vague in relation to how payments were calculated, timber valuations, management and marketing costs as well as insurance cover.  Even when farmers received legal advice on the contract, there was limited expertise on forestry, particularly in the early years of the partnerships.</p><p> Many of the issues today are a direct result of the vacuum of information provided to partners.  This has led to concerns that the contracts are one-sided in favour of Coillte and that farmers are not getting their fair share of the thinning and clearfell profits.</p><p> It was a condition of all schemes that annual meetings would take place with partners.  Unfortunately, it is my understanding that in many instances they did not take place.  Even when meetings occurred, limited information was provided to partners on the condition of the crop, how the crop was progressing or when operations were planned to ensure effective management of the crop.  The lack of meaningful communication with partners on the management of their forest has led to concerns that the forests are being mismanaged, resulting in a decrease in forecasted revenue.  Of particular concern is the lack of communication with farmers whose forests have entered into active management.</p><p> In some instances, farmers were not contacted in advance of harvesting operations.  When harvesting operations were completed, they were not provided with documentation on the volumes of timber harvested or timber sales invoices.  Farmers were provided with no analysis on the progress of the crop following thinning to compare forecasted thinning profits with actual thinning profits, or the implication of higher than predicted growth rates on rotation lengths and annuity payments.  Farmers understood that the contract was for 40 years.  However, in most cases, due to higher than predicted growth rates, the rotation length is being shortened by Coillte.  This is causing concern as many farmers made plans based on receiving an annuity payment for 40 years and clarity needs to be provided on this.</p><p> The IFA met with Coillte recently to voice concerns on behalf of farmers regarding the lack of transparency on how annuity payments and profit share are calculated, as well as the distress being caused as a result of poor communication.  It was a constructive meeting where it was agreed that Coillte and the IFA would work to try to address farmers concerns by developing principles and guidelines for engaging with partners to strengthen communication and to rebuild trust between partners.</p><p> Coillte has a duty of care as the dominant partner with the experience and knowledge of the sector to ensure that partners have a clear understanding of the agreement, particularly the timber revenue models and the distribution of the profits.  We are very much at the early stages of developing these principles, but I look forward to working with Coillte to improve communication and transparency with partners.</p></speech>

Serious concerns were raised about farmers and their relationship with Coillte.  Before I open the discussion up to the other members, I note that in his presentation Mr. Healy makes a number of points about the contract and the lack of communication between Coillte and the farmer regarding management of the forests and the growth rate, etc.  Mr. Healy said seven different types of contract were signed.  Was it a standard contract or were these issues not addressed in the contract?</p></speech>

They were not weighted in favour of the farmer.  If one looks at the lack of transparency and communication, they are weighted in favour of Coillte.  Coillte is the dominant party here.  As representatives of the IFA, we have seen contracts and there is nothing to suggest that it is a fair contract for the farmer.  They signed the contracts but they signed them because they trusted Coillte.  Coillte was the dominant and leading force in forestry in the State in the mid-1980s and into the 1990s.  That is where the problem is.  How do we get these contracts opened up, resolved or looked at?  There are serious, significant issues here.  There is a lack of transparency.  There is no proper management and there is no engagement with the farmers in question.  If one has a savings bond, one can go to any bank and ask how it is performing.  That has not happened here.  Coillte has not engaged in a very meaningful way with its partners.  Coillte has never had a meeting where it has told its partners the forecasted growth rates of their forest.  There never has been a proper, meaningful engagement with the contracts with any member that I have spoken to.  I invite Mr. Sweetman to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Sweetman" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#C00500"><p>I will address some of the difficulties that may arise with the contracts.  First of all it is important to note that while there are seven different main types of contract there are up to 35 different actual contracts in so far as each contract was negotiated individually with the farmer in question.  In latter years the contracts could be said to have fewer problems but in the early years some of the contracts were completely opaque with regard to what was actually in the contract.  I will take a particular example.  There was a contract which was called the 1% clearfell contract whereby the farmers' income after the 20 year State subsidy was arranged so that when it came to clearfell, there would be a 1% payment to the farmer.  I will give an example of how that might work.  With a 40 year cycle, the State would pay the first 20 years and Coillte would pay the next 20 years.  Let us assume the sum agreed was &euro;10,000 per annum, and that would be for a reasonably large plantation.</p><p>If clearfell occurs at year 40 Coillte would have paid that farmer &euro;200,000 over the 20 years.  If it happened at year 30, which is more likely in the current climate, that farmer would have received &euro;100,000 from Coillte.  In addition that farmer would be responsible for replanting at year 30 instead of year 40 and the 1% which the farmer would get at year 30 would not be sufficient to pay for replanting.  A farmer who was not aware of all this would find himself at year 30 with a clearfell forest and no money to replant it.  Far from getting any money at the end he would be owing money because he would be legally obliged to replant.  That is one possible problem under the contract.  That is only one type of contract and I am not suggesting that all the Coillte contracts are like that because they are not.  That, however, is definitely a problem.<br/><br/>A second problem is perhaps to do with liens on the land.  If a farmer has a contract with Coillte for some section of the farm and wishes to build a shed and goes to the bank for a loan, he must get permission from Coillte because there is a lien on the land.  He cannot conduct his business without the co-operation of Coillte.  I am not saying that Coillte would not give permission, I am sure it would, but that is an issue for farmers.<br/><br/>A third very important issue is the business of the requirement to replant.  One would assume that most farmers knew about it but the <i>de facto</i>situation is that they do not.  As recently as yesterday, because I knew I was coming here, I contacted a lady who planted her entire 15 ha farm, 22 years ago with Coillte.  I am not talking about someone who does not know her business.  This person would really know her business.  She was entirely unaware, 22 years later, that there was any requirement to replant, despite having had approximately 20 meetings with Coillte over the intervening period.  She was aghast.  She scrutinised her contract from start to finish and could find no mention anywhere of any requirement to replant.  It was her own responsibility to know that she had to replant but if she had annual meetings with Coillte over 20 years somebody could have told her that she would have to replant after the end of the rotation.<br/><br/>Those are just some of the problems related to Coillte that are coming to us.  I am sure Coillte is trying to address them.  They are problems we do not believe are being dealt with at the moment.  We had a constructive meeting two weeks ago with Coillte.  I would have thought in the intervening two weeks it would have been a good idea for Coillte to at least contact all its partners and inform them that there is a helpline available.  This did not happen.  To this day Coillte has not sent any circular to its clients informing them that there is help available if they have a difficulty.  Coillte told us at the meeting that it had received 60 calls to the helpline from among the 630 people who have contracts with it.  I would respectfully suggest that if it received 60 calls out of 630 then in fact 400 of the 630 did not know a helpline existed.<br/><br/>It is quite possible that there are many people, like the pal I spoke to yesterday, who did not know there was a problem.  She said she would never have planted trees on her land if she thought it was sterilised for future generations.  She said she was never aware that she could not put it back into farming for her children.  That is a major problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#D00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses today to discuss this important issue.  It is one that needs to be highlighted and landowners who are in a bind because of these so-called partnership contracts need answers.  I say "so-called" because partner seems to be a misnomer when describing the agreements in place between these landowners and Coillte.  Many of the cases described show a commercial imbalance between the outcome for Coillte and that for farmers.  If people like the woman Mr. Sweetman mentioned had half an idea of what they were getting into they would not have gotten into it at all.  There are clear problems.</p> <p>  How many farmers are adversely affected by this?  How many have contacted the witnesses?  I note what Mr. Sweetman says about the 60 calls to the helpline.  The managing director of Coillte, Mr. Gerard Murphy, acknowledged a problem with transparency and communication, which is welcome.  To what extent are the problems raised by those 60 being worked through in a satisfactory manner?  Are they being told this is what they signed up to?  How are they being helped when they call the helpline?</p> <p>  I note that it is not widely known that there is a helpline.  That is unfortunate to say the least.  Having listened to all that has been said, read the information supplied to us and having listened to some individual landowners, it is obvious that these are flawed contracts and partnership documents because farmers or landowners are getting a very raw deal.  To what extent are any aspects of, or clauses in, the contract, and Mr. Sweetman described seven main contracts and maybe 35 variations on those, void or unenforceable?  Mr. Healy referred to methodology.  Is it so vague that the farmers could not establish their likely incomes?  I understand there are certain unknowns in respect of forestry and it seems some people bought a pig in a bag.</p> <p>  In respect of the liens on the land and the land being encumbered, is Mr. Sweetman saying these partnerships were registered with the Land Registry as the title of the property in all cases? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Sweetman" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#D00300"><p>Not in all cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#D00400"><p>I presume this also presents a problem for a farmer.  If land is encumbered in this way, tied up until it is cleared of forestry and the income does not appear very attractive in most cases, it would be difficult for the farmer to sell on the land.  It would not be the most attractive proposition for the buyer to find it so encumbered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#D00500"><p>I also welcome the witnesses and thank them for the presentation.  We will meet Coillte after this session.</p> <p>  Mr. Healy said approximately 630 farmers signed up between 1993 and 2012.  Most or all of these contracts are weighted towards Coillte because the farmers took Coillte at face value as being an arm of the State.  We as politicians know from our daily dealings with people that for every four people who would be that na&iuml;ve there is always one meticulous man who will go to the ends of the earth, through his solicitor, before signing a contract.</p><p> In those situations, which I have no doubt did arise, were different contracts drawn up?  What I am trying to get to is whether it was the case that Coillte was cherry-picking, knowing that the contract was weighted in its favour, but if somebody questioned it and got legal advice it was prepared to come back with a redraft that was more farmer-friendly.  I am trying to get to the bottom of that aspect of this issue.</p><p> Leaving the nature and the set-up of the contract aside, it is bound to have aspects favourable to the farmer.  Are they being honoured?  Is Coillte honouring the contracts, irrespective of the way they are weighted or is this problem partly due to Coillte not honouring contracts, irrespective of their nature?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#E00200"><p>I thank the representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, for their presentation.  Most of my questions have already been asked by the other committee members.  I will wait to see what the answers are.  I was not here for the first day of hearings, but this is a very useful insight into the way Coillte operates.  Some basic questions about the contracts need to be answered.  It is very useful for this committee in its dealings with Coillte.  When we heard from other groups on Coillte contracts, hauliers of wood, for example, we heard that they were treated as badly as farmers had been.  It seems to be endemic where Coillte is concerned.  Is this a matter of a big corporate body dealing with individual farmers who might not know any better and simply taking advantage of the situation?  What has actually happened?  It seems that there has been some improvement in the contracts in recent years.  How has that come about, and why has that improvement taken place?  It is probably because people have received advice and become more involved.  Why do the witnesses believe this improvement has happened?  I would like to comment later, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Collins" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#E00300"><p>I will address the matter of the contracts.  At the start of the contracts, there was an upfront payment of &euro;500 per hectare.  This was an enticement to get people involved.  People were not made aware, and the majority of people were not aware, that this had to be paid back.  That payment is deducted from the clearfell profits, and those profits are index-linked.  That is what the contracts stipulate.  The majority of people to whom I spoke were not aware that this was taking place.  It was not clearly outlined to them at the start.  People thought it was wonderful to get &euro;500 per hectare.<br/><br/>Senator Mulherin asked about the lien on the land.  People did not know this was taking place.  It has caused much distress to a lot of farmers, because they now feel that if they have to borrow money, they must get a letter of freedom from Coillte to allow that to happen.  This has caused a lot of grievance.  I do not know where this will end but there has been a lack of meaningful engagement on the contracts throughout.<br/><br/>There has been a lack of transparency.  There was no indication of how Coillte would calculate the profits for purpose of the annuity.  Nobody sat down and engaged with these farmers to tell them the quantum of their annuity payment and how it was determined.  Much of the timber that has been thinned has been sold on by Coillte.  There has been no documentation to show where it went.  Dockets have not been issued.  Farmers do not know whether the timber was sold as saw log pulp, stake or pallet wood,<b></b>or where it went.  As the committee is aware, one individual has said more than 4,000 tonnes of timber was taken from his land.  That is an estimate.  It could be much more.<br/><br/>There are a lot of issues here that need to be resolved.  The contracts, as Senator Mulherin said, seem to favour Coillte.  I would suggest that they do, but farmers signed up to them.  They did not have the required knowledge.  These people were the pioneers of forestry in rural Ireland.  They were the first people to take this leap of faith and put most of their land in forestry.  I deal with a farmer in Galway who has about 200 acres in a Coillte partnership.  He is at a loss as to what is going on.  There are people who just do not understand the concepts involved.  <br/><br/>One woman indicated to me that her Coillte partnership is fine.  I asked how long she has planted for.  She told me she had planted for 18 years and was getting her money.  The one good thing that has happened here is that the State has provided lucrative premiums for people to plant.  That is good.  However, this woman understood that this was coming from Coillte.  She was not made aware of what the true arrangement was.<br/><br/>Coillte has misled people.  There is a bigger issue here.  People who get annuity payments have money dumped into their accounts.  They do not know how the payments are calculated.  It is a serious issue for a semi-State body to send out a statement, which is not even on a Coillte letterhead, of a sum dumped into their partners' accounts.  That is a very misleading practice for a company the size of Coillte.  It shows a lack of professionalism on its part.  In one instance, the letter was addressed to the partner's wife, not to the partner himself.  That is a serious breach.  Coillte has to put up its hands and admit it was wrong that it never informed people of the amount of money due or how to calculate it.  The company must admit it was wrong that its representatives never sat around a table with their partners, outlined their annuity payments and what Coillte made from the thinnings that it carried out.  </p></speech>

Coillte's has informed us that 30 of the 60 have been dealt with in full.  Of the rest, the company reckons it is on the way to dealing with 25.  This was the information we got at our meeting two weeks ago.  Problems have arisen in a further five outstanding cases.  However, that is the tip of the iceberg in my view.  I should also point out that we have no way of verifying those figures.  For instance, we do not have the names of the 630 people who have contracts with Coillte.</p></speech>

That is all.  However, as I said, the IFA has no way of writing to 630 people, because we do not even know who they are.  We depend on people making a complaint to their local IFA.  Many people do not even know that there is a problem.  Unless they have finished their 20-year cycle and have begun to receive their annuity payment, or unless they are getting to a thinning cycle or a clearfell cycle, they do not realise that there could be a problem.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked if different contracts were negotiated in cases where the farmer was well-informed and, therefore, did a better deal than others.  I think that is probably true.  I am not suggesting Coillte set out to treat people unfairly, but if farmers knew what they were at, they would negotiate a better contract than somebody who did not.  Maybe that is part of life anyway, and I am not suggesting that Coillte set out to be unfair.  In fact, I think Coillte would be the first to admit that it has adjusted contracts over the years, owing to the fact that some of them were quite simply not up to scratch.</p> <p>  A member asked what happens at clearfell, and whether the land is saleable.  If farmers have planted forestry on their land, they cannot sell it unless the buyer agrees to plant it.  The requirement to replant stays with the land, whether it is sold or not.  The answer to the member's question is that land is seriously devalued if it has just been clearfelled.  This is only a rough estimate, but if a unit of agricultural land in a certain area is worth &euro;10,000 and a site has just been clearfelled, its value decreases to &euro;2,000.  The value is about 20% of what it would be.</p></speech>

Was it targeted at the age of the person?  We are not sure how it came to be done.  To follow on from Mr. Sweetman's point, land that has been clearfelled is valued at &euro;500 an acre.  That is how hard it is.  It is virtually impossible for a person to sell that land because there is an obligation to replant it.  The question Coillte must answer is how did it decide the person sitting on my left would receive 1%, while the person sitting on my right entered into a 60:30 arrangement.  How did it decide?  We are not sure if it was based on a person's age.  There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed.  I do not know how or in what way Coillte calculated certain annuities.  Seemingly many people with larger sites were targeted.  It was missold.</p></speech>

It is either Coillte's responsibility - in which case it is included in the contract - or the farmer's - in which case it is also included in the contract.  In some of the earlier contracts there was no specification as to who was responsible, but, in fact, it was the farmer.  It is clear that Coillte has upped its game in the more recent contracts.  What is even more clear is that it has realised its communication with its partners has been abysmal during the years.  Two weeks ago we came to an agreement that it would improve dramatically, but I am a little concerned that in the two weeks since the meeting there has not been any contact with the 630 partners to tell them that something is happening.  We are certainly not in a position to make that contact.</p></speech>

There has been no contact.  Many of those involved are elderly and perhaps in the case of some of the partnerships intestate.  Many have had no communication from Coillte.</p></speech>

The position seems to be - the delegates can correct me if I am wrong - that everything was weighted in favour of Coillte; by and large, it was getting the best deal everywhere it went.  While business is business, at the end of the day the farmer owned the land and was providing the opportunity for everyone to make money.</p> <p>  Mr. Collins mentioned the issue of intestacy.  I have come across a number of cases where the person who entered into the contract is deceased.  Where do matters stand?  What happens now?  What mess is left behind?</p> <p>  The people who are sitting across from me are farmers.  They sell whatever crop or product they produce at the most opportune time when they can make the most profit from it.  They bring calves to the market or sell milk whenever they can make the most profit.  In this case the farmers involved did not have the opportunity to pick and choose when they sold their product because it was being handled and sold by somebody else who was a big player in a big business in which there were peaks and troughs.  The delegates can correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that much of the timber in the forests under the control of Coillte was used by it to fill in the troughs.  When prices were at their lowest, that was when the timber was used, while timber from Coillte's own forests was held back until prices rose again.  I certainly would consider that to be in breach of the contracts made.  I looked through one of them and it seemed that it stated everything would be done to maximise profits for everybody involved, but I do not think that has been happening.  As far as I can see, what has been happening is that the arrangements are being used by Coillte as a means to fill the troughs at times when prices are at their lowest to allow the merry-go-round to continue.  At the end of the day, it is the farmer who has suffered the most.  I would like to hear the delegates' comments.  I am sure Coillte will have a different argument, which is fine and we will deal with it when we come to it.</p></speech>

If George Lee, in an excellent piece of public service broadcasting by RTE, had not brought it to the fore and public attention, it would have been buried nicely.  In fairness, we must lay the credit with George Lee who did a good job because he found a number of the people who had been affected.  Are the delegates concerned?  Do they have an inventory of members of their organisation who bave been affected?  There seems to be a cohort, particularly in the south east and counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Laois.  Those affected seem to be concentrated in particular geographical areas.  There are also some in the west but not as many as in the midlands.  Have the delegates had contact with them or given advice to them?</p> <p>  Notwithstanding what Coillte has stated and will state, is it not apparent that it was truly in the dominant position?  It drew up the contract and its partners - the farmers - had to seek amendments to it, if properly advised which would have required the obtaining of legal advice.  It appears from the significant number involved that they did not have an opportunity to do so.  Is that a fair point?  It tallies with something I did.  I stopped a huge number of people from signing wind turbine and solar panel contracts because the proposed contracts would have meant they would have effectively been sterilising their land for a long time.  It would have impacted not just on their ability to farm but also their single farm payment which would have been affected, as would have their ability to obtain planning permission for a site for a son or a daughter.  That is what has happened.  People walked into it and had their land sterilised.</p> <p>  The problem in this instance is that it involves a cash crop with a long-term return.  That is the big issue and I had an uncle who was a forester.  The unfortunate people concerned were like lambs to the slaughter and there was only ever going to be one winner.  I have read Coillte's presentation to the committee carefully.  Five scenarios are presented and it is the substantial winner in four of them.  There is only one in which it loses in the upfront actuarial valuation and discounting values.</p> <p>  Mr. Sweetman made reference to early maturing forestry plantations.  There was a gap in the payments.  Surely Coillte had an onus to ensure there would be early maturity or a faster yield or growth to bring the period from 40 to 30 years.  It seems people have been left without payments.  That is what brought the issue to the fore for many.</p> <p>  There was no need for Coillte to communicate because it was in the driving seat.  That is the way it felt.  It was driving into the winner's enclosure and there was only ever going to be one set of losers and that set comprised many of the 630 people mentioned.  When I saw them on television, what I noticed was that they were elderly and that they included widows.  It is not a very good presentation.  Coillte can bring in all of the PR agents it likes but a picture paints a thousand words.  Many have said to me that this is scandalous and asked whether I am going to do something about it.  A group of 630 is small; the number affected is not 6,300.  All Coillte had to do was ensure they would be informed and receive their money in a timely fashion, that they would receive an indication of the level of return and whether there would be an early clearfell, as opposed to what had been projected.</p><p>The fact that there was a five-yearly review should have been communicated.  Now Coillte is running after the problem after it has arisen.  It is trying to correct it and while I accept that it seems to have got its act together, as someone who has always supported it, I am very disappointed with the way it has behaved in recent years.  I will say this to its representatives directly.  It will get it also because it is not very good to see what it has done.  It has been running after itself since January or February since George Lee's programme.  We have had constant communication and cannot fault Coillte in that regard.  The delegates have had meetings with its representatives.  However, Mr. Sweetman says he has not been brought up to speed in the past fortnight with what has been going on or on the number of people involved.  I know that there are confidentiality issues in that regard, but I had hoped the delegates would identify a cohort of 200 members.  Have they not reached the position where they know how many of the 630 are members of their organisation?  The IFA could follow up with them in that regard to ensure this issue would never arise again with a contract.  The moral of the story is that no one should ever sign anything for anyone without first obtaining legal advice.  That is very clear and I send that message to farmers who are contemplating agreeing to wind turbine or solar panel placement or anything else on their farms.  It is a salutary lesson, not just for the farming public but also for every member of the public who engages with organisations that are in a dominant position.  If many of the farmers involved were to take the ultimate step, the <i>contra proferentem</i>rule and contract would apply whereby those in the lesser position would be viewed as such.  It is up to Coillte to ensure that in in future nothing will be signed in the absence of proper legal advice being proffered and that it will be privy to it before anyone enters into a contract.</p></speech>

As he said, the issue was highlighted on a TV programme.  Farmers put their trust in Coillte and took what had been put in front of them at face value.  I will let the delegates answer the questions in one minute, but do they have proposals for how we will rectify the position?  Is there a proposal for a review of the contracts or some template that we could use to ensure fairness would be brought back into the equation for the 630-odd farmers involved?  As Deputies Martin Kenny and Willlie Penrose raised questions, I will let the delegates answer them.</p></speech>

There is nothing to stop it from doing so and it is quite possible and probable that it has happened.  Does it have an effect?  Yes, it does because it affects the annuity and how it is calculated.  This results in an economic disadvantage for the partner in question because he or she is not maximising his or her income.  One must ask how someone can sell the timber here and be the buyer at the other end?  It just does not work.  That is the issue.  The Deputy is correct; there are peaks and troughs and it fills the void when the price of timber is down.  There is nothing to stop Coillte from doing so.  However, at that end it is the sole benefactor because the price of timber fluctuates.</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Willie Penrose's comments, yes, we do take into consideration the contracts and what has happened.  Those who signed the contracts were elderly and vulnerable persons and not aware of what was happening.  They trusted Coillte and the State.  Coillte was seen as a State organisation.  In the early 1990s many did not know into what timber would mature.  It is a very valuable crop, something of which they were not aware.  They were not given professional or the correct legal or financial advice by Coillte at the time.  Many of those who signed the contracts were not experts in forestry.  That is the problem.  How do we rectify it?  We must sit down with the people concerned to see what we can do for them.  That is what the IFA has done and what we want to do.  We want to try to help them.</p></speech>

We do not know who has a contract with who as we are not privy to that information.  However, at local level we have said that if anyone wishes to have us work on his or her behalf if he or she is having difficulty, we will do so.  We are all aware individually of some of the problems being encountered in various counties.</p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose asked a question about early maturing forestry in the context of reducing the projected period of 40 years to 30 and the effect this would have.  I must admit that in some cases it would be advantageous for the farmer to have a shorter rotation in so far as Coillte has in some contracts toploaded, if one will, the annuity paid.  However, in earlier contracts there was a fixed sum annuity, in which cases it would really be disadvantageous to have a shorter cycle.</p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose also asked about the obtaining of legal advice.  It is true that many of the people I know of received legal advice.  I cannot say whether everyone received legal advice, but I do not know many solicitors who knew anything about forestry in the 1990s, let alone who were competent to give legal advice on it.  It also came to my attention that the estimated income contained in some contracts was way off current values and had not been adjusted.  Every five years there was supposed to be a readjustment of the projected income.  In contracts I have looked at there has been no readjustment for over 20 years.  Therefore, instead of every five years, there has been no readjustment for over 20 years, which is a problem.  If the Deputy were to ask me what the big issue was, I would say it was a complete lack of transparency and contact between Coillte and its partners.  It was to be expected that Coillte would try to have a contract which was at least beneficial to it, but to do so without having the farmers' understanding of just how beneficial it was to it, to my mind, was deeply unfair.</p></speech>

Mr. Sweetman has stated a few times that Coillte's contracts in the recent past have been to a higher standard.

Seemingly, Galway and Kilkenny were the main attractions for the contracts.  There are a number of contracts in these areas.  There was a huge targeting of them because they were deemed to have very productive ground for timber production.  That is what I have been led to believe - that there was huge significance in Galway out of the Mountbellew office, as well as the Kilkenny office.</p></speech>

That is what happened.  There was a targeting of two regions: the west, out of the Mountbellew office, and Kilkenny, out of the Kilkenny office.  They were classified as having highly productive ground for forestry production.  </p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose said he was not aware of anyone in the midlands with a Coillte contract.  I am sure there are people in the midlands with Coillte contracts.  Why have they not come out?  Many are ashamed to say they are engaged in a partnership with Coillte because they believe they have been let down.  They are ashamed to say they signed up to something and that they have given away their land for 40 years.  That is how they feel.  They were vulnerable persons who signed up to something without being aware of the effects.  As my colleague has pointed out, there was no legal expertise available in the early 1990s.  Coillte had the expertise.</p><p>The private grower was not aware of the value that timber would be.  The core issue now is how we can get a resolution to this.  This is why people have not come forward.  People are still getting their State premium.  It will probably come to a head in three or four years' time when the majority of these contracts finish in the State premium from the forest service and then enter into the annuity payments.  This is where the big problem will arise.  I do not know how we are going to be able to help these people.  This is a big mess and it needs serious attention.  Some &euro;300 million is tied up in forestry partnerships in rural Ireland.  If we consider the 12,000 ha, at a conservative figure of &euro;25,000 per ha, it comes to approximately &euro;300 million.  That is a lot of money, all of which is leaving rural Ireland.  The idea of forestry for rural Ireland was to regenerate and put money back in to the rural economy.  People now feel that this has not happened.</p></speech>

They did not consult the partners on this.  How can Coillte employ KPMG to carry out an audit when Coillte has not consulted its partners?  The partners have to be involved in the negotiations and in the day-to-day decision making in the partnerships.  This has not happened.  I agree that an independent body has to be set up and there has to be total transparency in these contracts.  We must sit down and work out how this can be achieved.</p></speech>

Even though it affects a relatively small number of people it would appear there are a lot of different issues with each of the contracts.  The approach we are trying to look at is to set down a frequently asked questions type document that Coillte would work up, in consultation with the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA.  This would at least get it out there, for those farmers we may not have yet come across it, and it would deal with how various aspects are calculated and so on.  We would probably need a system to mop up those to get a bit more detail and maybe some form of appeal for people.  If they are unhappy with the situation they should have access to somebody so they can sit down and work it out.  A lot of these contacts have been in place for a long time and there is a lot of learning from all this.  The key issue now is to try and get to these 630 people to see if we can get a resolution for them to move on.</p> <p>  As other speakers have already outlined, as the contracts have been going on for longer the older the person is the bigger the issues appear to be.  It is complex because some people have passed away, which presents probate issues and so on.  An element of any solution is the need to go through the contracts one by one.  We had a meeting with Coillte two weeks ago and I certainly got the impression that Coillte was very anxious to try to work with the IFA to resolve the situation.  We must try to get to the 630 people, sit down with them and work it out to come to a fair resolution for it.</p></speech>

KPMG has been retained to conduct an audit.  Is KPMG, in essence, going to look at the figures and see if the bottom-line figure deposited in the farmers' bank accounts is correct?  Is this the case?  KPMG will not be adjudicating on the fairness or otherwise of contract terms.  That is a whole different ball game.  We could have a situation where Coillte is shown to be correct, but that does not mean the terms were not unclear or unfair with regard to management-----</p></speech>

KPMG has not been appointed by anybody else to conduct an audit review in this regard, as I understand it.  Coillte has brought that company in to assist it in resolving this.  That is a matter between Coillte and KPMG.  That is a contractual relationship between Coillte and KPMG.</p></speech>

Will the landowners get sight of this evaluation or will they just see a line signed by the auditors saying all is in order from the perspective of money accounted for, income and outgoings?</p></speech>

The farmers' problem with that is if one is hiring somebody to look at a contract to see if the contract is fair, then the person selected should be truly independent and not selected and paid by Coillte.  They shall only be looking at the accounting function.  Nobody here is suggesting - I certainly do not - that Coillte is cheating on the contracts it has.  Coillte is enforcing contracts that are not fair in the current situation.  I am not at all suggesting that Coillte is not paying money when it is due, even though the methodology of paying the money is not acceptable to us.  I am not suggesting that Coillte has set out to cheat anybody.  The <i>de facto</i>situation, however, is that Coillte is not treating the partner fairly.  Coillte is in a dominant position throughout this.  Coillte has admitted that it has not communicated adequately in this regard.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked if there were any suggestions and I have one.  There should be a protocol for a meeting between Coillte and the partner, with a set agenda where the items down for discussion can be agreed.  As things stand, in a lot of the cases where the annual visit took place, the visit involved the Coillte representative coming to the farm, telling the owner the trees were grand and asking the owner to &quot;Sign here, because if you do not sign here you will not get the State subsidy&quot;.  I am not saying this was everywhere but in certain instances I am aware that it absolutely was.  It is true that if the farmer did not sign on the dotted line the subsidy, or premium, would have been withheld.  It was a probably a form 4 but it does not matter what the form was.  It was necessary for the farmer to sign the form in order to get the premium.  By extension, the farmer has then obviously had his meeting with Coillte.  I am not saying this happened everywhere but I am certainly aware of several instances where that happened.  In some cases the meeting consisted of the Coillte representative and one of the landowner's relatives signing <i>per pro</i>, and not even with the landowner present.  Clearly this is not acceptable.  These are aspects that Coillte itself wants to tighten up on.  If the committee is asking how things can be changed this is one of the ways.  There should be a proper protocol for these meetings.  The five-year readjustment of the suggested increment etc. should also be clearer.  It was suggested by a committee member that Coillte thinned the forests when it wanted to fill a gap in its market.  That perception is very clear.  Whether or not it is an accurate one I have no way of knowing, but the perception is definitely out there that Coillte takes material out of the forest to fill its own orders when it suits and when Coillte does not want to sell its own timber because the market may be wrong.  Bear in mind that in some of the contracts the annual income is based on a percentage of the thinnings - in some cases 88% of the net profit from the thinnings goes to the farmer - but 88% of nothing is nothing.  Very little income is forthcoming from the forest in some cases simply because the market is bad at that particular time.</p></speech>

I do not think it has in some cases.  There are a lot of issues of mismanagement of crops throughout the country.  Many people feel aggrieved by this because this is their income, they signed up for this for their retirement and they have been left hanging out here because there is nothing for them.  There is no pot of gold at the end in terms of what they had anticipated was going be there for them.  This was signed up to by people for a son or a daughter or maybe for retirement and to enable them to go into a nursing home or whatever the case may be.

I am sorry I am late.  Since the day this was raised at the committee, how much focus has Coillte put on resolving the problem?  Has the communication been any better way?  According to some of the farmers to whom I spoke, there is a real fear among farmers.  If a private operator plants ones forest, one gets the grant at the beginning.  The contractor gets the establishment grant.  The farmer then gets the 15  year or 20 year grant in these cases.  There are cases of which I am becoming aware where land has been planted for ten or 12 years and there may be some trees, especially in boggy ground, that have failed.  Coillte has a responsibility to maintain these trees and if there is an inspection of them, those farmers are left wide open.  It would have to go to an appeal, because their whole grant could be blocked.  Has Coillte addressed any of those problems?</p></speech>

That can be a serious issue because there can be clawback on the premium and the farmer is liable to pay back that premium.  It could be 50%, 60% or 70% over the lifetime of the premium.  In most case it was a 20 year premium.  The farmers is at a loss as Coillte can walk away.  There is no onus on Coillte.  There is a lack of management in many of the forests that I have seen throughout the country.</p></speech>

They are dealing with them on an on-going basis.  At the meeting between the IFA and Coillte a few weeks ago, it was agreed to develop principles and guidelines to strengthen communication and trust between both partners.  There is obviously a very clear desire and need for both those of things to happen.  We believe Coillte has a duty of care as the dominant partner and with all the experience it has to ensure the farmer has a clear understanding of the issues in all aspects of the growing process and, in particular, as I highlighted earlier, the timber revenue model and the distribution of profits.  There is much work to be done and I hope that the agreement both parties came to a couple of weeks ago will be honoured.  It is clear that farmers are at a loss in relation to a number of key aspects.  I hope that Coillte will bear that in mind and will work with us.

We have submitted two interim reports to the committee since our last appearance in December and we hope to further build on these today and outline a clear set of actions that will address any outstanding concerns to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.  Before that, I will give a little background and context.<br/><br/>Coillte&rsquo;s farm partnerships are highly innovative products that were launched initially in the 1990s.  The agreements were all designed to promote afforestation at a time when this was recognised as a key priority for the sector.  The agreements were also designed to provide solutions for farmers who were considering entering forestry for the first time by addressing matters such as maximising access to forestry grants for landowners, providing early cash payments and avoiding the requirements for farmers to sell land.  A key principle of the partnerships is that the overall value of the forests is maximised for the benefit of both partners by providing the landowner with Coillte&rsquo;s expertise and economies of scale, market access and crop certification.<br/><br/>Between 1993 and 2012, seven main schemes were developed and within these there are 35 identifiable forms of contract.  Further to this most schemes would have undergone some degree of customisation and negotiation to suit individual needs.  The consequence of this is that it is difficult to make direct comparisons between partnerships and each partnership should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Let me be clear that every one of our partnership contracts is legally sound.  Our records show that all our farm partners had access to their own independent legal advice at the time of contract formation and signing and many of them were subject to detailed and extensive engagement with the partner's solicitor.<br/><br/>In a number of recent reports, allegations have been made or information has been inaccurately represented regarding Coillte&rsquo;s farm partnerships that we would like to specifically address for the committee.  It has been suggested that Coillte has not paid partners what they have been due and has in some cases harvested timber which is not accounted for in profit calculations.  Coillte can confirm that having reviewed its contracts with farm partners, it is satisfied that there are no cases where partners have not been paid what they are due and it is satisfied that it is fulfilling all of its contractual obligations.  All timber that is harvested has been and will be included in profit calculations that determine payments to the partners.  It has also been suggested that some farm partners will only receive 1% of profits from the partnership.  We refer to the case studies in the presentation, which clearly outline that there is a good balance of payments between the partners.  The precise profit share at clearfell is based on the scale and level of early payments that have been made.  For example, partners who received larger earlier payments will receive a smaller proportion of the clearfell profits and <i>vice versa</i>.  In most cases the partner will receive approximately 60% of overall cash generated from the crop.  In some cases, and particularly the index-linked schemes, Coillte is forecast to make a loss on its share of the partnership.<br/><br/>It has also been reported that forests have been poorly maintained.  Coillte has a very strong motivation to manage these forests to a very high standard in order to protect its investment to date.  Coillte ensures that its forests are managed in a consistent and professional manner to the highest standards.  All Coillte forests, including those involving farm partnerships, are independently audited and certified as being well managed to both Forest Stewardship Council and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification standard.  This certification adds significantly to the overall value of the timber produced from Coillte&rsquo;s farm partnerships.  A number of Coillte&rsquo;s farm partnerships, including those which have recently received media coverage, have won Royal Dublin Society forestry awards for the sustainable management of the forests.<br/><br/>It also has been reported that Coillte has not communicated with its partners, in some cases for 20 years.  Let me state clearly for the committee today that this is simply not true.  Given the length of partnership of over 40 years and changes in circumstances, we recognise the need to strengthen communication processes, particularly around more formal systems of communication and transparency on payments and how profits are calculated.  We are taking active steps to address this.  The level of communication is very much related to the activity phase of the crop.  Our records indicate that while our formal communications need improvement, there has usually been regular operational communication with local foresters.  Our records of correspondence, meetings and site visits clearly demonstrate that it is simply not true to say that there has been no communication for 20 years.<br/><br/>It has also been reported that Coillte deducts a 15% marketing cost.  This is incorrect.  The contracts specify exactly how the marketing cost is calculated.  The precise percentage is calculated every year based on historical costs in Coillte&rsquo;s annual accounts related specifically to the cost of sale.  The marketing charge is based on direct costs of marking and measurement and is approximately 2%, not 15% as has been reported.  The actual charge is consistently in the order of 2%, which is well below the industry standard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#K00400"><p>Since 1993 Coillte has paid &euro;20.8 million in direct payments to its farm partners and over the same period Coillte has received &euro;3.8 million from crop profits.  That is &euro;17 million that Coillte still needs to realise and that does not include the significant management and overhead costs incurred in managing these partnerships.  Taking this into account, Coillte has a very significant interest in maintaining these forest crops well and maximising their overall financial performance.</p> <p>  I will speak a little about the operation of the scheme and its benefits.  The key feature of the partnership agreements is that there is an agreed profit share between the partners.  The structure and timing of this profit share varies for each scheme.  In many cases the partner had a choice of different schemes, depending on the individual preferences.  Profit share is typically realised in most cases by the partner through the payment of an annuity and a share of clearfell profits at the end of the crop rotation.  In certain schemes, the partner receives a guaranteed payment through the life of the crop, irrespective of the performance of the crop.  The precise share of the profits payable to the partners at clearfell is primarily determined by the value of advance payments plus the annuity payments the partner receives.  Upfront payments are calculated based on the forecast profitability of the crop.  In later agreements, these payments are reviewed on a five-year basis to reflect the actual rather than the forecast performance of the crop.</p> <p>  Profit is calculated by reference to direct costs only, such as harvesting, haulage and marketing, and it does not cover any management charges.  Coillte recoups its management and overhead costs from its share of the profit.  Coillte receives a small portion of profit from thinnings, typically 20%, as they are carried out but must wait to the end of the rotation to realise most of its share of the crop value.  Coillte incurs a further cost across our partnerships in the order of &euro;500,000 per annum in respect of our direct management costs.  This is recovered from Coillte&rsquo;s portion of the profit share.  The partner also receives an annual premium through the first 20 years paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  More than 80% of Coillte&rsquo;s farm partners are still in the phase where they are in receipt of grant premiums.  I have produced a schematic for the committee of how a typical farm partnership agreement operates and it is included in an appendix to the presentation.</p> <p>  There is a good balance of benefits for both partners throughout the crop rotation.  In addition to this, the farm partnerships provide important benefits to the wider timber industry.  As Coillte receives its returns primarily at clearfell, the flow of benefits to date has primarily been to the farm partner.  Coillte is committed to these partnerships to realise the investments of everyone involved.  It has a duty of care to protect and maintain its investment in these forests to date as a State asset.  Our case studies, which are presented in appendix B and are summarised in the accompanying table, show that there is a balance of benefits and risks to both partners.  The vast majority of farm partners should receive over 60% of the value of the plantation over the course of the crop rotation.  In all cases, Coillte is responsible for optimising the value of each partnership for the benefit of both partners.  Coillte is committed to living up to this responsibility.</p> <p>  At a meeting of the committee in December, a number of matters relating to Coillte farm partnerships were raised.  Subsequently, Coillte engaged with the IFA to understand and discuss a number of matters raised by IFA members.</p><p>Based on constructive engagement between Coillte and the IFA, we believe that we have an agreed list of key issues.  Coillte has committed to address each of these issues through future engagement with the IFA in order that it can then be communicated to members and other farm partners.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Coillte has already taken a number of actions to address some of the concerns that have been raised by farm partners.  These have largely been detailed in the interim reports that we have submitted to the committee.  As members are aware, Coillte wrote to all its farm partners in December informing them that it had put in place a dedicated phone line to provide a support service.  We have actively encouraged all of our partners who need support to contact that line.  The number for this line is on the company's website and was also published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>.<br/><br/>All calls to this line are logged and assigned to the appropriate person within the organisation.  Since 15 December we have received approximately 80 calls to the helpline.  The vast majority of calls have been requests for information and have been easily dealt with.  A further number of issues are being actively followed up and resolved.<br/><br/>In December, this committee highlighted that in a number of cases, there is a gap between the expiry of the grant premiums and the commencement of Coillte's annuity payments.  This situation arose due to a change in the timing of premium payments.  Coillte has agreed that where this situation arises, it will honour the spirit of the agreement and will commence annuity payments a year earlier to ensure continuity of income for the landowner.<br/><br/>We have received clear feedback from our partners through this engagement that they are frustrated with the lack of information about payments and how they are calculated.  We acknowledge this frustration and apologise to our partners.  We have commenced active steps to improve the quality and level of information that we provide to our farm partners.  This will include an annual statement which will detail any payments made, any payments due and the basis for their calculation, in accordance with the partnership agreement.<br/><br/>We have retained KPMG to carry out an independent review of how payments are calculated and to verify that the calculation methodology is in line with the contract.  This is designed to provide a new level of transparency to our partners on how payments are calculated and to give our partners confidence that calculations are being carried out correctly.  We are initially prioritising those partners who are already in receipt of annuity payments from Coillte or for whom forestry premium payments will expire this year.  We expect to be in a position to issue these statements in advance of the annual partner meeting this year.  It is our intention to provide this information to all our partners in due course.  These commercial statements will also serve to address concerns related to insurance, specifically which portion of the crop each partner should insure.<br/><br/>In a number of cases, to ensure that our calculations are accurate we are carrying out a full updated forest inventory.  This process is already well progressed.  The updated inventory will confirm productivity and any thinnings that have already taken place.  It will ensure that accurate statements are produced and that payments are correctly calculated.<br/><br/>Coillte is aware that in certain cases, partners have looked to exit the partnership agreements.  Coillte's position is that where genuine reasons exist, we will explore options with farm partners on a case-by-case basis, subject to normal commercial terms.  Our next steps are to close out all remaining issues on our call log, prepare commercial statements for our partners, engage with the IFA to agree responses to the issues raised by its members and present options to partners who wish to exit their agreements or for whom it makes sense to restructure their payment schedule.<br/><br/>We believe we have created a significant valuable asset for both parties though the innovative approach taken with the farm partnerships.  We have enabled this value to be released to partners in various ways to suit partners' expectations on income continuity.  Out of our 630 partners, we have identified approximately seven partners who have expressed significant dissatisfaction with their partnership.  While our preference is to continue in partnership, we are open to explore either buying or selling out these partnerships on full commercial terms.  We have paid out a net &euro;17 million in payments to date, not including management time costed at approximately &euro;10 million.  Like any other commercial partner we need to recoup a return on this investment.  We remain committed to our contractual obligations and expect our partners to do likewise.  Coillte is open to engagement with any partner who has difficulties or changed circumstances and is committed to improving transparency and communications.  We have already taken steps to improve these areas.  We will continue to engage with the IFA to address the issues it has raised, especially on commercial transparency and improving communications on resource management and sales strategy.<br/><br/>I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to address the committee today and we will gladly answer any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#L00300"><p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  Does he not feel embarrassed that Coillte, as a semi-State company managing State assets, working in partnership with farmers, has let down those farmers, many of them elderly or widowed?  It has failed to communicate with them in a proper, open and transparent way, explaining every step in the process and what is due at the various stages of the contract.  I note that Coillte has now engaged PR companies and everything else but it is a bit late for many of those people.  I accept that from here on in, the issue is being viewed in a different light.</p> <p>  Coillte is a big organisation.  Has it not failed to ensure the people in a weaker position were properly advised and communicated with?  Let us call a spade a spade.  It was vital that such people clearly understood the terms of the original contract.  Mr. Murphy noted that many of them received legal advice.  Is he able to say that in each of the 630 contracts, he has documentation to prove the people were properly and legally advised?</p> <p>  Coillte is in a dominant position.  We understand that some people do not even realise that on completion of felling they would have to be replanted, which is the equivalent of effective sterilisation.  After the 30 or 40 years are up, the farmer is back in the cycle again.  Has Coillte established a proper forum for farmers to ventilate their grievance?  KPMG has been retained but that is from Coillte's side.  Its review is the equivalent of trying to unscramble the egg.  It is one side of it.  KPMG is operating under Coillte's instructions.  It will just ensure that payments are properly calculated in accordance with the contract.  Surely, in view of the one-sided nature of the contract, there should be an effort to review the contracts in a current context and apply current valuations, terms and conditions thereto.  In the interests of restoring trust and confidence, the contracts should be rejigged.  That seems to be very important.  Some of them were taken out in 1993 and 1994 which is 25 years ago.  I was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1992 - it is a lifetime away.  Many things have changed in the interim for those people.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that Mr. Murphy said that if somebody has not fully understood the nature and extent of the contract, in certain circumstances Coillte is prepared to negotiate his or her exit, which is fair enough.  That is what I understood he said - maybe he did not.  Perhaps I am not very clever but I thought that was there.  In that context, what does it mean for someone who has been in for 25 years and wants to get out, given that Coillte is saying that at the end of the felling process people have to go back in and replant?  Does that take them out of being bound by that additional term?  That is very important.</p> <p>  While I might not be too well up on this, the terms and conditions under which contracts were predicated seem to have changed.  There were things such as increased growth rates, earlier maturity and a shortening of the rotation period.  These farmers, many of them elderly, were in the inferior position in terms of their contractual understanding; they expected it to be 40 years or so.  How often has Coillte reviewed them?  I thought a review was supposed to have taken place every five years.  That does not appear to have been the position.  I have listened carefully to the IFA presentations and that does not appear to be the position.</p><p>Is it the case that Coillte was harvesting to suit itself because there was a timber deficit?  In the valley period, did Coillte harvest to suit itself, irrespective, and without letting anyone else know about it?  Those are the questions I have to ask.  If there was harvesting at times of early maturity, were the concomitant payments as a result brought forward to reflect that and paid out to farmers?  I am trying to garner from what has been said that there is early maturity and, thankfully, trees appear to be growing better.  Of course, there are a lot of targets to meet in the forestry and Coillte area.  Coillte has a role to play in that but private farmers seem to be leading the way with 18,000 of them working on it.  Those are some of the issues of which I took note.  The five-year adjustment is very important.  Has that been kept up to speed?  Can the witnesses indicate to us where the vast bulk of the 630 farmers, or partnerships as I call them, are located.  Are they in Cork, Kilkenny or Carlow, Laois or across the midlands?  I noticed the excellent programme by George Lee, which I praise again, and our Chairman has been in the vanguard in this area also.  George Lee did an excellent public service because we would not have heard a work about this without his programme.  In fairness to the Chairman, the committee had been on about this in December.  He brought it out and I saw a whole cohort of people I felt very sorry for.  I saw an elderly man of 73 who thought he should have got a big share but who got nothing.  Another man with two parcels of land failed to maintain.  Another lady had 90 acres.  There was a horrendous lack of transparency.  Another person had been at annual meetings but no information was given.  Those people are hard-working and decent and they were frustrated and disappointed.  I felt very hurt for them having been a strong supporter of Coillte over the years when I had good reason to be.  However, those people have had a major influence on my attitude to Coillte which is a very large organisation charged with a great responsibility.  It has behaved in a cavalier manner to those people and it has a lot of ground to make up.  It will take a lot of PR companies to come back after a lot of people in Ireland watched George Lee on the news.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#M00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is before us because we have received complaints about the partnership agreements Coillte has entered into post-1990.  We have had a flavour of these exposed in the media, through the cases brought forward by the IFA and also individuals who have contacted myself and other members of the committee.  Generally speaking, the issue is financial transparency and how the moneys to which people are entitled and actually receive are calculated, but there is also an issue of fairness in the terms and conditions of these contracts.  Other complaints relate to the management or suggested mismanagement in places of the actual forestry itself.  For example,   I spoke to a man earlier today who complained that where trees overhang public roads or private roads over which there are rights of way to commonage, for example, Coillte refuses to cut them back.  I understand in some cases that to take out thinned wood, Coillte employs contractors to enter the land who drive over fencing and so on and leave it, in the absence of fencing, first, insecure, and, second, to pose a danger to animals, including sheep and dogs, as well as to walkers.  Often, these contractors enter the farmer&rsquo;s land without any notice and there is no restoration or making good of any damage to the land when this is done.  Another issue which I ask the witnesses to clarify is the suggestion that Coillte does not pay towards the installation, maintenance and upkeep of roads and that either the farmers or State grants have been obtained to provide them.  Obviously, Coillte is bringing heavy machinery onto roads which are not reinstated to clear fell or thin out the forests.  These are just some of the complaints.</p> <p>  While Mr. Murphy set out some global figures and provided the committee with case studies, I have details here of a 1994 partnership contract and one wonders why, on the face of it, any farmer who knew what he or she was doing would ever sign it.  Under the contract, the farmer obtains a grant to buy, plant and maintain the trees for the four years to establish a forestry and signs the benefit of the grant over the Coillte.  Up front, Coillte has no capital outlay on this asset.  The farmer gets a premium for 20 years which comes from EU-Government funding and is not payable by Coillte.  There is an annual payment, which I am told is called a "life pay", over the lifetime of the crop until it is clearfelled.  Notwithstanding that, in this particular case the farmer gets no revenue from thinnings and on clear fell gets just 1% of the net profits.  As has been mentioned, this farmer, as appears to be common case among landowners, will have to bear the entire cost of replanting to establish a new plantation after clearfelling.  That is estimated at &euro;3,000 per acre.Coillte is in a position to decide unilaterally when to clear fell and when to thin and there is no consultation with farmers.  The witnesses may not have heard the IFA witnesses earlier, but it was clear that there are commercial concerns about Coillte&rsquo;s methodology.  If it thins or clearfells when wood is cheaper, that will impact on the price the farmer will get.  I appreciate that Coillte has different types of contracts, but there is an impact there and Coillte is the ultimate beneficiaries of this raw material in the forestry itself.</p> <p>  That is a summary of the complaints.  This particular farmer regrets very much getting into this at all and it seems there are a number of farmers in the same position.  This is a lot more than just a failure to communicate or to be transparent.  The bottom line is that on the face of it this looks like a very lop-sided partnership.  It is not a partnership, which, as I stated earlier, is a misnomer.  It appears to be a case of very hard-nosed commercial activity on the part of Coillte.  I do not know what advice farmers got but this is the situation in which they find themselves now.</p> <p>  To shed light on some of the issues, would Coillte be prepared to bring material before the committee?  We are told there are 630 contracts.  In its presentation, Coillte said that only seven partners had expressed a signficant dissatisfaction.  By the same token, I understand from what the witnesses have said today that the only thing people have been told is that there is a helpline.  Coillte has not specifically reviewed things or written to those 630 farmers or landowners to ascertain what concerns there are or to enter into a dialogue with them.  If it has, that has not been said to the comittee.  Coillte has also pointed out that at this juncture 80% are still in a phase of drawing their grant premia.  It may be that this problem is arising now because a lot of people are at the end of the life of the forest which is ready to be felled and farmers are wondering about money.</p><p>I understand that this problem is now arising for people because many forests are at the end of their lifetimes.  The trees are ready to be felled and farmers are wondering about money.  They have probably been doing so previously as well.  The problem is being compounded by poor communication.  Would the witnesses be prepared to give the committee the number of contracts involved on a county-by-county basis?  I presume that we are not talking about partnership agreements in all cases, which are obviously legal contracts of a certain nature.  Could the witnesses set out the different contracts that have been entered into with landowners in respect of the use of their land in this fashion?</p><p> Reference was made to the complications relating to probate in the case of the death of the person who originally entered into the contract with Coillte.  The successor is not privy to that contract.  In some cases, a contract does not seem to be available for the next of kin or the successor to see.  I understand that difficulties may have been experienced by some landowners or successors in getting copies of contracts.  Can the witnesses confirm that this will not be a problem, that there will be transparency and that the contracts will be furnished to whoever is going through the probate process in respect of an estate?</p><p> We have been told that there were seven original agreements, which morphed into approximately 35 variations.  Have there been any addendums made to agreements afterwards in respect of which people have raised issues?  Have there been cases in which an initial agreement was drawn up, problems arose and further or supplementary agreements were made?</p><p> The witnesses also stated that Coillte is prepared to consider people buying themselves or getting out of partnership agreements on commercial terms.  How many landowners have been released from the terms of their partnership agreements?  Has anybody actually been released and, to whatever extent the witnesses can tell me, on what terms?</p><p> On transparency in respect of money, it has been said that some people are having money put into their bank accounts yet they do not know the breakdown of it or if they are getting a fair amount.  Coillte has retained KPMG, which may sign off and say that this is correct.  Is the farmer or landowner going to get a chance to see the supporting documents that KPMG will have sight of, in order to try to ascertain for himself or herself that he or she is getting a fair price?  Will that information be forthcoming or are we just going to get a few lines from KPMG to say that everything is fine and has been done in accordance with the terms of people's contracts?</p><p> In respect of Coillte's annual reports and accounts, to what extent can the profit or loss attributable to partnership agreements be gleaned from these documents?  If I view Coillte's accounts, can I see where these partnership agreements are dealt with and where their profitability or otherwise is referred to?  The witnesses provided some figures regarding payments out.  Is there a place where I can see what profit and loss is attributable to each agreement on an annual basis?</p><p> While the witnesses said that people had the opportunity to avail of legal advice, it would seem that many of these contracts were entered into when it was not very prudent to do so on the part of the farmers.  Indeed, it seems that if they pressed it, they could have got a better deal from Coillte.  The fact that there have been variations to the contracts suggests that some people did and perhaps got a better deal.  I am just making an assumption there.  As I highlighted earlier, elderly farmers on a particular type of contract are in some cases getting 1% of clearfell profit.  They are being asked to re-establish crops at a cost of &euro;3,000 per hectare at their own expense, with no grant aid available.  In some cases, as we have been told by the IFA today, people did not even realise they had to replant their forests.  Do the witnesses from Coillte think that is fair?  In effect, it is win-win for Coillte and no-win for farmers.</p><p> Another issue I mentioned earlier is the clause in the contract that allows Coillte to unilaterally clearfell when it feels it can do so, up to a period of 40 years.  The other partner - I use that term loosely - really has no input.  It has been suggested that this is an unfair term of contract and that it is unenforceable.  I can guess what the witnesses' response will be but I am putting the point to them nonetheless.</p><p> I mentioned complaints earlier in respect of management and contractors going in and land, fencing and roads not being reinstated.  Apparently, as I understand it, these are not express terms in most of the contracts.  Would the witnesses accept that it should be an implied term and that these matters should be the responsibility of Coillte in the course of proper management of forestry?  Would they agree that Coillte should be obliged in this manner?  Perhaps they can clarify the situation in respect of the 630 contracts, given that they are aware of what is in them and we are not.</p><p> What I got from Coillte's presentation is that it is speaking to the issue of poor communication.  It puts its hands up to that and maybe some transparency.  I would like the witnesses to speak further to the issue of unfair terms of contract and the vulnerability of many of these farmers.  Many of them are older now.  Coillte is in a position to trade on and use as good currency the fact that it is a State company.  It immediately endears itself to farmers for this reason, yet we have these complaints coming from people.  It may not be the biggest number considering the number of farmers who are engaged in forestry.  However, for a vulnerable elderly person, it is a difficult situation to be in.  They are left in the dark and are wondering about when they are going to get money.  A large number of them made this investment in the hope that they would have a nest egg or some income to mind themselves in old age and, perhaps, to look after bills, including those relating to funerals, when they are gone.  That does not seem to have turned out to be the case for them.  Despite the statement "We entered into commercial contracts", many contracts have been modified.  That clearly means that the original contracts left something - or a lot - to be desired as regards landowners.</p><p> I hope the witnesses have had an opportunity to take down my questions, of which there were many.  I have a note of them if anyone needs refreshing as we go along.</p></speech>

Deputy Penrose asked if we are embarrassed by what has happened.  I would have to say that the vast majority of the farm partnerships are working well.  We believe that after going through the process.  Obviously, there are very dissatisfied partnerships.  I would prefer not to have that position.  We are actively engaged with them to resolve any of the issues that they may have.  It would be wrong to say that I am not concerned.  Whether it is one, two, five or 100 partnerships, I would like to have all our partners fully satisfied in terms of honouring the obligations we have set out with them.</p><p>Another of the Deputy's questions relates to how we communicate with them and whether they are properly advised.  As I said earlier, according to the review we conducted, all contracts were the subject of independent legal advice.  I have not yet seen an example of a contract that was not subject to such advice.  There would have been extensive communications with the farm partners in terms of how those contracts were entered into and what people were looking for.  At the time - 20 years ago - the big issues for farmers coming into forestry were continuity of income and access to management expertise.  That is what they were looking for because they were concerned, going into forestry initially, about how they were going to have income continuity, particularly from farm premiums.  This is what was designed by the partnerships in the context of what we were doing.<br/><br/>In terms whether they were properly advised regarding the replanting obligation, there is a felling licence obligation in all contracts and the replanting obligation is part of that.  In the context of all of the premiums, the form 1 and form 2 contracts people would have entered into would have reminded them that there was a replanting obligation.  In terms of the call log, the form and whether we wrote to people, we did write to all our partners setting out the call log and we also advertised it in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal .  </i>In terms of all of the recent media coverage, the issues are certainly well publicised now.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked a question as to why we are using KPMG in the context of transparency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022700002#O00200"><p>No, that is not what I asked.  KPMG will read the contracts, apply the payments and verify what is due under the contracts.  That is not the issue.  KPMG is going to take a literal approach.  It will take the contracts and read them.  I could read a contract in ten minutes and determine what is due at a particular time.  My question is whether KPMG has any power to examine the five-year adjustments which should have been carried out and which may not have been carried out.  Is KPMG in a position to ensure that all of that is correct or is it just engaged in a payments process?  I want that cleared up because it is important.  KPMG is a big company but this is the equivalent of trying to scramble an egg.  KPMG is operating on the instructions of Coillte.  It will just ensure that payments that are deemed to be due are properly calculated.  However, the one-sided nature of the contracts is now evident and everyone cannot be wrong on that.  Mr. Murphy has a different view and that is fair enough.  He must put the company or corporate view out there but he is going to hear from so many people, including my colleagues here, that the contracts are unilateral in the context of equality and, from that perspective, KPMG has no role.  The only role in that context is for Coillte at corporate level.  As I said earlier, Coillte should consider rejigging the contracts in the interests of good business relationships with those people who are affected.  Mr. Murphy has claimed that there are not many people affected.  If that is the case and there are only ten or 15 people affected, why not do it for them?  Why not ensure that some of the issues raised by Senator Mulherin are addressed?  She is not making it up.  She comes from Mayo and knows what she is talking about.  Why can issues like maintenance and so forth not be looked at?  There is a huge amount that is outside the remit of KPMG.  It is only looking at the monetary end of things.  I am referring here to the contracts, the wording of same and so on.  I would like to see Coillte rejigging the contracts.</p> <p>  I made the point to the IFA representatives that the numbers affected are small and Mr. Murphy has reiterated that.  However, there may be other people out there who have not yet realised the position and who have not understood the import of those contracts.  Some contracts were only signed in the late 1990s and something will only hit the fan in the next three to four years.  There may be a greater cohort of affected people then.  We need an awful lot more information from Coillte.  We want to know where the people affected are located and the nature of the contracts that were entered into.  We also want to know how much time is left before the contracts expire and the anticipated end-date of those contracts.  Then we will be thrashing and will know a lot more, including whether the number affected is small.</p></speech>

In terms of KPMG's role, we have asked that company to confirm that the calculation of payments is in accordance with the contracts and that it has been done correctly.  We have also asked KPMG to advise us on the scope and content of the commercial statement that we are putting together for the partners.  That is the role we have given KPMG and it is very much related to the calculations part of the contract.  The scope of its involvement does not extend beyond that.</p> <p>  There is a very important element of context to all of this that I would like to mention but first, I would like to reiterate what Mr. Murphy said in terms of our belief that the vast majority of our partnerships are working well.  That is the feedback we are getting through our local offices but we do acknowledge that there are a number or problematic partnerships.  In terms of context, it is important to understand the phase that this portfolio is at and the phases that forestry typically goes through.  In the first five years when one plants a greenfield site with new forest, there is a lot of activity and there is a key focus on ensuring that plantation is well established, that all the plants strike and that one gets to what is called "free growing".  Typically, that takes the first four to five years.  There is then a period of between ten and 15 years when there is very limited activity in the forest.  It is really a case of maintenance at that stage, as the forest grows and as it comes to a point where thinning takes place.  That is the point when the premiums are payable - the first 20 years of the crop - but the general level of activity is low.  A key point to outline here is that our ability to forecast the actual profitability of that crop is relatively limited until we see the growth rates of the crop and until it gets closer to thinning stage.  More than 80% of the 630 farm partnerships that we have are still at the stage where the activity is relatively low.  That is a very important piece of context.  There are a number which have now come through that stage and we have started to carry out thinning.  I will talk through the whole process by which we calculate the payments and the annuity payments that are due to our partners in due course but would like to address a number of other issues first, as they arose.</p> <p>  The issue of exit for the partners was raised.  Senator Mulherin asked how many partners have exited or been facilitated to exit.  Exit is something that arises for us on an ongoing basis.   Partners' circumstances change and these are long-term, typically 40-year agreements.  The issue of probate has arisen and is a very real one, particularly in the context of such long-term contracts.  We face requests to sell our share of the partnership and also to buy the partners' share of the partnership on a regular basis.  We have a clear process by which we evaluate payments that have been made to date, payments that are due and assess those on the basis of our estimate of the profitability of the crop.  In quite young crops it is quite difficult to make that assessment.  A further complication can arise if crops have to be roaded.  These are the types of costs that must be taken into account.  To date we have successfully exited approximately ten partnerships by way of us buying out the partner buying or the partner buying us out.  </p> <p>  The issue of shortened rotation has been mentioned.  We have already referenced the fact that there are seven different schemes involved here and in six of those schemes, a shorter rotation is advantageous to the partner.</p><p>What that means is the partner gets the same level of payment from that plantation spread over a number of years but it is a shorter number of years.  Therefore, the individual payments are higher, but the level of profit that accrues to the partner is the same in every case.  The one exception to that is the scheme, to which Senator Mulherin referred, where there is a life payment and a guaranteed fixed annual salary, as it is called, in the contract that is payable to the partner.  That payment is indexed linked.  I would refer the Senator to the case studies we have shown, including one from that particular scheme, which demonstrate that during the course of that rotation Coillte makes a loss on that rotation.</p><p> On the issue of Coillte making harvesting decisions, in essence, when it might be advantageous to Coillte to harvest the crops or not to do so, there are three key tests to which we have to live up to in these contracts.  We have a clear responsibility to ensure these crops are managed commercially in the interests of both parties.  That is a contractual obligation.  That is the first test we have.  The second test is that it must be done on sound commercial principles, having regard for good silviculture and good forest management practice.  The third test is that it must have regard for the long-term nature of forestry.  Those are three tests by which we live.  In accordance with that, we produce what is called a resources plan.  It determines when crops get thinned, when they get clearfelled and what their date of clearfelling is.  Bearing in mind that the vast majority of these partnerships have not yet got to the stage where they are being thinned, there is quite some road to travel before the clearfell date, which is the date Coillte sees its return on its investment in those partnerships.  The resources plan essentially is drawn up on a case-by-case basis, partner-by-partner basis; it is not drawn up on a portfolio basis, or with reference to Coillte's outputs from its estate.  The reason for that is that we have an obligation to maximise the commercial benefits and the interests of both partners in this agreement. </p><p> On Deputy Penrose's question regarding where the partnerships are located, I do not have to hand the figures per county.  We divide the country up into six business area regions.  The spread is relatively even.  We have one area in the north west in which there are only 33 farm partnerships.  The other five regions typically have an even number ranging from 16% up to 25% of the partnerships.  It is correct to say there is a cluster in the Kilkenny-Waterford-Tipperary region and there is one in Galway.  Typically speaking, there is a good spread across the country.</p></speech>

I draw the Chairman's attention to the fact that we have 630 partners.  At any particular time we endeavour to make sure they are satisfied and that their experience of the partnership is good.  However, at any particular point in time there may be dissatisfactions and we endeavour to address those.  The call log we have set up is quite active.  There have been references to that.  I wrote to all of our 630 partners.  Having regard to the fact that these are long-term agreements, some of them are already more than 20 years old and people's circumstances change.  We received back a small number of those letters marked "return to sender" and we are working through those one by one to make sure those letters get delivered to all 630 partners.  In addition, we have advertised the call line on our website.  We have got it published with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and ensured reference is made to it in various online coverage by agri-media outlets.</p></speech>

It was appended to one of the interim reports we sent to this committee.  It highlighted that issues were drawn to our attention, that we understood some frustration was expressed by our partners and, in particular, frustration was expressed that when they have questions they do not know to where to turn.  In response to that, we have set up this call line.  The call line is manned full time by a full-time member of Coillte's staff.  It is not manned by a call centre off-site.  The first role of the person who answers a call is to assign it as an issue to somebody within the farm partnership team.  That may be somebody locally or centrally depending on the nature of the query, whether it is primarily a commercial or an operational query.</p> <p>  Our experience of that call line, and the response to it, has been that the vast majority of calls are requests for information.  It has become very clear to us through our engagement with our partners that we have not lived up to the standards we would expect of ourselves in terms of communicating.  We have mentioned that and that we are taking very clear steps in that regard.</p></speech>

However, our partners have annual meetings.  I know that has also been the subject of some discussion in this forum and in other places, and it has been the subject of some of the feedback we have got from our partners.  We are committed to having annual meetings with all of our partners.  In some cases where the level of activity is relatively low, we believe it is appropriate that those meetings take place by telephone and that they are documented.  In our documentation of our annual meetings with our partners, there is an opportunity for the partner to raise issues of concern.  We would accept that those meetings have been primarily operationally focused.  Their focus has not been on commercial details.  That is an active step we are taking to address that issue and to specifically address the issue of payments to partners.</p> <p>  To give members a sense of what the statement we are producing involves, the specific issue we are addressing is the fact that our partners have said to us that they have not been clear about what payments they are due in the future.  From their financial planning perspective, that is a reasonable requirement.  I would respectfully disagree with something Senator Mulherin said in that I believe these are partnerships.</p><p>They are not adversarial agreements and we are both on the same side.  Coillte and the partners share the same objective, which is to maximise the returns from these crops in all cases.</p></speech>

Legally, we are obliged to do everything to optimise the value of the crop.  This is particularly the case with regard to thinnings, where most farm partners are now.  There is a three-year window to thin crops and it cannot be left too long as it would increase windthrow risk.  In the past two years we have entered into our most intensive thinning cycle, with over 200 partnerships having carried it out in that period.  We do not harvest to suit ourselves, though we look at the issue in the context of the market.</p></speech>

We would not go in to thin a crop without notification.  We were asked whether we were putting stuff in our panel mills at the expense of the partner.  When farm partners came in 20 years ago, most of what we did was export pulp and there were negative values in thinning.  This was a major strategic issue for the industry and Coillte looked at developing a very strong pulpwood using sector, following which Medite Smartply came in.  It accounts for a significant proportion of the market and without them we would probably have to export again.  The decision to establish those plants provided economic benefits and a safe and secure market for pulpwood, which enabled the crops to be thinned.</p></speech>

Even the material purchased by Coillte's own mill is bought at the same price as Coillte's own material and is a small fraction of the driver of the value.  Every single piece of timber harvested by a partnership, whether through thinning or clearfell, the latter of which has not yet happened, follows a fully auditable trail showing every element harvested, transported, delivered over the weigh-bridge and invoiced by our customers.  No other forestry company can demonstrate that level of transparency and the new commercial statement gives our partners access to that transparency.  We will show them the payments they have received and how they have been calculated, as well as the payments which are forecast to be received and how they are calculated.  The case studies included in our opening statement demonstrate that there is no question of Coillte taking a huge chunk of value at a cost to the partnership.  In the vast majority of partnerships the partner or the landowner receives the majority of the value and Coillte's split is, on average, about 40%.  In addition to this, we contend that we are adding to the overall value by a number of means.</p><p>For example, we are providing forestry management expertise, access to established market channels to maximise prices, economies of scale and, critically, a form of certification that is almost impossible for individual private forest owners to achieve on their own, given the overheads and level of administration involved but for which we have the necessary scale, and adds a premium to the end product's price.</p></speech>

If there is any damage, that should be picked up in the normal communications.  As to her question on whether we are making good on damage, the answer is "Yes".  We are obliged under the contract to make good any damage arising from operations.  I would be disappointed if there was significant damage, but if there is, it should be identified with local management and rectified.</p> <p>  We were asked whether we were contributing to roads in light of the road grants.  We facilitate the partner in applying for a road grant in the majority of cases, but we still bear the cost of additional roading in a number of instances.  There are examples of us bearing the costs of roads in some of the partnerships that have been mentioned.  That forms part of our contribution.</p> <p>  Regarding Lifepay and only getting 1%, which would barely cover replanting costs, perhaps Mr. Stanley will explain Lifepay.  That system was built for giving income continuity from the start to the end.</p></speech>

Where the landowner is only due to get 1% of the profits from clearfell, it is typically because he or she has been receiving significant payments throughout the full rotation of the crop.  The commitment that we have given through our engagement with the IFA and others is that we are open to engaging with any of the partners where this is a source of anxiety and to considering, for example, replanting obligations and restructuring some of the elements of cashflow within the contract so that there is no risk of a negative cashflow at the partnership's termination.</p> <p>  If I may, I will refer to the way in which thinning profits and annuity payments are calculated and specifically the five-year review of profits, which is important and has been mentioned by a number of people.  The review is a sensible clause in the contract and protects both partners' interests.  I will explain how it works.  It is a review of annuity payments that are due to the partners.  The majority of partners are not yet at the stage where those annuity payments are payable to them.  The annuity is designed to provide continuity of income once the forest service grant premium payments expire after 20 years.  Critically, all profits that are generated from thinnings regardless of their timing are recognised in the calculation of these annuity payments.  In advance of an annuity payment being due, we make a calculation of the forecasted profits from thinnings over the full rotation of the crop.  In the majority of agreements, 80% of those profits are payable to the partner as an annuity payment.  This amount is divided by the number of years from the date on which the premium payments expire to the date of clearfell, which gives the annual annuity payment to the landowner.  For example, if 80% of the total thinning profits from a crop is &euro;200,000 and there are 20 years remaining in the partnership from the expiry of grant premiums to the clearfell date, the landowner will receive an annuity of &euro;10,000 per annum for 20 years.  It is a simple calculation.</p> <p>  In all cases, the annuity commences after the expiry of premiums and gets paid until clearfell.  All thinning profits are taken into account.  When we start paying the annuity, it is based on a forecast of profits because we have not yet realised the profits.  The purpose of the five-year review is to ensure that, as the partnership progresses, the annuity payment is reflecting reality rather than forecast.</p></speech>

When we investigated, the reason for this was that the premium payments were initially paid retrospectively, that is, a year later.  A number of our agreements are scheduled to pay the annuity payment on what is termed in the agreement the 22nd anniversary of the agreement.  This was designed so that the payment would be paid 12 months after the last premium payment.  In recent years, though, those premium payments were brought back in line, which left a one-year gap.  We have recognised that.  This contract specification applies in the case of approximately 60 partners.  We have told our partners clearly that continuity of income was the spirit and intent of the agreement.  Even if the contract explicitly states that the annuity payment commences on the 22nd anniversary of the agreement, we will start the annuity payments one year earlier on the 12-month anniversary of the expiry of the forest service premium payments.  There should be all full-----</p></speech>

Of those 60, only a handful - it might be four or five - had already reached the point where their premium payments had expired.  We have now rectified that.  The balance had not reached the point where their premium payments had expired.  We have recognised the issue and committed to ensuring the payment happens a year earlier.  It would not be correct to say that the 60 have had a gap year.</p> <p>  The review of payments is designed to happen every five years because that term is the typical thinning cycle.  The annuity review essentially happens every year after someone has completed a full thinning.  At that stage, a landowner can take into account the actual recorded profit.  There is a full audit trail up to the weighbridge at the customer's facility.  We must have this paper trail for our certification purposes.  We need to be able to show the full chain of custody for the timber from where it grows to where it gets processed, as do our customers if they are to sell the material into their end markets.  We reflect the actual profits every five years and the annuity may adjust to reflect that.  By the time a landowner reaches the point of clearfelling, the annuity payment should be taking into account all of the actual thinning profits rather than just forecasted thinning profits.</p></speech>

Under our system, we have extensive and good markets.  Being the largest supplier of round log, we have developed strong markets across the country, including for pulp and sawlog.</p><p>In the case of small and large saw log, we put the material up either through our auction or the annual saw-log contracts we have with our sawmill customers.  In the case of pulp wood, there is a number of different markets.  We can either put in into MEDITE SMARTPLY, which is the biggest user of pulp wood in the country, or put it into local markets.  When I look at the prices received against benchmarks in the private sector in the last two years, we compare very favourably.  I am very comfortable saying that.  Because we are a forest owner, we are actually aligned to the farmer in this regard.  At the end of the day, we are always looking to get the best possible price for our product.</p><p> The other question was around profit and loss attributable to the accounts.  It is not explicitly seen in the accounts.  Some of it gets recognised as some of the value gets realised but most of that value is not taken up in the financial accounts.  We have statements around how much we have actually spent, which is approximately &euro;20.8 million, and we have profits realised from the thinnings we have got, which is &euro;3.8 million.  That is why this is the net payments to date in our partnerships where we have paid out &euro;70 million.  That does not include management, overheads and other costs in maintaining the forest on top of that.  Currently, we have a significant outflow from the farm partnerships.  We have a duty of care and we have invested significant amounts of money in the partnerships and it is in our interest as well as in that of the partners that we get full value from the moneys we have put in.</p><p> Another question was whether it was prudent to enter into the agreement in terms of variations.  I understand it was asked if some people were getting a better deal.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

There are seven main schemes with 35 variations.  The central pillar of the contracts remains the same in terms of profit calculation and allocation, however.  There may have been addendums within the extensive negotiations and discussions with partners' solicitors where small things were sought in contracts on rights of way or other issues.  However, they were not material to the overall pillars of the contract.</p></speech>

There are different schemes which were developed over the years from 1992 right up to 2012.  Over time, different schemes developed because one found as time went on that farmers were looking for variations to the original.  The early schemes were very much index linked and there was a guaranteed payment all the way through together with the premia.  As that went on, we found that different schemes were more attractive to people.  People looked for some share of it up front in terms of annuity, but were prepared to have a value at the end.  In most of those contracts, somewhere between 55% and 60% of the clearfell value goes to the partner.</p></speech>

If I were looking at it, the earlier schemes are probably more attractive because they provided a guaranteed, index-linked payment right the way through.  If one looks at the time-dimension money, it is a guarantee of payments all the way through to the end.  Some of those schemes are attractive to the farmer.  It depends on one's appetite for risk.  Some people preferred a guaranteed income and did not want to worry about the performance of the crop.  They were happy to take that.  In other cases, partners started to say they wanted to be more vested in how the value was created and they wanted to capture some of the value at the end if log prices changed in the long-term.  It depended on the appetite for risk among the partners.</p></speech>

We heard earlier that the practice in these forestry partnerships was an innovation and something new in Ireland.  I presume that as they got more clued in to what the value of their asset was, they made more demands.</p></speech>

I would not say one was better than the other.  I go back to one's appetite for risk.  Some people prefer a guaranteed payment all the way through without having to worry about the performance of the crop.  That takes a lot of the risk out.  In the later schemes, people perhaps took less money earlier through the crop and waited for more value to come out at the clearfell stage.  Each depended on the preference of the partner.</p></speech>

These were innovative agreements.  When they were initially set out, it was very advanced thinking to look at 40-year term agreements, all of which were designed to maximise afforestation and to increase the accessibility of afforestation to landowners.  If one looks at the case studies, the majority show that the split of value is of the order of 60:40 between the partner and Coillte.  The early scheme had a split of value which was much more heavily weighted in favour of the landowner.</p></speech>

I go back to one of the early answers on a duty of care to the crop from both a silviculture and commercial perspective.  When one applies for a clearfelling licence, one has to show that one is felling the crop taking into account the silvicultural merits of the decision and its commercial merits.  It is something that would go against that spirt and the legal obligation to fell the crop at the right time to get the value to use it as a way to terminate the contract.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the guiding objectives, there was no input from the other partner.  He or she could not say he or she had researched it and it should be looked at another way.  These are markets we are talking about and markets are something one interprets.</p></speech>

Obviously, one will consult with partners.  Part of the reason people came into these partnerships was to use Coillte's expertise in making the right decisions around resource management.  We pride ourselves on the fact that we make the right decisions as to how both to thin and fell a crop to get the best value at the end of the day.  It is not in our interest to make decisions which diminish the value of the crop because that also impacts on the investment we have made.</p></speech>

They said legal advice was provided to the people who signed up to these contracts.  Did they get independent legal advice or was it just suggested that they get legal advice?  Can the witnesses confirm that they actually got the legal advice?</p> <p>  I refer to clarity around the value of the timber and thinning at the time of sale.  Many people are reaching the 17 to 20 year point when thinning is or should be happening.  Do they actually get a clear statement of the value and volume of timber extracted, where it has been sold and what price has been achieved?  Is that provided to them?  From what we have heard, that does not appear to be the case.</p><p> The annual meeting is being presented as meaning that communication was ongoing whereas my understanding is that it would be a meeting whereby a local forester would go out to visit a farm and say to the owner, "Your trees are doing grand and we will keep an eye on them for you".  That is my understanding of what is involved.  It certainly would not be considered the type of communication for which farmers were looking.  They wanted something more substantial - they wanted questions answered and they wanted to know where they stood, what was happening and where it was going.  That type of meeting, which is more of a box-ticking exercise from the point of view of making sure everything was okay, does not fulfil the criteria and to suggest it does is being a little disingenuous on the part of the witnesses.  I would like clarity in respect of that matter.</p><p> The witnesses mentioned that there was a range of partners up to 2012.  How many new partnerships have there been recently?  Have there been any and, if not, why not?  Mentioned was made of an offer and I see that just seven partners out of 630 expressed dissatisfaction.  To be honest, I do not think Coillte would be here if the figure was that low.  If there were only seven people who had a problem, I do not think this committee or anyone else would be making such a song and dance about this.  In fairness, it is less than 1%.  It does not stack up that only that small number of people would have a problem and it seems more widespread than that.  The witnesses suggest that, in some of those cases, Coillte would explore either buying out the partnerships at full commercial value or selling them to a third party.  Is Coillte buying land at the moment?  If it is not engaged in partnerships, where is it getting new land to plant?  I recently came across a situation whereby, as I understand it, Coillte is actually selling land on the international market.  What is going on in that regard?</p><p> Basically, Coillte's defence is, "We are honest people and we would not do anything wrong."  However, we need something a little more solid than that to reassure the public and the people who have these contracts.  What has been presented is quite flimsy.  I have looked at one or two of the contracts and I have talked to several people who have them.  They seem to be all over the place with regard to how well they stand up.  Two of the people to whom I spoke certainly felt they were not told they needed to get legal advice or to get their solicitors to look over what is involved and that this was not raised with them at the time.  They were presented with contracts, they discussed them a little bit with the people from Coillte and they signed up, trusting that everything was okay.  I would like to hear the witnesses' final comments on that matter.</p></speech>

It has been very interesting to hear Coillte's response to the issues raised and I would like to address some of them.  Mr. Stanley said that some of the partnership meetings will take place over the phone, which is amazing.  I wonder how many of the partnership meetings actually took place by means of phone calls.  Will the witnesses expand on that?  I do not think many farmers would take a phone call from Coillte to ask how things are going as being a meeting.</p> <p>  In regard to the figures on the seven complaints referred to by Deputy Martin Kenny, the witnesses said that 80% of the grants still have the annual premium from the Department, so I would think the seven cases apply to people outside the grant period.  If so, that means there are 126, which is 5.5%, and, therefore, it is more of a problem than Coillte - which is suggesting a rosier picture - is presenting.  Is that the case?  The figures are making it look a lot better but I wonder why Coillte would be here if just seven people out of 630 were having problems.  To have seven out of 126 is a lot more significant.  It may even be seven out of 20 who are having a problem, although we do not know.  I wonder about that.</p> <p>  In the context of the clusters in east Galway and Kilkenny, Coillte owns processing plants around the country, including in Waterford and Clonmel.  Is there any correlation between the clusters that have the problems and the Coillte plants?</p> <p>  We are discussing the problems farmers are having but it seems there have also been problems for foresters dealing with Coillte.  I refer to a report published by the timber raw materials supply chain sector on Irish forestry practices and procedures in 2008-2009, with which I am sure the witnesses are familiar.  This highlights many of the same problems they had in dealing with Coillte such as, for example, the manner of awarding contracts, the volume of timber to be harvested and the arbitrary and uneconomic rates of payment by Coillte.  All of those issues correspond with the difficulties farmers are having.  I wonder if there is a cultural trait within Coillte which contributes to this problem.  The report states there is ample evidence of non-compliance by Coillte with its forest certification responsibilities, which the witnesses mentioned are important for Coillte regarding its contracts with farmers.  Is there correspondence in this regard?  Is there a problem within Coillte overall in terms of its dealings with the people it has to deal with, such as farmers, growers, foresters, harvesters and transport people, who may be in here with a problem at some stage in the future?  Is there an ongoing cultural problem with which Coillte needs to deal?</p></speech>

Based on what I have heard in the two presentations, I would not be very familiar with the issues involved.  When does the famous contract terminate?  One would imagine it is a one-cycle contract that ends after the clearfell.  If that is the case, why are we being told that some of the contracts contain an obligation to replant at the expense and responsibility of the farm partner?  If that is not true and if the contract terminates at the end of the clearfell, does Coillte just walk away or is there anything in any of the contracts in the context of returning the ground to its original condition before any trees were planted, similar to the conditions relating to most planning permissions?  I suppose that applies down the line in light of the duration involved and the fact that we have not reached the end point.   What is the position?  We have been informed it is in the contracts that the farm partners have to replant at their own expense and cost?  I would like to have that clarified.  If that is not in the contract, what are the termination clauses and what is the timescale involved?  Although the witnesses said the timescale changes because of improved growth, when the contract was originally drawn up, and allowing for the predicted growth time at that stage, what were the terminating clauses?</p></speech>

There is no talk at all about the establishment grant, although Mr. Murphy referred to &euro;20 million being paid out.  At the moment, &euro;800 per acre is given twice in an establishment grant.  Is that correct?  I know Coillte has 12,000 ha involved in the partnerships.</p><p>There has been talk that all of this money was paid out.  All the private companies at the moment that offer to plant trees and manage them for farmers for "X" amount of years do not do such work for the love of the farmer.  There is "X" amount to be earned from such work.  If Mr. Murphy from Coillte is honest with the committee here, what is left over in the margin would go a long way to paying the &euro;20 million that he has said Coillte is out of pocket.  Let us remember that &euro;800 is paid per acre.  We know how much it costs to carry out forestry mounding, fencing, and buying and planting the trees, which anyone can see.  Coillte has put forward the idea that it has paid the money to farmers ahead of getting any money back.  If one calculates the figures honestly one discovers that the establishment grant will leave enough room and then one adds the number of acres mentioned and one will be financially okay.  In my opinion there is no risk involved in that part of the scheme. </p><p> Coillte has mentioned how much it pays out each year and we know there are 630 partnership contracts with Coillte.  I have calculated that the scheme will involve &euro;800,000 per year or an average payment of between &euro;1,100 and &euro;1,200.  Is that fair to say?  Mr. Murphy has said that from 1993 to now Coillte paid out &euro;20.3 million but subsequently that figure was reduced to &euro;17 million.  I calculated my figures using the first figure of &euro;20.3 million.  If one divides that sum by 23 or 24 years and the number of participants then the average total amount paid each year is between &euro;800,000 and &euro;900,000.  Is that correct?  </p><p> Farmers need to know the following in terms of thinnings.  If maintenance is not done properly, and in ten, 12 or 15 years an inspector from the Department discovers that trees have not grown will Coillte take full responsibility if any farmer loses his or her grant?  My question is fairly straightforward.  </p><p> There are grants for creating access roads thus enabling lorries with timber forwarders and timber harvesters to access the areas of forest.  I have been made aware that Coillte has said that it will not provide such grants for the simple reason that the bonds sought by the council have left the project unworkable.  Is that correct?</p><p> I have considered the case study provided for between 35 and 40 ha along with the price of land at the moment and have realised that a farmer would be awful foolish to go into a partnership.  I have calculated that a farmer would receive between &euro;580,000 and &euro;600,000 from the scheme but he or she will receive &euro;5,000 an acre at present if land is sold.  If a farmer sold 100 acres or 48 hectares at &euro;5,000 an acre he or she would earn between &euro;5.2 million or &euro;5.3 million.  Is it, therefore, worthwhile to invest in a partnership with the current price of land? </p><p> Earlier Mr. Stanley mentioned how Coillte markets its products.  In Ireland there are only three or four customers for such products and we talked about them on the previous occasion.  A farmer, Coillte or anybody can sell their product to the sawmills owned by Mr. Fahy, Murray Timber Group or Glennon Brothers.  One does not need a magic wand to sell.  Mr. Stanley also talked about traceability.  That does not add to the value of the timber, in my opinion.</p><p> I worry about the following.  Before Coillte thins forestry does it consult the farmer?  Does it say, "Michael Fitzmaurice has a timber forwarder or cutting equipment and it costs so much a tonne to cut and transport the product to the road, Joe blogs will supply a lorry to transport this, we will bring the product to a weighbridge and the owner will be forwarded with the tonnage within a week or two weeks".  Unfortunately, that scenario has not occurred and many people are vexed about the matter.</p><p> There is another problem that I know exists in parts of Galway.  We spoke about the matter earlier and I heard the delegation members mention Galway and Kilkenny.  I mean instances where pine was planted on average ground but it has grown crooked and is now only good for pulp.  Down the line that situation will cost people money.  Realistically, when all of their expenses are taken out of the equation it will cost them money to replant such ground.  </p><p> At the beginning of a partnership one receives an establishment grant.  Coillte may have a few quid left over that will make participants happy and I refer to the front-loaded bits, which covers expenses.  There is not huge maintenance required or a huge number of meetings involved when it comes to growing a forest.  Is there not a case to be made for the people who joined in good faith?  I do not blame Coillte for the timber not growing properly because in the past timber was planted in unsuitable locations.  When timber was planted in boggy ground it just grew in every direction.  Earlier Mr. Murphy said that everything was sound legally and Coillte ensured, like the HSE and every other State and semi-State body, that it came out fighting and declared it did everything right.  I would question whether people were advised to seek other advice.  Let us remember that it was not the norm to seek other advice at the time.  I shall take Mr. Murphy at his word that Coillte was legally belted up well and that everything was good.</p><p> Morally, is it right if someone embarked on a scheme in good faith but the timber has not grown?  I do not blame Coillte for the timber not growing because growing timber at that time was a totally different game than it is now.  Such people are left with ground that will not yield a return and they must pay the cost of replanting.  Let us remember that it is the State that paid the grant to the farmer and not Coillte.  In addition, Coillte received the establishment grant that covers many problems and costs encountered along the way.  Thinnings have been collected that would not have been documented.  Therefore, is there a moral obligation on Coillte in this instance?   </p><p> I wish to outline a concern.  How does Coillte deflect the following concern?  A felling licence lasts for a while.  Is that right?  An application for a licence must be signed by the participant and a licence may last for two, three or five years.  In the private sector of forestry people are worried that Coillte will keep its own products or properties when forestry is cheap and approach Johnny and Mary who signed the docket because they signed it on a certain day but it may apply down the line.  How does one counteract such a situation?  Those people are vulnerable because Coillte can do such a thing.  There is no point in Coillte saying that it cannot do so.  Should a clause be included in the felling licence that the product will be sold when the price is good and not when it has plummeted?  Why is that option not available to the people involved?</p><p>  Finally, I want to know whether the following is true.  Has Coillte sold a large amount of forestry to some other entity?      </p></speech>

To add to Mr. Murphy's response on the issue of legal advice, Deputy Martin Kenny stated that Coillte had indicated that legal advice was given to the partners.  That is not correct, and if we made such a statement, it was incorrect.  Having gone through our records, they show that each partner had independent legal advice paid for by the partner.  We did not give partners legal advice at any stage.</p> <p>  On the value of timber, the commercial statements we are producing for our partners will detail a number of matters.  They will summarise the contract, set out payments that have been received to date and the basis on which they were calculated, and detail future payments based on forecasts.  The basis for the calculated forecasts will include the volumes of timber we expect to extract and the years in which we expect to extract them.</p></speech>

In the first 20 years of the crop, the issues that arise are mainly operational.  As there is no cashflow in this period, there is no requirement for any form of financial discussion.  The way the meeting is structured is that in the final quarter of each year, a form is sent out to the partner outlining works that have taken place in the previous year and works planned for the following year.  The form includes a section in which the partner can add comments.  Where comments are made, they are followed up by a telephone call which will clarify points made on the form or arrange a one-to-one meeting.  Deputy Pringle is correct in general terms in that one-to-one meetings do not often occur in the first 15 years of the crop because the farmer does not need to be told the same story every year.</p> <p>  The approach is three-pronged, consisting of an initial visit to check the site, the sending of a report to the farmer and an option to hold a meeting either by telephone or on a one-to-one basis.  We have checked years 14, 15 and 16 of contracts and our checks show that we have record of 96% in terms of forms issued and returned either with comments or as acceptance of the report as being an up-to-date review of the performance of the crop.  The forms do not cover financial matters in the initial period.</p></speech>

If, for instance, next year was a year for a road-in application, that would be noted and this is always followed up by a one-to-one meeting because in the case of felling licences or road-in applications, Coillte is required to meet the partner and have the various forms signed.  When the partner receives the document, he or she is given an option of accepting the document, discussing issues by telephone or having a meeting on the ground.</p></speech>

The only time we meet partners to obtain a signature is if we are applying for a road-in application or a felling licence.  In most cases, this will not happen before year 15 of the contract.  In the years between establishment of the forestry and year 15, it is not a tick-box exercise or just to obtain a signature.</p></speech>

For example, when we reviewed the contacts we had with one of the partners who attracted a significant amount of media coverage, we realised there had been 16 site visits over two years.  These were all operational site visits and in many of them, although perhaps not all, there was interaction with the partner on the site.  This reflects a partnership that is now moving into a stage of highly intensive operations.  Likewise, the interactions become much more intensive at that stage.</p></speech>

At that point, there may be a telephone call or meeting.  What is the position?  It is important that this is clarified and Coillte sets out exactly what people can expect.  It is obvious that people are not getting what they are informed they will get.  If they were told they would have to fill out a form once a year and a meeting would be arranged on request, they would have a certain expectation.  Coillte informs us that it meets partners every year when that is not the case.</p></speech>

It is for private forest owners who do not have an existing relationship with Coillte, so they are not in this batch of 630 partners.  For individual private forest owners whose grant premiums have expired or are about to expire, we have launched a product called Coillte premium partners.  With that, we would enter a partnership at that stage.  That partnership enables us, similarly to these 630, to share some of the clearfell profits with the partners over a period of years.  It is designed to give continuity of income after the grants expire and then a share of clearfell profits.  No new forests are created with Coillte premium partners.  With the nature of those differences, the Coillte premium partners agreement is typically for an approximately 20 year period, whereas these agreements are typically for a 40 year period.  There are some key differences but it is a partnership agreement.</p></speech>

I think the question was whether we are buying or selling land.  We have sold land for a number of years where we feel that we can get multiples of the value of the forestry.

An issue we have had to date is that we have been out of the afforestation market for a number of years.  We are not eligible for the grants and premiums.  We are very aware of it because if we get in and do it in a certain way, we would drive up the price of land.  We have been very conscious for the past ten or 15 years that the private sector has been doing most of the afforestation.  It is an issue with the carbon targets.  We are looking for other opportunities to afforest land.  We are actively exploring a number of options which we hope to see if we can actually implement later this year.</p></speech>

Is the system which we have spent the last couple of hours speaking about no longer appropriate?  Is that not a reflection that it certainly was not working for the farmer, regardless of whether it was working for Coillte?</p></speech>

Some 20 years ago, there was a certain way of trying to get many more farmers into forestry.  There were blockages, particularly relating to the fear of getting into forestry and what that actually meant.  In that time, we tried to develop a partnership that gave access to management expertise and income continuity.  As the years have gone on, farmers themselves have got much more sophisticated in planting their own forests and are much more confident in how they see the forests themselves.  It probably mimics what is starting to be seen in Europe where forestry is a very well-established farm enterprise, which would not have been the case perhaps 20 or 30 years ago in Ireland.  Most planting was done by the State 20 years ago, by the predecessor to Coillte, the Forest Service.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked if the seven were really representative on the basis that future individuals are not yet receiving the annuity.  Some of the seven are people who are not necessarily getting the annuity now but may get it in the next couple of years.  They have said that they will look at various options.  Some of the issues that have been drawn to our attention relating to the annuity over the last couple of months, such as the annual statement, will be significantly alleviated by the steps we are putting in place.</p></speech>

In a number of the cases, if not all, of the seven significant partners that have highlighted themselves to us, if those partners had been provided with the level of commercial information that we are now committing to provide to our partners, those issues would not have arisen in many of those cases.

When one is dealing with 630 partnerships over a very long period, one will always have issues.  It would be wrong of me to say that we will have no issues coming through, but our job is to ensure that we have satisfied partners.  At the end of the day, if they are not satisfied with even simple things like bringing them along with us, one cannot maximise the value of the crop.  I am very strong on that.  If a partner is significantly dissatisfied as a partner, then it will not work for both parties.  It is absolutely in our interest to minimise any of that dissatisfaction.</p></speech>

Between harvesting, establishment and haulage, we employ many contractors.  Over recent years we have put in very strong procurement as part of compliance.  All our contracts are tendered with very transparent criteria.  In the past three years in particular we have recognised that in tendering to contractors, one of the matters was security.  With respect to investment, they found the annual tenders to be quite difficult, and we have now moved to longer term contracts, including three-year contracts and beyond for both establishment and harvesting over the past three to four years.  We have made substantial moves, first of all in being totally compliant in that the vast majority of contracts are competitively tendered with clear criteria, and on top of that we have moved to longer-term contracts to give security of work for these people.</p></speech>

In recent years we have moved substantially to full competitive tenders with well-published criteria.  There are also longer-term contracts for people to give greater security of work.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked a number of questions, with one relating to contract termination, obligations to replant and the element of cleaning up a site.  To deal with the easiest item first, after any clearfell we need to leave a site in a position to allow for replanting.  That would be part of any normal operations.  The contracts terminate at the clearfell stage.  The thinking behind the contracts at the time was to allow rotation, with revenues etc. flowing against the investment for that period.</p> <p>  People referred to a cost with respect to replanting, but I am a forester by training and we always see replanting as investment in the new crop.  When replanting, it is about investing for the second generation of the crop.  That is why it was kept separate and it would be seen as one project from establishment to clearfell.  The land is given back to the farmer and it is his or her responsibility to replant that for a future crop.</p></speech>

When does the contract terminate?  The original contract stipulates the partner is responsible for the replanting, so there is an assumption that there will be a roll-over, which is another 25, 30 or 40 years.  If a party signed a contract in the 1990s, he or she signed away the farm.  That is if it is a roll-over contract, if we consider the timescale of the contracts is 30 to 40 years.</p></speech>

Hundreds of tonnes of timber are taken out over a period of a couple of weeks and the road is left in a total mess after it.  That happens all over the country.  A lot of local authorities have serious issues because while a road will withstand normal wear and tear, we are talking about a huge volume of traffic over a very short period of time with very heavy weights and they are putting weight restrictions on it and all of that.  That is not part of today's discussion.  It is an issue for local authorities who do not get enough money from central government to maintain the roads and are always complaining about it.  When clearfelling starts in an area and huge volumes of heavy lorries go in to make the roads and then when the heavy lorries come in to extract the timber, they decimate the roads.  It is a problem.</p></speech>

We moved a number of years ago to legal loading.  One could argue we should anyway.  We have a very strict policy of legal loading.  We also have designated haulage routes to ensure we only do it over certain roads.  We also apply the councils' weight limits in certain areas where we may have to do double handling.  It is something we have been working successfully on for the council over the past 20 years.  I accept it is an issue and has continued to be an issue over the years.</p></speech>

We are here as a result of legitimate concerns raised in private about 630 partnership agreements.  Some people have gone public with their concerns.  What we have seen here in terms of communication is quite shocking.  It seems that once the partnership agreements were signed, notwithstanding what the representatives of Coillte are trying to say to cover the cracks, they were put into a time capsule to be revisited when the State stopped paying people their premia after 20 years.  That seems to be what is happening and why this is arising.  Maybe they are nearing clearfell and people are wondering what is happening.  The IFA has taken a very strong line on this.  The methodologies used to calculate what people are entitled to is not clear.  There appears to be unfairness in this.  Coillte can tell us it was a commercial agreement and that it told people to get legal advice.  We do not want to have to discuss the same issue again.</p> <p>  Based on what we have heard, I understand the lack of trust people have in the communication they have received from Coillte.  Coillte has not denied it.  Coillte has tried to explain its communications to us, for example the letter with "1993" at the bottom of it.  One does not have to be a genius to think there is a big problem with the communication on the farm partnerships.  I would like to think that going forward as people present themselves as they become aware of issues and look at their funds, they will be dealt with fairly by Coillte.  I hope that from now on there will be proper communication.  If there is not, representatives of Coillte will have to appear before the committee again and we will be more armed than we are now.  That is how I look at it.  We have a lot more to do.  I expect Coillte to look after these people in a proper fashion.</p></speech>

Coillte has written to 630 farmers, received replies to 5% of those letters, put a new process in place and will have a new commercial statement, all of which is very good news.  However, what has it done on the issue in recent years?  All members have been approached by farmers from various parts of the country who, unfortunately, had very difficult and sad stories to tell.   The witnesses are aware that is why they have been invited back before the committee.  We want to get to the bottom of this and, as Senator Mulherin stated, ensure the witnesses do not have to again appear before the committee in a year's time to explain themselves.  We want to ensure that when the witnesses come back before the committee in a year or two with Coillte's annual report, it will contain good rather than difficult news.  Why was it necessary for the committee to prompt the witnesses to acknowledge the huge communications difficulties and that they had to put new structures in place to alleviate the difficulties that exist?</p></speech>

As regards many of the schemes, in particular those where the annuities are only now coming in play, although we believed we had good operational communication, the transparency around the information was not strong enough and that has started to emerge as an issue.  We intended to produce annual statements.  In terms of the speed in that regard, only a certain number were coming through and over the next five years there will be a larger number with which to deal.  Looking forward, I can consider it in the context of the steps we are taking to improve it.  We are committed to taking the steps we earlier outlined and I hope that when we appear again before the committee it will see substantial progress in addressing these issues.</p></speech>

We have had confirmation from both sides that the engagement has been thorough, constructive and genuine.  The IFA has recognised a real commitment from Coillte to work with it to resolve these issues.  We have drawn up an inventory of the issues and are in the process of drawing up detailed responses to eight or nine such issues.  A witness on behalf of the IFA earlier called it an FAQ, which is a good way to view it although I would see it as much stronger than that.  It will highlight some of the issues that are appearing at different parts of the partnership portfolio.  However, our intention would be to propose a certain course of action, seek the input of the IFA in that regard and then jointly agree a response.</p></speech>

I thank them for taking the time to attend our meeting.  The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the pilot programme on gender budgeting.  After this meeting the committee will prepare a short report on the matter.  As part of today's meeting we will focus on the quality indicators used as part of the pilot to measure the progress in each of six Departments, the process used to devise the indicators and the ways in which the pilot project in the Revised Estimates volume can be improved and help to encourage greater use of performance information during the Estimates process.  </p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p> <p>  I invite Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a to make her opening statement now.</p></speech>

This final document was presented to high level officials in a briefing supported by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last year.<br/><br/>I am aware that the Department appeared before the committee last week and has given it an overview of its broad approach and priorities.  I will therefore not repeat those but will move directly to the task outlined by the Chairman, to provide an assessment of the pilot initiative.</p><p>My opening statement involves a broad assessment and obviously, thereafter we are happy to go into detail where we can.<br/><br/>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has informed the committee that it has consulted with the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, during its process of developing that initiative and we commend Mr. Beausang, Ms Swaine and their colleagues on their efforts to do so.  I also welcome the initiative shown by the six Departments that have committed to engage in the pilot process.  <br/><br/>As members will be aware, in its working paper the Government committed to prioritising gender as its initial equality focus area in accordance with broad international precedence and due to the relatively wide availability of data.  Departments were in the first instance asked to review and assess policies for impact on gender equality and set high-level gender equality objectives and indicators at programme level.  Much of the work to assess policies and set high-level gender equality objectives within Departments was in fact done for the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  Some Departments have done the work to identify specific needs of men relevant to their portfolios.  The Department of Health has, for example, identified gender-specific objectives in its men&rsquo;s health action plan.  Departments were therefore advised to begin by looking to the commitments they made in the national women&rsquo;s strategy in identifying their goals and objectives for gender budgeting.  This strategy can be viewed as a compilation of existing policy commitments already agreed within Departments. <br/><br/>Departments were then asked to report on gender equality, budgetary objectives and targets in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV.  At first glance, the identified objectives could be described as underwhelming.  It is important, however, to take into account the period of time Departments had to prepare for the REV, the limited training to date made available to relevant officials, the absence of gender expertise within Departments and, as referred to by Mr. Beausang last week, international lessons recommending specificity in the pilot stage.  Though close monitoring and critical reflection is essential to the effective implementation of gender budgeting, we must also accept that this will necessarily be a long-term process.  Departments must therefore have the opportunity to scope out how best to utilise the tools made available to them and how to concretely apply them.  Genuine commitment will be needed to <i>ex ante</i>, as well as <i>ex post</i>, analysis, for example.  I therefore am not inclined to overly criticise the policy decisions evident in the REV at this point but rather to look at how Departments are armed to achieve at least the goals they have set. <br/><br/>In saying this, it is clear that some of the objectives identified are not ambitious and do not adhere to the prescribed approach of the pilot to focus on gender equality.  As discussed in last week&rsquo;s committee meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the health goal, for example, is extremely limited when considered in the broad context of health inequalities and gendered health inequalities.  While the consideration of age-related and socioeconomic inequalities is to be welcomed, the metrics disappointingly do not include sex-disaggregated data, which are available to the Department in this area.  This is particularly concerning given that, according to 2017 research commissioned by the Marie Keating Foundation and pharmaceutical company MSD, lung cancer has now replaced breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer fatalities among women in Ireland.  Indeed, lung cancer rates among women are expected to increase by 136% by 2040. <br/><br/>To ensure an ambitious process of change, experts have emphasised the importance of maintaining an open process that allows for input and influence from outside Government administration and of providing for a co-ordination structure that can provide critical input and feedback.  They have cautioned that gender budgeting processes led solely by the public administration system tend to keep ambitions lower and focus on changes that are easily obtained.  In this regard, the proposal by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to establish a steering group involving the NWCI and other external expert actors is to be welcomed.  Individual Departments must also be encouraged to provide for public participation in setting equality objectives and the oversight roles of this committee and the select committee will be vital. <br/><br/>The availability of data is clearly critical.  Our understanding is that, as part of this pilot process, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has requested that Departments identify and log where data deficiencies exist.  We are not aware whether a system has been put in place to assist Departments in this regard or to compile this information.  I had a brief conversation with the Department yesterday and as it was not able to confirm that, I suspect that as yet, such a system has not been developed.  There has been a changeover of staff there and the Department was unable to clarify my query yesterday.  This will be crucial in informing the successful roll-out of gender budgeting in the long term.  In June 2017, the Scottish Government published Scotland&rsquo;s equality evidence strategy, which aims to identify the key research and evidence gaps for each protected characteristic and assigns responsibility for closing those gaps.  In 2008, Israel amended its statistics law to require collection of gender-disaggregated data. <br/><br/>Progress on the REV equality objectives are to be reported in the public service performance report.  For gender budgeting to be effective, the quality of data indicators and analysis will be critical.  While, for example, the high-level goal set by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is clearly ambitious, it identified only one gender-specific indicator.  In order to fully assess the impact of child care expenditure on gender equality in the medium to long term, qualitative as well as quantitative analysis will be required, as is the case across the board.  This will necessitate gender expertise, as well as existing economic and budgetary expertise.  Gender expertise is a specialised body of knowledge which is currently lacking within most Departments.  In the first instance, the newly established Parliamentary Budget Office could recruit in gender expertise to provide for adequate analysis and to develop guidelines for implementation. <br/><br/>Creating the appropriate context for these pilots remains imperative.  An administratively-led process is useful to address micro-level and single-policy economic matters.  It is easy, however, to lose sight of macroeconomic policies and fiscal policy in particular.  The question of overall fiscal policies and the fiscal space remains crucial to equality in Irish society.  Members will have seen that in its document to be released tomorrow, the Parliamentary Budget Office, has also made reference to this.  One means by which the Government can appropriately guide Departments in their gender budgeting efforts and provide clear indication of their macro-level priorities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>equality is to publish an equality budget statement alongside budget 2019.  In the medium term, the Government should consider creating a legal foundation for gender budgeting, building upon the existing public sector duty requirements. </p></speech>

My understanding is that the invitations are with senior level staff and are yet to come to us.  Consequently, we do not have details about the terms of reference as yet.</p><p>We do not have that detail as yet but the NWC also works quite closely with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission with regard to gender budgeting as well as lots of other issues.  We will also be having discussions about what we would like to see the steering group achieve and how it should be run.  Those conversations will be ongoing with the Department as well as between the other actors who will be invited to sit on the steering group.<br/><br/>In terms of the goals and objectives of the pilot project being underwhelming, I did make reference to the same issue myself.  All I can do at this stage is reiterate the point that it was done in a very short space of time.  There was a very limited amount of time given to Departments to identify their goals.  While the child care goal is ambitious, many goals are narrow in their focus, particularly those from the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  However, all international expertise would suggest that keeping the focus narrow is useful.  At this point, officials are just getting used to looking at budgetary measures from a different perspective.  Measures are not just about cost-effectiveness<i>per se</i>, although they should be informed by cost-effectiveness, but also about equality.  It is about the impact of budgetary measures on equality, which is a different perspective for many officials to take.  They need time to get their heads around that, to understand what equality objectives and indicators are and what kind of data they will need.  This will also require really strong, solid circulars from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO.  The latest document produced by the PBO is really useful in that regard.  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 contains a specific commitment to building capacity among officials.  Based on international experience, the best way to do that, in addition to circulars and so forth, is to establish a mentoring system.  Officials will require ongoing support and there will be details that they will need to thrash out and the best way to do that is through mentoring.  I would really like to see the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Ministers from each Department committing to a mentoring process.  <br/><br/>In terms of how we compare to Scotland and Israel, one of the equality budgeting examples used quite a bit by Scotland is around apprenticeships, one of the aforementioned narrow-focus goals.  The Scots have been very pleased with progress made.  In 2007 only 14% of the 9,000 people on apprenticeship schemes were women.  This was identified as a concern during the equality proofing of the budget and the resulting change in policies actually improved the overall take-up of apprenticeships.  There were 26,000 placements last year, over 40% of which were taken up by women.  Scotland is continuing that equality proofing to increase access to apprenticeships for people with disabilities.  <br/><br/>It is important to state a number of points here.  I have already mentioned that the Departments were directed towards the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 to look for areas in which they would set their objectives and apprenticeships is one of the issues that is identified in that strategy.  In that context, the Department followed the guidance that was given.  Apprenticeships tend to be not just a gender issue because apprenticeship schemes are also often targeted at lower-income earners or those from lower-income communities.  In that context, there may also be other equality outcomes that the Department has yet to identify that may come about.  It seems that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is following the international advice that it has received to date. <br/><br/>On the PBO, we have not yet sought a meeting.  However, reference was made in our opening statement to a document on our gender budget assessment exercise which was presented to high-level officials and budget officials in November 2017.  The director of the PBO was in attendance and engaged in the discussion at that time.  We received good feedback from those who attended.  Other than that, we have had some initial conversations with PBO officials but we have not had a formal meeting yet.  <br/><br/>A question was asked about what we would like to see in budget 2019.  We would like to see some of the refining that was suggested by the PBO in terms of the technical elements of it happening, which would be very useful.  We would also like to see an emphasis on equality outcomes for individuals.  We will have to see how the indicators are reported on but one concern is that there may be too much focus on performance outcomes in terms of Department's hitting the targets that they have set in the Revised Estimates volume and not enough focus on whether that equates to equality outcomes for individuals.  As yet, I cannot see how Departments are going to do that.  We have not seen the <i>ex ante</i>analysis to understand why they came up with particular objectives and indicators so it is not clear how we will find out whether there have been clear equality outcomes for the individuals they have identified.  We would also like to see an equality budget statement by the Minister to sit alongside the Budget Statement itself at the end of this year.  Interestingly, Sinn F&eacute;in published a gender budget statement last year alongside its own budget document which was useful.  It pulled out the gender priorities from the budget document, which was a good start.  We would like to see other parties doing the same thing because that would encourage the Government to do it too.  </p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, that seems to have been done by the Department of Education and Skills and others but not by the Department of Health.  The guidance of the national strategy was followed in some senses.  The NWC also engages with the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments around these issues.  Apprenticeships would be one of the issues upon which we would engage with the Department.  We are happy enough at the moment but until we get on to the steering group, the level of influence we can have within each Department is unclear, apart from talking to Ministers about gender budgeting.</p></speech>

In terms of setting really ambitious goals, potentially the best place to do that is in the equality budget statement.  Then, within the Revised Estimates volume and other budgetary documentation, that could be broken down into a number of high-level goals.  In Austria for example, each Department is encouraged to identify five high-level goals.  The really broad element might sit well in the equality budget statement and that could then be broken down into more specific pieces within the Revised Estimates volume.  The more specific the objective or goal within the Revised Estimates volume, the more specific the datasets can be.  That will allow for greater clarity in reporting.</p></speech>

Part of the learning from Scotland was that equality budget statements initially referenced what had been achieved in the previous year by the budget but the Scottish administrators are moving to look forward over multiple years and not just backwards and to set longer-term indicators and broad, ambitious goals.  They are useful for Departments.  The Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have decided to attach these to performance budgeting.  That is sensible in some ways, in particular, because of the emphasis on accountability, transparency, etc., and on multi-annual planning, and, therefore, it should fit well into that.  However, those expecting change will have to expect it over the medium term at least.  Last week, Mr. Beausang also referred to the fact that some jurisdictions have suggested that they have not experienced major change yet but gender budgeting has only been practised over the past ten years or so.  Even the UK now, in referring to the introduction of the public sector duty, recommends that there needs to be eight years worth of implementation for people to be able to get their heads around it and work more naturally in that way.  We have to make sure that we give this time.  It will also take commitment that will go far past this Government.  There will need to be a political commitment within the Houses as well as within Government to make that happen.</p></speech>

Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a mentioned it was part of the Scottish model.  She has seen the indicator the Department was looking at, which was bland.  Just 300 females have been involved in apprenticeships but it does not dig into the data regarding how many of them completed apprenticeships, went on to full-time employment, and secured mortgages on the back of that.  The indicator is not useful in collecting data but data will be key to the roll-out of this process.  Chapter 6 of the NWCI's paper refers to consideration of legislative initiatives.  Some countries have enacted legislation that sets requirements for public authorities.  Does the organisation favour the introduction of legislation?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the importance of membership-based NGOs in this process and the template used in Scotland as best practice.  Will Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a elaborate on that?</p> <p>  I presume the advisory group will play a key role.  Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a said that we do not know what impact that will have and what its terms of reference will be.  If it was left open to the NWCI, what form should the group take?  What teeth and powers should it have?  What areas should it examine?  Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a said the process would take time to bed down and there is no quick fix in this regard but there is no point in setting up an advisory group if it is not able to give good advice based on evidence.  There is a lack of available data according to all the documentation I have read.  How can that be addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;s N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022700002#E00600"><p>Data availability is one of the key issues and it is not just a key issue for Ireland.  It has been a key issue across the world and that is why other jurisdictions have either introduced strategies to address that or they have amended legislation, which was mentioned in our opening statement.  That will be a process as well.One of the issues is we have not seen the<i>ex ante </i>analysis as to why particular objectives and indicators have been identified.  We do not know how Departments are being guided in identifying what data they should use in the first instance and then what data gaps are evident to them and are causing obstacles for them in making their assessments.  There is an issue around transparency in understanding how the process is being moved forward or facilitated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not wish to overly criticise the Department because it has been committed to this process but I would like to see that detail.  As part of our involvement on the steering group, I expect to see some of that documentation and assess it.<br/><br/>With regard to participation, Spanish regions, for example Andalucia, have introduced public participation processes that have been effective in developing budgets but I am not sure that Ireland is anywhere near that.  The type of reform that has been undertaken as part of our budgetary reform process has led to more transparency and greater accountability, etc., but even the role of parliamentary committees, for example, and their ability to influence our budgetary process is not to the standard of Scotland.  One of the reasons behind that is until recently Scotland only had the opportunity to focus on expenditure and did not have responsibilities in respect of revenue and, therefore, it might have been a more comfortable environment in which to allow parliamentary comment than previously.  We are still at the point where even parliamentary oversight has not reached the stage we would like it to.  We would very much like much greater public engagement and participation in the budgetary process but I am not sure we are there yet.  In the first instance, engaging with established organisations rather than the public would be the best way to go about it.  There are pillars, for example, the community and voluntary pillar, which comprises large organisations that have a social justice, equality perspective, that often focus on economic issues.  They are being engaged on a range of issues related to the budget and they should be invited to participate more closely in the process.</p></speech>

What the NWCI would like is not simply to have organisations but to have other expertise on the group.  For example, I do not know if the committee has met Dr. Sheila Quinn but she is a leading international expert on gender budgeting.  By and large, she is based in Ireland when she is not flying around the world to advise other jurisdictions on what they should do around gender budgeting.  We have some serious expertise in Ireland, particularly in the area of gender and economics but also in the area of equality and economics.  There are some heavy hitters, who could do some good on that steering committee.  We will have those conversations with the Department and we will make those suggestions to officials.</p></speech>

Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a stated that the equality budgeting initiative needed to remain focused.  What should the programme do next year?  Would the witnesses be satisfied if it were applied to the same types of areas and operated within its current limitations or must it become much more ambitious?

These are necessary practical, sensible and technical adjustments which could be easily implemented.<br/><br/>On the next steps with the metrics and indicators, it is not yet clear to what extent the indicators and metrics are connected to the pot of money available.  For this reason, it is difficult to identify what pot of money is available specific to the metrics that are identified and where this money will go.  If we are to set appropriate metrics and indicators, we need to be able to see the <i>ex ante</i>analysis to understand how the Department has assessed differential impact.  In the first instance, we need to see how Departments are assessing the way in which budgets are satisfying the needs of recipients and how the Department is probing challenges and barriers faced by target groups.  I do not see this in the document and I cannot see how these exercises will be done.  The National Women's Council of Ireland sits on the steering group and will press to have greater clarity on these matters because, as I indicated, the metrics are focused very much on performance rather than equality impact.  That is where my concern lies. </p></speech>

It is not clear what equality impact is being sought by some of these measures.  We can measure an output or metric but why the Department chose this and what it is seeking as an overall equality or gender equality outcome is not clear.  We could speculate on apprenticeships and theorise as to the reasons they are a good focus but it is not clear what the specific drive of all the Departments is with their metrics.  That is probably an important point, which may relate to the fact that this very new.  Outputs and metrics are always easier to identify, whereas the type of long-term social change needed for equality is much harder to identify.  It is almost as if this is a case of wanting to support the first step by providing a way to measure outputs.  We now need to overtly link this to an outcome we are seeking.  As Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a stated, this is a much longer-term issue which requires a type of gender expertise that is probably not yet present.  We hope this expertise is being built through the process of doing this and we would like to support that.  While linking the short-term piece with a longer-term piece over a set period is slightly frustrating, this is a process.</p></speech>

If the Minister were to ask the National Women's Council of Ireland to indicate what should be the high level metric in education and skills or if it should be apprenticeships, would the council have a view?</p></speech>

The National Women's Council of Ireland worked very closely with the Department of Justice and Equality in developing the national women's strategy.  As I stated, the strategy is more of an action plan than a strategy as it was a compilation of commitments that had already been made by Departments with regard to women's equality, gender equality, the advancement of women, etc.  That is what has been done to date under the strategy, which is fine because it is a live document.  The National Women's Council also sits on the monitoring group for the national women's strategy.  From our point of view, we are eager to see the commitments made in the strategy fulfilled.  If that were to happen, it would make a significant difference to women's equality.  The National Women's Council made a substantive submission to the consultation on the national women's strategy and our recommendations under each of the headings were probably more ambitious than what ended up being provided for in the strategy.  I expect that is fairly standard regarding the types of recommendations that social justice and advocacy organisations make and the provisions that are agreed in the long term.</p> <p>  As I stated, I am reticent about being overly critical of this initial phase of-----</p></speech>

What I am trying to figure out is where we will be on this journey in next year's budget or in five years time.  Will we still have indicators that are not ambitious and about which, in some cases, questions arise as to how they will impact on gender equality.  It is fine if we are building but will we build for next year?  The joint committee must produce a report on this initiative which will, we hope, influence the future direction of the Government, as will the steering group.  What will be the next steps?  I am not criticising what has been done because we are in a much better position than we were last year when we could not even get this issue on the agenda.  While we all welcome the initiative, we would like to know what will be the next step that will build on some of the achievements that have been made thus far.</p></speech>

The National Women's Council of Ireland is a policy and advocacy organisation and the Department is a part of government.  Our relationship with the Department is very much as one would expect it to be.  The National Women's Council has produced a significant body of work in the past 12 months aimed at influencing the Department and we are happy to be critical where necessary.  It is not necessarily the case that we do not want to be critical of the Department.  Rather, we accept that officials are in the very early stages of the process, which is key.</p> <p>  Significant efforts were made in the area of poverty proofing about ten years ago and policy proofing was pursued for a certain period before being dropped.  When we speak to officials about poverty proofing we find that political and ministerial commitment to the issue was sometimes lacking.  Moreover, it created additional work for officials who are busy.  This is one of the reasons I am reluctant to be critical at this stage.  It is important to us that the Department signed up to the process in the first instance.  I would like other Departments to engage with the process fairly quickly.  We engage regularly with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I am disappointed it has not engaged in this process.</p><p>I spoke to one of the budgetary officials who informed me that it was not directly invited to engage in the process, which I was disappointed to hear.  That would not necessarily have precluded it from engaging.  It already carries out switch analyses, for example.  The type of work it does is really appropriate for gender budgeting.  It should be involved in this pilot.  By next year, it should be engaging actively on this.  I am having those conversations with the officials.</p><p> We view this is a pilot scheme that definitely needs to be built on.  That is part of the reason we are being so encouraging about it.  If there was an equality budgeting statement, with broad and very ambitious commitments made within it by the Department and the relevant Minister, and if the Department came back next year with several high-level goals which link back to the overall goal identified in the equality statement, that would allow us to say that a range of issues are being addressed in order to achieve that equality outcome.  This would provide greater clarity.  There has to be a better sense within Departments of what is meant by different types of indicators.  The Parliamentary Budget Office is included in that as well.  It is important to know whether there are output or outcome indicators in the Revised Estimates Volume.  That issue is quite fuzzy at the moment.  We need to have much greater clarity in respect of it.</p><p> I would like to see some sort of qualitative assessment take place.  I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is seeking such an assessment.  I am also concerned with performance budgeting.  There has been a real move into quantitative analysis across the board because it is more concrete and easier to assess.  However, any equality budgeting needs to have that qualitative assessment which very clearly links each of the high-level goals back into that equality budget statement goal that has been set.  That would provide us with a greater chunk of information, a better idea of where the Government is going and how the Departments are fulfilling those commitments.</p></speech>

I note the comments on the gender equality statement Sinn F&eacute;in released last year.  We will continue to work towards that.</p> <p>  Civil Service staff have bought into the process.  It is a new process and a different way of thinking and acting.  Does the National Women's Council of Ireland offer training to staff in the different Departments?  Has that been a topic of discussion so far?</p></speech>

We occasionally receive funding, either from foundations or through Government, to carry out elements of training.  We have carried out training with the Department of Justice and Equality on unconscious gender bias, for example.  We have provided training at times, and if we received funding it is something we would be willing to do.  However, different types of training are required for officials.  Ideally, ongoing, mentoring training that officials need would be provided.  There is a commitment in the national women's strategy to build capacity among officials.  That is absolutely crucial and needs to happen as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The best means to do that is to look at what has been done in other jurisdictions and what has worked.  Ms Christina McKelvey, MSP - or, Member of Scottish Parliament - visited last year.  I do not know if she spoke before the committee.  She was invited over by Senator Higgins and the NWCI.  We presented to an early iteration of the Oireachtas Women's Caucus.  I spoke to Ms McKelvey and asked her if it would be possible for some arrangement to be made between Scottish and Irish officials.  She was speaking in a very particular capacity, but I asked her if that would be a possibility.  I also asked her if connections could be made between relevant committees in both countries in order to progress the process.  She believed that it would be possible to act on both of those suggestions.  It would make sense.  The same could be said about links between Austria and Ireland because the former has specifically connected gender budgeting into its performance management systems, which is what Ireland is seeking to do.  That is absolutely key to the success of this project.  It must be resourced.</p></speech>

I do not want to repeat what others have said.  I apologise for being late.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statements that they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  </p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p> I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with our sound system.  </p><p> I welcome all of our witnesses here this afternoon.

Of that renewable energy, 49% was from wind energy.  The next largest portion, some 39%, was from bioenergy.  Of that 39%, 25% is from biomass, 11% is from biofuels and 3% is from bio gas.  Looking at each of the sectors, it is important to see where bioenergy is used.  Some 2.3 percentage points of the 27% renewable electricity came from bioenergy, and some 5.1 percentage points of the 6.8% heat came from bioenergy.  Even though it only represents 10% of the renewable electricity it accounts for 75% of renewable heat energy.  Furthermore, almost all of the 5% renewable energy used in transport came from bioenergy.  We are seeing that the majority of bioenergy is used in the heat and transport sectors and that there has been some penetration in the electricity sector.  </p> <p>  National policy in terms of bioenergy is well set and has been laid out in the national mitigation plan, the energy White Paper and the draft bioenergy plan.  The draft bioenergy plan is undergoing a strategic environmental assessment with a view to finalising it.  All of the actions under the draft plan are being progressed.  The key projects in the electricity sector are the refit and renewable electricity support schemes.  In the transport sector there is the biofuels obligation scheme, BOS, and in the heat sector there is a new support scheme for renewable heat, which was formerly called the renewable heat incentive, RHI.  </p> <p>  We are very familiar with the REFIT 3 scheme, so I will not go into that in much detail.  The new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is currently in development.  There was a public consultation which closed in November 2017 to which there were 1,250 responses.  The design proposal for the scheme is being developed, with a final proposal to be brought to Government later this year.  The introduction of the scheme will of course be subject to state aid clearance.  </p> <p>  In the transport sector, the BOS, which has been in place for a number of years, now requires fuel suppliers to include 8% of fuel in petrol and diesel supplied in Ireland to be from biofuels.  There is some double-counting so the figure is not a full 8%.  The 8% target was introduced on 1 January 2017.  We had a public consultation which closed in January which sought views on increasing that rate to 10% from 1 January 2019 and to circa 12% from 1 January 2020.  There has been a relatively low level of indigenous biofuels used in Ireland; only 17.5% of the biofuels used in feedstock in 2016 came from indigenous sources.  As the demand increases, not just in Ireland but across Europe, the opportunity for biofuel producers in Ireland will also increase.  </p> <p>  In the heat sector, the new support scheme for renewable heat - formerly the RHI - was approved by Government in December 2017.  Two key work streams are under way at the moment.  One is the state aid process; we are at the pre-notification stage at the moment.  The other is the development of the detailed terms and conditions.  Deputies and Senators familiar with the scheme will see that we published a scheme overview which has been approved by Government on the website.  The detailed terms and conditions are being developed by SEI for review and for the approval of the Minister.  That will happen over the coming months.  </p> <p>  We are working on the issue of how the support scheme for renewable heat and the renewable electricity support scheme will work in conjunction with each other to support combined heat and power.  We are also looking at the potential for using bio methane, to be produced by anaerobic digestion and injected into the natural gas grid.  This has not been supported under the current approved support scheme for renewable heat, but we are examining the different options in terms of how that could be supported in future.  </p> <p>  This is a meeting on bioenergy, and I want to stick to that topic.  I should not leave out the fact that there is an electrification piece around heat and transport as well, which we can talk about at a point in the future.</p> <p>  Bioenergy is already playing a role, and has a role to play across all three sectors.  The State supports that through the new renewable electricity support scheme in the electricity sector, the biofuel obligation scheme in the transport sector, and primarily through the support scheme for renewable heat in the heat sector.  </p></speech>

Attending with me is Mr. Tom Bruton, who is head of policy in IrBEA and Mr. James Cogan, who is leading our new biofuel subgroup within the association.</p> <p>  IrBEA represents more than 200 members in the bioenergy space, from biomass supply to biomass technology, and in bio gas and liquid biofuels.  Bioenergy itself is one of the largest sources of renewable energy in the EU.  It has not factored so well from an Irish perspective, but the opportunities are great in that it is unique and can contribute to each of the targets, be it heat, transport or electricity.  From an economic perspective the benefits of bioenergy are large, in that over 3,600 new permanent jobs in the bioenergy sector can be created if the targets we are trying to achieve are met.  Some &euro;1.5 billion of direct investment in this sector is achievable.  Some 8,300 workers will be employed during construction and installation, and it will provide sustainable family farm incomes in the Irish agricultural sector.  The energy import bill can also be reduced by 7.5% by the provision of a secure, competitive energy source for Irish homes and businesses.  </p> <p>  The primary barriers to fulfilling bioenergy's real potential revolve primarily around the slow implementation of the support scheme for renewable heat.  We feel that state aid is currently too slow and we would like to see it open for applications for 2018.  Not enough effort has been directed towards developing bioenergy as a source of combined heat and power, and indeed district heating.  We also have the slow implementation around the RESS.  Currently it is at 22.7% and the target is 40%.  Bioenergy is factored very poorly in subsidy schemes around electricity in previous years.  There has been a lack of effort towards mobilising our indigenous biomass for these particular bioenergy markets.  There is a slow increase around the BOS, which we will use to decarbonise our transport sector.  </p> <p>  Our recommendations for the support scheme for renewable heat include the opening of applications from mid-2018, with a push to expedite the whole state aid approval process.  We would also like to see improved tariffs post-2018 for a bigger uptake of bioenergy projects.  Sustainability criteria should be in line with the renewable energy directive, RED 2.   Robust eligibility criteria is key, and there should be a simple application and approval process for projects that get off the ground.  Positive uptake will really only happen with the correct tariffs in place.  We could follow the mainland United Kingdom as a very good example of how to make that happen.  There should also be a low ongoing administration burden from that perspective.  Allowing useful heat to cover the drying of wood is a key element that we would certainly lobby for.  </p> <p>  Looking at the BOS, which applies to transport fuel, Ireland has only reached 5.2% in over ten years.  We are hoping to close the gap, with another 5% in less than three years.  That will be difficult.  There has been low development because of the low deployment rates in biofuels across the transport fleet.  Some 40% of all engine fuels are not currently included in the BOS.  One of the recommendations that IrBEA made in the consultation response to the Department in January is that that 40% should be included; it is low-hanging fruit.  Fuels in the aviation, agriculture, marine and construction sectors are not included in the BOS.</p><p>According to both the International Energy Agency and the European Commission, use of biofuels needs to grow by a factor of ten if we are to stay within the 2&deg; climate change target.  I believe we need to move to 12% biofuel.  If the UK can move, Ireland will also follow.  We will probably need to petition to the UK to make that happen.</p><p> In terms of recommendations on a RESS, we certainly need to see it implemented by 2019.  However, the state aid issue needs to be expedited.</p><p> Technology options are key for bioenergy.  We will not compete if it is technology neutral.  All renewables can play a role, but specific technology options are key for bioenergy to be successful.  Of course, that 40% baseline needs to be more ambitious.  We have modelled on the basis that 55% is achievable while still driving down the cost of electricity for consumers.</p></speech>

RECAP stands for the Renewable Energy Consumers and Producers, which was formed towards the end of last year essentially to act as a coherent contact point for the Department and other State bodies in discussing the acceleration of climate action, particularly in the area of energy.  Unfortunately, one of our members, Mr. Brian Britton, passed away last week.  I wish to put on record our thanks to him for the phenomenal energy he put into establishing RECAP.  He was one of few people who could pull together all strands of the industry.</p> <p>  RECAP members cover energy generation from all different renewable energy technologies.  We also include consumer groups.  This is in recognition that many of the foreign direct investment companies in Ireland have already signed up to the RE100, which is a commitment to source 100% of their energy from renewable sources.  We are seeing a strong demand from consumers as well as, obviously, people active in the industry.</p> <p>  Since RECAP was formed we have made submissions to the RESS consultation, the enduring connections policy and the National Planning Framework.  We continue to work proactively with a wide range of stakeholders.  Our ultimate belief is that we need to work towards a 100% renewable energy target.  It is only when we accept that this is the long-term goal that we will start to make all policy decisions and regulatory regime changes with a long-term goal in mind.</p> <p>  Over recent months we have seen a number of very positive announcements, including the climate emergency measures Bill, the commitment to the SSRH, the ending of grant aid for oil boilers etc.  We are starting to see an acceleration of very welcome activity.  We will need all these actions and more.  It has taken us 30 years to get to about 10% renewable energy.  We need to treble that over the next 12 years if we are to keep in line with our Paris commitments.  It seems like a tall order, but we have the fastest growth rates for biomass.  We have the second best wind resource in the EU, which will be the highest post-Brexit.  We have solar radiation levels similar to much of Europe.  We have a very skilled industry here capable of meeting those targets and making the necessary investments.</p> <p>  We see this as an opportunity rather than a compliance issue.  I will give just one statistic.  Over the course of the last year we imported &euro;9.6 billion of energy products, &euro;4 billion of which came from the UK, mostly in the form of oil and gas.  To put that into context, it is about the same value of all of our food and drink exports to the UK.  That gives an indication of the scale of activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Sadlier" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018022700002#F00400"><p>RECAP welcomes the ambition of EirGrid as set out in the publication, Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios.  We believe that a scenario somewhere between the "Low Carbon Living" and "Consumer Action" will materialise, requiring about 8 GW of additional renewable energy generation.  To meet our energy needs and to ensure our security of supply the deployment of a blend of technologies will be vital to deliver a sustainable energy system.  Separately we note the RESS consultation document proposed a range of RES-E scenarios between 40% and 55%.  We believe the analysis used to underpin the RESS consultation document needs to be revisited.</p> <p>  We commissioned analysis by leading consultancy firm, Baringa, to assess the total cost of renewable energy to consumers in our pursuit of more penetration on the system.  The analysis looked not just at the scale of the PSO, but incorporated the benefit and reduction in the wholesale power price.  The Baringa modelling shows that the 55% RES-E scenario can be fully cost neutral to consumers with the right blend of technologies and flexibility measures.  This effect gets even stronger under a 75% RES-E scenario.  The perception of increased cost should not be a bar to weaning ourselves aggressively off fossil fuels.</p> <p>  In the coming months we will need to define a long-term decarbonisation plan for Ireland, which shifts the narrative away from focusing only the cost of renewable energy to also advocating the benefits.  Ireland's decarbonisation plan needs to be underpinned by the socialisation of the energy system, focused on community engagement and ownership, and the removal of obstacles and project development uncertainties through long-term grid allocation planning and long-term RES option planning, both of which will attract long-term capital to the sector.  We would welcome any questions from committee members.</p></speech>

I am joined by Brendan Murphy, commercial director at Ervia, and Denis O'Sullivan, head of commercial at Gas Networks Ireland.  I appreciate the opportunity to brief the committee on the work under way by Gas Networks Ireland to reduce the carbon concentration of gas supply in Ireland and to help meet challenging 2020 emissions reduction targets.  I would like to outline to members the role that natural gas, renewable gas and Gas Networks Ireland can play in attaining those targets and in underpinning Ireland's energy security as we transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>  In the longer term, Gas Networks Ireland believes that Ireland's annual emissions, currently 61 million tonnes per annum, could be reduced by up to 17.5 million tonnes by further utilising the gas network.  Gas Networks Ireland is currently assessing or implementing many of the technologies to make this happen.</p> <p>  Natural gas is of strategic importance to Ireland, representing 30% of our country's primary energy mix.  Some 688,000 homes and businesses in 20 counties throughout Ireland depend on it every day.  Of particular importance is the demand for natural gas from foreign direct investment companies seeking to locate or expand in Ireland.</p> <p>  In starting to transition from natural gas to renewable gas, in 2018 Gas Networks Ireland will introduce renewable gas onto the Irish gas network for the first time.  Our first renewable gas-injection site is under construction in Cush, County Kildare.  It will receive gas from the anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food wastes and will have an initial capacity of 90 GWh per annum.  Over the next five years we plan to construct six additional renewable gas-injection facilities with a total combined annual capacity of 1,450 GWh.  To put it into perspective, this is enough energy to heat 145,000 homes with a 100% carbon-neutral fuel.  By 2030 we are targeting to have 20% of total gas demand met by renewable gas, a figure supported by the SEAI report.  This 20% of gas demand equates to 11,000 GWh - or sufficient renewable gas to meet the needs of every home currently using natural gas along with 50% of fuel requirements of the entire truck and bus fleet in Ireland.</p> <p>  Renewable gas also has the advantage of helping Ireland to address the emissions from our expanding agriculture sector.  Using agricultural waste will not only create a new energy source, but will also allow us to achieve our potential as a food producer while mitigating agricultural emissions.  Where renewable gas is burned in existing gas-fired power stations it will produce renewable electricity, but with minimal additional infrastructure required.  Running just two of the existing gas-fired power stations on renewable gas would increase Ireland's renewable electricity by an additional 20%.</p> <p>  In terms of natural gas in the power generation sector, Ireland has made considerable progress in the development of renewable energy, predominantly electricity.  However, this has only been possible by relying on secure, flexible and efficient natural gas electricity generators to partner intermittent renewable technologies, such as wind.  Its vital role in guaranteeing security of our electricity supply is without question, with 52% of our electricity currently produced from natural gas on an annual basis.  While considerable progress has been made in decarbonising electricity, an ambitious policy is required to ensure it meets its decarbonisation targets by 2050.  An energy policy based on replacing heavy carbon emitters such as coal and peat with cleaner natural gas, combined with greater renewable energy use, makes sense.</p> <p>  Ireland will need to reduce emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 to align with our Paris agreement commitments and European Union commitments.  Gas Networks Ireland is currently assessing carbon capture and storage, CCS, for gas-fired power generation in Ireland, which is the only technology that can reduce power generation emissions at scale, while providing Ireland with the levels of inertia and system services required.  Ireland could also achieve negative emissions in this sector by utilising our renewable gas resource with CCS, which is known as bioenergy carbon capture and storage, BECCS.</p> <p>  I now come to natural gas in the heat sector.</p><p>Of the 1.7 million occupied houses in Ireland, approximately 700,000 are heated by oil.  Unlike gas, oil-fired homes currently have no pathway to become zero-carbon homes.  Out of these homes, 300,000 are located in urban areas which already have natural gas and some 100,000 of them are actually located within 20 m of the existing gas network.</p></speech>

The RGFI represents the full supply chain of the renewable gas industry from the biogas producers, technology providers, academia, innovation and the end gas consumer.  The RGFI is consumer led and is an advocacy body for all gas consumers and for members seeking to decarbonise.  We take a consultative approach with Government agencies and Departments to find solutions and a cost-effective route to carbon-neutral pathways for decarbonising gas as a primary energy.  The core objective of RGFI is to inform policy makers and decision makers of where solutions can be found.</p> <p>  Under consumer demand and climate change obligations, approximately 60% of total heat energy consumption in Ireland is provided by gas, 80% of which is consumed by our large manufacturing and processing companies.  The ETS manufacturing processing companies operate in Ireland predominantly in two sectors, being the FDIs in agrifood and the beverage sector.  The proposed policy in the energy White Paper excluded the ETS manufacturing sectors, perhaps unintentionally, and it states that they are not accessible to the renewable support heat scheme.  This will significantly impact on competitiveness and on attracting and retaining FDI industries and jobs in this country and will severely impact the agrifood sector in its drive to decarbonise and compete internationally with its consumer products.  There are &euro;13.6 billion in exports crying out for solutions to decarbonising.  Sustainable energy is now a mandatory criterion for the majority of these companies as they look to secure new markets and competitiveness as well as retain existing employment.</p> <p>  On the potential for biomethane in Ireland, the EU has issued a report outlining that Ireland could be a net exporter by maximising the use of its own resources.  It states the wider economic and environmental benefits of utilising agri-residues, excess crops, the rotation of cash crops and cattle slurry and manures, which would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture creating a circular economy and a valuable indigenous biogas industry leading to security of supply and revenues.</p> <p>  Biomethane supply can be utilised in various sectors to decarbonise energy in heat-thermal, renewable electricity generation in CCGT, transport in the public and private sectors and HGV haulage.  The provision of renewable gas injection into the grid can utilise existing infrastructure without major capital cost and it can use existing high-efficient technology all at low cost to citizens, industry and commercial gas consumers.  The existing high-efficient use of gas can achieve efficiencies of up to 90%.</p> <p>  Business and domestic consumers make decisions on their energy sources for the long term.  By excluding renewable gas, namely, biomethane and BioLPG, in the proposed first phase of the RHSS, essentially locking out energy users from investment decisions that will fundamentally alter the market in Ireland, we will place the roll-out of biomethane and BioLPG technology in jeopardy.</p> <p>  We are proposing to Government that carbon tax be utilised to support the renewable gas industry.  Every gas consumer pays a carbon tax on gas consumption and in 2016 the Irish consumer paid &euro;126 million.  If utilised to support the renewable gas industry to roll out biomethane, it would contribute to 7% of the national gas grid's consumption.  There are opportunities in this area.</p></speech>

Mr. Brian Britton was in contact with me on numerous occasions and I wish to recognise him today.  I met with him just before Christmas and I am deeply saddened at his passing.  He is a loss to his family and friends but he is also a significant loss to this industry.  He was a pioneer, particularly of offshore wind energy.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll spoke about wind and solar.  He seems to think there are some 3,000 job opportunities in the solar sector but I think it might be more and could have a greater impact.  Many people talk about offshore wind in the Irish Sea but offshore in the Atlantic Sea is where the real resource is.  What is the timescale for harnessing offshore wind in the Atlantic Sea?  Some pilot projects have been done but certain groups believe there is a need for greater Government initiatives and to be more attractive to investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Carroll" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018022700002#G00600"><p>I agree with Deputy Dooley's point about the jobs in the solar industry, because it is not just about large-utility scale energy.  There is potential for a significant amount of rooftop panels and we have been involved in a large number of commercial rooftop schemes.  They are probably more labour intensive than other schemes so the final figure could be a multiple of the 3,000 mentioned in the report.</p> <p>  The technology for harnessing offshore wind already exists and the opportunity off the west coast is for floating platforms, in which respect a number of different technologies are already being deployed.  Japan is taking the lead in this area, along with France.  A number have been deployed off the west coast of France and a significant number are to be deployed off the coast of Japan as it looks to move away from the nuclear sector.  The barriers include the route to market and the physical grid connection and these should be looked at.  There is a suggestion in the national development plan that coal will be taken fully offline by 2025, which will free up almost 1 GW of grid capacity.</p><p>It should be an aim within that timeframe to have a significant offshore wind opportunity using at least some of the grid connection already there.  On cost, offshore cost continues to come down.  It has probably halved over the last ten years.  Prices are now about &pound;50 per megawatt hour in the most recent contracts for difference, CfD, auction in the UK.  That would have been unheard of and even people's most ambitious projections a few years ago would not have seen prices come down to that.  We can see the same here.</p><p> However, driving down the cost of delivery of renewable energy requires a scale of ambition that attracts the right level of activity in the supply chain.  One takeaway point we would make to the committee is we would encourage it to use its influence to set a very high ambition.  With that ambition, we will see more actors come into the market and that will help drive down the costs of the technology and the implementation of projects.</p></speech>

The national development plan rightly talks about electricity connection through the Celtic interconnector into France.  The witness seems to be saying we need to look at connecting to a resource that is already there for which the technologies are advancing and developing?</p></speech>

We are going to need more grid infrastructure and within the space of the next seven or eight years that grid capacity should be available.  It needs to be used to support renewable energy rather than any form of fossil energy.  It is not a technology barrier at this stage.  Siemens has estimated that, within Irish territorial waters, we have one third of the offshore energy resource in the European Union.</p> <p>  The potential for Ireland to be a massive exporter of energy exists if the right grid infrastructure is put in place.  That is the trend of most EU policy.  It wants to see generation where the resource is strongest and then, through increased interconnection between member states, to see the power flow from least cost production to consumers.  Ireland, and the west coast, has a great opportunity.  The Deputy's constituency could be looking at replicating what Aberdeen was to the oil industry and at the benefit that part of Scotland had from offshore oil.  The west coast of Ireland can get a similar benefit from offshore wind.</p></speech>

It is generally viewed as being fit-for-purpose given the level of development in terms of where we are.  However, the consultations are being examined.  The timeframe at the moment for a final report is the end of this quarter.  We would look to see something there.  On Deputy Dooley's point, offshore wind was looked at as part of the RESS economic analysis.  That was published on our website.<br/><br/>Grid is vital for any electricity infrastructure.  Cost is another element.  Studies on the REDP showed the cost levels for the east coast and the south-east coast, because of the less deep water, might be where the Ireland's initial, or only, offshore wind farm is at the moment.  However, I think that grid point is clear.  It may<b></b>not be a matter of building grid to the west coast but there are strong points of the grid on the west coast, particularly in the Shannon Estuary, but also in the Cork region.  That would need to be factored in with respect to location when looking at offshore wind.</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting that clashed with this one.  I was interested in the Siemen's report.  It said Ireland possesses one third of Europe's offshore wind energy.  It has the wind power to do that.  I heard what Mr. Brady said.  I still think other European countries that do not have nearly the same potential that we have seem to have developed a viable industry.  What are the blocks to Ireland doing that?</p> <p>  In respect of biofuels, we are way behind in using it as a renewable source.  We have relied on onshore wind and put all our eggs into that basket.  We are ignoring the wider portfolio and bioenergy in particular given our large agriculture sector.  I welcome Mr. Mike Quinn, whom I met in a previous incarnation.  I think it was about this week last year, if my memory is correct.  I express my sadness at the loss of Mr. Brian Britton.  I had the pleasure of meeting him on a few occasions and he was very passionate about renewable energy.  </p> <p>  We have failed to develop bioenergy.  I brought forward a paper on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in in January.  I welcome comments on that.  It is available to everybody online.  I refer to tapping into the huge agriculture sector, trying to use it in a more sustainable way and creating a circular economy and extra income for rural communities.  The European Commission says we should be able to export energy produced from biogas.  We need a change in Government policy to develop the energy mix.  Mr. Brady might outline what officials in the Department see as the change needed in Government policy to bring forward a strong biogas and biomass sector.  However, I refer also to other sources such as solar, which many of us have been banging the door about for a long time, geothermal energy, which has been almost completely ignored and hydro, recognising its limitations but also that other countries have made progress on that.</p> <p>  I direct this to Mr. Quinn, in particular.  I am familiar with the example at Cush.  It seems like an easy plugin.  The gas pipe is passing by between the railway line and the road.  The old Cush Inn has been bought.  The plant nearby will be bringing compressed gas to that.  It will be a great success and I look forward to it coming onstream.  However, I refer to the current haulage fleet in the State.  Second to agriculture in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is the haulage industry.  We do not want to stop the haulage industry but we need to find another alternative.  What level of production would be needed in the State to fuel that?   The other and final part of the question is: has the semi-State sector a role to play?  Briefly, what would that be in respect of developing the biomass and biogas industries?</p></speech>

I will start with the Department, if it would like to come in on those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018022700002#H01100"><p>The first one question is: what is the block to offshore wind?  Traditionally, it has been cost.  The cost differential between offshore wind and onshore wind has been significant.  That is coming down.  Internationally, we are seeing the cost of offshore wind coming down.  They are not level yet.  However, when we look at the renewable electricity support scheme, there is a proposal for a technology neutral auction so we would not necessarily be selecting technologies.  There would be an auction of whatever can bid in.</p> <p>  This committee has heard previously that there is potential for different people looking for different pots for different technologies.  I refer to looking at a segmented amount for solar, offshore wind or bioenergy.  That is an alternative approach.  Anything that moves away from that would mean potentially a higher cost for the consumer.  However, I think the main difference in terms of why offshore wind has not been a success in the past and should be in the future is that dramatic reduction in cost we have seen.</p> <p>  In respect of bioenergy, undoubtedly, we have a large potential for biogas, biomethane or renewable gas or whatever we want to call it.  There are two main items we are working on at the moment.  One is we need absolute certainty from EUROSTAT on exactly how biomethane injected into the grid will be treated in regard to our renewable energy targets and our emission reduction targets.  We need to know, from the point of view of the Exchequer if we are going to fund the scheme, exactly how that can count towards our targets.  Will it just go in and be a mix or can we direct it towards the heat sector?</p> <p>  The second point is the business case.  This is under the support scheme for renewable heat.  In order to support this, we need to put together a strong business case to show why and how we can spend Exchequer funding on biomethane injection.</p><p>That is something we are working on at present.  We have committed to the industry that we will look forward to the Budget Statement 2019 to bring that forward.   </p><p> In terms of some of the other technologies mentioned by Deputy Stanley, I have covered biogas, biomass obviously has been quite successful in the heat sector, and the support scheme for renewable heat, SSRH, should bring that along further.  In terms of solar energy, the renewable electricity support scheme , RESS, comes into play and there are questions on whether it is technology neutral or not.  We looked at geothermal energy in terms of the support scheme for renewable heat, SSRH, and included it in our economic analysis.  We found a very low take up at a comparable level of tariffs.  In terms of hydo, we have had some development in small hydro energy, as the big barrier there is probably our geography.  </p><p> On the question of freight emissions, freight emissions are around one quarter of the emissions in the transport sector, which is obviously the largest part of our emissions in the non emissions trading scheme, ETS, sector, and transport accounts for approximately 58% of non-ETS emissions.  </p><p> The movement of freight to lower emissions fuels such as compressed natural gas, Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, are rolling 14 publicly accessible filling stations, but there is also the potential for biomethane or renewable gas to be injected into the grid and be directed at transport to further decarbonise it.  That is a potential path for freight.</p></speech>

As Mr. Brady pointed out Ervia is in the process of rolling out some CNG terminals across the country.  The first one is actually in Dublin Port and it should be coming on stream in the first quarter of 2018.  We are waiting for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, CRU, to give the safety certificate.  The second terminal will be on the M7 and under what is called Project Causeway, there will be up to 14 stations in place by 2020.</p> <p>  Our plan is to roll out 70 stations by 2027.  It has got an investment of &euro;100 million.  That will supply fuel to about 5,000 commercial vehicles.  To put it in perspective, there are approximately 80,000 commercial vehicles currently on the road in Ireland today.  It can have a major impact.  If we converted more than 50% of the commercial fleet, that is buses and trucks to CNG, on fuel savings alone it would save approximately &euro;524 million over diesel and an emission saving of 270,000 tonnes of CO2.  If we use renewable gas instead of CNG, that saving grows to 1.225 million tonnes of CO2.  It is very significant. </p> <p>  It is not as if we have to invent this technology.  This technology is already being deployed.  There are 24 million CNG powered vehicles globally so it is not something we have to invent ourselves.  We will roll out existing technology.  The reason it will take time is that we have to become used to rolling out the CNG refuelling stations and the other major challenge up to now has been getting right hand drive vehicles.  A number of firms have signed up, including a waste company in County Clare is in the process of converting its waste fleet and as of Monday, 26 February, Bord na M&oacute;na will start to convert the first ten trucks to CNG as well.  It will gather traction in the next number of years.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the role of the semi-State companies.  I think the semi-State companies have a significant role to play in using biogas and biomass.  GNI has a big programme in terms of rolling out the support infrastructure for biogas.  We talked about the first injection point in Kildare, a second injection point should be going for planning permission in Mitchelstown and we hope to have ten to 12 anaerobic digestion plants generating gas that we can inject into a central agreed connection point.  GNI's role will be to provide CNG powered transport to collect the gas from the network of anaerobic digestion plants and then inject the gas directly into the grid.  We are also going to operate the Green Gas Certificate programme, which we hope will be approved by the third quarter.  We should be in a position to start providing those green gas certificates of origin for the gas injections.  We have a very significant role to play in that.  We have identified a series of networks right across the country where we will build out these injection points </p></speech>

It would be remiss not to convey some of the sense of the frustration of the Irish BioEnegy Association members around policy implementation.  The SSRH, as it now known was conceived of in 2013 and mentioned in a draft bioenergy plan in 2014.  Now we are in 2018, and the scheme is not open for applications.  No application has been made to Brussels for state aid for that scheme.  It is quite frustrating that 800 tonnes of oil are being burned every day, while that scheme is being cooked too slowly for the needs of industry.  There is an industry waiting to deliver on it and install boilers, with farmers and foresters waiting to supply crops and forest thinnings into this.  There is an urgent need to meet the 2020 target for renewable heat.  It is part of the Irish BioEnergy Association's everyday job to try to turn around to members and explain why the opportunity is not open and available in the short term.</p></speech>

I have read the presentations.  I will watch the video with interest.</p> <p>  On Mr. Bruton's final point, I attended the Bioenergy conference last week.  It is absolutely clear that the industry has been completely stymied in the past four years and it looks like it will be later than 2019 before we benefit for state aid rules.  We killed it for five years by holding out the expectation of this scheme, so that any customers will say that they will wait to benefit from that scheme, so the industry has been crippled for five years.  </p> <p>  It is still going on.  Mr. Brady will have heard me say at the Irish BioEnergy Association conference that we have just done the same to the solar industry.  The Minister comes out, stating that he will introduce a roof top scheme, sometime in the summer and in every office of every single developer in the sector, the phone goes dead.  Anybody thinking of entering a contract, thinks they should wait for that aid.  That is a mistake we must stop in terms of trying to promote what should be a thriving industry.  </p> <p>  I want to put a question to Mr. Brady, and again he would have heard me call for this, but it follows from an early presentation to the committee when Mr. Paul Kenny from the Tipperary Energy Institute made the very simple astute point that some 67% of new houses we are building, are being built with fossil fuel heating systems which in any scenario we will have to take out again in the next decade or two as we seek to meet our climate targets.  That will be at the real expense of the householders.  It is particularly frustrating when there are viable alternatives, such as solar water heating, geothermal, air heat pumps to name but a few.  Is there a prospect, Mr. Brady, that the Department will be looking at introducing regulations where we will just stop the introduction of the fossil fuel heating systems in any house?  In any industrial system, one could look at sustainable biomass for solution.  Where are we continuing to go with oil and gas, when we have biomass and other renewable alternatives?  It is the cheapest, quickest and easiest way of getting those industries back on their feet.  Has the Department considered that?  Will it consider it? </p> <p>  There are many areas I could go into, but I will focus on the future use of gas.</p><p>I read the presentation from the CEO of Ervia.  Again, on a purely climate change science basis, we have heard presentations from international authorities showing the scale of the changes we must make to comply with the Paris Agreement.  This means that we need to see an end to all fossil fuel production, particularly in the power generation sector where two thirds of energy is lost as waste heat.  This is an incredibly wasteful use of a resource we should be limiting our use of.  This brings me back to Deputy Dooley's question about the future of Moneypoint and peat-powered power stations because there seems to be no way one could justify a new gas-fired power station in Moneypoint to replace a coal-fired one.  Regarding the argument that it helps us reach the climate targets, it might help us meet it in the very short term but these plants last 30 years.  We are not going to, or cannot, use that gas plant in 30 years' time so why would we go with it, particularly at a time when, as Deputy Dooley said, we have a comparative competitive advantage in terms of very high wind speeds and a huge sea area?  Surely that should be the future of Moneypoint as a connection point for off-shore wind energy and the use of DC cables to connect to continental and British markets as a way of playing our part in what the EU looks to do now, which is creating a north-west European regional market where we ship power over long distances and across markets.  I cannot see how any rational energy approach would say we should go with gas rather than offshore wind.  There are issues around inertia.  This is a technical issue with which we must deal but I believe our engineers are capable of doing that far more quickly and more cheaply than the alternative Mr. Quinn seems to be advocating, which is that we might be able to find some CCS solution to the gas issue.  Is there any working example of a CCS plant on the scale of Moneypoint that is in any way commercially viable?  Could Mr. Quinn show me where it is working and who is developing it at scale?  I would be very interested to see where that is happening.</p><p> I am very supportive of the concept of renewable gas - getting gas from waste products, anaerobic digestion and possibly from grass - but my understanding is that at best, even if we really maximised that gas from grass potential, it might provide at a maximum roughly 25% of current gas consumption.  I understand that Ervia is now expanding its gas network in the midlands and surrounding counties.  How is that happening?  I also understood that we had really come to the end of building out our gas network and that there were no more significant commercially viable options in terms of extending our gas network.  Given that we may be facing a future where our gas supply is restricted to a renewable supply by 75% for climate change reasons, how is it that Ervia is expanding its gas network now?  Why are we looking at two new LNG terminals in Shannon and Cork, which I can only presume is to import American fracked gas, which is a threat to climate?  Why is Ervia talking about new gas-fired power stations?  How can that in any way live with the climate science reality that says we must switch from gas just as much as other fossil fuels because the carbon from it will be in the atmosphere for several hundred or thousand years and we must stop putting that carbon up there?</p></speech>

Obviously, I am trying to learn from everybody here as well.  I am not being dogmatic about this but is there not an argument that the use of biomass and biofuels can have an impact on other parts of the planet?  Alternatively, have things moved for the better?  I remember quite clearly being in Egypt prior to the Arab Spring where food poverty and food security were significant questions.  One of the things farmers spoke about was big land masses being bought up to produce biofuels for the west.  I believe this was a trigger for the Arab Spring in countries like Egypt and Tunisia.  The farmers could not grow the food they needed to eat and the cost of food shot up because there was scarcity of ordinary, proper, healthy food in the region with most of the land being taken up with the production of biofuels.  There is an ethical question here about the energy the First World uses at the expense of the Third World and indeed the greater impact of climate change on the Third World than on the First World.  I want to tease out this issue.  Is this still a concern?</p> <p>  Another issue I have come across recently because people have written to me about it is getting biomass from dumps.  Apparently, Bord na M&oacute;na has a dump in Kildare from which it extracts biomass.  What is the impact of that on the local communities and environment?  Would anyone here from the Department and elsewhere comment on that?  </p> <p>  We are trying to get all the freight carriers to move to biomass fuels but at the same time freight is responsible for more than 15% of CO2 emissions from transport.  I am old enough to remember the goods trains in the good old days that went up and down the train tracks carrying Guinness, food and fuel.  As a State, we should be trying to return to a massive reintroduction of trains as a means of transporting goods thereby getting freight carriers off the road.  This would be a big contribution to cleaning up our air and our usage of fuel.  I am more interested in the ethical arguments around biofuels.  </p></speech>

I might start with Mr. Brady.  I know Mr. Quinn was addressed and I also want to bring in Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Sadlier and Mr. Cogan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018022700002#K00500"><p>I might clarify matters in terms of the state aid application.  We are in the pre-notification phase for the support scheme for renewable heat, SSRH.  This is the period during which we discuss what our scheme is and how we plan to implement it with the Commission.  As I said earlier, there are two strands of work.  The other is the development of the detailed terms and conditions so that is part of the pre-notification period as we develop them.  I know it has not been mentioned but I might put it out there in terms of grandfathering.  This is where plants might already be up and running.  Can they avail of the SSRH?  That is part of this pre-notification process.  We would like this to be the case but it needs to be teased out with the Commission so that when we agree or disagree with it, that goes into the final official state aid application.  I assure everybody that we are working to implement the SSRH as soon as possible and that being in the pre-notification process does not mean there is a delay.  It is part of the process.</p> <p>  In respect of Deputy Eamon Ryan's points and the two thirds of new homes that are being put in with fossil fuels, we could look at it as being the glass being one third full.  Under Part L of the building regulations, all new homes and homes undergoing major renovation require a portion or an amount of renewable energy to be delivered on site.  This is generally done in two ways.  One is through solar PV panels on the roof, which is generally done in combination with a fossil fuel heating system, while the other way is in terms of heat pumps generating heating for the whole home.  We have seen a growth in the number of heat pumps over the years and this number is growing so it is positive but, yes, fossil fuel heating systems are still being put in.  At the moment, as part of the clean energy package, and I think the committee has talked about the package of measures that are moving through Europe, there is an energy performance of buildings directive that is almost at completion in Europe.  The transposition of that directive will necessitate a change to the building regulations so that would be an opportunity to revisit that and examine whether it should be further changed.  The building regulations in many ways constitute the stick stating what people must do.  The carrot in terms of fossil fuels has been removed in terms of the recent changes to the better energy homes scheme whereby grants are no longer being offered to retrofit or put in new oil or gas boilers so there is definitely a direction of change there.  It may not be as fast as the Deputy would like but it is certainly a move in that direction.  </p> <p>  With regard to gas, Moneypoint and climate change targets, I would like to clarify, although people may already be well aware, that our renewable energy target is across the entire energy sector whereas our national emissions reduction target is only in the non-ETS sector.  Electricity lives in the ETS sector so whatever the future of Moneypoint and peat stations is and whether they convert to gas or full renewables, I want to be very clear that this would not impact our national emissions reduction target.  That is important.</p></speech>

When there are negotiations on fines or how we are doing, will there be cognisance taken or recognition of what we do on the emission trading system, ETS sector?  In terms of national security, competitiveness and economic benefits, we should not just sanitise the whole ETS sector and say it is nothing to do with us; it is some market thing.  We can make strategic decisions.  It would help us in Europe in the wider negotiations if we were doing really well in the ETS by providing renewable power to the rest of Europe by switching away from fossil fuels.  That will help us in our broad policy approach.</p></speech>

I want to make sure that people understand that when we hear about the non-ETS target, against which we are measured very strictly, that issues around Moneypoint or peat are not necessarily part of that conversation.  Undoubtedly, it has a part to play in terms of the overall national policy position on 2050 and decarbonising the whole energy system.  In Europe, if one is out of line in one area but in line in others, it can only help.</p> <p>  On Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's points on environmental impact, there is considerable concern about biomass and biofuels and the impact on land use.  An amendment to the renewable energy directive was brought in called the integrated land use change directive.  It put a cap on the amount of energy from biofuels that countries can count towards their renewable energy target.  That cap is 7%.  A key part is that we cannot just say that we will decarbonise transport by putting in more and more biofuels.  We can do it but we are only allowed to count up to 7% when those biofuels come from food or feed-based crops.  There are strict sustainability criteria in the renewable energy directive and they are getting stricter.  It is a topic which is live and is being addressed by European legislation.</p> <p>  The point was made about removing waste from dumps.  We are entering a phase where we are viewing waste as a resource.  We are seeing the Dublin waste-to-energy facility is generating energy from waste and hopefully, in time, heat via district heating.  I do not have any information on what is being done locally.  Anything would have to pass the standard environmental tests and planning regulations.  </p> <p>  I want to be clear about some of the figures I gave for trains and freight.  More than 50% of our emissions in the non-ETS sector are from transport, within which about one quarter are from freight and half are from cars.  There is potential for converting freight to trains, but it generally works where one is transporting goods over a very long distance or when one is transporting goods from a particular point to a port.  We use freight for wood, principally down to the south east, and have trains running from one of the mines.  Our current freight fleet is very dispersed.  While converting it to rail has merit, it does not have significant potential. </p></speech>

Deputy Ryan correctly pointed out that there is decision on inertia around the 400 kV line that comes out of Moneypoint.  The Government has stated that Moneypoint will be retired at 2025 and a decision will be made around 2020 or 2021 on this.  I have not seen any scenario where conventional generation does not supplement renewables up to 2050.  I am not sure of the case after 2050 but until then there has to be a base load alongside renewables.  Ireland has been very successful in that and we are at 55% at present but we still need gas.  One example that we looked at in 2016 when the wind dropped to 1% on one day and the slack was taken up by the combined cycle gas turbine, CCGT, plants and it went as high as 73% of energy in a particular day.  We need that fast response from the CCGTs.  My colleague will touch on the carbon capture and storage, CCS, generally.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to the Bord na M&oacute;na biogas facility in Drehid, County Kildare.  That gas was being flared before we put in the landfill gas engines.  It is from organic waste which generates gas when it decays, which we now use as fuel for four engines which provides power to 8,000 houses.  That will change over time, however.  The majority of household waste goes to the waste-to-energy plant in Poolbeg.  Changes in legislation that are being brought in regarding the brown bin organic waste-----</p></speech>

There are several successful carbon capture and storage plants operating in Canada and the US.  One plant in Canada is producing 115 MW of electricity and they are capturing roughly 92% of the carbon coming off the plant.  Ireland has a unique opportunity, in that we have a lot of the infrastructure in place already in Cork with a gas field that is coming out of service.  It is a low-pressure gas field, which is a distinct advantage in terms of the cost of storing the carbon.</p> <p>  More generally, as Mr. Quinn observed, there is no scenario where gas is not involved in power generation for the foreseeable future, until 2050 and perhaps beyond that.  That being the case, we should use the opportunities there to capture the carbon from the natural gas while it is there and being used.  The potential for carbon reduction or carbon emissions during that period is very significant.  We have that opportunity to capture the carbon and store it back into the gas fields from which it originated.  </p></speech>

Extensive surveys have been conducted which showed there was nothing suitable there.  We have a fleet of modern gas plants, often quite young, some of which we are now switching off because we cannot pay the capacity payments or they did not win in the bidding system.  The idea of building new gas plants when we are shutting others down is unusual.</p> <p>   Regarding the Canadian plant, what is the average price per kWh of power produced?</p></speech>

It should, could and would have a place but I hear no international expert or have seen no major report which currently thinks that it is viable or that there is any sign of it becoming viable in coming decades.  At a time when we could be connecting with the Continent to provide that balancing power supply and developing our renewables, I think it will go 100% renewables.  I do not think that we will burn gas in the future, I do not think that our climate will be able to take it.  The key reason why carbon capture and storage is not working is not ideological; it is just not economic.  It is nowhere near it.  It is twice or three times the price of the renewable alternatives, which will kill it for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

We need to understand and realise as a community, as policy makers, Government and semi-State agencies, that electrification of biomass will not address the matters and the urgency required to decarbonise manufacturing and processing industries such as those represented by the gentlemen beside me from Diageo and Dairygold.  Other foreign direct investment companies and the biopharma, biomedical, medical, ICT and IT sectors, as well as the data centres with which we are all familiar, have been criticising the Irish Government for its lack of energy policy.  It is critical that we understand that we need to talk about an energy mix.  Electrification is not the solution for manufacturing and processing.  I note that 60% of the energy demand in Ireland is from thermal, that is, gas, of which 80% is consumed by our pillar industries in the manufacturing and processing sector, which is the employment backbone of this country, and in the agrifood sector, which accounts for &euro;13.6 billion in exports.</p><p>It would be unfair to discount the merits of renewable gas and biogas in terms of the opportunity to decarbonise agriculture, assist rural Ireland in having a place in the future and decarbonise energy, as renewable gas can.</p><p> On the EUROSTAT, we are positively disposed to working with the Department and Europe and there have been some recent developments in that regard, which we welcome.  This is part of our consultative approach with the Government and Europe in addressing these regulatory barriers.  It is important to understand that the green gas certification project being rolled out by the renewable gas industry and other industry participants will capture, verify and validate what is being done about greenhouse gas emissions.  It will be 100% accountable, fully auditable and transparent.  The gas industry is highly and fully regulated.  We can fully account for what we are producing, which offers value for money to the end consumer and is sustainable.</p></speech>

As I stated, we need to move the narrative away from the cost of renewable energy and toward focussing on its benefits, including security of supply, sustainability and economic benefits.  The industry across all technology is going through an unprecedented reduction in cost and efficiency.  Our nearest neighbour has experienced a twofold reduction in the cost of delivering offshore since 2013.  It established its offshore programme with the average price approximately &pound;120 per megawatt hour but is now delivering offshore wind at approximately &pound;55 per megawatt hour.  However, it got there by creating the environment and ambition to establish supply chains and operational maintenance hubs.  It is now delivering offshore wind in the UK for 30% less than we can from onshore.  That price differential goes to the economic modelling for the wholesale power price which accompanied our submission to the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, consultation in respect of the reduction in energy price on capital costs.</p></speech>

The targets for renewable energy and transport for 2020 are 10%, while Ireland is currently just over 5%.  That number diminishes because some of it is double counting, so it is notional rather than real progress.  Ireland is one of the least ambitious countries in Europe in terms of meeting the target.  In terms of targets for 2030 because 2020 is around the corner and we seek continuity and growth in ambition, the European Council is currently proposing legislation for 2030 which would cut the 10% down to 3.5% in real terms.  Nominally, it is 14% but half of that is optional - optional directives are curious to consider - and the remaining 7% is double counted, with half being notional, so in real terms it is 3.5%.  That shows that there is a cohort of countries, including Ireland, in Europe which advocates a much reduced obligatory ambition for renewables and climate progress in transport.  This begs the question of whether Ireland is prepared to be ambitious on its own even though the European Union has reduced its level of ambition or if it will stay within the maximum obligation that Europe imposes.  I hope that gives members some context of where we are going.</p> <p>  As regards Deputy Smith's question on whether or not biofuels have created food security issues around the world and, specifically, in Europe, it is a very legitimate question which has been debated up and down the street over the past ten years in Europe.  Not a single drop of biofuel imported into the European Union comes from a region or area that presents concerns such as those raised by the Deputy.  I am more than happy to meet her and go through that in detail.  Most biofuel used in Europe is biomass produced by European farmers.  European farmers are a superpower in terms of their ability to produce such crops and forms of biomass.  The volumes required to make progress in climate progress and transport are tiny compared with the capacity of European farmers, with the notable exception of palm oil diesel, which is a rotten apple that all biofuels and bioenergy producers should be keeping out of the barrel.  Unfortunately, it is not firmly out of the barrel.</p></speech>

The offshore storage, platforms and pipes are there.  The only facility that would need to be installed is the carbon capture piece at the existing power stations which are adjacent to the pipeline heading offshore.  As I stated, &euro;85 per megawatt hour is the figure used in the UK or that came out of the UK report.  We believe the cost to be less than that in the Irish context and we have done some research on the matter which I am happy to discuss with members.</p></speech>

They are very welcome to the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  The D&aacute;il referred the affordable child care Bill 2017 to our committee on 1 February.  Today's meeting of the select committee will consider the Bill on Committee Stage and report back to the D&aacute;il.  Before proceeding with the business, I remind members and those in the Public Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off completely or to aeroplane mode for the duration of this meeting as they interfere with our broadcasting systems.  Even when on silent mode they tend to do so.</p> <p>  I also remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the officials from her Department.  In advance of the Minister's opening statement, I wish to bring a matter of correspondence to the attention of the committee and the Minister because it relates to Scouting Ireland.  As the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte and I will be aware, this matter entered the public domain at the end of last week.  All three Members of the Oireachtas present made statements to express concern about the matter.  I wish to bring it to members' attention that I received correspondence from Scouting Ireland's chief executive officer, Dr. John Lawlor, yesterday and have had conversations with him since.  I have formally requested, with the agreement of members of the committee, to write to Scouting Ireland and request a copy of its child protection procedures for the consideration of this committee.  I have no doubt but that this will also be circulated to the Minister.  I will make arrangements for this letter to be circulated to all members of the committee because it is addressed to me as Chairman of the committee.  I just wanted to put that into the public domain.  Whether we consider requesting Scouting Ireland to come before us is a matter which we can consider at a later date.  While we do not have compellability powers in respect of Scouting Agency as an organisation, I have spoken with the organisation and Dr. Lawlor indicated he would not be averse to attending to discuss the matter in the future.  I understand matters are under investigation within the organisation.  This is no secret; Dr. Lawlor himself has put it on the public record.  Therefore, we would not wish to pre-empt or predetermine any of these matters but I wanted to put that on the record for the members present because I was not able to reach a number of members last week.  I was out of the country on business pertaining to another committee.  I think that concludes that part.</p></speech>

When I introduced the Bill to the House on Second Stage I was very grateful for the strong support I received from all sides of the House and the very constructive tone contained in all suggestions made.  I acknowledge and thank Deputies and the Chairman for their support of the Bill and especially for the detailed attention they have given to preparing amendments.  In particular, I note in advance that I am pleased to accept in principle an amendment to Schedule 2 to the Bill on the purpose of referrals for child care support from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Similar amendments on the issue were proposed by Deputies Rabbitte, Mitchell and Funchion.  We can discuss the detail later in the meeting but I want to signal at the outset that I accept the amendments in principle and I thank the Deputies for their valuable contribution.</p> <p>  I also want to signal in advance that I plan to propose a small number of further amendments on Report Stage.  These amendments will principally involve minor changes to the Child Care Act 1991 to facilitate the registration of school-aged child care services with Tusla.  As such, they result from my announcement last December that I planned to introduce the regulation and registration of school-aged child care providers during this year in order that these providers can take part in the affordable child care scheme at the outset.  To achieve this outcome, I plan to propose a number of amendments to the definition of school-aged services, which are set out in the Child Care Act 1991, so as to clarify more precisely the scope of such services and to expand the definition to include children up to 15 years of age.  The definition is currently limited to primary school children, and the proposed amendment will ensure it aligns instead with the age limit of 15 years as set out in the affordable child care scheme.</p> <p>  The introduction of school-aged child care regulations will also have knock-on implications for the exemptions from registration for childminders, which are also set out in the Child Care Act at section 58L.  Therefore, I intend to propose two related amendments to section 58L to ensure unintended consequences for childminders do not arise.  At the same time, I want to confirm that all registered childminders will be eligible to participate in the affordable child care scheme.  We will not only seek to maintain but to grow over time the number of registered childminders.  The report of the expert group on childminding, which I commissioned, was submitted to me last month and will be published by the group shortly.  I intend to develop an action plan setting out short, medium and long-term actions in response to the report to support the childminding sector on a path towards registration.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which clarify the definitions of &quot;civil partner&quot; and &quot;cohabitant&quot; are required by virtue of the fact that the definitions of &quot;civil partner&quot; and &quot;cohabitant&quot; in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 are implicit in the sections of the Act to which the amendments refer, rather than explicit.  </p><p>Amendment No. 6 to section 6 relates to the outsourcing arrangements for the school scheme administrator.  While subsection (1) of amendment No. 6 allows outsourcing of functions conferred on the scheme administrator, subsection (2) specifies that these functions may include the making of payments.  However, in subsection (2) there are no particular specified payments to which &quot;the payments&quot; refers.  Amendment No. 6, which is purely a drafting amendment, therefore, proposes to delete the word &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>Amendment No. 22 is also a technical drafting amendment to provide clarity that the child to whom the paragraph refers is the child for whom an application is being made for financial support under the scheme.</p></speech>

While those two points in time are critical, as the definition of a couple determines whose income is assessed when an application is made the current wording omits any reference to the timing of reviews under section 17.  If a couple separates after the time they were awarded a subsidy and the applicant then seeks a review of the income, it is the applicant's current status as a lone parent that should matter and not his or her status at the time the application was made, namely, when they were still a couple.  By deleting any reference to points in time the proposed amendment ensures that the definition will apply at all relevant times.</p></speech>

While references to communications throughout the Bill refer to communications in writing or by electronic means, the references to contracts in sections 6 and 8 refer only to agreements in writing.  They do not, therefore, allow for the possibility of contracts that are solely held in electronic form and signed by means of a certified digital signature.  To allow for this possibility and to ensure consistency in the approach throughout the Bill, amendments Nos. 5 and 9 delete the words &quot;in writing&quot; and as a result, a contract would be described simply as an agreement.  </p><p>At a practical level, I would note that current contracts in place between my Department and child care providers are solely in electronic form.

The wording in the published Bill does not allow for this possibility as it implies that applicants may not apply for financial support if they are benefitting from free child care under section 14 in respect of any child.  The amendment therefore proposes to address what is effectively an unintended consequence.</p><p> Amendment No. 26 relates to section 15(2)(d), the purpose of which is to stipulate that section 14 referrals for child care are an alternative route to support under the scheme.  There is no need for subsidised child care in cases where a referral for free child care has already been made.  Amendment No. 26 is needed to ensure that, in cases where one parent benefits from free child care as a result of a referral under section 14, the other parent of the child can still apply for financial support under the scheme in the normal way, particularly if the parents are separated and each has care of the child at different times of the week.  In other words, while one parent to whom the section 14 referral applies cannot apply for financial support in the normal way, the other parent can apply for financial support on his or her own behalf in the normal way.  The amendment therefore proposes to address any unintended negative consequence that could arise for the second parent in this example as a result of a referral arrangement being in place.</p></speech>

I certainly agree with their intentions and sentiment but the aim of the proposed amendment is effectively already provided for in the Bill and as a result, I am not accepting the amendment.  Let me explain.  The definition of &ldquo;childcare services provider&rdquo; in section 1 is a "provider of a pre-school service or a school age service whose name is entered in the register of prescribed early years services established and maintained in accordance with section 58C of the Child Care Act 1991".  Every childminder registered with Tusla is named on the register established under section 58C of the 1991 Act and is therefore already included within the definition of "childcare services provider" for the purposes of this Bill.  Every childminder registered with Tusla who signs a contract with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs under section 8 of this Bill would therefore be an approved child care services provider for the purposes of the scheme.  While I am pleased to assure the Deputies that the Bill will allow all registered childminders to take part in the affordable child care scheme - which is what I am indicating - I am also conscious that very few childminders are currently registered with Tusla.</p><p>The Deputy is aware than in 2016 I established a working group to examine future options for the regulation and development of childminding.  The working group, which was chaired by Childminding Ireland, submitted its report to me on 15 January.  I subsequently met representatives of the working group.  Following that very positive meeting, my Department is currently considering the report with a view to developing an action plan setting out short, medium and long-term actions.  </p></speech>

When I read the Bill it was not clear to me that it included childminders.  Including the measure will not increase costs.  We will call a vote on the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 11 relates to section 9, which sets out the information which must be included in an application for financial support.  Section 9(f) requires information on the child's stage in the education system as it is necessary to determine how the hours of child care support will wrap around the hours of school or the ECCE preschool programme.  This amendment changes the language from the class the child attends at school and whether he or she participates in preschool to the class in which the child is enrolled at school and whether he or she is enrolled in preschool.  The change ensures consistency with language to be used elsewhere in the Bill through the proposed amendments to section 13 and provides clarity that it is a child's enrolment in a class which matters, rather than a child's attendance as attendance may vary, for example, as a result of illness.</p><p>The amendment also adds a reference to preschool programmes funded by the Minister for Education and Skills as some children take part in the Early Start programme that is funded by the Minister for Education and Skills, rather than the early childhood care and education, ECCE, preschool programme.  </p><p> Amendment No. 32 relates to the wording of Schedule 2 on HSE referrals, which is intended to allow for section 14 referrals for children who need child care on developmental grounds, who are too young to benefit from free provision either through the ECCE preschool programme or the Early Start programme and who would otherwise not attend a child care service.  This amendment is consequential to the amendments to section 13, which seek, effectively, to future-proof the legislation for possible future changes to ECCE rules as a result of which parents could be given flexibility to choose when to take up the ECCE entitlement.  To provide this flexibility, instead of referring to the qualifying age for participation in the ECCE, the amendment refers to whether a child is enrolled in a preschool programme either the ECCE preschool programme or the Early Start programme.  The upper age limit of four years for HSE referrals reflects the two-year entitlement to the ECCE preschool programme and the compulsory school starting age of six years old.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are minor technical drafting amendments.  They amend section 9, which specifies the process by which parents may make applications for financial support under the scheme and the details they must provide.  One such detail is the name and address of the parent's employer or education and training provider, as appropriate.  However, the word &quot;education&quot;, which is included in the reference to an employer or education and training provider in section 10, is accidentally omitted in similar references in section 9.  These amendments simply rectify that omission.  </p><p>Unfortunately, following submission of the list of amendments for Committee Stage, a third such omission was identified in the phrase &quot;employer or training provider&quot; in section 9(4)(c).  I hope to correct that by proposing a similar minor technical amendment on Report Stage.</p><p>Moving to amendments Nos. 14 and 30, they both relate to the verification of identity and allow for the inclusion or reference to children alongside existing references to the applicant and his or her partner.  The Bill already allows for the possibility of checks to confirm that an application does not involve fraud or misrepresentation and such checks may involve checks on the identity of the applicant and the applicant's partner.  These two amendments would allow the possibility that such checks may include the identity of children who have been named in the application.</p></speech>

A lone parent in training represents 100% of the workforce in that house and for that person to engage and get back to employment, there is a space in which they would need additional support.  I submitted the amendment to ensure that lone parents would be mandated and that there would be a practice in place to support them to get back into employment or to further education.  I was trying to get a balance between finishing training and getting back into the workforce.  It is unfortunate it has been ruled out on Revenue grounds.  I would have like to have seen it accepted.  A good deal of the conversation that took place in the past 18 months on the affordable child care Bill was around the most vulnerable and those who need to get back into a particular pathway of self-development for themselves and in terms of the workforce.  Lone parents and Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK, would have lobbied me on that and it is regrettable that the Department has not seen its way to including it.  I would love to hear the Minister's explanation as to the reason it has been ruled out.</p></speech>

In that case, from my perspective, given the nature of what Deputy Rabbitte is trying to achieve in her amendment, I wonder whether a definition change within the Bill enabling the Intreo scheme, although obviously in a different Department, might resolve the issue the Deputy has highlighted and whether that might be considered because it is an eligibility matter.  I would agree broadly with the sentiment of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  It is out of order.  We are discussing the section, but I would ask that it is something the Minister might consider with her Cabinet colleague.</p></speech>

Clearly, he would be aware of that in light of the fact that as the Minister who is both the sponsor of the scheme and now the Bill, with a focus on those who have the least resources or are in situations where they require a significant amount of support in terms of child care - lone parents being one of the clearest examples of that - there is a need to provide them with the maximum support possible to ensure they get back to work or training.  I appreciate the intention of the amendment.</p> <p>  The Bill, as the Chairman said, gives the Minister the power to make regulations specifying definitions of "work" and "study".  I will be defining "work".  It will include within the definition not only employment and self-employment but also State-sponsored labour market activation programmes, in which lone parents would no doubt be participating in many instances.  I expect that any lone parent taking part in an Intreo employment activation scheme who is eligible for financial support will be awarded the maximum of up to 40 hours of support.  In addition, given their expected income level, a lone parent on such a scheme typically would be awarded the highest rate of subsidy per hour.  My initial point is that they will more than likely receive the highest level of subsidy and support during that period of time.</p> <p>  I appreciate the intention of the question.  I could also indicate, as we may get to in some of the other amendments, that within the Bill we would be reviewing the operations of the scheme after a certain period of time.  This may be one to which it might be helpful to bring a focus.</p></speech>

She said she may periodically review the impact of the affordable child care scheme on lone parents.  This, in particular, is what I seek.  I will withdraw my amendment but that is not to say that, between now and Report Stage, I will not decide to come forward with another amendment or proposal on lone parents.  The Chairman has made a valuable point on the focus on job activation in respect of lone parents.  With Intreo, there has to be some means by which matters cannot be left to chance.  The phrase "more than likely" is not good enough for me.  I need to ring-fence and protect.</p></speech>

Thus, someone who has engaged in training or further education might be put on the right path, with the support.

These amendments address situations when a forthcoming change in circumstances is known in advance.  For example, the children's dates of birth will be specified in the application form.  It will, therefore, be known in advance when a change in a child&rsquo;s age will result in a change to the level of financial support.  These amendments provide clarity that the initial determination of the amount of financial support to be provided over the next 12 months can include references to known changes in that amount.  It should be noted that the Bill already allows for the amount of subsidy to be changed when the applicant notifies the scheme administrator of a change in his or her circumstances at the time the change of circumstances occurs.</p></speech>

The provision is intended to support families to get out of poverty through labour market participation by enabling full-time child care whenever a parent is engaged in work or study and ensuring, at the same time, that a certain level of child care support is available for all families regardless of labour market situation.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 23 will permit exemptions to be made to this work-study test in prescribed situations where the applicant or the applicant's partner is unavailable to care for a child for reasons unrelated to work or study by allowing the possibility of full-time child care support in those situations.  Examples of situations which may be prescribed include situations in which an applicant's partner is in prison or hospital in the long term.  In such cases, the applicant's partner will not satisfy the definitions of work or study but the applicant should still be eligible for full-time child care support if he or she is engaged in work or study.  To provide for this possibility, amendment No. 23 requires the Minister to have regard to the unavailability of the applicant or his or her partner to care for the child and amendment No. 21 enables the Minister to make regulations defining the meaning of the term &quot;unavailable&quot; for the purposes of the scheme.</p><p>In addition to the above amendment, I intend to undertake focused research in the coming months on the work-study test, the exemptions proposed in these amendments and their potential collective impact in disadvantaged communities.  This research will inform the regulations to be made under section 13.  In particular, the work will inform the definitions of &quot;work&quot; and &quot;study&quot;, the situations in which the exemptions from work and study test will apply and both the standard and enhanced hours of child care subsidy to be provided.</p><p>In addition, amendment No. 23 also addresses the way in which the scheme will wrap around the ECCE preschool programme and school hours.  Section 13(6)(c) of the Bill requires the Minister when making regulations on the hours of financial support available to have regard to the period of time each week the child qualifies to participate in pre-school programmes.  This wording is consistent with current ECCE rules in which eligibility for ECCE is determined simply by the child's age.  It would also be consistent with certain changes to ECCE rules, including those planned for this coming September, which will create two full years' of entitlement.  However, it is important to further future-proof the legislation to accommodate potential changes to the ECCE rules to offer parents some flexibility around choosing when to take up an ECCE entitlement.  This possibility would require the affordable child care scheme to wrap around ECCE from the time the child is actually enrolled in that programme rather than from a single age at which the child qualifies for ECCE.  In order to allow for this possibility, amendment No. 23 seeks to require the Minister to have regard either to eligibility to enrol in ECCE or to a child's actual enrolment in ECCE.</p><p>As to school hours, the amendment requires the Minister to have regard both to enrolment in school and to eligibility to enrol in school.  Enrolment is relevant to children aged four and five years for whom school is not compulsory.  Once children have reached the compulsory school age of six years, the affordable child care scheme will wrap around school hours for all children.  As such, it is eligibility to enrol in school that matters.</p><p>I must also stress that these are technical amendments.  They do not alter the policy of the affordable child care scheme itself, rather they future-proof the scheme so that it is sufficiently flexible to wrap around ECCE in both its current format and in future potential scenarios.</p></speech>

I support the amendment.  We might seek to get an assessment from the Minister as to how she herself plans to kick the tyres of the scheme, one might say, using quantitative and qualitative methods to ensure the legislation is working.  I am not sure but I suggest that six months might be too short a timeframe, although I have an open mind on that.  Will the Minister give us an idea how she plans to kick the tyres on her own legislation?</p></speech>

Deputy Sherlock has put it well.  We must test the legislation to see how robust it is and whether it needs to be tweaked, and see what we might learn from the results.  It will be two years before the affordable childcare scheme is up and running in its entirety.  Checks and balances are good.  If there was more checking and balancing featured in legislation as it came before the Houses, we might learn a lot.  As this work is monumental in the area of child care and its future provision, I favour checking it as it goes along and tweaking it, making amendments where needs be, and learning from the good parts.  To continuously review it under a timeframe, whether it is six or 12 months, is good practice.</p><p>I compliment Deputies Funchion and Mitchell.</p></speech>

I recognise and agree with the need to review the operation of the scheme once it is established.  I believe that there is an allowance for that review incorporated into the Bill as it stands.  It will take place.  My primary concern about the amendment is that the six month time period is too short to practically ensure that it is done well, that it is relevant and that we can get the appropriate data required in order to ultimately make a decision.  We need to have a review of the operation.  Section 25 provides for a review of the operation of the scheme at any time, and for reports on such reviews to be made to the Oireachtas.  In addition, Standing Order 164A requires me to carry out a review of the functioning of the legislation 12 months after its enactment and to lay that review before the Oireachtas as well.  I believe 12 months is a more appropriate time than six months because of all of the aspects that are required to be reviewed in the context of section 13.  Initially it will be a good opportunity to review it and find out what the impact of section 13 - and its associated regulations - has been, in the context of the overall operation of the legislation.</p> <p>  I am concerned that a review of the scheme six months after its roll-out would not give enough time to let the scheme bed in.  It would not allow enough time for reliable and useable time series data to be generated which could inform any necessary changes to the scheme.  In short, we would lack the evidence to make an evidence-informed policy decision.  I intend to carry out a full evaluation of the operation of the scheme once it has been running for a sufficient period of time.  For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The reason I wanted to extend it is that when a child is embedded in a particular environment and some time has passed, they have made friends and key developmental milestones are being reached.  They have stability and friendships have been garnered.  I was looking at what was best for the child.  Sometimes we have to forget about the financial side of things and consider what is best for the child.  The fact is that we are talking about two and half, three and a half and four and a half year olds.  If those children were placed and settled for more than three months it would be unsettling to remove them from that environment.  I know that there is a financial implication and that is one of the reasons it has been ruled out.  I was considering what is best for the child.  I know the Minister also is focused on what is best for the child.</p><p> I tabled my amendment because I wanted to ensure that children could finish a term.  Even if the period is not as long as three months, I would like children to finish the session at the next definite break - be it the mid-term break, Christmas or Easter - and thus not feel like they had left something behind.  Does my explanation make sense?  I hope I have been clear.</p></speech>

I support Deputy Rabbitte.  I am aware of one facility in my constituency where children are admitted to the after-school care programme when they are only a few months old and right up to the age of nine.  The Deputy wants to ensure that such care is continued and that any transition is as seamless as possible, which I support.  I would like to hear the Minister's ideas, knowledge or wisdom on the matter.  It would very useful to make the transition less onerous for the people concerned.</p></speech>

I very much agree with their intentions, objectives and the sentiments they have expressed.  How Deputy Rabbitte articulated, at length, her concerns and rationale for ensuring that a process of providing support and care for the children, particularly in the context of section 14, must be done in a way that is child-centred and supports the child was very helpful.  It is really helpful for the remarks made by the Deputies to be on record as we move towards enacting the Bill.  The reason I say so is because these are procedures that relate to the referrals by statutory bodies under section 14.  They will be dealt with in the agreements to be made with each body.  These agreements will include the criteria and duration for referrals.</p> <p>  I recognise the value of a graduated withdrawal of supports for families who are in need of additional child care support.  Again, I suggest that the Bill already provides the flexibility to provide for this through the referral procedures to be agreed with each relevant statutory body.  For example, a referral could provide for a full 12 months of support, which could then be renewed for a further 12-month period, if required.  In addition, the current schemes operate on a year-by-year basis and are renewed each September but the affordable child care scheme will operate on a rolling basis.  Most successful applicants will receive a 12-month award, at whatever time they apply, to be renewed 12 months later.  However, referral agreements will be flexible enough to allow an alternative duration for referrals, which may vary between different statutory bodies.</p> <p>  I will not accept the amendment because the principle of it will be dealt with in the agreements negotiated with the individual statutory bodies.  We will ensure that there will be a child-centred approach in the agreements under section 14.</p></speech>

In terms of section 14(1) and Schedule 2, the agreements will be made with each of the following entities: the local authorities; the HSE; the Child and Family Agency, CFA; the Minister for Justice and Equality; and the Minister for Education and Skills.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has said that the flexibilities which need to be added to the scheme will be negotiated with the listed entities.

I am winding on from where I started when I sought financial support for a child to remain in the child care services for a period of three months to a proposal that he or she remain until there is a natural break in the cycle.  In the child care setting it is all about the ritual from Halloween, Christmas parties, the spring break to Easter.  There is a sense of completion and finality in remaining until the end of term and not leaving at the end of a week.  I know that it is a 38 week cycle.  I am not looking for a child to remain for the total cycle but to finish when there is a natural break.  We all know of the psychological impact of achievement which enables families to say they finished the term, as opposed to walking away mid-stream which in the long term has a detrimental effect.</p><p> I will withdraw the amendment, but I will be looking to see what the Minister will do to address the issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We all know that child care centres operate at different hours from the regular workplace.  This minor amendment to the section proposes that authorised officer conduct inspections during reasonable working hours.  We think it is respectful of the staff who work in child care centres and hope the Minister will accept it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2018022700002#Q01300"><p>The phrase &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; in relation to the ability of authorised officers to enter premises for the purposes of carrying out an inspection is the standard wording.  Section 55(1) of the Child Care Act 1991 contains this wording to allow an authorised person, a Tusla preschool inspector, to enter at all all reasonable times any premises where a registered preschool service is being provided.  While I envisage "all reasonable times" normally being interpreted as implying working hours or "during reasonable working hours" as stated by the Deputies in their amendment, it is still important to provide for the possibility, even if it very unlikely to occur that an authorised officer will need to have access at very short notice to a premises where child care records are kept.  For example, it might come to the attention of an authorised officer that there is a case of suspected fraud and that there is a possibility that the person in possession of the records might seek to destroy them.  That is the reason I am not proposing to accept the amendment.</p><p>I do not anticipate that would happen very often, if at all, but at the same time if we took the amendment in the names of Deputies Mitchell and Funchion "during reasonable working hours", there would be no possibility, should there be a suspicion, or a need to check outside of reasonable working hours for the authorised officer to be able to do so.</p></speech>

Perhaps there is such a provision already in the Bill, however, we tabled the amendment on the off chance that there was no such provision.</p></speech>

Any existing regulations in this regard, both Irish and European, will be complied with as a matter of course.</p> <p>  This is the crucial part.  As both Irish and EU data protection regulations, including the EU general data protection regulation, which will come into force in May 2018, will have the force of law, there is no need to require adherence to them in this Bill.  Indeed, there is a risk that if we were to do so, we might unintentionally imply that these regulations have less force in other statutory contexts than they do in the context of the affordable child care scheme.</p> <p>  Let me assure the Deputies that my Department continues to work closely with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that the scheme will meet all general data protection rules, GDPR requirements and a data protection strategy has been developed and as part of that a privacy impact assessment has been undertaken.  The peer review group, reviewing the business case for the scheme's IT system has commended my Department in this regard.</p> <p>  We are really focused on the issues.  Section 23(5) specifically requires me to consult with the Data Protection Commissioner before making regulations on the processing of personal data in relation to the scheme.  I am suggesting that the amendment is already provided for in law and that is why I am not accepting it.</p></speech>

I will consult with the Attorney General's office on the precise wording to be adopted and I hope the Deputies will appreciate that.   We will then propose an amendment on Report Stage along the lines which the Deputies have suggested.  The proposed amendment is, of course, in line with the policy intention set out in the heads of Bill last year, which was that referral procedures from Tusla should support referrals both on the grounds of child welfare or protection and on the grounds of family support or early intervention.  The wording in the published Bill was not intended to limit referrals only to cases of child welfare and child protection.  The phrase "not receiving adequate care and protection" was used as it explicitly refers to Tusla's purposes as set out in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  I accept that the wording in the proposed amendment is more positive in tone than the current wording and I welcome that.  I thank the Deputies for proposing it.</p></speech>

We see Brexit as one of the biggest prevailing challenges for the all-island economy and we primarily want to see more businesses planning for that challenge.  As an organisation we established a cross-disciplinary Brexit team in November 2016 to look primarily at the development of our Brexit advisory service and our Brexit research programme.  That team has also examined the impact of Brexit on our organisation as a whole and on our service provision.  If I may, I will share a little more about the research programme and the advisory service.</p> <p>  In terms of our research programme, it is very important to us as an organisation that we respond in an objective manner, basing the decisions we make, the advice we give and the operational service we deliver on evidence-based research.  To that end, we have developed a multifaceted research programme to help us better understand the implications of Brexit on existing trade structures across the island and on the sectors and business types which may be most impacted by Brexit.  In addition we have developed our business monitor from the third quarter of 2016 to provide us with additional insights on the impact of Brexit on businesses to date, on the concerns that businesses have and on the planning that is taking place for Brexit.</p> <p>  From our research programme, we already have two reports that have been completed to date.  The first one, with which the committee will be familiar, is Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs on Cross-Border Trade, which looked at the impact of a hard Brexit at an aggregate sectoral and product level and it identified a potential drop of 16% under both WTO tariffs and non-tariff barriers on that cross-border trade.  That impact disproportionately affected the agriculture sector and, in particular for Ireland, the export of beef products to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  We have a second report, which has been completed and which we hope to have published next week.  It looks specifically at the integrated nature of cross-Border trade on the island of Ireland and at supply chain linkages.</p><p>It shows a very high level of integration of supply chains on the island of Ireland and the fact that, across all sectors, it is much higher between Ireland and Northern Ireland than Ireland and Great Britain.  The report also shows that businesses have a very high reliance on that cross-Border trade.  For more than one-quarter of Irish businesses, their export market is Northern Ireland.  That cross-Border trade is primarily in intermediate goods, that is, the goods are component parts within the supply chain.  Further information on that will be published next week.</p><p> There is a full range of research, both under way and forthcoming in the next number of months, on cross-Border trade in services, in the ability of businesses to absorb the cost of Brexit, on the implications of divergence and access to skills and on tariff barriers.  All those will help us, as an organisation, better identify which supports businesses will need during the transition period and after Brexit.</p><p> The Brexit Advisory Service is the business-facing arm of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit supports.  We have been these out and about across the whole island - from Dundalk, Monaghan, Cavan, Offaly, Sligo, Cork and Mayo - and have planned a raft of events for 2018 which InterTradeIreland is using to engage with businesses in order to help them plan, act and engage for the best possible Brexit outcome.  In addition to these events, we have also prepared and made available Brexit fact sheets and a glossary of terms on the website.  We have provided access to a tariff database that gives businesses free advice on how tariffs might impact them in the event of a hard Brexit and we also have a Brexit start to plan voucher scheme which gives businesses up to &euro;2,000 of professional advice and guidance to help them in the process of planning for Brexit.</p><p> That is a whirlwind tour of our services but I hope it demonstrates to the committee how InterTradeIreland has fully taken on board the challenge of Brexit.  We live and breathe it.  We have redirected a significant proportion of our resources and organisational effort to ensure that we have the evidence base to understand the challenge of Brexit and we are also working directly with businesses to help them in their preparations regardless of the outcome of the current trade negotiations.</p></speech>

Our current strategy, which covers the period of Brexit, aims for significant uplift in the amount of foreign direct investment which we hope to win for Ireland between 2015 and 2019.  The targets include 900 new investments, 80,000 gross jobs and a 13% increase in the number of firms in the portfolio.  Our performance to date has been quite encouraging, especially in 2017.  The total number of people employed in the IDA Ireland portfolio of companies is a record 210,000.  This is a positive backdrop from which to confront the challenges of Brexit.  Ireland's attractiveness to multinationals continues to increase.</p> <p>  We share the view of the Oireachtas that Brexit is a very unwelcome development.  It is not in Ireland's national interest.  It fragments the EU market.  It is very challenging for multinationals but it is not insurmountable.  It is worth remembering that they are quite sophisticated, large investors which have the wherewithal to respond to the challenges of Brexit.  Brexit is a double-edged sword, presenting opportunities and challenges for Ireland and in the context of foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  In the lead-up to the UK referendum in June 2016, we had been speaking to our clients about Brexit.  They share our collective view that it is a very negative development which creates uncertainty and instability.  More fundamentally for them, it threatens cross-Border business activity and supply chains and it poses additional costs and disruptions to trade and investment.  It is important to remember that multinationals have options to preserve market access within the EU and the UK from their existing networks of subsidiaries and branches.  They will not be frozen out of any of the markets.  Some of them view Brexit as such a significant event that they will re-examine the overall structure of their business in the EU and reconfigure it with due regard to Brexit.  The two principles guiding their response to Brexit are least disruption and lowest cost.  They do not want to have to leave the UK and will stay there as long as possible but they are making plans to respond to the challenges that Brexit poses to them.</p> <p>  Generally, Ireland's multinationals view Brexit as a low risk.  The impact varies across sectors and companies but none of our clients are telling us that Brexit is an absolutely terrible challenge.</p> <p>  On IDA Ireland's response to Brexit to date, it is a standing item on the executive committee and board's agenda.  Each month, we deal with the issue, reviewing what we are doing, what our clients are saying and our response.  Our parent Department, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has provided extra financial and human resources to help us address the challenges of Brexit which we have deployed to increase our focus on the UK market and on those clients affected by Brexit.  We have established an IDA Ireland Brexit group, which I chair, and we participate at all relevant departmental, cross-agency and other Brexit fora.</p> <p>  Since June 2016, we have completed four sensitivity analyses of our portfolio, meaning that we have approached our clients to identify those which are at risk from Brexit and those that view it as presenting them with investment opportunities.  We have also restructured our European operations and now treat the United Kingdom as a separate and distinct market from the rest of the European Union.  The full range of grants, information and advisory supports available to our clients are available to the clients now dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  We have organised many investor briefings in the UK to brief companies there on Ireland's proposition and we have also undertaken a dedicated marketing campaign in the UK.  There is ongoing engagement and monitoring of relevant companies through our operations, teams, overseas and through our client development programme.</p> <p>  We have already won approximately 20 investments with employment potential of more than 2,500 jobs over the next three to five years, as a result of Brexit.  We have a considerable pipeline of more than 30 investments on which we are still working and which are yet to be announced.  Brexit is already generating investment opportunities for Ireland which IDA Ireland has converted.</p> <p>  IDA Ireland continues to have ongoing and active engagement with clients around Brexit.  Its impact varies by sector and company.  Financial services is one of the sectors most impacted upon by Brexit and it engaged with us quite quickly to respond to the challenges.  The majority of the IDA Ireland portfolio is not heavily exposed to Brexit.  I would describe the overall response of our firms to the challenges of Brexit as pragmatic and business-focused.  Clients have options.  They have extensive networks of branches and subsidiaries in the UK and across the EU which gives them the wherewithal to respond to Brexit.  The key issue for our clients is the terms of continued access from Ireland into the UK post-Brexit, and we are working with them to address that.  What is really important is the deal of the final EU-UK agreement and transition arrangements.  All our clients want and need transition arrangements to give them more time to prepare to respond to the challenges of Brexit.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland works with companies around the Republic to help them start, innovate and scale their business in international markets.  Our 2020 strategy, Build Scale - Expand Reach, is specifically a Brexit strategy to help companies increase their jobs by 60,000, increase exports by &euro;5 billion to &euro;26 billion by 2020, increase the level of spend in Ireland by those companies by &euro;4 billion in 2020 and help more of those companies with their global ambition to internationalise their business.</p><p>In May of last year we launched an important eurozone strategy specifically focused on increasing our clients' exports into the eurozone by 50% by 2020.  As members are aware, we work with approximately 5,000 companies across our network of ten offices in Ireland and 33 offices outside of Ireland.  Our focus is manufacturing and internationally traded service activities.  Reflecting the strength of the economy last year, we reported record results by our clients, involving the highest level of employment in the history of the agency with 209,338 people directly employed by our client companies and the creation of over 10,309 new jobs, along with the lowest level of job losses since 1998.  It is important to note that there was growth in all regions, counties and sectors in terms of that employment performance.  We were delighted with that and are in the process of collecting the end-of-year export data from our client companies, which we will shortly be reporting.

Although the outcome of the Brexit negotiations is currently uncertain, our role is to help companies prepare for the worst and hope for the best in terms of whatever type of Brexit may occur.  Since the referendum in June 2016 we have undertaken a wide range of initiatives which, in the interests of time, I will not address individually.  We have worked with companies at an individual and sectoral level to help them respond to and prepare for the outcome of Brexit, whatever that may be, and have particularly focused on helping companies take practical measures in that regard.  A number of initiatives involve market diversification and we are actively working with companies to help them diversify their global footprint.  Last year, we helped companies win slightly fewer than 1,400 new overseas contracts and establish 350 new overseas presences whereby companies are putting new operations on the ground to help them win business in international markets.  Some 56 companies established a presence outside of the UK.  Assistance was provided to first-time exporters.   We brought almost 1,000 international buyers into Ireland, which is extremely important in terms of helping them to win business.  We run a very extensive programme of ministerial-led trade missions and other trade events and will undertake almost 200 major international trade events and 57 ministerial-led trade events this year.  We have realigned our financial support and recently launched a new market discovery fund that is providing financial assistance to companies to help them investigate and target new business in international markets.</p> <p>  On innovation, one of the areas in which companies can compete and win against the competition, we last year approved over &euro;100,000 in funding for 99 companies to invest in research and development.  We oversaw 436 industry innovation projects through gateways or connections between industry and technology centres and over 1,000 collaborative innovations between industry and research centres around the country.  Those measures are very important in terms of helping companies capitalise on the available technology.  Aligned with that, we have recently launched a new agile innovation fund which is focused on providing a fast response research and development and financial support to companies.</p> <p>  On competitiveness, we have assisted over 1,000 companies with lean business practices, which is fundamental to help them drive their own competitiveness.  We will very shortly be launching a new offer in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of client numbers, we have more than 1,670 client companies currently exporting to the UK, just over 651 of which export more than 20% of their output to the UK and Northern Ireland, which is a very important market for them.  The main sectors impacted are construction, construction services and products, engineering, agricultural machinery, timber, furniture and the very large agrifood sector.  We are intensively working with that grouping of companies to help them prepare for and respond to every eventuality.</p> <p>  Brexit probably represents one of the biggest economic challenges of the past 50 years in terms of long-term structural change.  The effect on currency in terms of the change in the exchange rate has impacted several companies.  Our role is to help companies prepare for the long-term implications of Brexit.  We have launched a scorecard to help companies assess in a very practical way what actions they can immediately take in spite of there being some unknowns.  More than 2,100 companies have completed the scorecard and started to take action and we have provided financial support to assist those companies with practical plans.  We are putting on Brexit roadshows in many counties around the country and have a group of consultants based in Ireland who are focused on helping companies with international reach to assess what the implications of Brexit are for them and help them to respond in a practical way.  We also continue to run Brexit advisory clinics around the country, with nine held to date, including one in Portlaoise last week, with one to be held in Claremorris next week and another with InterTradeIreland before the end of the month.  The clinics address practical matters in terms of financial and supply chain management, transport and logistics.</p> <p>  We have recently launched an international digital marketing campaign called "The Irish Advantage".  It is a digital boots on the ground initiative to assist companies position themselves in international markets.  Phase 1 of the campaign, focusing on the construction and medtech areas, has been launched in France, Germany and the Netherlands.  Phase 2, focusing on FinTech and financial services, will shortly commence and will target the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Italy and the Nordic countries.</p> <p>  As Mr. Donoghue mentioned, we received sanction for additional resources within our organisation, including provision in budget 2017 for some 39 staff positions, 37 of which have been filled, and an allocation of an additional &euro;1.3 million in budget 2018, as a result of which additional staff are being recruited. </p> <p>  In conclusion, we will continue to work with companies to prepare for any type of Brexit.  It is a big challenge but our focus and our message to companies is to concentrate on the things we can influence and impact, which are competitiveness, innovation and diversification in terms of companies broadening their export base outside the UK.   Too many Irish companies are overly dependent on the UK market.</p></speech>

I have a few comments to make before members pose their questions.  The first work undertaken by the committee approximately 18 months ago was to look at the situation around Brexit.  Representatives from the organisations before us today also presented at that stage.  All present are aware that Brexit is an unwelcome development and not in Ireland's national interest.  I was struck by Mr. Donoghue's comments in that regard.  Mr. Sherry set out the economic challenges and long-term implications.  Do the witnesses think that companies are more aware of the challenges facing them than they were 18  months ago?  The word we heard the most at committee meetings on Brexit at that time was "uncertainty" and that nobody really knew what was coming down the line.  We still probably do not know exactly what is to come.  Are companies now more aware of the challenges they will face?   Some 18 months after first appearing before the committee, do the witnesses believe they have the proper resources to help companies face those challenges?</p><p>The witnesses said they have extra staff.  </p><p> If there was no Brexit, could the energy, commitment and emphasis of InterTradeIreland and the IDA be put into something other than Brexit?  I am sure the issue of Brexit has taken up much of their time and work in the past 18 months.  If the vote in the UK was not carried, do the witnesses feel they could have pursued other avenues, which they have now missed out on?</p></speech>

I will address the issue of the awareness of the challenges.  We have an all-island business monitor, which is the largest monitor of business owners on the island of Ireland, and we have been monitoring the awareness of businesses and some of the issues they have around planning for Brexit.  We have seen very little shift in businesses formally planning for Brexit since quarter three of 2016.  Of our cross-Border traders, 18 months down the line, only 8% have a formal plan in place for Brexit, which means that 92% have no formal plan in place.  They are telling us the uncertainty around Brexit makes it very difficult for them to plan.  We are seeing an increase in the informal planning for Brexit as more information filters through.  In our most recent survey, 41% of businesses said they are talking to peer groups and other organisations in the same sectors in a collegiate way to garner more information to help them plan for Brexit.  A fifth of firms have said they are starting to engage with Government agencies such as the ones attending the committee today to help them to better understand Brexit.  There has not been a huge shift and certainly not the shift we would like to see.

We have a plan in place for our Brexit research activities and the Brexit advisory service for 2018.  We are comfortable that we have the funding to do what we have said we will do with regard to Brexit.  If we had more funding we could do more but we know what we are hoping to achieve in the course of the next 12 months and we have the resources in place for that.</p> <p>  If there was no Brexit we would be in a different world.  There is much more we would and could be doing if there was no Brexit.  We have plans in our current research programme apart from the issue of Brexit.  We want to better understand cross-Border trade in services which over the past number of years has become as important as cross-Border trade in goods.  There is very little research on that cross-Border structure for services and we would like to understand it better.  We are doing additional research and would like to do more on cross-Border public procurement and also in investment decisions by firms, which have altered in light of Brexit.  Even if Brexit had not occurred it is an area that we would like to better understand as an organisation.  They are a couple of areas in which we would be doing research if there was no Brexit.  There is plenty to do to help businesses across the island of Ireland to fulfil the potential of cross-Border trade and the all-island economy.  </p></speech>

Companies and multinationals are certainly more aware of the challenges and opportunities of Brexit.  They have taken advantage of the past 20 months to do a lot of additional research, analysis and due diligence to understand the specifics of the challenges and opportunities.  Many are now in a position to select exactly how they will respond to Brexit.  Different companies and sectors have moved at a different pace and some are more advanced than others but generally they are certainly more aware.</p> <p>  The resources made available from our parent Department to us are absolutely sufficient but it is something to keep under review.  Depending on how Brexit plays out, whether it is towards the harder end of the spectrum or the softer, the impact on the economy and our clients will evolve and be different and they will need to review the resource situation accordingly.  Is there an opportunity cost associated with Brexit?  Are we missing out on other things as a result of Brexit?  No.  The honest answer is that Brexit is now part of the day job.  Everyone is pushing themselves harder to deal with the challenges and pursue the opportunities so we have not lost out.  </p></speech>

For us and Ireland it is really important that we are constantly competing for business.  In the past number of months, as Mr. Kieran Donoghue has already highlighted, we have won approximately 20 investments from a number of different sectors going into Dublin and regional locations which are creating about 2,500 jobs.  We have won investments on the back of it and we hope to win more.</p></speech>

For us, the big concern was companies doing evaluations and becoming aware but not taking action.  Action is key in responding in advance of March 2019.  We had a workshop in Portlaoise last week which 79 companies attended.  Change has taken place over the recent months on that.</p> <p>  We are very grateful for the substantial additional resources received from the Department, which we needed to help companies.  I will add one caveat which is that there is an issue associated with larger companies looking to make big investments but being restricted by state aid rules.  There are larger companies that employ more than 250 people which need to make big capital investments in order to redirect their energies.  An example is companies in the dairy industry that are producing a lot of product.  State aid rules restrict the support we can provide for them.  From Enterprise Ireland's perspective the introduction of the guaranteed loan scheme which will be operational from next month is a very important development.</p> <p>  I will answer the question about whether we are losing other opportunities as a result of the focus on Brexit in two ways.  In 2015, the growth rate of exports to the UK by Irish companies was in the order of 12% and in 2016 it was 2%.  We have seen a drop in realising potential opportunities in the UK, by currency and also by market demand.  That is a lost opportunity as a result of Brexit.  We are accelerating efforts with companies to capitalise on opportunities in other markets.  That is very important in terms of lessening their dependence.  Similar to the IDA, Brexit is a very important part of the day job for Enterprise Ireland.  That is a reality and we have to deal with it.  </p></speech>

They have a very difficult task.  The first time they attended here 18 months ago, we talked about the uncertainty and we are still experiencing that to a certain extent.  This morning the Taoiseach confirmed that the legal text would be agreed tomorrow at 12 o'clock so hopefully we will get some certainty from it.  This morning I read shocking comments made by the Foreign Secretary in England.  He said there was no need for an Irish Border after Brexit because there is no hard border between the London boroughs of Camden and Westminster.  He also suggested that British and EU negotiators could seek inspiration from London where congestion charges are automatically applied to commuters driving in the centre of London.  He said there was no border between Islington, Camden and Westminster.  I lived in the borough of Camden and travelled to work in Grosvenor Gardens, which is in the City of Westminster.</p><p>At the same time, there was a border in Ireland so I know exactly what a border does and does not look like.  I think his comments were really dangerous and clueless.  I do not know what he is talking about and I really fear where the Tory Party is leading the English people but that is not what we are here for today.  <br/><br/>I have a few questions for InterTradeIreland.  I looked at its figure of 92%.  I think it started with 98% and the figure then dropped to 96%.  I know it is difficult to get it lower than that because we do not know what we are dealing with but I look forward to the InterTradeIreland report on cross-Border trade and supply linkage.  I assume that might lead some companies in the middle of supply chain that might not even know they are exporting to the UK or <i>vice versa</i>to wake up.  InterTradeIreland's Start to Plan programme involves providing an allowance of &euro;2,000 per company.  The witnesses said the uptake of that in the Border counties is good but not so good in Munster or Ulster.  Are there plans to reach out to other areas?  <br/><br/>Can the witnesses from IDA Ireland tell me which companies or sector are particularly exposed to Brexit?  Reference was made to the fact that most larger companies are - I will not use the word &quot;okay&quot; - pretty much up to score on it.  I have a question for Enterprise Ireland about the scorecard.  It has produced 2,100.  How many supported companies have been given grants by Enterprise Ireland?  Does Enterprise Ireland have a record of that?  How many of these companies would say they are Brexit-ready? </p></speech>

As for the businesses planning for Brexit through the all-island business monitor, the numbers have not come down very quickly.  Part of the reason for that is because the businesses on which we are focusing on the island of Ireland are SMEs.  Consequently, many of them are very small companies that only have a certain amount of resources for planning.  The larger companies with which IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland deals will have more resources behind them to support that planning process.  The supply chain linkages report shows clearly the nature of the integrated supply chain on the island of Ireland and how closely Ireland and Northern Ireland are tied in terms of delivering those component parts for businesses.  As for whether that will be a wake-up call for companies, we do not anticipate a big wake-up call for companies.  What we hope to do is to get out and speak to businesses directly.  That is where the value is in changing those numbers around and getting more than that 8% of cross-Border traders to plan for Brexit by sharing with them how they plan for Brexit and giving them advice through the Start to Plan vouchers that will really help change that.  That is where much of our effort will be focused during 2018.  My colleague will share some of that in a moment.</p> <p>  It will be a period of time before we see SMEs really getting past that uncertainty.  The good news we are starting to see through the business monitor is that businesses are doing far more informal planning.  They are having internal meetings.  Just over a third of businesses trading across the Border we surveyed in the most recent business monitor said that they had at least met internally as an organisation and discussed Brexit and that is new.  That is moving forward.  We are seeing more of them meet their peer organisations and support organisations to get more information for Brexit.  They are contacting organisations such as ourselves for advice and are using the Brexit advice vouchers for that.  We are seeing a positive sign of that informal planning improving.  When we think about the proportion of businesses that actually have a formal business plan, maybe that is good enough for now as we try to work out exactly what is going to happen around Brexit.  We are starting to see enough positive signs.  I will pass over to Mr. Skerritt who will discuss the plans around developing the Start to Plan voucher and its reach because plenty is under way there.  </p></speech>

My job is to manage the Brexit advisory service.  We deal directly with those companies and encourage them to act upon their plans.  The Deputy is right in identifying that we are seeing more interaction and engagement with companies based in and around the Border region, which might be expected to some extent.  We have mapped out where we see some gaps in terms of penetration for those vouchers.  In particular, they fall down the west coast, through the midlands, down around Munster and back up into Dublin.  We have events in Derry for Sligo, Cork, Mullingar and Wexford and a joint event with Enterprise Ireland in Cootehill, County Cavan in March.  Members have been made aware of the fact that there has already been some take up in the Border region.  We are also running those events in partnership with local SME stakeholders - either with local chambers of commerce or local enterprise offices.  We are looking to increase the number of service providers with a local voice and local expertise on our panel into which SMEs can tap to help them get the greatest benefit from the vouchers.</p></speech>

That is across the board in all sectors but, obviously, we are conscious that it affects the financial services sector.  Interestingly, that is the area where we are seeing a lot of investment wins so it is coming in the other direction for us as well.  The bulk of our investments and the new announcements have come on the financial services side.  For us, there are also opportunities that come from new areas like broadcasting, legal services and in particular, any of the areas that are regulated areas because the companies that are in the UK must look at alternative locations.  That is the first part of the response but I will hand over to Mr. Donoghue, who might add like to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Donoghue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#H00500"><p>I thank Deputy Quinlivan for the question.  The IDA portfolio is very varied.  We have some very large multinationals, as the Deputy is aware, employing 5,000 or 6,000 people and then we have companies employing 20 or 50 people, so the impact of Brexit will vary across the portfolio.  At a high level, we have some engineering firms in the portfolio in regional locations that are very reliant on the UK market so their exposure to Brexit will understandably be higher.  While people tend to refer to financial services as an area of opportunity, building on Ms Buckley's observation, an awful of investment funds are sold from Ireland into the UK.  They need to preserve access to that UK market post Brexit and if they do not, it could have implications for that sector here.  Some life sciences and pharmaceutical firms use the UK as a landbridge and provide intermediate inputs to other firms in the supply chain in the UK on their way to continental Europe.  Depending on how Brexit pans out, they could have an exposure they need to manage as well.  The essential point is that all of the companies are aware of their exposure and are putting in place approaches to mitigate and manage the risk.</p></speech>

He is right about the Brexit scorecard.  As I mentioned, just over 2,100 have been completed.  That is not just for Enterprise Ireland clients but local enterprise organisations and many other companies.  We purposely made that support available to all companies so we can assist them.  As for resulting financial supports, we have supported 89 companies through our Be Prepared grant to prepare a plan associated with Brexit.  We expect that the vast majority of companies that completed the Brexit scorecard will not avail of that grant because it is really for companies that cannot prepare a plan themselves.  It is focused on companies to provide them with that extra assistance so that it does not become a barrier to them taking action.  In terms of providing support for companies, the real figure involves the supports we provided through sales and marketing through our international offices, through competitiveness and through innovation.  Those supports we provide to companies also involve provide support to companies to help them add capacity and differentiate themselves from the competition.  The vast majority of the organisation's budget is devoted to those areas and we have not only provided supports in those areas but realigned our supports to make them more accessible for companies.  Consequently, a large percentage of the organisation's budget goes to those areas, as well as through the supports we provide in terms of the work of our staff in helping those companies to respond.  It is an organisation-wide response, including any financial supports we provide.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions and it is probably better to ask them together to let the delegates answer them in whatever order they wish.  </p> <p>  My first question has been touched on.  I was interested to hear about vouchers.  If I heard correctly, a &euro;5,000 voucher is being prepared under Enterprise Ireland, while there is a &euro;2,000 voucher under InterTradeIreland for a Brexit readiness pack.  These are useful and of practical assistance to businesses.  As a Kildare Deputy, I come from the midlands-Leinster region.  There has been a strong uptake in the Border region, but I have not seen the same degree of engagement or concern among companies local to me.  I held a meeting last week on Brexit, at which representatives of the local chamber of commerce and the local enterprise office, LEO, provided support and materials of assistance to local businesses in trying to prepare for Brexit.  The meeting was successful and well attended, but I got a sense from some of the attendees to whom I spoke that they did not believe Brexit would affect them because, for example, they did not do business in the United Kingdom.  Like the storm we are told that is imminent this week, some people will not take this issue seriously until it hits.  Is there a degree of complacency or inertia and is it a concern?  Even if the delegates are making their best efforts, some people are not quite there yet, particularly in SMEs, and need a nudge to get them to sit up and take the issue seriously.</p> <p>  My next question is on a different note.  IDA Ireland referred to the opportunities which would arise from Brexit.  I agree that one such opportunity arises from the potential move by academic researchers, institutions and investigators and their teams out of the United Kingdom lock, stock and barrel to Ireland because they want to access funding under the European Research Council, Horizon 2020 and other schemes.  How we are doing on that front?  Have we had any notable win to date?  Are people on their way here?  Which agencies are chasing them, including, for example, those represented in this room?  What are their portfolios in that regard?</p> <p>  On a related matter, the delegation from Enterprise Ireland referred to the agile innovation fund, which is great to see.  It also referred to technology gateways.  I acknowledge Enterprise Ireland's support for the Mid-East Regional Innovation Think Space, MERITS, centre in Naas which is only getting started, but it is a positive development that is great to see.  Programmes such as the agile innovation fund are welcome, but I would like to have more information on them.  It is not clear where the LEO service stops, the Enterprise Ireland service starts and stops and where the Science Foundation Ireland service starts.  It would be great if the delegates drew the picture of the remit of their agencies.</p></speech>

His remarks about the vouchers and the level of concern about Brexit among businesses across the island of Ireland do not tally with those that are formally planning.  Based on the insights we have received through our business monitor, businesses are seriously considering the potential impact of Brexit, if not formally planning for it.  Of the Irish businesses that took part in our recent survey, 16% stated Brexit was already having a negative impact on them.  For cross-Border traders, the figure was 25%.  Some 40% have told us that the main area of concern is sales.  They are starting to see a change in how sales are made which they have attributed to the concerns about Brexit held by them and their customers and suppliers.  This is the case across the island of Ireland.  As we break the figures down by county, we can see the depth and reach of that concern.  Businesses are taking the issue seriously and already feeling the impact of Brexit.</p></speech>

It is possible that there is a degree of Brexit fatigue because it is mentioned everywhere in the media, at events and so on.  There is a great deal of noise about it.  We deal a lot with micro-SMEs and have been very busy on a day-to-day basis; therefore, distilling the facts and information can be challenging.  That is what we are being told anecdotally.  Many businesses may be planning, but it is on a tacit basis.  The issue may be discussed around the kitchen table or on informal basis, but that does not necessarily equate to having a plan.  The conversations are coming through to us and have been picked up on recently through the business monitor, but we want to move companies on.  Being passive about Brexit is potentially satisfactory for some companies, but we want them to be consciously passive, that is, to make a decision to leave it for now and continue to engage at events.  The vouchers should be made available through various avenues.  They are available for the purpose of producing a report bespoke to each business.  We are looking to extend their use to meeting training needs, for example, where a company has someone who has never had to complete paperwork for customs before.  That would widen the scope and, therefore, the level of engagement.</p></speech>

Many of our client companies in Ireland are part of larger organisations.  At corporate level, they consider both the opportunities and challenges presented by Brexit.  Suffice it to say, that work is ongoing.</p> <p>  Deputy James Lawless asked about immigration and our comment on research opportunities and the like for Ireland.  For us, talent is key - the attraction of talent is critical.  There is an opportunity for Ireland in people seeking to move to where they will feel welcome and wanted and where they will have opportunities.  This, undoubtedly, will be an advantage for Ireland.</p> <p>  On remits, we work closely with Enterprise Ireland.  Our role is to engage in the multinational environment and ensure that not only will companies establish in Ireland, but that they will also sustain and expand their activities here.  We work very closely with our sister agency, Enterprise Ireland, on companies' client bases and in ensuring their level of expenditure and engagement with indigenous companies is strong.</p></speech>

A number of our research intensive clients and colleagues in SFI have drawn our attention to the fact that non-UK researchers, in particular, now believe the United Kingdom is a less welcoming environment in which to conduct research and that a number of them are actively looking for new jurisdictions to which they can transfer their research activities, especially if they are EU funded, or where they can start new research agendas.  It is an issue we are monitoring closely.  When a country can attract a lead researcher in an area, it is often a basis for attracting flows of investment.</p></speech>

Like IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland has direct responsibility for supporting company level research and development within companies.  It also has responsibility for applied research and Horizon 2020.  SFI has responsibility for basic research.  In the case of Horizon 2020, I am delighted to say Ireland ranks No. 1 in Europe in winning contracts in the SME strand.  In 2017 we reported that a total of &euro;475 million had been secured by Ireland under Horizon 2020.  The committee will hear later this week about a large win by an Irish company under Horizon 2020.  It will be announced in the next few days.  That is important for us because it does not just attract investment in research and development but it also promotes strong collaboration between Irish and European companies which has helped them to win against competitors from outside Europe.</p> <p>  I will also mention the recent allocations made from the regional enterprise development fund.  Just over &euro;30 million has been allocated in the first round to 21 projects throughout the country.  Research is an important element.  The second call, for a further &euro;30 million, will be announced within the next six weeks and focus on supporting infrastructure and developments in regions.</p> <p>  Deputy James Lawless asked about complacency among companies, particularly SMEs.</p><p>Our experience is that it can be seen either as complacency or as a lack of knowledge in terms of what exactly to do.  Brexit is a very big issue facing them.  With the Brexit scorecard, our approach has been to help them focus on the things on which they can take action.  Earlier, I mentioned innovation, investing in new products and services, competitiveness and market diversification or looking at new markets.  Those are practical things they can do that will arm them and help them to strengthen themselves, irrespective of what type of Brexit we have.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Lanigan to comment specifically on some of the experiences at the workshop last week in Portlaoise by way of example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Lanigan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#K00200"><p>We recognise that it is difficult for companies to identify where they might be exposed and, particularly, what they can do about it.  That is how the Brexit scorecard emerged.  We identified nine areas of exposure, some of which are now getting a lot of attention from our companies.  At the Portlaoise clinic, for example, as well as the other clinics we are running, we are focusing on three areas: financial and currency management, strategic sourcing, and customs and logistics.  Brexit or no Brexit, at this point companies can genuinely take some action in those areas and start to make changes within their business.  We are also seeing a lot of attention around the customs piece.  That is probably due to the attention it is now getting in the public domain.  It seems quite clear that there will be a necessity for customs procedures.  Whatever happens with Brexit, they do need to understand the implications of this for their businesses.</p> <p>  As Mr. Sherry mentioned, we have a team of consultants working with our companies at the clinics, where they pre-book meetings.  Typically, between 30 and 50 meetings with consultants take place at those clinics.  Separately, we are also offering consultancy to companies where they need to spend some time with somebody outside of the business who understands the issues relating to Brexit that will impact on the company, so they can put together an action plan.  The output of these clinics and the consultant interventions is an action plan.  This allows the companies to have clear actions in terms of what they can do next.  It does not need to be a long list.  We are seeing companies recognising the issues.  Some 2,100 companies have done the scorecard.  That means they have been prompted to think about the things they are exposed to and are taking actions around that.</p> <p>  Of course we would like to see more action.  However, we must recognise that many of these companies are small businesses.  They have to run their business at the same time.  That is why the focus is very much on things they can do for their businesses that make sense anyway and that will strengthen their businesses no matter what kind of Brexit we have.</p></speech>

He will see the prompts we are providing and will get a report at the end of it depending on how he responded, which will indicate what actions he might take.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great work being done by all three bodies, but particularly by the IDA, in the area of Fingal.  We have had two good announcements recently in respect of the Korean company, SK Biotek, and MSD biotech.</p> <p>  So far, everybody has focused on the issues around our existing businesses.  While that is right and proper and very important, I am wondering, too, about the opportunities that arise for the three bodies in terms of attracting new business.  I am particularly focused on Dublin Airport, which has a huge impact not just on the local and regional economies but also on the national economy.  It contributes around &euro;8.7 billion to the Irish economy.  There is good news from Cathay Pacific with direct flights coming in from Hong Kong from 2 June.  Hainan Airlines will also commence flights from mainland China into Dublin so we will have a direct link with Beijing and the phenomenal market that represents.  We are doing a lot of business with those countries at the moment, particularly China.  Having those flights will offer huge opportunity.</p> <p>  I have raised the fact that DAA has four blocks of offices that could accommodate 4,000 workers.  That represents a great opportunity, given that planning permission is in place and it can be modified to a client's needs.  Further to that, there is another 75 acres of a landbank that could accommodate a huge number of additional business.  We are all aware that an increasing number of people are looking to Europe as an opportunity.  Ireland is very strategically positioned to afford them that opportunity as the land bridge into Europe - an air bridge, as it were.  How much marketing has been done by IDA Ireland to advertise and sell that inside Europe?</p> <p>  An example would be Kellogg's, a household name that sells Europe-wide.  Its headquarters for the EU are here in north County Dublin, where it employs 350 people.  There are other companies that must have similar needs.  Ireland represents an opportunity for them.  I will be asking the witnesses some questions in this regard in a moment.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has been out in Hong Kong doing a lot of work raising our profile for our financial services.  The witnesses from IDA Ireland mentioned that as one of the areas that is strongly on their minds.</p> <p>  There is land zoned for 33,000 homes in Fingal, with 4,000 of them to be built in Donabate, which is within 15 minutes' walk of a train station and has access to parks, beaches, schools, sporting clubs etc.  I imagine all that would make an attractive package for companies coming in.  What are the three or four issues most commonly cited as a challenge for prospective customers coming to this country to set up?  They are looking around the world.  IDA Ireland is continually bringing people in to have a look.  If we take uncertainty about Brexit out of it and consider issues like housing, transport, staffing, schools or power costs, what are the main challenges for prospective companies, big or small, that are considering relocating here to avail of the opportunities we can give them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Buckley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#K00600"><p>IDA Ireland is very familiar with the importance of Dublin Airport and the access it provides for our clients and their customers, products, etc.  Airports, access and connections are critically important.  The Senator mentioned the construction of the office developments at Dublin Airport, known as Dublin Airport Central, with which we are also very familiar.  I understand construction has commenced and we will be marketing those offices as part of our proposition to clients.</p> <p>  When it comes to clients and what they are looking for, it varies depending on the sector and the activities in which the company is involved, be it manufacturing, services, or research, development and innovation.  If I were to pick the most important item for our clients when they are looking at Ireland alongside other locations against which we are competing, the biggest item is probably talent and talent availability.  That piece is certainly critically important.  Under that, I would say it is the availability of an experienced and talented workforce and the calibre and quality of students coming from our third level colleges.  Those would be the first two items they are looking for.  The type of activity the company is involved in, be it services or manufacturing, will also dictate what kind of services it is looking for in the form of water, power, etc.</p><p>In tandem with that, there would also be a focus on property, particularly commercial office and manufacturing property solutions.  That would be critical too.  Across the board, one can select a number of areas in which it is important for our clients to be able to feel that the people they are bringing into the country to work and who are already here will locate in the locations that our clients decide to establish in.  There are other areas of critical importance that our clients would look at.  The list of areas is quite wide.  It all depends totally on the activity that the client is involved in.  It sometimes depends on who one is competing against too, because it is sometimes Ireland competing against other large urban centres around the globe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Sherry" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#L00200"><p>There are opportunities relating to Dublin Airport.  An Enterprise Ireland client, Dublin Aerospace, recently made an announcement about an additional 150 jobs.  Cathay Pacific, as the Senator has rightly pointed out, is opening a new route with the first flight on 2 June.  We will have an event on 25 April in the Aviva Stadium with the chief operating officer, COO, and some of the leading team there, focusing on opportunities in China for exporters to that market.  Enterprise Ireland works very closely with companies in international markets in helping them to open and justify new direct routes to Ireland because it is a very important factor for exporters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#L00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They have been extremely informative about the range of services being offered by their organisations.  I have follow-up questions to fill in some of the gaps.  Our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland mentioned 651 companies which are highly exposed to the UK market.  Do the witnesses have an idea of how many jobs that would relate to?  If they do not, maybe they could follow on with that information.  It would be important to understand the potential threat to jobs there.  I wanted to speak to Mr. Donoghue and Ms Buckley specifically about those 20 relocations and the 2,500 jobs that they have been successful in bringing to Ireland.  Perhaps it is similar to what the previous speaker said.  What were the major factors in those specific successes?  Where was tax in the range of considerations?  If they were ordered, would talent go first and tax last?  How important is the tax offering?  Is it possible to get a broad breakdown of where companies have relocated to?  How many of the 20 companies to date have come to Dublin as opposed to the regions?  I thank our colleagues in InterTradeIreland for an excellent presentation.  It is worrying to see that 92% of companies still have no formal planning in place.  InterTradeIreland's start to plan initiative sounds really good.  I have a simple question.  Is &euro;2,000 enough?  What can one get for &euro;2,000?</p></speech>

They will, over time, create 2,500 jobs.  Those jobs have not necessarily been created at the moment.  We will see that happen over the next few years.  The biggest focus for our clients is the fact that they cannot be in the UK post Brexit.  It is a regulatory issue for many, especially on the financial services side, which a significant number of those investments were from.  Many of those have located in Dublin.  Some already had a presence there and are also expanding there.  It will be a very strong focus of these companies to ensure not only that can they operate from a regulatory perspective in Ireland but also that the talent is available.  The talent is key, to ensure that the people who are here will be able to work and that they can get the kind of talent they need.  That is a key priority.</p> <p>  We have a number of investments from financial services which are relocating their activities here.  Some had no activities in the UK but will have to find a location in Europe because of Brexit as they expand and internationalise themselves.  Due to regulation, we have seen life sciences companies look at Ireland and decide to establish here.  In particular, we have two pharmaceutical companies that have established in Dundalk.  Wasdell Group is from the UK and will invest &euro;30 million with 300 jobs to be created in a pharmaceutical packaging and distribution facility in Dundalk.  Those jobs will be created over the next five years.  The second company is Almac Group, which is expanding its activities into Dundalk with an additional 100 jobs.  Those would be the two life sciences companies that we have seen.  A company called Alter Domus will establish itself in Cork and expand its financial services activities in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.753" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Donoghue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#L00800"><p>I will zero on the Deputy's focus on tax.  Tax was a factor but it certainly was not the principal driver.  Another interesting feature of those 20 investments is that the majority are what we call new name investments.  By that, we mean that they had no pre-existing presence in Ireland.  A reason multinationals have traditionally selected the UK as a base is exactly the same reason for which they select Ireland: it is a platform from which to service the wider EU market.  The Brexit decision has now drawn a line through that so clients are now looking at places other than the UK, and Ireland, with English-speaking common law, is an obvious attraction.  Linking in with what Senator Reilly referred to, in recent times, we have detected an increasing emphasis on quality of life, the availability of residential property, and the quality of our city regions and infrastructure.  If one considers the environments from which these multinationals come, whether Shanghai, Beijing, Australia, continental Europe or the US, they are used to operating in a particular environment.  They are now looking to us for guidance as to what Ireland's plans are to improve the attractiveness of all of our regions, including Dublin, over the next few years.  That is what makes the Government's recent initiative with the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040 really important for these multinationals.  They know that, over the next few years, we have a vision and plans in place to expand the carrying capacity of the economy to support more foreign direct investment.</p></speech>

Is it?  Talent and commercial property were mentioned.  Following on from Senator Reilly's question, I imagine the English language would be a huge factor too.</p></speech>

On the point about the breakdown of investments and Mr. Donoghue's point about investments coming to Ireland for the first time, one thing we have found with many of our clients is that they come and establish operations in Dublin, then after a period of being in Dublin, they seek to expand their activities.  They often go to what we, internally, call second-site solutions where, after a period operating in Dublin, companies go and establish operations in other parts of the country.  For example, we would have Northern Trust, which many would be familiar with, and which has very strong funds management activity in Dublin.  It has had that there over many years.  It has expanded its activities in Limerick and has several hundred people now employed in fund administration activities.  We see the same with State Street bank which has locations in Dublin, Kilkenny and elsewhere.</p><p>It is not unusual for companies, particularly those in the financial services sector, to start their operations in Dublin and then expand their activities around the country as they become more comfortable and get to know the environment, the footprint and the talent pool of people they need and have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#M00200"><p>It is a success and we need to acknowledge that.  The only concern is the obvious one, namely that 85% of the Brexit bonus in terms of the relocations to date has been Dublin-based.  Given that development is already very much skewed towards the east coast, is there not a particular challenge for IDA Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-27a.761" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Buckley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018022700002#M00300"><p>Since the financial services sector is regulated, it is the one that has been under the most pressure to move its activities.  The investment made in Dundalk by the two life sciences pharmaceutical companies is quite significant.  It is safe to say financial services companies are among the first movers.  There are other sectors and activities that will move, particularly on the regulated side.  The pharmaceuticals sector is regulated.  We will also see movement among tech companies that are considering expanding their activities to Ireland.  In time, we will be absolutely focused on marketing not only Dublin but also the regions as locations in which to invest.  Over time, as we win further investments, we will see other investments being made in regional locations.</p> <p>  It is important to highlight that when we talk about Brexit related investments, our clients increasingly tend not to want us to talk about whether their investment is related to Brexit because they will still be using the United Kingdom.  It will still be a market for them.  It may not be within the European Union but the client will have a customer base there.  Every conversation we have with our clients has a Brexit tint but ultimately our announcements may not mention Brexit because clients may not want that.  Over time, we will see investments coming through that may not mention Brexit but that will be Brexit related.</p></speech>

I am referring to professional research people whom I know.</p> <p>  The culture here has very much changed.  Ireland is now seen as very much less insular following the marriage equality referendum.  We have not mentioned, but all know, that being in the eurozone makes life very easy for somebody coming here who wants to do business with the 440 million people in mainland Europe.</p></speech>

I am quite aware of a lot of the work that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland do.  There has been a lot of interaction in Mullingar.  The Science Park has been a great success.  I refer in particular to the use of the former tobacco factory, which would have been a real eyesore only for the good work ethic and great business acumen of Mr. Garret Moore and those who came in behind him.  In this regard, I must mention Mr. Tommy Kelly and Mr. John Hunt of TEG and Mr. Pat Beirne and the guys in Mergon.  The development has been a huge success story.  It is a breath of fresh air to go to the factory and see what is happening there.</p> <p>  I am trying to be very objective.  Patterson Pump Ireland in is the IDA park in Mullingar.  I was involved in some representations for the company.  It has been a good success story.  It moved to its current location from Lynn Industrial Estate.</p> <p>  Talent, third level education and getting second stations to locate further down the country were mentioned.  Maybe a different focus is needed on some of the regional parks.  Perhaps they are more suited to indigenous companies.  These have proven to be the only companies that have taken up the spaces.  Perhaps we need to consider these places slightly differently.  Everybody wants to be in Dublin or around the M50, unfortunately, but Mullingar is only 50 minutes from the M50 and it is close to the M4 and M6.  Perhaps we should change our expectations regarding the types of companies that will locate in some of the places.  I am sure the delegates are hearing all about Sligo and every other town, including Limerick and Dundalk.  Athlone has been quite successful.  We have talked about some of the other regional towns and what has occurred there but I am curious to hear the delegates' thoughts on what might be the way forward.</p></speech>

We have approximately 17 client companies there.  They employ close to 3,000 people across a good range of sectors.  The pharmaceuticals sector there is very strong.  There are a cluster of pharmaceutical companies.  We also have a very good tech company, a very strong player, Ericsson.  We have won a number of investments in recent times.  We recently constructed a building.  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, a brand-new company, has located in Athlone.</p> <p>  My organisation would love to be able to deliver clients to every location in the country but we are challenged.  It goes back to the question of requirements.  I mentioned earlier the critical nature of third level education.  It is a question of having some scale behind the activities.  The talent piece is critical.</p> <p>  Senator Davitt referred to the park in Mullingar.  We would be very happy to welcome indigenous companies there.  We work very closely with Mr. Kevin Sherry and the Enterprise Ireland team in that regard.  It is part of our property remit to have land available for indigenous clients.  Enterprise Ireland clients have access to our parks.  The relationship between both agencies works very well.</p></speech>

Westmeath is a very important region for Enterprise Ireland clients.  More than 3,700 people are employed in Westmeath by Enterprise Ireland clients.  Employment by the companies in the region grew by 7% last year.  We cannot have enough entrepreneurs like Mr. Garrett Moore, whom I know well.  He started SteriPack and made it a very successful company.  It has since invested heavily in the Imperial Tobacco facility.  It was not by accident that the announcement of the regional economic development fund, amounting to &euro;30 million, was made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, at the IMR facility.  It is a fantastic facility and it offers great opportunities to companies.  It is about supporting and encouraging entrepreneurs in continuing to develop and grow existing businesses and in starting new businesses.</p> <p>  Last year, we supported 181 companies in starting up.  That is very important focus for us.  In that area, there is very strong capability.  The medical technology companies and the other companies mentioned in this regard have a strong cluster.

It emerged when the SME delegates were before us that many SMEs are not aware of what Brexit means for them.  Those who are not exporters might not realise that a large part of their business involves supplying or servicing an exporter.  Will the delegates comment on progress in this regard?  What can we do to address it?</p> <p>  I thank all the representatives, especially those from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  They have done a huge amount of work in building and supporting businesses.  In Galway, there is a significant medical devices industry that was not there 20 years ago.  In Cork, there is a huge pharmaceutical industry.  Therefore, there is a spread.</p><p>I wonder now, given that the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin is chock-a-block, whether there is a huge opportunity to invite more financial service operators, particularly from Asia and Australasia, into Dublin Airport where there is room to build another such centre.  I had to get that little plug in before I let the witnesses go.</p></speech>

Senator Reilly is absolutely right: many SMEs are not aware of their supply chains and where they sit within them.  This is a key part of our messaging.  When we have gone out all around the country, in the North and South of Ireland, we have told businesses they really need to look at where they sit within their supply chains, look up them, look down them and see how Brexit in all its permutations may impact upon their business.  We are trying our very best to get this message out.  It relates a little to Senator Davitt's point on SMEs.  Through our very latest supply chain reports, research which will come out, I hope, next week, we are seeing just how important SMEs are to all-island trade.  We all know they are the backbone of our economy and that they contribute approximately 50% to gross value added, GVA, in Ireland, but when we looked at businesses that are trading across the Border, we saw that the majority are SMEs and are trading within supply chains in component parts.  It is important they have both the space and the opportunity to grow on both sides of the Border if we want to see cross-Border trade continue to develop at the pace it has done so.  Over the past 18 years we have seen cross-Border trade increase on average by 4% per annum.  We want to see that continue to grow and really take up its full potential.</p></speech>

The voucher is one element of the Brexit advisory service and how we engage with companies.  One can also access the website for information, a glossary of terms, a targeted database etc.  The value is an issue.  It was &euro;1,000, but during the course of 2017 it was increased to &euro;2,000 following feedback from companies and engagement with service providers on that.  When they receive a value from that in terms of a report, it is not the end of the journey.  It is used to signpost other services through InterTradeIreland such as our innovation team and our products through that which help them then to act.  This is the information being scoped out as part of the start to plan voucher and other agency supports around that.  We also have plans through the course of this year to add a follow-on, a start to act voucher that will be of an increased financial amount.  This will play in as talks move on, there is more information and companies then take that action.</p></speech>

For example, they may be servicing or providing supplies to a company that is exposed to the UK market.  We also need to remember that companies will be exposed if they are buying from the UK market.  The vast majority of product coming into this country comes from or through the UK, so that is an impact for our companies.  This is why, going back to the scorecard, and this is one piece of the scorecard, companies really need to look at how they might be exposed on that side of their business as well, hence our focus on strategic sourcing, helping companies to see whether they are buying their product in the right place, the implications, and what changes they might need to match their business on that sourcing side to ensure they are not heavily hit on that side as well.</p></speech>

It was a very informative session.  We will continue to monitor Brexit developments.  We are looking at it purely from a business, enterprise and innovation point of view.  We will probably invite the witnesses back in about six months.  I hope they will be available to come back again.  The situation is very fluid, as we all know, but we will be keeping them on their toes.</p></speech>
