As the committee knows, the general scheme of the Bill was approved by the Government last July.  The scheme, together with the regulatory impact assessment, has been published on my Department's website and forwarded to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>  The main purpose of the proposed Bill is twofold: first, to provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions and individual enterprises; and, second, to provide for a new statutory framework to allow the setting of minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers.  In effect, it is a framework designed to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements struck down by the Supreme Court in the McGowan judgment.  These agreements, prior to structural changes codified in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, were made between a trade union and an employer's organisation through a relevant joint industrial council and, subject to certain conditions, registered by the Labour Court.  This registration meant that the agreement applied to every worker of a particular class, type or group and to his or her employer, regardless of whether the worker or employer was a party to the original agreement.  Their utility was reflected in the fact that prior to the McGowan judgment, six sectoral REAs had been registered or varied by the Labour Court and between 70,000 and 80,000 workers were covered.  </p><p>  The Government was of the view that a framework to facilitate sectoral terms and conditions was in the public interest and the general scheme, as published, is designed to deliver one.  There has been extensive consultation with stakeholders on these proposals.  In early 2014 a framework document setting out draft proposals on the issue was circulated by the Department to relevant employer and worker representative organisations and the subject of subsequent engagement and discussion.  The input of these stakeholders in the context of the consultation process has been very constructive and informed the approach proposed in the Bill.  While stakeholders have concerns about some elements of the overall scheme, it is fair to say there is broad support from employer and worker representative organisations for the proposed new framework and a desire to have it put in place as soon as possible.  </p><p>  For the purposes of outlining the background, the committee will be aware that in May 2013 the judgment in the McGowan case was published.  The Supreme Court held that Part 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid, having regard to Article 15.2.1o of the Constitution.  That articles provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas.  In that case, the Supreme Court took the view that the registered employment agreements were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals which impacted on all employees and employers in the relevant sector.  While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law-making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what was permissible under the Constitution.  The effect of this decision was to strike down as unconstitutional the registration of agreements previously registered under the 1946 Act.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law.  </p><p>  It is important to remember that the existing contractual rights and sectors covered by REAs were unaffected by the ruling.  Contractual rights can only be altered by agreement between the parties involved.  However, it means that since May 2013 new employees in these sectors can be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers.</p> <p>This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  In addition, as a result of the striking down of the registered employment agreements, a not insignificant level of industrial unrest in relation to procurement contracts and appropriate rates of pay has developed recently, particularly in relation to construction-related projects.<br/>From the parties' perspective, the primary objective of REAs was to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that would apply when the employer was tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions.  The agreements also had the effect of ensuring industry terms and conditions were recognised and maintained.  In addition, the existence of these legally backed agreements was recognised under European Union law and ensured, in accordance with the EU posted workers directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction who might be using employees from lower wage economies did not obtain an advantage over local contractors in wage costs.<br/>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 included a number of provisions amending and inserting new provisions in Part III of the 1946 Act relating to the REA mechanism.  The aim of these provisions was to make the mechanism more responsive to changing economic and labour market conditions, as well as making the legislative framework much more constitutionally robust, in the light of the 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace's Fried Chicken<i></i>case which struck down the system of making employment regulation orders, EROs, on similar constitutional grounds, partly by way of making ministerial orders to give registration sectoral effect.  However, the effect of the 2013 Supreme Court ruling was to make Part III of the 1946 Act void <i>ab initio </i>and consequently the amendments and additional provisions inserted in the 1946 Act by the 2012 Act were no longer either coherent or effective.  However, while the Supreme Court ruling only addressed Part III of the 1946 Act in its unamended form, there is uncertainty as to whether the new provisions of the 1946 Act, as then amended, would withstand constitutional scrutiny based on the approach taken to Article 15.2.1<sup>o</sup>in the McGowan<i></i>judgment.  Accordingly, having considered the legal advice from the Attorney General on the implications of the Supreme Court ruling and given the importance of the issue for employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts, the Government has decided to legislate to address the ruling and provide for a revised legislative framework that would be fully informed by the Supreme Court judgment and expected to withstand constitutional challenge to the greatest extent possible.  <br/>As I said, the primary objective of legally binding sectoral terms and conditions is to provide a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that would apply when the employer was tendering for and working through contracts and to ensure industry terms and conditions and standards were recognised and maintained.  The draft scheme does this.  The new framework will provide a mechanism whereby the existence of legally binding terms and conditions of employment relating to rates of remuneration and sick pay, pensions and mortality provision in a particular sector will contribute to the promotion of harmonious industrial relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest in the sector,  the promotion and preservation of high standards of training and qualifications in the<br/>sector and ensuring fair and sustainable rates of remuneration in the sector, in the light of EU law on the transnational provision of services.<br/>In the future it is proposed that the Labour Court, when requested to do so, will initiate a review of the pay, pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister in the matter.  A trade union or employer body that is substantially representative of workers or employers of such workers in a sector may make an application to the Labour Court to initiate the process looking for a possible recommendation to be made to the Minister to make the order.  Interested parties - this is an important point from a legal perspective - will be given an opportunity to make submissions to the Labour Court in the context of such a review.  The new legislation will provide the Labour Court with specific principles and policies that it will be obliged to take into account when considering whether to make and, if so, what recommendation to make to the Minister in relation to pay, pension and sick pay terms in a particular sector.  If satisfied, the Minister will give effect to the recommendation by order.  The standard Oireachtas oversight provisions will apply.<br/>In addition, the Bill provides for mandatory dispute settling procedures to be included in a Labour Court recommendation to the Minister in the event of a trade dispute in relation to the provisions of the order.  Provision will be made to allow firms in financial difficulty to apply for a temporary derogation from the obligation to pay the rate of remuneration provided for in an order.</p> <p>Additional protections will be introduced in the form of anti-penalisation measures to protect workers who invoke any right conferred on the worker by the Act or take other specified actions under the Act.</p><p> The enforcement and compliance measure to be provided for in regard to the new sectoral terms and conditions will be drafted to ensure consistency with the measures proposed in regard to employment rights compliance and enforcement provisions under the separate workplace relations Bill.  In addition to the new sectoral framework, it is proposed to reintroduce the facility for the registration of employment agreements to which there are only subscribing parties and which are voluntarily entered into by those parties.  Enterprise-level registered employment agreements provide certainty for the employer and worker in terms of rates of pay and other terms and conditions over the period of the agreement.  Furthermore, all such agreements will be required to contain a provision that, if a trade dispute occurs between workers and their employer, a strike or lockout shall not take place until the dispute has been submitted for settlement by negotiation in the manner specified in the agreement, thereby contributing to industrial peace in the enterprise or enterprises.  As such agreements are not legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority that arose in the McGowan case do not apply in those cases.  For the same reasons, it is not considered necessary for the registration of such agreements to be confirmed by ministerial order.</p><p> I will now briefly outline the purpose of each head of the scheme.  Part I is the preliminary and general aspect.  Heads 1 and 2 include provisions on Short Title, citation, constructive provisions and commencement.  Part II provides for the reintroduction of a legislative framework governing the registration of employment agreements between individual enterprises or a number of such enterprises and trade unions that will be binding only on the parties to the agreement.  Head 3 provides for definitions of key terms to be used in this part of the Bill.  Head 4 provides for the register of employment agreements to be maintained by the Labour Court.</p><p> Head 5 provides that, where an application is made to the court to register an employment agreement, the court shall register the agreement in the register only where it is satisfied that there is all-party agreement that it should be registered, and it is satisfied that it is desirable or expedient to have a separate agreement of a class, type or group of workers covered by the agreement.  Similarly, the court shall only register the agreement where it is satisfied that the trade union of workers is, or trade unions or workers are, substantially representative of such workers, that the agreement is not intended to restrict employment generally, or the employment of particular workers, and that the agreement provides that, if a trade dispute occurs between workers to whom the agreement relates and their employer, a strike or lockout shall not take place until the dispute has been submitted for settlement by negotiation in the manner specified in the agreement.  In addition, the court shall not register any such agreement unless it is satisfied that registration of the agreement is likely to promote harmonious industrial relations between workers and their employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest.</p><p> Head 6 provides for the variation of registered employment agreements in certain circumstances where all parties to the agreement so agree, or, where one party wishes to vary the agreement but the other does not, the court, after exhaustion of dispute provisions, local discussions and LRC conciliation, or the workplace relations commission variant thereof, or a Labour Court recommendation, may refuse or grant such a variation as the court deems appropriate.  In addition, provision is made for a party to withdraw from an agreement following any such variation where the agreement provides for the party to do so in such circumstances.</p><p> Head 7 provides that the court may cancel the registration of an employment agreement where all parties so request, or where the registration of an employment agreement has continued after the finishing date of the agreement, on the application of any party made after three months' notice to the court and consented to by all parties, to ensure all parties are aware that the termination date is due and imminent.  It may also cancel the registration where it is satisfied that the trade union or trade unions of workers who are party to the agreement are not any longer substantially representative of the workers concerned.</p><p> Head 8 provides for the incorporation of the terms of any registered employment agreement in respect of remuneration or conditions of employment to be incorporated into a contract of employment.  Head 9 provides for publication of particulars in regard to registered employment agreements and the right of persons to obtain copies.</p><p> Head 10 provides that, where a trade union representative of workers or a worker affected by an REA complains to the proposed workplace relations commission that the employer has not complied with the agreement, the WRC shall consider the complaint, and if, after such consideration, the matter has not been resolved, and where an adjudication officer of the WRC is satisfied that the complaint is well-founded, such officer may direct the employer to do such things, including the payment of any sum due to a worker from remuneration in accordance with the agreement, as will, in the opinion of the officer, result in compliance with the agreement by the employer.</p> <p>Where an employer fails to comply with such a direction, the provisions of the WRC Bill shall apply, i.e., determination by the Labour Court and order of the District Court.  The head also provides that where the Labour Court is satisfied that a strike is in contravention of the agreement and has as its object the obtaining of remuneration or terms and conditions other than those fixed in the agreement, the court may direct the trade union concerned to refrain from providing funds to assist the strike, or cancel the registration.</p><p> Head 11 provides that the court may, where asked, give its decision on any question as to the interpretation of a registered employment agreement or its application.  In addition, a court of law, in determining any question arising in proceedings before it as to the interpretation of a registered employment agreement or its application, shall have regard to any decision of the court on the agreement, or it may, if it thinks proper, refer the question to the Labour Court for its decision, and the decision of the Labour Court shall be final.</p><p> Part III of the Bill covers sectoral minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions.  It provides for a revised legislative framework to address the issues arising as a result of the absence of any sectoral wage-setting mechanism following the Supreme Court ruling in the McGowan case.   Head 12 provides for definitions of key terms to be used in Part III of the Bill, including the definition of "remuneration".   Head 13 provides that Part III will not apply to close family members.  This provision mirrors the exclusion of family members for the purposes of the National Minimum Wage Act.</p><p> Heads 14 and 16 provide that any organisation that satisfies the Labour Court that it is substantially representative of employees or employers or a particular class, type or group of workers can separately or jointly request the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration, under head 14, or the sick pay, pension and mortality pay provisions, under head 16, of workers of that particular class, type or group, and request the court to make a recommendation to the Minister as to what the court deems appropriate remuneration and terms and conditions of such workers.</p><p> Head 15 provides that the rate of basic pay recommended by the court may be in excess of the national minimum wage.  The recommendation may also provide for not more than two higher hourly rates of basic pay, based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned or the attainment of recognised standards or skills in the sector concerned, and minimum rates of pay in respect of young workers which are lower than that of an experienced adult worker, as provided for and in accordance with the relevant percentages set out in the National Minimum Wage Act.  The recommendation may include a minimum rate of remuneration for apprentices and provisions regarding any pay in excess of basic pay in respect of shift work, piecework, overtime, unsocial hours worked or travelling time.</p><p> Head 17 provides for the scope of a Labour Court recommendation in relation to the requirements for pension and mortality and sick pay schemes.  I should point out that head 17(i) provides that the Labour Court recommendation may provide for the requirements of a particular pension and mortality scheme or schemes for a class, type or group of workers, including a minimum daily rate of contribution to a scheme by workers.  It is appropriate that it makes reference to the employer as well, and this will be dealt with in the Bill.</p><p> Head 18 provides for the submission of supporting evidence from employers and trade unions in relation to their being substantially representative of relevant employers and workers, respectively.</p><p> Head 19 provides that the court shall not undertake an examination unless it is satisfied that the request applies to all workers of a particular class, type or group and their employers in the identified sector and the court is satisfied that it is desirable or expedient to have separate terms and conditions relating to pay or pension schemes and sick pay schemes for that class, type or group.  In addition, the court shall only undertake an examination where it is satisfied that the organisation or organisations making the request is or are substantially representative of the class, type or group of workers or employers in the sector to which the request is expressed to apply, and any recommendation is likely to promote harmonious relations between such workers and employers.</p><p>  Head 20 provides for procedures in relation to the holding of a hearing by the court on an application for a review under Part III.</p><p>  Head 21 provides the necessary guidance to the Labour Court in terms of the principles and policies that it will be required to take into account before making a recommendation to the Minister.</p> <p>Head 21 provides the necessary guidance to the Labour Court in terms of the principles and policies that will be required to be taken into account before a recommendation is made to the Minister.</p><p> Head 22 provides for mandatory dispute settlement procedures to be included in a Labour Court recommendation in the event of a trade dispute arising in regard to provisions of the order.  Heads 23 and 24 provide for the submission by the Labour Court to and for consideration by the Minister of the Labour Court recommendation.  The Minister shall refuse to make such an order if not satisfied that the process has been complied with.  Otherwise, the Minister shall make the order.  The standard provisions dealing with the laying of orders before the Oireachtas are proposed.</p><p> Head 25 provides that if an order has not been amended or revoked within three years, the Minister may request the Labour Court to undertake a review of the terms and conditions of the previous order.  Head 26 provides for a mechanism to allow an employer experiencing financial difficulties apply to the Labour Court for a temporary derogation from the requirement to pay the remuneration provided for by order.  Head 27 provides that the enforcement and compliance measures to be provided for in regard to Part 3 of the Bill will be drafted to ensure consistency with the measures proposed by the Minister in regard to employment rights, compliance and enforcement provisions under the Workplace Relations Bill 2014, approved by the Government on 8 July this year.</p><p> Head 28 provides that a provision in a contract of employment is void in so far as it purports to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Bill when enacted.  Head 29 provides for anti-penalisation measures to protect workers who invoke any right conferred on them by the Act or who other specified actions under the Act.</p><p> While the drafting of the legislative proposals has also been informed by comprehensive legal advice, I would welcome hearing the views of this committee on the general scheme, which will be of assistance to me in informing the drafting of the Bill.</p></speech>

The key issue in regard to the failure of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 relates to Article 15.2.1&deg; of the Constitution.  How confident is the Minister of State in regard to this Bill?  He said in his remarks that he expects the Bill to withstand constitutional challenge, but is he confident that the work he and his officials have done is robust enough to withstand constitutional challenge, or will we have to take the same road again in a year or two, particularly in regard to Article15.2.1&deg;?  I refer specifically to head 14, which allows the Labour Court to initiate a review on the basis of whether employers and unions both agree.  Is there a danger that section 14 could be in breach of Article 15.2.1&deg; of the Constitution?</p><p>  Head 26 deals with situations in which the employer's business is experiencing "severe economic difficulties".  I welcome that, but what exactly does it mean and what is the test for "severe economic difficulties"?  What process exists for a company to engage in and what role will workers in the company play?  What role can competitors who may see a company using this provision for competitive advantage play?</p><p>  In regard to part 2 of the overall scheme, the Minister of State used the words "substantially representative".  What is the test of "substantially representative"?  For instance, the construction sector employs tens of thousands of people, but at what stage does one say a particular union or group is substantially representative of that sector?  The same question goes for the retail sector and for other large areas of employment.  What process will define what "substantially representative" means?</p><p>  The committee is fortunate to have received good documentation from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the Bill, but significant detail is missing, as always happens in regard to heads of a Bill.  I have found over the years that it is the detail that is used to frustrate the implementation of the legislation, be that on the employers' or the unions' side.  When will we get a sense of the exact details on the legislation from the Minister of State?  Will we have those details before Second Stage of the Bill?</p><p>  One of the major issues of the previous JLC and REA system was that it caused many businesses on this side of the Border, particularly in the construction sector, to be uncompetitive in comparison with those on the other side of the Border which did not face this legislation.</p> <p>There was the lack of a willingness on the part of NERA to enforce the various directives that were in place.

I know that he understands from his own experience how complex this area can be.  The progress through the courts of wage setting mechanisms in the past few years has been interesting.  The former joint labour committee system was essentially struck down by the High Court in 2012 and the registered employment agreement system in 2013.  The Government has acted swiftly to close the lacuna and we are confident that this legislation is sufficiently robust constitutionally to withstand any challenge.  The Deputy knows, however, that nobody can say this with 100% certainty because we have a system in place under which any legislation can be challenged through the courts.  It is important that there be this appropriate division of labour between the Oireachtas, the Executive and the courts, but we have worked extremely hard over a period of time, particularly through the consultation process with the stakeholders representing employers and employees, to ensure we get this right, that it will respond to their needs, as well as changing needs in the economy, and that it is constitutionally robust.  I am satisfied that the legislation, when published, will withstand that test and be constitutionally robust.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question about whether parties are substantially representative, the Labour Court has a test on this.  I am confident that the test applied by the Labour Court in terms of declarations made by trade unions which are substantially representative of workers and employers will meet these requirements and that this will be reflected in the legislation.  It is important to ensure the legislation will be as constitutionally robust as possible and that these tests are met.  I am confident that they have been met in the context of this legislation.</p></speech>

The tests are stringent, properly so.  This should not be allowed, for example, to distort competition.  There is a very clear provision in the heads in that regard.  Anybody seeking a derogation of any description will have to deliver very significant financial information to the Labour Court in order to take advantage of it and the derogation will also be time-limited.  We have run this through the process of consultation with employers and trade unions and there is some experience of having a test like this with the National Minimum Wage Act which has not been invoked.  It must be very robust.  Employers, for example, are only allowed two exemptions in a particular period.  It is important that we state very clearly that this is tight and robust and will not be open to abuse.</p></speech>

There was a sense that they were using lower wage rates and that there was no enforcement; therefore, it brings in the issue of workplace relations also.</p></speech>

We have reached the stage where through the consultation process employers and trade unions, broadly, agree that we should put in place a new system to replace the old one but which would be more constitutionally robust and deliver the fairness employees expect.  The requirement to have certain rates of pay for standards of qualification is important, as is our compliance with the postal workers directive which is important European Union legislation.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that it was important that we comply with it because we must look at the transnational position and ensure workers working in this country are paid the appropriate rate.</p> <p>What we do not want is a race to the bottom which benefits no one but rather badly affects employees and standards across industry.</p></speech>

Head 15 provides that the rate of basic pay recommended by the court may be in excess of the national minimum wage.  I have always had a concern about competition across borders.  We have one of the highest minimum wage rates in Europe and, until recently, also had one of its highest unemployment rates.  There is a link between the two, particularly in the case of competition from countries with different rates.  On that basis, Northern Ireland was mentioned by Deputy Calleary.  If we are competing with them and they have lower rates, it makes it very tough for an Irish employer.  It does not have to be the Border, but can be across any border.  The Minister of State said in answer to Deputy Calleary that the aim of the provision is to protect workers.  While it protects workers, it does not protect the unemployed.  How do we ensure we get the balance correct?  Does the Minister of State consider that we have in the head the correct procedures to ensure we protect those who do not have jobs by enabling them to get them, even if it is not at the highest rate they would like?  I hope the Minister of State can put my mind at rest in that respect.</p></speech>

I appreciate where the Senator is coming from and understand where he sits on this.  Some have argued that the re-introduction of wage-setting mechanisms is somehow anti-competitive, but this is about standards also.  It is about standards of training and the retention of workers.  There has always been a premium for skilled workers, particularly across the construction sector which formerly had the REA and ERO arrangements with which people are most familiar.  We have tried to strike a balance on the competitiveness of industry across the former REA areas.  We are going through a draft Bill and cannot anticipate which sectors of the economy will engage in this process, but we are very much of the view that we must re-establish this mechanism to ensure we respect the competitive nature of business while ensuring that rates of pay apply over and above the rate of the national minimum wage where people's skills insist on that.</p> <p>It is a balancing act, but it is important to reintroduce a system such as this to ensure standards across the industry.  It is about much more than pay because it also involves terms and conditions, as well as standards and training.  I am satisfied that we are on the right path towardsd balancing these interests.</p></speech>

It is naive to think that will happen.  In fact, it is the reverse.<br/>I commend the Minister of State for the opportunity that has been afforded to us to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  This is important because of a series of constitutional challenges in the Supreme Court on the issue of collective bargaining and workers' rights.  They involve REAs, JLCs and the concept of collective bargaining.  There is an opportunity for the Minister of State to reflect on the issue today because there does not seem to be a proper constitutional floor to protect workers.  The small number of employers who took those cases effectively dismantled the industrial relations machinery of the State in terms of collective agreements.  They were able to do so because of the failure of the Constitution which favour private property rights, the weakness of powers of employment rights bodies and the lack of Oireachtas accountability in this case.  As the Minister of State said, all of this is subject to future court challenges.  We, therefore, need to ensure the Constitution is robust enough to protect workers' rights.  It is welcome that the Minister of State seems to be pre-empting the outcome of future legal challenges and I hope this legislation can withstand any such challenge.<br/>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has expressed concern about flaws in the judgment which led to the collapse of REAs in the first place.  ICTU has also made a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights.  I would like to know what is the Minister of State's view of that complaint.  <br/>The Bill needs to be much clearer on specifics.  The Minister of State said:<blockquote>A trade union and-or employer body that is substantially representative of workers or employers of such workers in a sector may make an application to the Labour Court to initiate the process looking for a possible recommendation to be made to the Minister to make the order.  Interested parties - this is important legally - will be given an opportunity to make submissions to the Labour Court in the context of a review.</blockquote>However, the general scheme does not seem to define a &quot;substantially representative&quot; organisation.  Is this a weakness?  If there is to be a future court challenge, could this be an area in which an employer could seek to find a loophole?  We must ensure we close any potential loophole; therefore, we need a clear understanding and definition of what this term means.<br/>The Minister of State also mentioned &quot;interested parties&quot;, but is there a definition of what constitutes &quot;interested parties&quot;?  Such a legal definition would be helpful.<br/>In head 7 there is no provision for notice to be given to a trade union organisation by the Labour Court of its intention to cancel an REA.  ICTU has expressed concern about this. <br/>Head 14 deals with the &quot;substantially representative&quot; of workers element.  The Minister of State might advert to it.<br/>In the case of young workers, hjead 15 makes provision for minimal early rates of basic pay lower than those for an experienced adult worker.  ICTU has expressed the view that we should not have different rates of pay based on class, type or group because, as a result, we could end up with a two-tier workforce and all of the complications and difficulties this might entail.<br/>Enforcement and compliance are obviously important because any legislation is only as valid as the State's ability to enforce it.</p> <p>If one looks at the construction sector as a good example, we have seen unscrupulous employers use subcontractors to bypass agreed rates of pay.  There are a number of examples of which the Minister of State will be aware.  A strike has been ongoing for a number of weeks.  The employer was able to deem some workers as subcontractors and avoid having to pay proper rates.  Has that been looked at in the context of this legislation?  The legislation needs to be robust and able to protect all workers.  We need to look at the loopholes that have been and are being used by employers, because that is the key to this.  </p><p> What happens if an employer is outside the Construction Industry Federation or IBEC but wants to be part of an REA?  Is it allowed to be part of it?</p></speech>

One of the important provisions of this Bill is the establishment of that sort of approach, where individual enterprises can come to an agreement and register it with their own workers.  That addresses one of the deficits identified through the courts in respect of deficiencies in previous legislation.  I agree completely with the Senator when he makes reference to enforcement and compliance.  If one looks at some of the measures that we are seeking to introduce in the Workplace Relations Bill, which we have discussed at length here over recent times and which relate to the use of compliance notices, fixed charge notices and new mechanisms for enforcing awards with adjudicators or in terms of Labour Court determinations, one can see that we want to have a similar suite of provisions available in this context to deal with issues that might arise under this legislation.  However, there needs to be consistency, and compliance and enforcement are very important.  Without proper enforcement and compliance, the legislation and its use will be degraded.</p></speech>

The reason we are reconstructing some of those systems, to a point, is that we believe it is in the public interest and the common good to do so and that it gives everybody consistency regardless of whether they are employers or employees.  A series of lacunae were identified in those cases.  One of the key deficits identified was the issue of Oireachtas oversight.  This is effectively addressed in the heads of the Bill.  It is very important that we plug that gap and make sure this is constitutionally robust.  The Oireachtas is the legislature in this State and makes the law.  Obviously, there are limited law-making functions, if I can put it like that, outside the Oireachtas, but ultimately the order will be registered with the Minister and the Oireachtas, which is very important.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane made a point about decisions relating to whether a trade union or indeed an employer body would be considered substantially representative.  The court is where that test takes place and it is important that the court be allowed to continue to do that because it is the expert body dealing with this.  The court should have the latitude to do that.  It is a very important aspect of this that the court may make a decision relating to the evidence provided to it as to whether  a trade union or an employer body is substantially representative.</p></speech>

I wish to raise two points.  Head 5 provides that the court shall not register any agreement unless it is satisfied that the registration is likely to promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest.  What criteria will be laid out?  Surely any employer and employee representatives who come together do so in an attempt to promote harmonious relations.  What criteria have been laid down for a court's refusal to register an agreement?  Are there any specifics, or is it left entirely to arbitration and the court?</p><p>  Where our EU partners have minimum wage agreements that have been breached, has an examination taken place of the models they use, given the constitutional difficulties we have had?</p></speech>

We take into account the arrangements in states across the European Union and particularly those closer to us.  Traditionally we have had particular processes and wage-setting mechanisms here.  I note that the UK decided to rid itself of those a number of years ago.  We feel it is in the public interest.  The test applied to harmonious industrial relations is whether it is in the public interest to engage in agreements of this type.  Ultimately, that test is considered by the Labour Court.  It is the Labour Court that will decide whether to recommend the registration of an agreement based on that test.  It is matter for the court to decide.</p><p>  There are a range of different wage-setting mechanisms across the European Union.  Different states have their own way of doing this.  We have made our own decision to proceed with legislation based on the fact that the superior court struck down the former wage-setting mechanism regime.  There are a range of different systems across the European Union, some of which are similar to those operated here previously, before the legislation was struck down by the courts.  We have looked at the judgments that were handed down, obviously on the advice of the Attorney General, on plugging those gaps and making sure that what we have now is robust draft legislation - on which I welcome members' comments - which I think will be accepted and supported by stakeholders right across industry.</p></speech>

I sent down a draft of our observations on the Workplace Relations Bill and it was brought to my attention last Friday that I had sent the committee the wrong observations in terms of the other Bill.  I have amended that to forward the committee my observations.  </p><p> It is important at the outset for me to clarify that the Labour Relations Commission has not had statutory responsibility with regard to the operation of joint industrial councils or indeed registered employment agreements in the past.  It is clear that the new Bill will not afford responsibility for the registration of agreements to the Labour Relations Commission-workplace relations commission.  The commission has had no role in the development of the current draft legislation and that is appropriate. </p><p> The commission historically has assisted the operation of joint industrial councils through the provision of its staff, when requested, as chairs of various councils, although not all councils.  These are experienced conciliation officers of the commission.  In particular, the commission has had a long involvement with the operation of the construction industry national joint industrial council and the electrical contracting industry national joint industrial council, which are two of the more eminent and active joint industrial councils.  The commission is hopeful that the new legislation will facilitate the employers and trade unions in such sectors to conclude sector applicable agreements, although it is not entirely clear whether it will do so.</p><p> The parties' wish to have the officers of the commission chair certain councils over the years has been a reflection of the parties' commitment to achieving consensus wherever possible in the process of developing proposed registered employment agreements for the consideration of the Labour Court.  The new Bill carries an emphasis on finding agreement on matters between employers and trade unions and that is an objective clearly consistent with the achievement of harmonious industrial relations in the economy.  I think the Minister of State placed particular emphasis on this earlier.  We must recall that harmonious industrial relations and industrial peace are a very important part of the economic activity of the State.  Compared to some of our European counterparts, we enjoy a particularly good industrial relations environment in this country.  Over the past number of years, the number of disputes involving workers has been at an all-time low.  </p><p> The commission has a clear statutory function of promoting good industrial relations.  In that light, the commission supports the concept of registered employment agreements as a means of facilitating employers and trade unions to come together to establish the basic arrangements to apply to the employment relationship in a given industry or sector.  The commission believes that competition between entities on the basic cost of labour is inimical to the achievement of harmonious industrial relations in some sectors of the economy.  The commission, therefore, believes that the structure provided by registered employment agreements, if capable of producing sector applicable agreements, is important to the effective operation of some sectors.</p><p> The construction industry, for example, has always been an industry characterised by competition between employers for business in the particular context of that industry.  I think most employers and trade unions would agree that the achievement of reasonable levels of industrial peace in this industry through various cycles has been largely attributable to the existence of a structured capacity on the part of the parties to remove the cost of labour from otherwise intense competition across the sector.</p><p> I believe that the provisions contained in the Bill, in particular, heads 6 and 10, setting out a requirement that all registered agreements will contain dispute resolution provisions involving the future workplace relations commission and the Labour Court is very important.  The history of engagement in this type of structure has been characterised by a capacity on the part of parties to resolve disputes through dialogue and negotiation.  The work of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court is focused on empowering employers and trade unions to achieve agreement between themselves and the Bill underlines the value of this approach.</p><p> Key to the effective operation of registered employment agreements is compliance.  This is a big challenge for all of us.  The Bill sets out in head 27 that the Minister is preparing arrangements consistent with the Workplace Relations Bill in this regard.  Fundamentally, this likely to involve a significant role for the former inspectorate of NERA, which will be the future workplace relations commission.  Operationally, this poses challenges in terms of ensuring effective compliance and my priority as a director general designate will be to enhance the achievement of compliance with registered employment agreements by utilising all of the compliance and enforcement mechanisms which are part of the new Workplace Relations Bill. </p> <p>These arrangements include increased powers and capacities on the part of compliance officers, as well as enhanced inter-agency capacities on the part of the Workplace Relations Commission.  If the Bill becomes law, the work programme of the future Workplace Relations Commission will have a focus on compliance with registered employment agreements.  I note, for the information of the committee, that the inspection services of NERA have handled over 4,688 cases to date in 2014, in which the incidence of breach has been high at 43%.  These cases have covered 72,634 employees and resulted in the recovery of unpaid wages of almost &euro;720,000.</p><p> The Labour Relations Commission welcomes the legislation and its intent.  Allied to the Workplace Relations Bill, the rationalisation of dispute resolution bodies, the enhancement of the work of the inspectorate which will become a body of compliance officers and the collective bargaining focus of the Workplace Relations Commission as exemplified by the current conciliation service provided by the Labour Relations Commission, the draft Bill will assist considerably to ensure we create harmonious relations in so far as possible and reasonable within the confines of the human condition among employers, trade unions, their representative bodies and employees.  It is vital for those employees who are sometimes outside the comfort blanket of formal representation to ensure in so far as possible that the floor rights of employment rights are observed and adhered to by all and, where possible, enhanced.  I understand that in the circumstances that previously obtained enhanced mechanisms were overturned by the Supreme Court, but we must balance the fact that engagement, negotiation and voluntary agreement have led to the industrial peace we enjoy.</p></speech>

ICTU is the representative body for workers and their unions on the island of Ireland.  It is a federation of 47 trade unions which operate in Ireland, with a total membership of 768,991 workers.  Congress affiliates represent tens of thousands of workers in sectors which benefited for decades from registered employment agreements and who stand to benefit from the proposed legislation.  The experience of trade unions is that many workers have seen a worsening of their situation as a consequence of the ruling of the Supreme Court in the McGowan case.  This is because registered employment agreements no longer have application beyond the subscribing parties and, as a consequence, employers who previously abided by collective agreements are now refusing to do so.  It has created an unsustainable race to the bottom based on unfair competition, with tenders for work based on bids involving wages, terms and conditions below REA rates.  This is threatening the livelihoods of workers and standards in the industries affected.  Congress welcomes the heads of the Bill as a significant step in restoring the balance.</p><p>  Once enacted, the legislation will provide legal underpinning for the operation of single company and group of companies registered employment agreements.  It will also put in place a system for registered employment orders.  Congress supports the overall legislative approach and wishes to draw the committee's attention to a number of key observations and recommendations for amendments to the heads.  The Bill does not provide adequate safeguards for workers from reprisals or threats where, for example, a worker or workers seek to negotiate or secure a registered employment agreement or report breaches of the legislation.  Critically, there can be no rowing back on the whistleblower protections afforded under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.   </p><p>  The situation of agency workers must be confirmed.  They are entitled to equal treatment, pay and conditions, as established in an REA or REO in line with the EU directive.  </p><p>  The heads of the Bill do not make provision for a minimum pension contribution by employers, only by employees.  Therefore, an amendment should be brought forward to provide for an employer contribution.  </p><p>  There is no provision for access by trade unions to members to discuss compliance with an REA or REO.  Assurances are sought about the phrase "workers of any class, type or group" and it is essential that its meaning is that the REO has three rates of pay in respect of each of the categories.  </p><p>  Technical amendments are also needed.  For example, the wording must be amended to allow groups of employees to be party to a registered agreement without the necessity to form a trade union.</p> <p>The proposed legislation is unquestionably a major step forward.  However, congress notes that the new framework does not address the deficit whereby Ireland, unlike most EU countries, does not have a system by which collective agreements can be concluded at a sectoral level and be made universally applicable for that sector.  This places employers and workers at a disadvantage compared with their EU counterparts.<br/>It is regrettable that in McGowan <i>v. </i>the Labour Court the Supreme Court did not comment on the constitutionality of the REA provisions in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.  That Act provided for employment agreements, made between trade unions and employer representatives, to be given general application by being registered by the Labour Court and by statutory order made by the Minister confirming the registration of the agreement.  It is worth noting that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights require that collective bargaining should take place at the &quot;level&quot; where it is &quot;effective&quot;.  Given the nature of employment in many sectors, effective collective bargaining can only take place at sectoral level.  This was a key point made in the Duffy Walsh report.  The consequence of the McGowan ruling means that there is still no framework for collective agreements to be concluded at sectoral level, and this is the subject of a reference, by the ICTU and our affiliate the Technical, Electrical and Engineering Union, TEEU,  to the European Court of Human Rights.<br/>Finally, congress stresses that it is urgent and critical that legislative progress to give effect to the right to collective bargaining in line with the commitment in the programme for Government is made.  We have set out in our submission our observations and recommendations according to the order of the relevant heads of the Bill.</p></speech>

The presentation has been interesting and it is good to see ICTU here.</p><p>  Ms King alluded to the fact that the lack of collective bargaining has left us with a massive problem.  The result of this has been the collapse of the previous system and we are now trying to build the complex and difficult system that will replace it.  However, there may not be confidence that this will be robust enough to stand, although it seems a simpler and fairer solution to have proper collective bargaining to resolve the issues.  Since the collapse of the previous structures, it is clear that a number of sectors are in complete chaos as far as wage rates and conditions are concerned.  We have discussed the issues here and in other forums.  In the construction, waste and retail sectors, individuals are struggling seriously due to a new form of competition which is eating into their pay and conditions to achieve a competitive advantage and until these issues are resolved, decent employers will not be able to compete in these sectors.</p><p>  One of the issues this committee has been considering concerns the length of time it takes for issues to be resolved.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvey will address this when he responds.  A case in Lucan, which is being discussed currently, involves allegations that have been made by employees against employers.  Some elements of State agencies are investigating these issues - the issues of self-employment, subcontracting etc. - but the investigations are too slow to deal with the realities of people's lives and the bills they face.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  My concern is that this experience may continue in the new workplace relations experience and the new Industrial Relations Bill.  We need an effective and timely response to people's experience if there is to be proper adherence to the rights of employees.  What is the Labour Relations Commission view on that?  What is the typical timescale within the LRC for applications and resolutions and is there a backlog?  On the issue of reprisals, it strikes me that it is difficult to legislate against the behaviour of unscrupulous employers who might create a block against staff who have applied to these processes. </p><p>  Subcontracting can be another major issue in the current labour market, particularly in construction where there is a competitive advantage among employers who either seek or forcibly seek subcontracting.</p> <p>It strikes me that the only way to resolve this issue is to rebalance in order that there will be a competitive advantage for employers to employ people directly under the PAYE system.  How will subcontracting staff be dealt with in these two areas?  </p><p> On the issue of compliance, how do we create a system under which the staff would become the police force?  If they were, it seems the system would be self-policing, but if a staff member believes he or she cannot police his or her experience in any way, there is a difficulty.  </p><p> I am still confused about the mix on the employer and employee sides.  For example, if there are two unions which are roughly equally representative of a group of workers, how will the system operate?  Similarly, how will it operate in the case of employees within an enterprise?</p></speech>

On the issue of delays, in the context of the conciliation service, the Labour Relations Commission operates a just-in-time service.  As soon as the parties involved are willing and able to engage with us, we arrange conciliation conferences.  Not only are we proactive in the sense that we do not wait for them, we contact both sides and offer our services almost on an immediate-day basis.  Our view is that it is better to avoid threatened disputes actually turning into strikes.</p><p>  In regard to the Rights Commissioner Service, we are up to date.  Effectively, when we receive a complaint in the Rights Commissioner Service - we receive over 10,000 a year - we can offer a rights commissioner hearing quickly.  For example, in the case of the complaints we received in September, hearings are being scheduled for January.  There is a high degree of productivity and case work in that regard, although, unfortunately, in the case of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal, it is an entirely different story.  That is one of the reasons we have decided on a single adjudication service under the new workplace relations Bill.  I am hopeful that, given the powers and processes being put in place, there is a reasonable expectation that if somebody makes a complaint, he or she will have it scheduled for hearing and a decision made in three to six months, depending on the nature of the case.</p><p>  A considerable number of cases in the Rights Commissioner Service revolve around the payment of wages, holiday pay, and terms and conditions of employment.  These are the bread and butter issues for any worker who is being made redundant or in the context of unfair dismissal or, alternatively, who is in work.  What we have managed to do in recent years, despite the volume of cases, is avoid the situation the Deputy addressed where justice delayed is justice denied.  I am very conscious of this issue.  However, we still have an uphill struggle to change the culture, milieu and operational arrangements for the Equality Tribunal and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in fact, the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be abolished under the new arrangements and there will be a single adjudication process.  However, it is very clear from our point of view that there will be a customer focus and delivery.  I am very conscious that it is a resource issue, but, certainly, we believe this issue must be addressed within the system because, in some cases, the delays are unconscionable.  I accept the point the Deputy made in that regard.</p><p>  On the issue of competition, to which Senator Feargal Quinn referred in a question to the Minister, I hold the view that it largely revolves around quality of service, quality of product, quality of delivery and quality of staff, which is why I made the points on labour costs.  One of the issues from which we must protect good employers is that of fly-by-night competition from people who operate systems that are not amenable to and do not observe the floor of employment rights established in domestic and European legislation.</p> <p>This creates the most unfair competition.  </p><p> The issues that must be addressed in the context of good employment are pay; terms and conditions of employment; and pensions where they apply and are appropriate.  That is why we have codes of practice and why, time and again, we issue strategy documents and statements.  The issue in the modern economy is quality of competition, product, service and the interface with employee and customer.  That is why it is important to place emphasis on it.  Registered employment agreements have the capacity to eliminate the labour cost orientation and force employers around the business of what I have suggested.  This happens in the retail market and should be happening in the hospitality sector in product delivery.  It is about learning and skills development.</p><p> Compliance is vitally important.  Because of the reorganisation, I am acting director of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  Compliance is one of the issues we must address in the Workplace Relations Bill.  Moving from the concept of an inspector to a compliance officer is very important.  It is more proactive and about regulation, both inspection and enforcement.  It will be important in the new Bill that the enforcement processes are faster and clearer.  Once the Labour Court has heard a case, we do not want people to have to go through a complex system of enforcement orders, going through the District Court or the Circuit Court, but to have fast enforcement.  People who have had decisions made in their favour by the dispute resolution bodies should actually get the money they are due before the employers involved go into liquidation or use some other device to avoid liability.  Although this is the first time I have been involved in the inspectorate and the issue of compliance, I am very conscious of this through the Labour Relations Commission in the past and the Rights Commissioner Service.  Having gone through the system, with its delays, people should not find that they cannot get the money they have been awarded because the employer has disappeared, gone into liquidation or will fight the payment all the way.  This will be very important in the context of what we are trying to do.</p><p> Subcontracting has been the bane of the construction industry, with questions such as who is a subcontractor, who is an employer and what is their social welfare or Revenue status.  This has been an issue for as long as we have been around and we must set very clear regulations for it.  In the new Bill there will be a process whereby we will be allowed to share data with Revenue, the Garda, the fraud office and other bodies and this will assist us considerably in enforcement and ensuring compliance.  The dispute the Deputy mentioned is with the LRC conciliation service.  We had a conciliation conference which did not succeed in resolving it, but we are available to the parties involved.</p></speech>

There is no registered employment agreement.  One of the biggest sectors in the past to have had registered employment agreements was the construction industry.  The only thing that stands between a construction worker and outright exploitation is the minimum wage which, by any standard, is awful.</p> <p>For somebody coming in as a trained cranesman, banksman or electrician, the only thing to which they are entitled in law is the minimum wage, which from our point of view is outrageous.  </p><p> ICTU has worked hard at trying to influence the establishment to get us to a place where we will have legislation.  We thought we had it in the 2012 Act, but it was challenged and we ended up back in the same place again.  We then had to redouble our efforts to influence the establishment to get into this space.  </p><p> Let me deal with the subcontracting issue and outline what it now means for a grade, group or category of workers.  I have mentioned some of the grades and groups in the particular industry.  Employers and trade unions can make a case to the Labour Court which will say X, Y and Z and what should happen under various headings such as the rate of pay, overtime, etc.  That gives a set of terms and conditions for the workers involved.  The regulation goes to the Minister, is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and becomes law.  It does not matter whether one's name is Mickey Mouse or J. J. and company; an employer must pay what the law states.  That provision is of huge value in the sector.  </p><p> We have had several discussions.  We are not allowed to put our heads in the sand; we must talk to employers on occasion.  They have shared their view with us that they would also like to have this legislation in place because they have found that two things happen.  First, the black economy thrives when there is no regulation; and, second, there is very bad behaviour in tendering for public contracts and everything else.  People might say they will pay a particular rate and have priced at a particular rate, but when it comes to the crunch, we have awful problems in having the rates paid to.  This legislation should make it very clear to all involved that this is now the law.  It means that when one has gone through the proper process and the legislation is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and becomes law, workers should then be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions determined.  By any standard, that provision has to be positive for those who work in the industry and also for employers because it provides for the creation of a level playing pitch.</p><p> The reason ICTU sought the amendment on the agency sector is agency workers are a particular category catered for, as Members will well know, by legislation approved not that long ago by the Oireachtas.  Any Member who saw a programme broadcast last week by the national broadcaster on agencies supplying labour will have seen that there can be a European and global network whereby people can interact to ensure workers do not achieve the rates of pay they should and that an agency can be used as a conduit.  Years ago I was here when we worked on the temporary agency Act.  At the time I described the machinations involved such that the person at the end of the chain - the agency worker - got nothing more than the minimum wage.  We are anxious that the committee give due consideration to nominating agency workers in the Bill in order that nobody, including main employers and subcontractors, will be in any doubt that the rate specified in a regulation order also applies to agency workers.  It is my judgment and that of congress that one will have agency suppliers of labour.  There are construction companies in the State which employ very few people directly and which take their labour force from labour suppliers.  Some of these companies will look for loopholes ensure they will not have to comply with a regulation order but still operate within the law.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that they will be illegal, but they will try to be within the law.  We believe that consideration should be given to closing off a possible loophole in that in order to make this as tight as it can be because it is very positive for workers in the sectors.  The other aspect, which Mr. Mulvey referred to in his contribution, is that Part 2 of the Bill allows for an employer and a trade union or trade unions to come together with the employer and have a single registered employment agreement.  That is also positive, in that there are some big employers, which I will not name, both in the public and the private sector, where industrial peace is very valuable to the State, the employers and the customers.  The registered employment agreement provides for the procedures both sides must go through before they take action that might be regarded as premature or unwarranted.  This means that there is at least a procedure which both sides are expected and have agreed to go through, before they get into the endgame.  Along with many employers, we feel that is valuable because it is an avenue where one is focused on living up to one's own part of the agreement.  What good is being party to an agreement if one does not try to live up to one's own side of it?  That is expected, and rightly so.  Much positivity may arise from registered employment agreements and registered employment orders, but I urge the committee to consider the agency issue.</p></speech>

The Minister earlier said that there is broad support for the proposed framework from representative organisations for employers and employees, and a desire for it to be put in place as soon as possible.  Does that surprise the witnesses or is it welcome that there is a general consensus that this is necessary for harmonious relations?  It is also stated under head 5, and I asked the Minister about this, that the Labour Court shall not register any such agreements unless it is satisfied that the registration agreement is likely to promote harmonious relations.  In what general areas does Mr. Mulvey think that the court would not register agreements?  The basis of an agreement is that both sides come together and want to sign that agreement.  On what basis does he think that might not be registered by the court?  The last REA provisions included six sectors.  Does he think the new framework would allow an increase in the number of sectors interested in putting in place regulations?  Does he think this is likely, discussed or possible?</p></speech>

If we return to the efficacy of the situation, it is important to remember that no major employer really attempted to set aside these agreements.  We must remember that.  By and large, the Construction Industry Federation, the major contractual body and the unions within those areas did not seek to set aside these agreements because they have brought industrial harmony and peace.  Contracts could be fulfilled, end dates decided, penalty clauses avoided, and arrangements made for travelling time, overtime, shift premiums, sick pay schemes, and so on.  There is a value in that one gets, not so much a uniformity, but certainly a sector-wide arrangement.  The alternative to this is a free-for-all.  We would not have the capacity in the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court to service the number of disputes that would emanate in individual employments across the country if we did not have some kind of agreed sectoral arrangement.</p> <p>We just simply could not have that because every huckster arrangement in the country would have a dispute.  While I do not mean that in any disparaging manner, it would affect any small arrangement, any small employer with a group of employees, and we just simply could not service that.</p><p> In a sense, that arrangement satisfied the interests of all parties.  I believe we are going to need it more than ever now, with the recovery in the economy, in particular in the construction industry.  Members will remember that, recently, when the TEEU, the union representing electricians, threatened the group of employers that if they did not adhere to the terms of the old registered agreement, there could be industrial relations difficulties, we had to intervene in those situations, and we have had no strikes.  It is about the value of maintaining the continuity of service, the continuity of employment and the continuity of business.  We are going to need that more than ever as we recover from the recession.</p><p> We should remember what has happened over the course of the recession.  Now, SIPTU and its unions are beginning to negotiate collective agreements of 2%, 3%, 4% and beyond that, and that is beginning to take root within the economy.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has already indicated that, for the Haddington Road agreement, he would be in a position to invite in the parties at some stage early next year for discussions.  The Haddington Road agreement for all practical purposes is a national registered employment agreement, if one wants to take it that way, for the collectivity of the 300,000 public servants.</p><p> Ms King made a very important point that registered employment agreements are not necessarily confined to construction or to the electrical industry, and, for example, airport fire and police workers have a registered agreement with the Labour Court, as have some other enterprises.  These are going to be vital around essential services or services that are vital to the economy, where there is an understanding in these areas.  Also built into these will be dispute resolution mechanisms, which I referred to in my opening address.  One of the most vital components of the parties in promoting good industrial relations is the use of the dispute resolution bodies of the State, which have a very good record, if I may say so, of resolving the most intractable of industrial disputes.  The issue of collective bargaining may be raised at another stage.</p><p> The vital importance in all of these issues is that we use the processes available to us, because they are free, independent and have a track record of resolving disputes, which applies equally to unions and employers.  In the context of the question the Deputy asked, I believe the economy as a whole will benefit from this because the issues of competition are linked to many other issues.  There is no competition on the minimum wage; the competition will now be on the living wage - minimum plus, whatever shape that may take.  This is the real problem which will be facing us in the coming years, and the Conservative Party Government in the United Kingdom has already started to address it.  I hope it will be addressed in the context of the low pay commission, which may need to be renamed the "living wage commission" or something like that.</p><p> That is what is going to happen.  As we always say in the adage, the construction industry lifts all boats.  That may happen again, although we hope we do not get into the same problems that related to other elements of the construction industry in terms of its financing through financial institutions.  The economy is reflecting that at the moment and we must try to have, if not so much organised change, then a situation whereby all parties who are central to this have, first, a forum by which they can address the issues that arise for them in their employment and, second, a reasonable mechanism by which these can be independently adjudicated.</p></speech>

We were not surprised, for the reasons I set out earlier, in that there is as much advantage to them in having an even playing pitch, and all of the other points around that.  We obviously interact with the employers on an ongoing basis so they would share with us at any opportunity they felt appropriate what their view was on this.</p><p>  With regard to harmonious industrial relations, the committee has heard Mr. Mulvey's view.  Harmonious industrial relations are a positive for everybody in the workplace, if they can be achieved.</p> <p>They can be achieved if there is an equity in terms of how people are dealt with, in particular if people get a decent rate of pay, are treated with respect, are properly compensated for their efforts and are rewarded in the context of terms of conditions.</p><p> Most people who go to work are adults who want a harmonious industrial relations scenario.  They want to come to work and they spend a lot of time in the workplace, so they do not come to work not wanting harmonious industrial relations.  Trade unions do not go around looking for disharmony.  There would be some who would advocate that we do but, actually, we do not.  However, we have to deal with a lot of disharmony.  If I may say it, sometimes the role of the trade union in bringing about harmony can be discredited when, in fact, the contrary can often be the case.  Notwithstanding that, as I said, having an employment regulation order that lists the terms and conditions and makes it clear to everybody what they have to pay and so on, having been through a thorough process which has ownership of the Houses of the Oireachtas, can only be a good thing.</p><p> I believe the employment regulation orders in the six sectors the Deputy is referring to come under the 2012 Act, which is still standing and operating.  The Deputy is being more ambitious than I am in this regard because my ambitions would be fulfilled if we could just get the three sectors that will not go in to go into it.  At the moment, a draft REO is published for the security sector, and the objections and so on are now coming in on that, which is very progressive for people working in the security sector; the contract cleaning sector is in discussions under the REO, which, again, is progressive; and the hairdressing sector is also having discussions.  Of course, the hotels have gone back up to the place with the green roof looking for a judicial review for some reason, the catering employers have indicated no interest whatsoever in taking part in this and retail are in the same space.  There are swathes of low paid workers in all of that, so the Deputy's ambition goes beyond mine in that, if I could ensure we could get those three groups in, we could come back and talk about who else should be in it.  All our efforts are going into trying to encourage and persuade, and whatever other appropriate word might be used, those employers to get into that scenario.  That is my response to the Deputy.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I hope the Minister will come back in after we have met all the groups so we can refer back to some of the issues the witnesses have highlighted.  We want to deal with this in a robust manner in order that, when the legislation comes before the D&aacute;il, it can be moved through fairly quickly.</p><p>  Ms King stated that many workers have experienced a worsening of their situation as a consequence of the ruling of the Supreme Court in the McGowan case.  Could she quantify that?  Words are easy but I am a practical sort of person and I deal better with numbers.  I can count my sheep in the field and I would like to know how many workers are directly affected.</p><p>  Head 26 involves a situation where an employer might be experiencing financial difficulties.  Does Mr. Mulvey see a need for an outside body to examine what this term means as it seems very vague or to adjudicate on the position of employers who may be having difficulties?</p></speech>

I counted them on the Sugar Loaf but they got hidden behind rocks, so I got used to not seeing everything the first time I looked.</p><p>  I will focus my comments on the construction industry.  First, in the downturn, five out of eight workers in the construction industry lost their jobs.</p> <p> Second, there was considerable change in the employment methodology.  I do not intend to name any of the bigger construction employer groups.  A number of them fell into liquidation due to the economic collapse.  At least six or seven of the bigger construction employers use indirect employment, for example by using agencies.  Most of the agencies are not offering employment which comes anywhere near the former registered employment levels.  As I explained before, the only law they have to comply with is the minimum wage.  Although they are in a minority, there are still employees who did not lose their jobs but have maintained their employment and whose terms and conditions did not improve, because construction workers have taken a 7% pay cut.  Turnover in the industry is very high.  Most of the new job offers, whether short term or long term, offer wages that are nowhere near previous levels, and there are extremes.  There are employers who offer extremely low wages, between &euro;10 and &euro;12 per hour.  A general operative in the registered agreement before this fell was probably earning approximately &euro;15.40 per hour while workers such as crane operators and banksmen earned approximately &euro;22 per hour.  Many people have lost their earning potential and have a major interest in the legislation passing.</p><p> Other issues are overtime and how it is paid for and travel time.  There is a long tradition regarding rates for travel time, much of which fell off the cart.  This is not anecdotal, but based on strong feedback from our membership.  We are the main union for the general operatives.  Other categories such as carpenters and electricians are in the craft unions, although we have some craft workers, such as painters.  Feedback from our members is that everybody should maintain his or her contract, even in catering and hospitality.  When the employment regulation orders, EROs, fell, before we got them back, there was an increase in employment but a 24% drop in full-time employment and a 33% increase in part-time employment.  There has been considerable slippage in the bigger sectors, such as construction, in terms of wages, pay rates and terms and conditions.  This sort of regulation order would be extraordinarily positive in getting back to where people were.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's question about head 26, although this is a matter for the Labour Court, I hope we would never be in a position where employers claimed inability to pay the minimum wage.  If it were the case, under previous national agreements we had the old inability to pay clause.</p> <p>In those cases, where we had that arrangement, an independent assessor was appointed by the court or by the Commission to evaluate the company's performance, look at its accounts and come back to the court with a report stating whether what is being claimed is true or one could vary it in terms of paying at that stage what were the national pay rounds in that case.  We have much experience over the years of using independent assessors to assess the capacity of a company to pay a pay claim.  That has fallen into disuse over the last few years but the precedent is there and there used to be ten or 12 individual practitioners who did this independently for us.  There is a limitation of about 24 months - no less than three months and no more than 24 months - and one cannot get the exemption twice in any five-year period, so one would be hard pressed to look for that in the context of even the period available to one.  That is the way it would be adjudicated, I anticipate, by the court, which would appoint an independent assessor who would look at the company's books and report back to it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014111100002#A00200"><p>I thank the sub-committee for its invitation.  The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention is an international agreement which committed certain parties to internationally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets during the period 2008 to 2012, inclusive.  The EU and its member states, including Ireland, made reduction commitments in respect of this first commitment period which will be met.  In December 2012 at the Doha climate change conference in Qatar, the parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted the so-called Doha Amendment to the protocol.</p><p>  The main feature of the Doha Amendment is that it created a second commitment period from 2013 to 2020, inclusive, in respect of greenhouse gas emission reductions for those parties which wished to enter into internationally binding emission reduction targets.  In addition, the Doha Amendment made further amendments to the text of the original protocol to be implemented in this second commitment period.  Most of these amendments simply enabled the implementation of new mitigation commitments but there are also some provisions that entail changes in substantive obligations.</p><p>  First, the list of greenhouse gases covered by Kyoto Protocol is extended, with the addition of one gas, nitrogen trifluoride, NF3.  Although the emissions of this gas are currently tiny, it is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential of 17,200.  That means one tonne of NF3 emitted into the atmosphere is equivalent to 17,200 tonnes of CO2.</p><p>  Second, the Doha Amendment provides for a simplified procedure that allows a party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period.  Previously, such an adjustment would require consensus among all parties to the protocol for its adoption and ratification by three fourths of the parties for its entry into force.  Following the Doha Amendment, an increase in ambition proposed by a party regarding its target is considered adopted unless more than three fourths of parties object, and it no longer requires ratification for its entry into force.</p><p>  Third, and finally, the Doha Amendment automatically cancels the assigned amount units of a party if and to the extent that its assigned amount for the second commitment period exceeds its average emission in the first three years of the preceding commitment period, multiplied by eight, or the number of years in the second commitment period.  This means the Doha Amendment automatically adjusts a party&rsquo;s target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010.</p><p>  The European Union, its member states and Iceland, acting in a single bloc or in "joint fulfilment", agreed to be bound by reduction targets in the Doha Amendment&rsquo;s second commitment period, specifically, to limit their average collective greenhouse gas emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80% of their base-year emissions, where most base-year emissions are from 1990.  This overall reduction commitment applies to the bloc of the EU, its member states and Iceland as a whole.  Within that bloc commitment, each member state is committed to differing emission reduction targets, strictly reflecting by design those already agreed to under EU legislation, specifically, in the EU&rsquo;s so-called effort-sharing decision of 2009.  In other words, by approving the terms of the Doha Amendment, Ireland is not committing itself to any additional emission reductions beyond those already agreed as part of legally binding EU legislation in respect of the period 2013 to 2020.</p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments under the EU&rsquo;s effort sharing decision is 20% below 2005 levels over the 2013 to 2020 period, with annual targets within that period.</p><p> Of course, those commitments in EU legislation are very challenging for Ireland, and there has been much discussion and deliberation on them at varying political and administrative levels.  Nevertheless, those substantial challenges reflect the reality of EU legislation and not the Doha Amendment itself.</p><p> As mentioned previously, "joint fulfilment" means that several parties may agree to achieve their emission commitments jointly.  Once the joint commitment has been achieved, all parties participating in the joint fulfilment are considered to be in compliance with the Kyoto Protocol&rsquo;s emission obligations.  Only if the joint commitment is not achieved does each party become responsible for its individual emissions levels.  In other words, non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol by an individual EU member state can occur only if: the joint commitment between the EU, its member states and Iceland is not achieved; the individual member state does not comply with its national target; and the member state does not buy sufficient internationally valid Kyoto emission units to compensate for the shortfall in its domestic emission reductions.  The compliance assessment for the Kyoto Protocol&rsquo;s second commitment period will not take place until 2023.  </p><p> In response to the challenges posed by EU legislation in this area and, by extension, the Doha Amendment, the Government decided the following last April.  First, as members are well aware, it decided to adopt a national climate policy position which specifies: an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and, in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p><p> Second, it decided to approve the drafting of the climate action and low carbon development Bill pursuant to a submitted general scheme.</p><p> Both initiatives underpin the iterative development of mitigation policy by means of five-yearly national low carbon transition and mitigation plans.  Each such plan will specify the policy measures which will be required to manage greenhouse gas emissions and removals at a level commensurate with the national objective of transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  It will also ensure, at a minimum, compliance with any existing mitigation obligation on the State under EU or international law, including the Doha Amendment.</p><p> The entry into force of the Doha Amendment also represents an important objective for Ireland and the EU, as part of negotiations with other UNFCCC parties as progress is made towards a new global, legally binding agreement to take effect from 2020.  It is hoped to develop such a new international climate change agreement to cover all countries at the Paris climate change conference, scheduled to take place in 2015.</p><p> Ratification of the Doha Amendment is of critical importance in the international negotiations under the UNFCCC for a new global agreement on climate change.  While the EU is already implementing the requirements of the amendment, its ratification by developed country parties, which are included in the second commitment period, is seen by many developing countries as a vital sign of good faith that commitments entered into will be implemented.  It is noted that at the recent UNFCCC negotiating session in Bonn, from 20 to 25 October, the executive secretary of the UNFCCC called on all parties to speed up ratification.</p><p> Because the honouring by Ireland of its commitments in EU legislation and, thereby, those in the Doha Amendment, will likely impose a charge on public funds, the terms of the Doha Amendment require the prior approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in accordance with Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution.  Hence, there is a need for a motion on this issue to be moved in the D&aacute;il.</p><p> In summary, because of our progressive stance on the international stage in respect of climate change and as a corollary to our existing commitments under EU legislation, I believe that it is both right and appropriate that Ireland approves the terms of the Doha Amendment.  I ask members to do so.</p></speech>

I also welcome his departmental officials.</p><p>  As I understand it, a motion will come before the D&aacute;il fairly soon to carry out this ratification process.  We ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, so it is important that we should fulfil that to the letter, including the Doha Amendment.  I am concerned that we are moving quickly towards 2020, which is just five short years away.  We still have large steps to take to ensure that we will meet our international obligations, including our EU ones, given what we have signed up to.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that Iceland and the EU are working together on this issue.  As we have seen, climate change does not respect any borders so the more countries that can be brought into such agreements the better.  I would encourage the Minister to use his good offices to achieve a consensus among as many states as possible in this regard.</p><p>  As regards the 2050 climate change targets, a recent UN report showed alarming results concerning what is already happening and what is coming down the line.  That report was backed up by a large body of scientific evidence.  I have heard scientists describe the report as emanating from the most comprehensive and broad-based research that has ever been carried out on any project or to back up any case.</p><p>  Only those who still believe the earth is flat, will deny that climate change is a problem.  Anyone aged over 30, as a good few of us here are - I am over 40 and a bit more - can see that even in our lifetimes the climate has changed.  Those are the facts of the matter.</p><p>  The Taoiseach gave a great speech recently to a big international audience, which is grand.  However, we are nearly four years into this Government's term and we need to see our climate change legislation.  I know the Minister has been newly appointed and is not long in the door, but I hope he is committed to dealing with climate change.  We tried to push the previous Minister along; promises were made but deadlines came and went.  I know that the Minister cannot rush these things, however, because we have to get them right.</p><p>  This committee carried out a large body of work in summer 2013 along with Professor John Sweeney of NUI Maynooth.  A comprehensive report was produced as a result of that endeavour.  We really need to move on this and, to that end, we want to get the relevant climate change legislation in place.  I realise that there are issues concerning how one can divvy up the obligations for various sectors.  There is a big issue concerning agriculture, not least because in some cases our agriculture is a lot more sustainable than agricultural practices in other countries.  The value of our forestry must also be taken into account, as well as the fact that we have extensive grasslands.  Those aspects must be considered carefully, but I welcome the fact that we are moving ahead to ratify the Doha Amendment.</p><p>  Nonetheless, we need to introduce our own climate change legislation.  The Taoiseach cannot preach fine words to international audiences if we are failing to put basic legislation in place to meet those obligations here at home.  </p></speech>

A copy of that was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23 October 2014.  I doubt we would be here if there was not an obligation under the Constitution.  The Minister said as much in his statement.</p> <p>It is frustratingly annoying to have spent weeks here compiling a report and conducting hearings with people here because we are required to comply.  In actual fact we are not doing what is important - the production of legislation and sectoral plans.  We decided not to have targets in the legislation but we were going to state our ambition in the sectoral plans.</p><p> The important thing, and what will show real leadership, is how we get there.  Essentially, we saw the recent negotiating strategy at European level which had a huge focus of attention on the agricultural sector.  We all know how important agriculture is to this country.  However, if one sector more or less gets a free get out of jail card then one must redouble efforts for other sectors.  Can the Minister tell us what is happening with sectoral plans?  Can he explain why we have not seen them so far?  Let me give the example of public transport.  A very significant amount of investment will be required in order to get people to shift from using a private car to using public transport and also goods will have to be moved in a different way.</p><p> Can the Minister tell us about the retrofitting of homes?  The scheme has stalled even though there was a decent uptake at the beginning.  We are putting an impossible weight on our shoulders in trying to comply with targets for 2030, given that we are playing catch-up at this stage.  We need to see how this will play out.  What relationship does the Minister have with other Departments in making sure sectoral plans come forward and targets are complied with?  How can he ensure significant investment is made in order to deliver on what is stated in the plans?   </p><p> The reason we are not in a worse compliance situation is due to the recession which resulted in a huge reduction in the amount of motorised transport.  The construction sector due to using concrete and so on was also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions during the boom but the recession has changed all that.  Therefore, we may be understating the current position at the moment.  I hope there is an upturn in the economy and we are starting to see some signs of same.  An upturn will mean we have more catching up to do because we have lagged behind.  When will the legislation be produced?  When does the Minister hope to have the legislation enacted?  Will the sectoral plans be produced at the same time?  What is the relationship between forestry in bogs and carbon sinks?  Has there been a change in approach to that area by the European Union?  Clearly, it will also be important for us to offset some of the agricultural emissions.  Birdwatch Ireland made an extremely good contribution on the role bogs play in terms of carbon sinks which completely surprised us.  The Minister needs to see how such an initiative would factor into negotiations that happen at European level.  Those are my initial comments.</p></speech>

I accept there is genuine concern about the legislation.  My plan is to publish it next month, if at all possible, and I believe we will meet that deadline.  As Members are probably aware, it is on the priority list of all legislation with a view to enacting it as quickly as possible.  I accept we need to get the legislation published.  It is a priority for the Government.  A lot of it is like an accordion as there is fallout from the legislation.</p><p>  In terms of sectoral plans and their development, a steering group has been put in place.  A lot of work is ongoing so that time would not be lost.  Those plans will, in line with the legislation, be published accordingly once the legislation has been enacted.  A timeline of 24 months has been set to put them in place in the legislation.  We might look at that aspect in the legislation, if needs be.  I accept that the sectoral plans must be in great detail and be for a defined period in order to achieve the necessary results.  </p><p>  There is a requirement to set up an expert group.  As the committee will be aware, I am in the process of concluding that aspect.  Separately Members have asked questions on the matter on previous occasions or through parliamentary questions.  The process is under way and is very near conclusion.  I hope to be able to make announcements on same.  We need that group to advise us because this is moving at a serious pace.  I refer to the technologies that can be used, the changes that float across various jurisdictions and how we can learn from such situations.  Somebody in my position needs to take very seriously the advice from an expert group.  We are putting a lot of detail into the initiative in order to ensure we are able to generate that advice for years to come.  Also, to ensure the group can act in a fairly independent way which is necessary.  </p><p>  In terms of the 2020 targets, I am on public record as saying that they were impossible to meet.  Given the circumstances in which they were designed, they were very difficult.  We, as a country, will have to address the matter.  Recently I had three meetings with the outgoing commissioner on the subject of climate change in 2030, from which an agreement was generated, and to state we believed the baseline, by which the 2020 targets were set, was wrong as was the treatment of agriculture.  I accept what Deputy Murphy said that we cannot just have some mitigation for one sector.  I agree with her that agriculture is a critical sector and that the targets set for Ireland, which are the among the highest for any European country, should not have been set.  The targets did not tally.  To put it simply, we could not meet our food production targets if we met the 2020 targets.  In addition, countries going through economic changes like we were would not have the flexibility to address the matter.  These issues were discussed along with cost efficiency, the GDP route of calculation, etc.  All of the discussion of these issues with the outgoing commissioner came to fruition because of the new agreement level over the past couple of weeks which the committee is well aware of.  </p><p>  The challenges for 2020 will not go away.  We need, through this legislation, the sectoral plans and the framework, to see how we can meet those challenges as much as possible.  We really need to look at the far more realistic and longer term period of 2030.  Ways to reach our targets for 2030 will be set out subsequently as a result of the agreement reached a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>We need to look at a whole range of areas.  Obviously, there are the four areas that have already been identified but we need to get into the finer detail regarding what work we need to do on them.  That is a challenge across Government.  A whole-of-government approach is required.  It must be driven by me and I have said to my Government colleagues that we need, as a country, to address this issue as quickly as possible.  We must put in place the proper responses across the various sectors in order to address it.  No one can be exempt.  It will be impossible to achieve the targets unless every sector meets the challenges before it.  </p></speech>

We are losing four years but the targets are not standing still.  In fact, the 2030 targets are going to be even more unachievable by virtue of the fact that we are delaying the implementation.  That should be a major concern for all of us.  There will be financial obligations but there is also a moral obligation to meet our commitments.</p><p>  I completely accept that Ireland has a different profile to other countries, particularly those which are heavily industrialised.  Those countries have different difficulties to us in the sense that they must work to mitigate some of the effects of industrial pollution.  I can visualise a Minister in 2030 saying that the targets were never reachable by virtue of the fact that we have given ourselves such a limited amount of time to meet them.</p><p>  As a matter of interest, why is this motion being put before the D&aacute;il now?  Why was this not done well before now?  It seems like now is the 11th hour and it may well be thus because we have not got the legislation in place and have dragged our feet on it.  </p><p>  We are putting an expert group in place now.  I realise that the Minister is barely five minutes in office but we went out and negotiated in the absence of expert advice which, as the Minister has pointed out, is needed if we are going to put the proper systems and policies in place to achieve our targets.  Why are these processes not happening in parallel rather than in sequence?  I have major concerns about us actually reaching our 2030 targets if we keep on delaying the process.  </p></speech>

I expressed concerns then that if we did not start the work on this, we would literally hit a cliff which we would then have to try to climb over, in terms of reaching our targets.  I take on board the fact that the Minister has only been in office for three or four months but the Government has been in power for four years.  I do not want to make a party political point here because we have a collective responsibility, as legislators to address this issue.  I would like to think that this D&aacute;il will put the necessary legislation in place to deal with this issue before its term ends.</p><p>  On the issue of bogs and their carbon sink value, can we look again at the issue of cut-away bogs?  There are extensive cut-away bogs in Laois, Offaly and several other midland counties and their value as carbon sinks must be assessed.  This is not just an issue for the raised bogs.  It is a well known fact, and scientific analysis has shown, that many of the cut-away bogs are now recreating themselves as raised bogs.  They will have a carbon sink value and I ask the Minister to ensure that this is taken into consideration.  </p><p>  We must put the sectoral plans and legislation in place and start the job.  It is so important.  We should have started this a long time ago - back in the 1950s or 1960s - but we really must do it now.</p></speech>

On the issue of the bogs, I assure Deputy Stanley that we will look into that.  On the issue of the Doha Amendment ratification, I would point out to Deputy Murphy that we are one of the first countries to engage in the ratification process.  We are one of the early movers, which sends a signal out to the rest of the community.  If we benchmark ourselves against other countries in that regard, this is a positive development.</p><p>  As part of the debate on the legislation we can have another look at the 24-month provision, which is not necessarily something that is locked in.  We can have a detailed discussion on that matter.  On the expert group, we are very close to a conclusion in terms of its composition and then it will be a matter of bringing people together.  I believe it is important to include international expertise in the group.  I am certainly determined to close it off as quickly as possible.  I appreciate Deputy Murphy's comments about that fact that I am barely in the door but I certainly want to close it off. </p><p>  On the issue of sectoral plans, I would not like the committee to think that there is no work going on in this area across Government Departments.  There is a lot of work going on in this space.  I have spent a lot of time discussing the sectoral plans with various Departments.  I was quite aware of this work in my previous role, when I was responsible for sustainable transport.  We made quite a significant amount of progress on issues such as the electrification of cars although we need to move that on to the next phase, to be honest, now that the basic infrastructure is in place.  We were trying to develop sustainable transport options in an environment where capital spending was far more limited than in the recent past.  We were trying to move things along in the context of very limited capital.  That is just one example of the work being done on a sectoral level.  Plans are also afoot in the area of retrofitting homes and for other aspects of the built environment.  There are also serious plans being developed in the area of electricity generation.  I do not want members to believe that there is no serious work going on in these areas.  There is a lot of work going on and we will see the fruits of that work.  The first critical thing we must do, though, is get the legislation published and enacted.  I welcome the fact that the Deputies who have spoken are positive about that requirement and I look forward to their positive contributions to the forthcoming debate on the legislation.  </p></speech>

I would point out that a discussion on our report on the climate change Bill is scheduled for 5 December.  The report represents an enormous amount of work on the part of the committee, carried out last year during a period of exceptionally fine weather.  We were in these committee rooms for three or four weeks.  Everyone had a very constructive input into the report and the launch of the report reflected that fact, with the very disparate groups who attended meetings all welcoming the final report.  The committee itself has strong ownership of that report and members will have a chance to debate it on 5 December.</p><p>  That concludes our consideration of the motion.  </p></speech>

The cross-reference to the definition of &quot;holding company&quot; will, in all likelihood, be out of date by the time this Bill is enacted.  A &quot;holding company&quot; is defined in section 8(1) of the Companies Bill 2012 which states company A will be the holding company of company B where company B is the subsidiary of company A.  This derives from section 155(4) of the Companies Act 1963.  We expect the Companies Bill to be enacted this year; therefore, it seems prudent for us to update the Irish collective asset-management vehicle, ICAV, legislation to reflect this.<br/>Amendment No. 5 includes a cross-reference to the definition of a holding company and is tabled for the same reason.</p></speech>

A concern I expressed, which is my primary concern, is that this seems to be a mechanism to encourage activity in this area without appropriate regulation and that there is a lesser regulatory burden on these ICAVs than there might otherwise be.  Given that it is lack of regulation in the area of financial speculation that landed us in the mess we are in, I would like to know the meaning of authorising things that are outside the UCITS regulations.  I am not familiar with them but I presume those regulations are the more normal regulatory regime.  Why are we authorising things and insulating them from the normal regulatory regime?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100003#B01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I have to be clear.  We are not authorising things that are not already authorised in terms of UCITS, AIFs or the likes.  We are putting a new vehicle in place for them to operate.  Currently, there simply is not a well-fit vehicle for them to operate in.  We already have a situation where there are similar such mechanisms as we are trying to put in place here in France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and a range of other European countries.  We are trying to create an investment vehicle for funds in this country.</p><p>  What we are doing, and I touched on it in the discussion on section 8, relating to the specific section is that the ICAV will require authorisation from the Central Bank to carry on the business of an ICAV.  It also limits the business to that permitted to be carried on under this Act and, where applicable, the alternative investment funds regulation or the UCITS regulations which govern activities on investment funds.  In essence, every ICAV will need an authorisation to carry on business either as an alternative investment fund or as a UCITS under the UCITS regulation.  </p><p>  I will defend to the death the idea that we are in any way dumbing down or reducing regulation.  What we are trying to do is treat these as they should be treated and rather than involving the Companies Registration Office in something that is not a normal company, the Central Bank will take over the role.  However, the actual level of scrutiny under the Central Bank remains, and the Deputy will see throughout the course of this Committee Stage that I am introducing a number of amendments that will further enhance regulation regarding accounting standards and so on that we will get to later.</p><p>  On the section about which the Deputy has asked me specifically, every ICAV will need an authorisation either as an AIF or as a UCITS before it can conduct any investment activity.  The UCITS regulations which are in place since 2011 already make provisions for such authorisations and a proposed amendment to the UCITS regulations contained in section 132 will enable an ICAV to apply to apply to be authorised as a UCITS.  However, in respect of an AIF, it is necessary to provide for the authorisation of an ICAV as an AIF, and section 17 simply states that chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Bill provides for that authorisation procedure.  In this section we are simply outlining the process that needs to be followed to be authorised as an ICAV.</p></speech>

I need to look into the UCITS regulations because one is flying blind in a situation like this one where one does not know how one compares to the other in terms of the level of regulatory burden and obligation.  I am concerned, particularly when I look at some of the promotional material from KPMG, Ireland's first tailor-made corporate funds vehicle.  Essentially, it was selling and promoting these ICAVs as mechanisms whereby one can avoid tax and have a lesser regulatory burden.  I know that is not directly relevant to this discussion but my concern is that we are creating two different sets of rules.  The perception KPMG seems to be putting across is that the rules here are less burdensome and that is much more favourable from the investors point of view.  I want to express my concern about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100003#B01900"><p>It is more favourable from the investor's point of view but it does not impact negatively on the Irish taxpayer because it allows the investor, and I am sure this will arise later, to avail of the check the box rule in the United States which allows the investor to be taxed on an ongoing basis instead of deferring a tax and being taxed at a higher rate in the US afterwards.  The big benefit for the investor is being able to avail of a US tax mechanism called check the box, which is a very transparent mechanism.  It is in place in the US system and is something the US system could change at any time.  In fairness to Deputy McGrath, he summed up the position very well on Second Stage when he said that this legislation is an attempt to catch up and keep up with our competitors, and that is what we are doing here.  I genuinely do not believe that it in any way reduces regulation.  It merely moves the administration of the vehicle from the Companies Registration Office to the Central Bank.</p><p>  The Deputy is right.  A number of organisations have promotional material but I am quite proud of that fact because I want to try to attract more corporate funds to this country and to do so we need a vehicle.  I know we differ on that politically but that is the rationale behind the legislation.</p></speech>

The first amendment deals with charges and the second with debentures, Chapter 2.  Both Parts reflect the established law on charges and debentures for investment companies.  The Central Bank will maintain a register of charges in a manner similar to that of the Companies Registration Office in the 2012 Bill.  The priority of charges will be determined in a similar manner to that provided for in company law.  The register of charges will be available free of charge for inspection on a website maintained by the Central Bank.<br/>Amendment No. 9 provides for the interpretation of certain terms in the new Part.  The expression &ldquo;charge&rdquo;, which includes a mortgage under current law, is expressly stated not to include a mortgage or charge over an interest in cash, money credited to an account of a financial institution, or any other deposits, shares, bonds or debt instruments.  This is in accordance with the exception of the registration requirement envisaged under the Collateral Directive, 2002/47/EC, on financial collateral arrangements.<br/>Chapter 2 deals with the registration and priority of charges.  Two separate procedures for the registration of charges are envisaged.  The first, the one-stage procedure, is similar to the procedure under the current law, namely, that particulars of all charges created must be delivered to the Central Bank within 21 days of their creation.  The second, the two-stage procedure, provides that an initial notice can be sent to the Central Bank stating the intention of the ICAV to create a charge, followed up by a further more detailed notification in 21 days of the creation of the charge stating that fact.  Where the priority of charges is not governed by some other regimes, such priority will be determined by reference to the date of receipt by the Central Bank of the particulars of that charge.<br/>Amendment No. 10, dealing with section 88, provides for the registration of charges created by ICAVs.  The section drawn is from section 409 of the Companies Bill 2012 and originally from section 99 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended by section 122 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  It provides that all charges created by an ICAV must be registered in accordance with this section.  Subsections (3) and (4) detail the one-stage and two-stage procedures.<br/>Amendment No. 11, dealing with section 89, derives from section 410 of the Companies Bill 2012 and provides for the duty of the ICAV to register charges under section 88 and the right of other parties to effect registration.<br/>Amendment No. 12, dealing with section 90, reflects section 411 of the Companies Bill 2012 and deals with situations where an ICAV purchase property which is subject to a charge.  Since this section only requires charges created by an ICAV to be registered, this section is necessary to ensure charges that were created by an individual but for which the liability for repayment is assumed by the ICAV are registered by that ICAV.</p> <p>This ensures that the records of charges on an ICAV property will be more complete.  Failure to comply with these requirements will be an offence.</p><p> Amendment No. 13 provides for a new section 91 which sets out the priority of charges.  This section is modelled on section 413 of the Companies Bill 2012.  Subsection (1) provides that priority be given to the creditor who files first in time in order to minimise the potential for fraudulent abuse and thereby protect creditors.  This priority will be subject to any overriding priority applicable to certain assets under already established law.  Subsection (2) clarifies that where several charges are registered on the same date, the charge that is registered earliest in time and on that date shall have priority.  Subsection (3) clarifies the meaning of the date of receipt of the specified particulars in the context of two different procedures for registering charges.  Subsection (4) provides that priority as to charges will also be subject to any contrary agreement between the creditors such as inter-lender or priority agreement, often entered into by financial institutions where more than one such institution lends to a particular ICAV.  Subsection (5) provides that the Central Bank does not have to enter details of a negative pledge in the register of charges.  Subsection (6) defines a negative pledge clause as an agreement not to borrow money from a third party or otherwise create another charge.</p><p> Amendment No. 14 provides for a new section 92 and concerns the registration and priority of judgment mortgages.  Subsection (1) provides that a judgment converted into a judgment mortgage shall be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the ICAV unless the procedure for registration of a judgment mortgage in subsection (2) is followed.</p><p> Amendment No. 15 provides for a new section 93 which sets out detail on the register itself and is modelled on section 414 of the Companies Bill.  The register will include details of the date of creation of a charge or the acquisition of a property and the date of receipt by the bank of the information and any other matters specified by the bank.  The bank will determine the form of the register and make it available on a website for inspection by the public.</p><p> Amendment No. 16, setting out a new section 94, provides that a certificate of registration shall be given in respect of any charge registered under this Part.  This provision is drawn from section 416 of the Companies Bill.</p><p> Amendment No. 17 sets out a new section 95 dealing with the entries of satisfaction and release of property from charge.  It is modelled on section 417 of the 2012 Bill and requires a statement.</p><p> Amendment No. 18, providing for a new section 96, is based on section 418 of the Companies Bill and provides for an extension of time for registration of charges and rectification of the register.  The section permits an application by the ICAV or an interested person to be made in court for late registration where there has been a failure to file the specified particulars of a charge within the 21 days where the omission was accidental or does not prejudice the interests of creditors or shareholders.</p><p> Amendment No. 19 proposes a new section 97 providing that copies of all instruments creating charges must be kept by the ICAV at the same place as the register of members.  The section provides that it is an offence not to comply with this requirement.  This mirrors the provision in section 418 of the Companies Bill.</p><p> Amendment No. 20, setting out a new section 98, provides that charges must still be registered notwithstanding the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, which facilitates the use of swap instruments and provides that a mortgage or charge to secure a liability under a financial contract is legally enforceable against the charger.</p><p> As I outlined on Second Stage, the rationale for these provisions is the desirability of transposing the relevant provisions of the Companies Bill to the ICAV legislation.  That is what I am attempting to do here by mirroring the most up-to-date Companies Bill, which we expect to be enacted by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I have not had time to go back to that legislation and these amendments were only made available a couple of days ago.  Are these provisions simply lifted from the 2012 Bill or are we seeing a reduction in the requirements as set out in the Companies Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100005#D00300"><p>The provisions are effectively lifted from the Companies Bill.  References to "company" are changed to "ICAV", while provisions relating to transitional arrangements in sections 419 and 420 of the 2012 Bill are omitted in this legislation because the ICAV does not currently exist and does not, therefore, require such arrangements.  These amendments represent an effort to mirror the provisions of the Companies Bill, with some tweaks.  There are no policy changes being enacted in this legislation in comparison with what is in the 2012 Bill.</p><p>  I hereby give notice of the likelihood that I will have to bring forward a number of amendments on Report Stage in view of the amendment made by the Seanad to the Companies Bill on Committee Stage.  The objective, as I said, is to ensure these provisions reflect the most up-to-date Companies Bill.  There is a fleshing out here of some of the areas in respect of which Deputy Doherty expressed concerns, such as accounting standards and the like.  This is not an effort to get away from the relevant parts of the Companies Bill.  On the contrary, it makes sense to ensure they are mirrored in this legislation.</p></speech>

Again, these provisions substantially mirror those in the Companies Bill 2012.  Amendment No. 21 introduces a new section 99 which concerns the liability of trustees for debenture holders.  This section is drawn from section 423 of the Companies Bill.  Many deeds under which trustees for debenture holders are appointed contain clauses which absolve the trustees from liability in circumstances other than wilful neglect or default.  It is considered desirable that some checks should be placed upon the power of trustees to escape liability for failure to carry out functions for which they receive payment.<br/>Amendment No. 22 provides for a new section 100 setting out provisions relating to perpetual debentures.  This amendment derives from section 424 of the Companies Bill.  That provision was first introduced to overcome certain doubts about the legality of perpetual debentures.  A provision making a debenture irredeemable or postponing it to some distant date would amount to a clog on the equity of redemption, thereby rendering the instrument void.<br/>Amendment No. 23, providing for a new section 101, mirrors section 425 of the 2012 Bill and gives the ICAV the power to reissue redeemed debentures.  Under subsection (2), the person entitled to the debentures shall have the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed.  Subsection (3) deals with situations where debentures are deposited to secure advances on current accounts or otherwise.<br/>Amendment No. 24 sets out a new section 102 which reflects the policy established in section 427 of the Companies Bill 2012 and, before that, section 97 of the Companies Act 1963.  It provides explicitly that a specific performance may be a remedy for breach of a contract to take up and pay for any debentures.<br/>Amendment No. 25 provides for a new Chapter 4 dealing with prohibition on registration of certain matters affecting shareholders or debenture holders.  The new section 103 provides that the bank has no jurisdiction to accept or register an order of any authority affecting a shareholder or debenture holder of the ICAV or any notice of the making thereof.  Again, this group of amendments mirrors the Companies Bill 2012, which is desirable in regard to the ICAV.</p></speech>

It exempts the trustee and indemnifies him or her against liability for breach of trust.  I wish to tease out the second part of this, which states "where he or she fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of him or her as trustee".  This goes to the core of what is white-collar crime.  We are talking about funds domiciled in Ireland worth approximately &euro;1 trillion, and people are investing that money in good faith.  When that money is managed in a way that does not show a degree of care and diligence, it is extremely difficult to prosecute somebody under this legislation or have them held liable.  It is extremely difficult to prove the degree of care and diligence required so has the Minister of State considered beefing up this section in the Bill to ensure there is further protection for those who have put trust in these trustees?</p></speech>

The new companies Bill has not even been enacted but we have mirrored the same provisions from that legislation.  I also take the broader policy point on white-collar crime and there is a series of a offences in that regard throughout this Bill.  I have referred to some of them already but, in this section, we have just mirrored what is in the Companies Bill 2012.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100006#E00300"><p>I understand that, and the Bill to which the Minister of State refers has not yet been implemented.  We will have to deal with the section on its own merit.  This is about exempting and indemnifying a trustee against liability, which could be quite large.  What benchmark would have to be reached under this section to show that the trustee has failed in the degree of care and diligence required?  It is okay to pass legislation with those words, which sound fine, but what are the benchmarks with the execution of this legislation?  It may not be possible to be more specific as there could be a danger of allowing others who fulfil some but not all criteria to be indemnified.  It is a catch-all reference and past experience has shown that it has been difficult, considering what has gone on in the banks, to identify legal breaches.  It is clear that in many cases there has been no legal breach, although public opinion might suggest otherwise.</p></speech>

There are approximately 70 various proceedings that can be instigated by either the Central Bank or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The issue is one of enforcement and there is significant regulation.  There is the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, regulation, for example.  I am not pretending to bring additional measures but there is a list of various enforcement measures that can be taken by the bank in the instigation of proceedings for offences, as well as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  There are many references to them throughout the Bill.</p><p>  I am open to hearing more from the Deputy about this on Report Stage but I am not necessarily sure how it can be further beefed up in this legislation.  The issue is more about enforcement and for that we have the Central Bank, a regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We are not in any way letting any fund get away with less oversight than they now would if they operated under the Companies Bill, which will soon be enacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100006#E00500"><p>We define terms in legislation all the time and we are doing so again in this Bill.  There is reference to "degree of care" and "diligence required" but there is no definition for either of those terms, apart from the fact that there must be "regard".  The word "regard" could be debated by barristers in the Four Courts for a couple of sessions with respect to "trust deed conferring on him or her any powers, authorities or discretions".  It seems from reading the section that the degree of care and diligence is defined by the trust deed conferring on him or her the powers but the section also refers to "having regard".  Could the definition of degree of care or diligence required strengthen this legislation?</p><p>  It is a minor element that goes through financial legislation all the time but in the past it may have appeared as if there has been a lack of due care or diligence in certain areas but the legislation may not be clear-cut.  Other countries have more robust legislation but we do not seem to be as strong.  The question seems to concern the definition of terms inserted, including "degree of care and diligence required" or "having regard to".  I do not have any suggestions but it occurred to me when reading the section that it could need further scrutiny.</p></speech>

As the Deputy recalls me saying on Second Stage, I am eager with this Bill to show that where the Companies Bill provisions are appropriate for the Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV, we are mirroring them in full.  The ICAV has certain additional levels of safe checks in that there must be a depository to keep assets safe.  With our regulatory structures in general, as I have seen in my new role with the Irish Financial Services Centre, etc., the regulations are - correctly - more robust than they have been.  I am quite satisfied there has been a substantial body of work done there and at a European level.  If the Deputy has thoughts on the issue, I would welcome them on Report Stage.  I see what he is trying to do but I am trying to keep this legislation consistent with the Companies Bill.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  However, with human nature being what it is, regulators will identify problem areas and try to prevent them but they cannot stop them.  They can help to prevent them.  We are exempting a trustee from liability in law but we are using terms such as "degree of care" and "diligence required", which are not defined in legislation.  It is a big issue as a regulator may try to prevent this happening; there are provisions whereby a party is not exempted if he or she is in breach of the degree of care or diligence required.  There is no clear way to show how this could be the case so there will be cases where people could be in breach of their degree of care and diligence required and be able to avail of this section because we have not properly defined those terms.</p></speech>

I am informed that those terms, particularly "duty of care", are defined in European law, particularly the UCITS directive and the accounting information system.  I do not have the information to hand but it shows how these elements do not operate in isolation or a silo and although they will be overseen by the Central Bank rather that the Companies Registration Office, they are also subject to EU regulation.  I am cognisant of the point, which is broader than this legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014111100007#F01000"><p>I move amendment No. 26:<blockquote><br />In page 58, to delete lines 30 to 37, and in page 59, to delete line 1 and substitute the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;(c) the other information provided for in the <i>Schedule</i>.</blockquote>(3) The annual accounts shall give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the ICAV at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the ICAV for the financial year.<br />(4) The annual accounts may be prepared in accordance with&mdash;<blockquote>(a) generally accepted accounting practice in the State,<br />(b) international financial reporting standards, or<br />(c) subject to <i>subsection (5)</i>, an alternative body of accounting standards.</blockquote>(5) To the extent that the use of any alternative body of accounting standards does not contravene any provision of this Part, a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of an ICAV may be given by the use by the ICAV of those standards in the preparation of its annual accounts.<br />(6) In this section &ldquo;alternative body of accounting standards&rdquo; means standards that&rdquo;.</blockquote>Changes in EU law mean that all ICAVs will eventually be subject to a requirement that the auditor must confirm that the accounts present a true and fair view.  This is a more exacting and explicit requirement and provides more detailed rules than were provided for in the Bill as published.  The manner in which the requirement can be imposed on ICAVs has been the subject of some consideration.  Section 94 permits the preparation of annual accounts to Irish accounting standards, international financial reporting standards and US and Japanese standards and envisages the standards of other jurisdictions being available also.  The effect of the amendment to section 94 will be to continue to allow for a range of accounting standards but only in so far as they are consistent with the true and fair standard.  The Central Bank will also be able to impose its own requirements on the accounting standards of ICAVs; therefore, while information can be presented for the benefit of investors in an accounting standard that they are, perhaps, more used to in terms of business, this will be allowed only in so far as these standards are consistent with a true and fair view and, if the Central Bank so chooses, with additional requirements which it can also impose.  I hope the proposed change will be welcomed as sending a signal that there will be no diminution of the overall regulatory standards for the ICAV.  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised the issue of accounting standards on Second Stage and I hope he welcomes the measure.<br/>Amendments Nos. 68 to 70, inclusive, simply correct typographical errors in the Schedule, setting out the form the accounts of an ICAV should take.  In the first instance, what should read as &ldquo;total assets&rdquo; reads as &ldquo;totals assets&rdquo; and in the second, what should read &ldquo;total liabilities&rdquo; reads &ldquo;total assets&rdquo;.  The possibility of working to a range of accounting standards will be attractive to fund managers as it will allow them to present their annual accounts in a manner which may be best understood by their particular investor base and overseas investors.  In determining precisely in other jurisdictions what accounting standards are acceptable, the Minister for Finance may make regulations prescribing them.  An amendment is included to require the Minister to consult the Central Bank and other relevant stakeholders before making such regulations and this is a common-sense precaution.  There is an amendment to section 98 on the report of the auditor of accounts to require that the auditor give his or her opinion on whether the accounts meet the true and fair standard and have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework.  <br/>This group of amendments also provides for an offence of a director of an ICAV failing to comply with his or her duty to comply with the section and corrects an oversight in section 94 of the Bill, as initiated, in that regard.  This is setting out to restrict the ability of anybody to circumvent the true and fair requirement.  If we insert it in the legislation, we can be proud of it because we will be ahead of the curve.  Although it has not yet been transposed or introduced, it is prudent and appropriate that we introduce it in our ICAV.</p></speech>

This improvement is welcome and I can see the logic of allowing for other accounting standards as long as they meet the criteria.  It all seems reasonable enough.  However, "true" and "fair" are vague terms.  I assume there is more detail as to what they mean.  Is there necessarily a relationship between including the words "true" and "fair" and the true and fair standard, which would be set down in a more detailed way?  How do we marry them?  Should the true and fair standard not be set down in a particular place or developed by a particular body?  Is the European Union doing it?</p></speech>

It is included in the 1963 Companies Act.  When we published the ICAV, we did not include the true and fair test because, up to this point, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, and alternative investment funds, AIFs, about which we are talking in relation to ICAVs have had not had to meet it.  While it has been applicable in the 1963 Companies Act for companies, we did not apply it to the ICAV because, up to this point, UCITS and AIFs have not had to apply it in this country.</p><p>  The true and fair concept is defined as a general rule of conduct or principle - the belief that businesses and organisations shall, truthfully, fairly or accurately present information on their financial conditions and operating results.  "True and fair" means that the financial statements are free from material misstatements and faithfully represent the financial performance and position of the entity. "True" suggests the financial statements are factually correct, have been prepared according to the applicable reporting framework and do not contain any material misstatement that may mislead users.  Misstatement may result from material errors or omissions of transactions and balances in the financial statements.  "Fair" implies that the financial statements present the information faithfully without any element of bias and reflect the economic substance of transactions, rather than just their legal form.  It is not sufficient for directors or auditors to reach such conclusions solely because the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  Auditors must consider whether the directors have fulfilled their responsibility in the preparation of true and fair financial statements when providing an audit opinion.</p><p>  As Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett acknowledged, given that we are involved in global competition, it is desirable to allow the information to be presented in accordance with accounting standards that might be more familiar to investors.  We do not want this to happen at the risk of the true and fair test.  This is included in the 1963 Companies Act and coming down the tracks in European law and amendments to accounting and audit directives.  Although there is no legal obligation on us to impose it in the ICAV Bill, taking into consideration the commentary of members on other Stages of the legislation, it is prudent and appropriate to include it.</p></speech>

There is a difference between accounting practices and financial standards, as dealt with in paragraph (a) versus paragraphs (b) and (c).

If companies are allowed to prepare their annual accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the State, that does not require compliance with international financial reporting standards or an alternative body of accounting standards, as listed in the legislation.  This allows companies to report accounts that are in compliance with neither the accounting standards listed in legislation nor the international standards, but only the accounting practices in the State, which are inferior to the standards that are in place internationally, whether in Canada, the United States, Japan or any other region.</p></speech>

Companies can present accounts according to standard accounting practices under the rules in this country, in accordance with various international standards as outlined in the legislation, or according to an alternative body of accounting standards as listed in the legislation.

The legislation allows companies to compile annual reports based on a number of standards.  We have now suggested that they can do so according to accounting practices here, to international standards, to Canadian standards, to Japanese standards, to American standards or, possibly, to a number of other standards.  Why do we not require them to present accounts to the Irish standards, which are the international standard anyway?  We use the European standard.  Why do we not ask companies to comply with one standard?  Five different funds might be quite similar to each other but might present their accounts in five different formats.</p></speech>

We need to provide flexibility to present the information in accordance with the format and practices in the country where most of the investment is made.

It is not something the country is obligated to do as yet under EU law; therefore, we are being proactive.

It is an issue I have raised.  Because we are giving legislative approval for the first time to these types of fund I am not convinced that we should allow flexibility to present the annual accounts for Irish domiciled funds in five ways, at a minimum; there may be others listed in secondary legislation.  It is an issue in financial institutions, some of which have used UK or EU accounting practices and there have been conflicts and differences.  There is an ongoing debate within the British jurisdiction on accounting standards and the issue is being investigated or the subject of hearings at Westminster.  When establishing something new and because this will be the first time we will have this new model, why do we not use the term "international accounting standards"?  We should try to be as tidy as possible.  Perhaps it is an issue on which the Minister of State might be willing to come back on Report Stage.</p></speech>

As discussed on Second Stage, we are introducing this system to catch up with our competitors.  If we were to introduce a system that did not offer the same flexibility as our competitors, one wonders what would be the purpose in introducing it.  The legislation also provides that the Central Bank can impose whatever set of standards and regulations it wants above and beyond it.  Between the true and fair test, the Central Bank having the ability to add additional layers, requirements and standards and the issues we have raised in the amendments, we are looking at the issue in a comprehensive manner.  It is, however, the Deputy's prerogative to table amendments on Report Stage.  If he does, I will be willing to consider them and engage with him on them.</p></speech>

However, when we are looking at our regulatory body to oversee this issue, we should make it as simple as possible.  I am open to being convinced in asking to have these funds apply international standards.  The debate globally is moving towards the use of international standards.  There is resistance to this from established practices in the United States and some of the larger countries.  I would be interested in hearing from those who operate this type of plc system whether complying with international standards is onerous.  I cannot see how it is.  It will, however, make the job of interpreting much simpler with the fair amendment tabled by the Government.   We may come back to the issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Making it flexible for them, even with the amendment, will allow funds to pick and choose the standards that benefit them.  We should not do this.  There is a risk in that regard to investors.  There may not be a risk to the State as such, but there is a risk to financial institutions located in the State that invest in these funds.  It has happened in the past.  I have been involved in a long debate with the European Union, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance on accounting standards which allow the banks not to disclose losses.  It was completely legal, however, because they had chosen to use a certain standard over another.  I wanted to raise a red flag for the Minister of State and it is welcome that we are going further than the European Union.  Unless there is a substantial reason such as it would scare off these funds, we should apply a uniform set of standards.</p></speech>

A feature of company law is that public auditors may also be qualified to audit company accounts.  In crafting section 101 similar language was used, but on reflection I believe it is more appropriate that it only be statutory auditors or firms within the meaning of Part 4 of the audit regulations.  In any case, ICAVs can only operate as UCITS and IAFs which already have to meet this requirement; therefore, the removal of the reference to public auditor in this case is purely a technical exercise to tidy up the text.  The amendment to section 103 is consequential to the amendment to section 101.  It is the straightforward and prudent thing to do and was overlooked in the original location.</p></speech>

I want to be sure the Bill robustly allows auditors to flag potential concerns they may have.  While I stand over the Bill in terms of its provisions on annual general meetings, I wish to ensure that if an auditor wishes to flag an issue to members, he or she will not be required to resign to allow motions to be moved before he or she can do so.  This issue will arise at various stages of our discussion and I will refer to it when we debate a number of other amendments.  I wish to address the issue on Report Stage to ensure the voice of the auditor is heard.<br/>Subsection (4) provides: &quot;On the date on which the holding of an annual general meeting is dispensed with in accordance with <i>section 84(4)</i>, any auditor or auditors appointed in accordance with <i>subsection (2) </i>or <i>(3) </i>cease to hold office and the directors shall immediately reappoint the auditor or auditors or appoint a new auditor or auditors&quot;.  The provisions on auditors are very much in line with company law as this probably reflects the best practice available to us.  I acknowledge Deputy Pearse Doherty's point which he also made on Second Stage that, under the Bill, it is not necessary to hold an annual general meeting.  We must ensure mechanisms are available to auditors who wish to raise concerns.  I will examine this issue before Report Stage.</p></speech>

These are large funds and cannot be compared to a local credit union.  This should not, however, weaken the position of the auditor or his or her ability to flag issues, as the Minister of State pointed out.  While I welcome the provision allowing shareholders to call an extraordinary AGM, the provision that AGMs is not necessary sticks in one's craw because annual general meetings are forums in which information is imparted and so forth.  While I am aware that we are chasing Luxembourg on this issue and I have flagged the need to introduce legislation to change the position that obtains in another jurisdiction, how is the issue of annual general meetings addressed in other jurisdictions?  I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he may table an amendment on the issue on Report Stage because this is a key aspect of the Bill.</p></speech>

I do not have the information the Deputy seeks to hand, but I will examine the matter before Report Stage.  The Deputy has correctly noted that no one turns up for the annual general meetings of these types of vehicle because they are not companies in the sense companies are understood in the Companies Acts.</p><p>  I do not want to have legislation in place that in any way weakens the voice of the auditor.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  I have an open mind on whether the Bill does this and there are some areas I wish to tease out.  Given that an extraordinary general meeting cannot be called if the persons seeking such a meeting collectively hold less than 10% of the voting rights in the ICAV, one must ask if an auditor will have an opportunity to address investors.  I will consider this matter before Report Stage and would welcome the Deputy's submissions, views or amendments on it.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 33 clarifies that UCITS, which are companies that are not investment companies under Part 14 of the Companies Act 1963, soon to be Part 4 of the Companies Act 2014, that is, UCITS plcs are also eligible to convert to the ICAV form by way of continuation.  It should be noted that there was no intention to exclude such companies when formulating this provision and the amendment corrects that oversight.  While we envisaged this easy conversion process for AIF and UCIT company funds, funds which are not constituted as companies will have to undergo a different process to become ICAVs.<br/>Other small changes in these amendments include devolving to the Central Bank the power to determine day-to-day policy considerations such as the form of application for a conversion and the manner in which the certificate of incorporation provided to the Central Bank should be certified.  The Central Bank is better placed than the Minister for Finance to determine these matters and in this instance it is not appropriate to follow the precedent set out in company law.  It is a different arrangement in terms of the Companies Registration Office.<br/>The amendment to subsection (3)(f) is straightforward in that it merely clarifies that when setting out charges for security interests related to the conversion company, the company should also identify the priority of charges.  This is something we addressed earlier in our debate on the Bill.  This amendment is simple in form and effect but it rectifies an error in the original text.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance has decided to set out these provisions via Committee Stage amendments.  These sections will be replaced by a new Part which mirrors the provisions on migrations for investment companies as set out in Part 24, Chapter 9 of the Companies Bill 2012, taking into account the specific nature of ICAVs.  The Part will facilitate the inward migration of investment funds from designated jurisdictions and provides for their continuation in Ireland as ICAVs.  It will also facilitate the outward migration of ICAVs to designated jurisdictions and provides for their continuation there.  Section 123 is the definition section and defines the terms &quot;migrating body&quot; and &quot;relevant jurisdiction&quot; for the purpose of this chapter.  Due to its expansive nature, the definition of registration documents will be contained in a stand-alone section.  These definitions are similar to those in section 1403 of the Companies Bill 2012.  It is also provided that the Minister may by regulation prescribe places outside the State as a relevant jurisdiction in certain circumstances.<br/>Section 124 gives a definition for registration documents, which is currently found in section 1403 of the Companies Bill 2011, and derives from section 256(f)(i) of the Companies Act 1990.  This section sets out the technical documentary requirements with which a migrating body must comply before it can be registered as an ICAV and authorised by the Central Bank.<br/>Section 125 sets out the principal elements of the migration process, and copies section 1405 of the 2012 Bill, derived from replicate sections 256(f)(i)-(x) of the Companies Act 1990.  This section permits collective investment fund corporates registered in prescribed jurisdictions to apply to migrate their registered offices to Ireland without having to wind up their existing jurisdiction first.  Migrating bodies may apply to the bank to be registered as an ICAV in the State by way of continuation.<br/>Section 126 contains further practical requirements in respect of the registration of migrating companies in the State.</p> <p>The key point is that the authorisation to carry on business as an AIF or a UCIT is automatic upon acceptance of an application to migrate.  It also provides that if an applicant fails to comply with the requirements of section 125, the bank will give it 30 days to remedy this failure and its failure to do so may result in the bank starting proceedings to strike it off from the register of ICAVs.</p><p> Section 127 provides house definitions for the purpose of the provisions on deregistration of investment companies incorporated in the State that may wish to migrate to other relevant jurisdictions.  Again, this section mirrors section 1,402 of the Companies Bill 2012.</p><p> Section 128 contains the detailed provisions relating to the deregistration of ICAVs who wish to continue as bodies corporate in prescribed jurisdictions.  These provisions reflect section 1,403 of the 2012 Bill.  Before granting deregistration, the bank must be satisfied that all requirements of this Bill in regard to deregistration have been complied with by the ICAV and that all fees and levies due to the bank have been paid.  The application to deregister must be accompanied by a statutory declaration stating that these requirements have been met and notice of the application must be published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  Creditors of the ICAV or holders of not less than 5% of its issued share capital may apply for an order preventing the proposed migration and deregistration of the ICAV.</p><p> Section 129 contains further provisions in regard to the deregistration of an investment company under this chapter and they replicate section 1,404 of the 2012 Bill.  Section 130 is based on section 1,405 of the 2012 Bill.  It states that where an application is made by a migrating ICAV to be registered in the State, or by a company seeking to migrate out of the State, a director of the ICAV must make a statutory declaration that the entity is solvent.  Subsection (2) sets out the requirements in regard to the making of the declaration, which must include a statement as to the assets and liabilities of the ICAV.  In addition, the declaration must be accompanied by a report of an independent person giving an opinion as to the reasonableness of the opinion of the director and the statement of the assets and liabilities.  Again, it will be an offence for the director to make a declaration under this section if he or she does not have reasonable grounds for believing that the ICAV can pay its debts as they fall due.</p><p> As with other provisions in this legislation and other amendments we are bringing forward today, the decision has been taken that it makes sense to expressly state the provisions that appear in various Companies Acts and the Companies Bill, rather than just cross-referencing.</p></speech>

We are dealing with quite technical matters, and we can all acknowledge this is quite technical and an area we do not interact with in our daily lives.  We are on page 75 of the legislation that was passed on Second Stage and there are five pages left, yet we have 22 pages of amendments.  These amendments are not like the amendments we dealt with earlier, which sought to delete words or technical details, but, instead, are supplanting entire sections and chapters of the legislation.  I have no problem with that and I understand where the Minister of State is coming from in regard to the Companies Bill, as it stands.</p><p>  The problem I have concerns a request I have made before and which I hope will find more favourable ears this time.  It makes it very difficult for Opposition and perhaps some Government Deputies when we get amendments reasonably late in the day which do not only amend the legislation but basically add another 50% to it in areas that were not looked at in the original legislation, would not have been dealt with on the heads of the Bill or on Second Stage, and which were not flagged.  The point I am making is simple.  I understand that the officials might be under pressure.  However, when the legislation is published, we get an explanatory memorandum with notes for each section, up to a certain point.  To have further explanatory notes at this stage would make it a lot easier for us in considering how the legislation interacts with company law and all the rest, given we are dealing not just with this but with the deadline for finance committee amendments at 11 a.m. tomorrow.  While we can deal with the shorter amendments that change a word or a line, when we are changing the entire Bill or adding to it, even if that is to make it more robust, I suggest that, if possible, we would have a note to help explain this.  It is about ensuring the company law provisions are dealt with properly.  Speaking for myself, it would make my life a lot easier and we might be able to get through this more quickly.</p></speech>

We provided a briefing on ICAV before Second Stage, which was useful, but we did not do it before Committee Stage.  I take the point and I know time was tight.  I am more than happy to make my speaking notes available to the Deputy now, in advance of Report Stage, which should help him if he wants to apply a further level of scrutiny.  Going forward, I have no difficulty with that, nor do my officials, and it is something we can certainly do, particularly on technical Bills like this.  The Deputy can take it as a given that I am supportive of what he has said.  In this particular case, however, I would argue we are not substantially trying to change the Bill.  It might sound like that when we are reading out pages and pages, but rather than just relying on a cross-reference with the Companies Acts, the legal advice has been that it is better to actually spell it out in the legislation.  The actual thrust of what we are trying to do has changed very little, I would contend, but I take the point.</p></speech>

The problem for ourselves, when we get this number of amendments coming in late in the day, is that the first thing we ask ourselves is where the Department is coming up with this and why it is coming in like this.  It is not clear.  When we are informed, it is then our job to figure it out and the penny finally drops that this is just about ensuring it is more robust and making sure that what is in the companies legislation is transposed into this Bill.  However, a little note of the type I have suggested would have saved myself and our office a lot of time, and would have helped us give better scrutiny of the Bill.</p></speech>

However, on advice, the Minister for Finance has decided to set out the provisions <i>in extenso</i>via Committee Stage amendments.  Section 125 will be replaced by a new part which mirrors the provisions on strike-off and restoration for companies as set out in Part 12, Chapters 1 and 2, of the Companies Bill 2012.  This new part sets out the circumstances in which an ICAV may be struck from the register and the second group of amendments, which we will get to shortly, deals with the procedures for restoration.  It contains provisions concerning both voluntary and involuntary strike-off of an ICAV.  In the case of involuntary strike-off, an ICAV may take a remedial step in order to avert the strike-off process.  The concept of voluntary strike-off is being placed on a statutory footing with certain conditions being established before the process can commence.</p> <p> Amendment No. 49 permits either the Central Bank or the ICAV to be struck off the register of ICAVS where it is not an authorised ICAV and the conditions governing voluntary and involuntary strike-offs as set out in subsequent provisions have been fulfilled.  This new section is similar to a new provision being introduced by section 726 of the Companies Bill 2012 in respect of the striking-off of companies.  Subsection 1 provides that the Central Bank may strike an unauthorised ICAV from the register of ICAVs where one of the grounds for strike-off listed in section 126 exists and the Central Bank has followed the procedure set out in sections 127, 128, 130 and 133(1).  Subsection 2 provides that an unauthorised ICAV may apply to be struck off the register of ICAVs where the condition for a voluntary strike-off, pursuant to section 131, have been fulfilled and the Central Bank has followed the requisite procedures set out in sections 132 and 133(2).</p><p> Amendment No. 50 provides the grounds upon which an ICAV may be involuntarily struck off the register of ICAVS by the Central Bank as follows: the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe the ICAV does not comply with section 13 of this Bill which deals with the provisions of registration information by the ICAV; an ICAV not authorised by the UCITS regulation 2011 that has failed to apply for an authorisation pursuant to section 18 of this Bill within 12 months of registration; the ICAV is being wound up and the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe no liquidator is acting; and the ICAV is being wound up and the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe the affairs of the ICAV are fully wound up and returns required to be made by the liquidator have not been made for six months.  </p><p> Amendment No. 51 provides that the Central Bank may notify an ICAV of its intention to strike it from the register of ICAVs, in accordance with the proposed new section 128, on foot of grounds set out in the proposed section 126.  This new section is identical to a new provision to be introduced by section 728 of the Companies Bill 2012 and it simplifies the general notice procedure for the strike-off of companies.  Subsection 1 provides that the Central Bank may notify an ICAV of its intention to strike it from the register of ICAVs, in accordance with section 128, on foot of grounds set out in section 126.</p><p> Amendment No. 52 sets out the required contents of the Central Bank's notice of its intention to strike an ICAV from the register.  This new section is similar to section 729 of the Companies Bill 2012.</p><p> Amendment No. 53 inserts and lists the remedial steps in respect of the grounds of the strike-off, as listed in section 126, that may be taken by an ICAV for the purpose of sections 128 to 130, inclusive.  For example, having been granted authorisation is a remedial step.  The new section 129 provides that, depending on the circumstances which led to the strike-off, a remedial step for an ICAV may be complying with section 13 of the Bill, obtaining an authorisation pursuant to section 18, providing details of a liquidator in up-to-date statements or providing notification pursuant to section 65 (6) of the Bill of the appointment of a director.  Section 730 of the Companies Bill also provides for this new concept of a remedial step and, as with this section, affords an opportunity to the company to avert the continuation of the strike-off process by doing one of the things listed in the section.  </p><p> Amendment No. 54 provides that the Central Bank may publish a public notice of its intention to strike the ICAV from the register of companies where no remedial steps have been taken by the ICAV since notification, pursuant to section 127.  Amendment No. 55 provides for the conditions to be fulfilled by an ICAV seeking to be voluntarily struck off the register of ICAVs by the Central Bank.  Amendment No. 56 obliges the Central Bank to give public notice of its intention to strike an ICAV off the register of ICAVs where it has received a valid application from the ICAV.  Amendment No. 57 provides that where the necessary pre-conditions for voluntary and involuntary striking-off of an ICAV have been fulfilled, the Central Bank may strike the ICAV off the register of ICAVs and the ICAV will then be dissolved upon publication of the notice of the strike-off.  Amendment No. 58 details the effect of removal from the register on the ICAV, together with its dissolution.  </p><p> Amendment No. 59 empowers the Central Bank to seek a statement of affairs of the ICAV or such further information from the directors of an ICAV that has been involuntarily struck off.  This is identical to a new provision to be introduced by section 736 of the Companies Bill and is in accordance with the recommendations of the company law review group, except for the enforcement powers given to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  In the original Bill it was intended to deal with the issue of cross-referencing.  There are some differences between an ICAV and a company and, therefore, the Minister for Finance, on advice, took the view that was important to set out these processes.  </p></speech>

I have a question on the involuntary strike-off of an ICAV and the robustness with which the Central Bank can act in this regard.  We know the three criteria which have to be met.  Section 126 sets out the grounds for dealing with an unauthorised ICAV, and refers to not having authorisation by the end of the 12 month period and so on.  It seems as though a process has to be followed which can take a considerable period of time.  Is view that it is robust enough to protect people who invest money in funds which are managed by ICAVs and so on?  A public notice will be issued in cases of voluntary strike-off.  That is not the case in an involuntary strike-off because there is usually notice with which the ICAV can comply.  In some cases it is not a case of compliance, rather, it is a notice that it will be struck off.  What type of protection is in place for individuals?</p></speech>

I take the point that it is not always about compliance, but putting in the remedial steps in respect of the grounds of strike-off is an important safeguard for an ICAV which is trying to avert the strike-off.  There are conditions for a voluntary strike-off.  Deputy Doherty asked about an involuntary strike-off.</p></speech>

An ICAV may not be registered and may not have complied with section 13.  If an ICAV continues to operate during that period of notice, which is, I understand, 28 days, it could continue to draw investment into the funds it manages.  I know the Central Bank has proposals to try to get them back, but in the case of a liquidation they will be stung anyway.  They should not be, because the Central Bank has identified a problem.  Can a requirement be included in the Bill that ICAVs do not continue to draw on those type of investment funds where a notice has been issued?</p></speech>

Where an ICAV is, in effect, going into or is in liquidation, but there is a period of time during which the fear is that it will continue to take in more funds, the Central Bank has the power to immediately stop the bank seeking new funds or issuing new shares.  It is something I am happy to re-examine between now and Report Stage.  It is not the case that a period of 28 days has to be allowed to elapse before the Central Bank tells an ICAV it is not allowed to take in any more funds.</p></speech>

The provisions here match those set out for investment in other companies in the Companies Bill 2012.  Restoration of an ICAC to the register is possible on application to the Central Bank or the High Court within up to two years of the date of dissolution.<br/>Amendment No. 60 provides that this Chapter applies to an ICAV that has been struck off under Chapter 1.  Amendment No. 61 adds a new section, section 137 detailing how an application may be made to the Central Bank to have the ICAV restored to the register.  This section is similar to section 728 of the Companies Bill 2012 in respect of striking off companies, which is derived from section 311A of the Companies Act 1963.  <br/>Amendment No. 62, section 138, details how an application may be made to the High Court to have a company restored to the register.  This section is similar to the new provision to be introduced by section 739 of the Companies Bill 2012, in respect of the striking off of a company.  Amendment No. 63, section 139, details the notice requirements for making an application to the court under section 138.  Amendment No. 64, section 140, details specific terms to be inserted in listed instances in a restoration order made by the High Court pursuant to section 138.<br/>Amendment No. 66, section 142, outlines further orders that the High Court may make on foot of applications made under section 138 or section 141.  Section 142 lists the following supplementary orders that may be made by the High Court on foot of applications made under sections 138 or 141.  That is, to give directions on placing the ICAV and all other persons in a position as if the ICAV had not been struck off, to direct the ICAV to change its name, where there may now exist another ICAV of a similar name, to order that the officers of the ICAV be held liable of a debt or liability incurred by or on behalf of the ICAV while the ICAV was struck off and such further orders as it may deem appropriate.</p></speech>

With the introduction of the new Parts to the Bill, by way of amendment here today, it is thought safest just to have a blanket referral to section 32E to cover all elements of the Bill.

We are in public session.  I remind all present to switch off their mobile phones.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Michael Colreavy, Se&aacute;n Kenny and Noel Harrington.<br/>The purpose of the meeting is to engage with Ms Liz O'Donnell, chairperson designate of the Road Safety Authority, in order to discuss the approach she proposes to take when appointed to the role and her views on the challenges currently facing the authority.  Members are no doubt aware of the Government decision of May 2011 which put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet with the chairperson designate in public session to hear her views and we trust that this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Liz O'Donnell.  I have no doubt most, if not all, members know her already.  She is welcome back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/>I draw her attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submission or opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I invite Ms O'Donnell to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

As a former Deputy and Minister of State, it is always a pleasure to come back to Leinster House, where I spent a considerable period of my life as a politician and have many good friends, in all parties and none.</p><p>  By way of background and for those who do not know me, I was elected first to Dublin City Council in 1991 for the Progressive Democrats.  Before that, I was active in the women's movement, canvassing in Mary Robinson's presidential campaign as a volunteer and as vice chair of the Women&rsquo;s Political Association.  I was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1992 and served as a Progressive Democrats Deputy for Dublin South from 1992 to 2007.  I spent 15 years as a Member of the Oireachtas and was, initially, party spokesperson on health and social welfare and later party Whip and spokesperson on justice.  In July 1997 I was appointed Minister of State at the then Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development assistance and human rights, a position I held until 2002.  In that capacity, I had a role in Anglo-Irish relations and was a member of the Government&rsquo;s negotiating team at the multi-party talks at Stormont which culminated in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  In 2007 I was promoted to a seat at the Cabinet table as Minister of State to the Government on the retirement of my dear colleague Robert Molloy.  I was a long-time member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, as well as a membe of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the first Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also served as Chief Whip and deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats.  I retired from politics following the 2007 general election and now work on a diverse portfolio of activities which includes journalism, public affairs advisory and consultancy work and lecturing. </p><p>  I am honoured to have been asked by the Minister to take on the role of chairperson of the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer my experience in the role and hope I can make a valuable contribution to reducing the numbers of fatalities and serious injuries on the roads.  I acknowledge the important public service remit of the authority and the very committed staff with diverse qualifications serving it.  In particular, I praise the work of my predecessor as chairperson, Mr. Gay Byrne, who played such a ground-breaking role in promoting the interests of road safety in Ireland.  His passionate contribution to road safety since 2006 has been immense.  He has been a tireless campaigner and helped to keep the spotlight and public focus on this important health and social policy area.</p><p>  The aim of the Road Safety Authority is straightforward - it is to save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions on the roads.  The impact of such deaths and injuries is felt in every corner of the country by every member of society.  Each fatality and serious crash has a life-altering impact on families and individuals.  The unexpected loss of a loved one in a car crash is a massive tragedy, with long-term emotional and financial loss for families.  Fortunately, in recent years Ireland&rsquo;s road safety record has improved measurably thanks to the work of the many agencies and individuals working in a strategic way to prevent death and injury on the roads.</p><p>  In taking on this role I am not starting with a blank sheet - far from it.</p> <p>The current strategy - the fourth road safety strategy - has been in place since 2013 and will run until 2020.  It my job is to ensure it is implemented.  </p><p> An evaluation of the previous Government road safety strategy, which ran from 2007 to 2012, has revealed that 686 lives were saved and that 1,400 serious injury collisions were prevented during its operation.  In addition to ensuring fewer families had to grieve the tragic loss of a loved one, this equated in monetary terms to a saving of approximately &euro;1.85 billion to society.</p><p> The fourth road strategy strategy builds on the progress made and understanding provided by the first three strategies - 1998 to 2002, 2004 to 2006 and 2007 to 2012 - tasked with improving safety on Irish roads.  In 1998, the year Ireland's first road safety strategy was launched, 458 people died on the roads.  Despite the worrying rise in the number of road deaths last year, which saw 190 people lose their lives, the number of fatalities has dropped by 58%.  This must be set against a 66% increase in the number of cars using the roads over the period.</p><p> The new strategy contains 144 actions, all of which are aimed at making the roads safer.  The areas covered by the actions include work-related vehicle safety, medical fitness to drive, drug driving, fatigue, distraction, mobile phones, vulnerable road users, emergency response and care.  Critical to the success of the strategy are an informed public that guards against complacency and high profile enforcement of life-saving road traffic laws.  The strategy requires a reduction in the number of people killed on the roads to 25 per million of population or less by 2020.  This means reducing the number of deaths from 41 fatalities per million, or 190 road deaths in 2013, to 124 or fewer by 2020.</p><p> Serious injuries will be a particular focus of the strategy.  In addition to continuing to reduce the number of fatalities, a special emphasis is placed in the strategy on the reduction in the number of serious injuries.  There continues to be systemic under-reporting of serious injuries and improving the way we capture data on serious injuries resulting from road trauma is a most important task.  Reduced numbers of fatalities and serious injuries will realise benefits for public health policy objectives, as well as result in reduced demands on emergency services.  A safer road environment will encourage more road users to walk and cycle, thereby improving their well-being, reducing congestion and improving the environment.  Better driving will reduce fuel costs and transport related emissions which will benefit everybody, especially those involved in business and industry.</p><p> The ministerial committee on road safety will continue to oversee implementation of the strategy.  Ongoing monitoring of and reporting on the progress of the strategy will be augmented by a mid-term review.  I note the broadening remit of the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The authority has changed significantly since it was established in 2006 with the addition of new functions.  New responsibilities include the transfer of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing from local authorities to the RSA, the introduction of the new plastic card licence and the transfer from local authorities of driver licensing responsibilities to the national driver licence service, regulation and management of additional vocational training for bus and truck drivers under the driver certificate professional competency programme, CPC, and the carriage of dangerous goods regulations.  An organisational challenge faces the authority to align its existing structures to ensure it is in the best possible position to deliver on both new and existing functions.</p><p> Since its establishment, the RSA has become entirely self-financing.  In 2013 it received &euro;6.5 million in funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but in 2014 no State funding will be allocated to the body.  Part of my role as non-executive chairperson will be to oversee the effective functioning of the board and ensure the required corporate governance standards are in place and functioning at the highest level.  The authority wants to ensure it is a highly effective and cost-effective organisation which offers the best value for money and which is respected as a leading public service body demonstrating integrity, trust and credibility.</p> <p> Sunday, 16 November is UN World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.  It allows us to pause and reflect on the tragedies caused by road traffic crashes.  A total of 23,592 people have died on Irish roads since records began in 1959 - roughly the population of Tralee, County Kerry.  A further 76,586 have suffered serious, life-changing injuries since we began recording them in 1977.  Already this year 163 families, friends and communities have tragically lost a loved one.  Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of deaths on the roads, there is no room for complacency.  Constant advocacy, awareness and collaboration with the Garda, emergency services and the wider public is needed to ensure members of the public embrace road safety and take personal responsibility for their driving behaviour.  </p><p> In my role as chairperson, if the committee ratifies my nomination today, I look forward to working with the staff of the RSA, my fellow board directors and other agencies devoted to road safety to prevent further needless loss of life.  I also welcome ongoing engagement with Deputies and Senators as they are very close to their constituents and concerns in their constituencies and can inform and keep me abreast of developments in their communities and concerns about road safety.  </p><p> I am happy to take questions members may have about my nomination.</p></speech>

Last year the committee visited the headquarters of the RSA in Ballina.  Seeing the analysis of all the tragedies and accidents that had occurred and how the RSA based its campaigns on statistics as they emerged was a very worthwhile exercise.  Ms O'Donnell quoted the very stark figure of 23,592, which is greater than the the population of Tralee, for those who had been killed since 1959, in addition to 76,586 who had suffered serious injuries, which is greater than the population of Galway city.  Obviously, there was a reduction in the figures until 2013 when there was a rise.  There seems to be potential for a small rise, but I hope this will not happen because the numbers are still under last year's figures.  What is the reason for this?  What would improve the position?  Could it be the shock therapy of all the advertisements carried on television?  Is there a different approach the RSA could take to bring the figures below those for 2013?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz O'Donnell" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014111100006#G00300"><p>It is remarkable that there was a rise in the number of fatalities in 2013, but that was the first rise in eight years.  Therefore, we have made huge progress thanks to advocacy, public awareness campaigns and the public embracing road safety.  However, there is a need for constant advocacy.  For example, a worrying trend has emerged where almost one in five drivers killed in 2013 had not been wearing a seatbelt.  This seems extraordinary, given all of the work done in advocacy, education and enforcement to ensure compliance the regulations on the wearing of seatbelts.  That work is being repeated in 2014, but it goes to show that when one thinks one has got the message across about the need to wear a seatbelt, laxity starts to creepin again.</p> <p>We must continue to convey the message that wearing a seatbelt is compulsory to save lives.</p><p>   Looking at the increase in the numbers since 2013, a worrying number of vulnerable road users have died on the roads both this year and last year.  A total of 30 pedestrians, 21 motorcyclists and nine cyclists have died on the roads to date in 2014.  In contrast, there is a decrease in the number of driver deaths in 2014.  In other words, young and old people, vulnerable road users, are increasingly at risk.  The RSA will be examining the statistics.  Ironically, due to the good weather this year and last year, more pedestrians and cyclists were out on the roads.  They are increasingly vulnerable, particularly with more cars on the roads due to the economy lifting.</p><p> Road use and danger on the road are changing all the time, so it is the job of the RSA to study these statistics.  There was a peak in the number of road deaths in the summer months both last year and this year.  In addition to personal responsibility and everybody getting the message that they must drive slower and be more careful, concerted enforcement efforts will have to be deployed over the summer months in 2015.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014111100007#H00200"><p>I welcome Ms O'Donnell and congratulate her on her appointment.  We will give her our full support in confirming her nomination.  I wish her well in the task she is undertaking.  I also recognise the work Mr. Gay Byrne has done.  Ms O'Donnell has big shoes to fill, but I have every confidence that she will more than surpass the achievements that have been made to date.  She will bring her own style and skills set to that difficult job.</p><p>  She is joining a very important and wonderful organisation.  It was established in recent years and it is a highly professional team of people who have done exceptional work in developing the strategy in tandem with the Government.  It is now on the fourth strategy.  Huge achievements have been made by the organisation, in tandem with the Government, in terms of the number of lives that have been saved and the number of people saved from serious injury.</p><p>  Undoubtedly, there is a challenge ahead.  Mr. Byrne made it very clear to the Government on his appointment that he did not intend to be a patsy, as it were, for the Government.  He laid down a challenge to the Government at an early stage that if it did not follow through on the commitments that were made, he would not remain in the role.  I hope and expect that the same will apply to Ms O'Donnell.  Knowing her style, she has never been one to sit on the sidelines and allow things to happen against her will.  She has always been very forthright and I expect her to bring that strength of character not in terms of standing up to the Government but working with it in a strong and effective way.</p><p>  While the organisation is run exceptionally well and Ms O'Donnell will now be its public face and will be involved in developing a high profile strategy for maintaining the importance of saving lives on the road, there is an area that falls outside her competency, unfortunately, which is enforcement.  Both Mr. Gay Byrne and the previous chief executive officer of the organisation were quite forthright in ensuring that both the strategy and the efforts made on enforcement were aligned in so far as possible.  That will be a challenge for Ms O'Donnell.  I wish her well in the effort to ensure that sufficient resources are in place to deal with enforcement.  Any independent observer of the slide in the good results of recent years would have to consider a reduction of investment in the ability of the Garda to patrol as effectively as it might wish.  That is the area of greatest concern for me.  It does not relate directly to Ms O'Donnell's role but it feeds into that role in terms of her interaction with the Government.  Perhaps she would comment on that aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz O'Donnell" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014111100007#H00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.  I intend to take the independence of the role very seriously, as did my predecessor, Mr. Gay Byrne, and the Minister expects me to do that as well.</p><p>  Of course, enforcement is a huge part of the fight against road accidents, road collisions and fatalities on the roads.</p> <p>Enforcing the law is important because it acts as a deterrent to those who are negligent in their road use.  I note that the traffic corps was reduced in size from 1,200 to 800 garda&iacute;, which is a source of concern.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will state it is doing the best it can with reduced resources by using more intelligent ways of enforcing traffic rules, including the use of safety cameras and automatic number plate recognition systems.  At the same time, it is important to the public to know that there is visibility on the roads.  There is major co-ordination between the RSA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on enforcement.  When we are strategising on drug driving or mandatory alcohol testing coming up to Christmas, there will be increased enforcement to collaborate and co-ordinate with the efforts of the RSA.  I hope to be in a position to comment on any aspect that affects road safety.  The mandatory alcohol testing enforcement, or roadside, tests have been extremely important in reducing the incidence of people drinking and driving.  The message is getting across and has reduced the number of fatalities on the roads.  The Minister will prepare legislation shortly to deal with the impairment of driving caused by drugs, but it requires legislation to improve enforcement.  The measures will be included in the next road traffic Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-11a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014111100008#J00200"><p>I congratulate Ms O'Donnell and wish her well in her role.  I also compliment her predecessor.  </p><p>  With the guidance of the Chairman, I would like to see a full relationship between the chairman of the RSA and the committee.  It is beneficial that the chairman comes before the committee on a regular basis.  While we are talking about the matter of road fatalities, in my constituency a man was killed this morning while crossing the road in the village of Hospital.  That brings home to us what this issue is all about.</p><p>  Ms O'Donnell put the emphasis on enforcement, but I am equally concerned about engineering.  Three elements associated with the maintenance of a safe road network are engineering, enforcement and education.  The RSA has an important role to play in the case of engineering.  I, therefore, ask for Ms O'Donnell's thoughts on how she envisages holding local authorities and the National Roads Authority to account for the engineering of some roads.  When the latest road fatalities take place on a Saturday or Sunday morning, they do not take place on the motorway network which, thankfully, is doing a good job.  Fatalities happen in isolated rural locations on roads that have been identified to local authority members and engineering staff as being in need of attention.  During the good days of the Celtic tiger and now the bad days very little was and has been done with these roads.  In some cases, nothing has been done.  I previously cited the example of local authority maintenance of speed limits.  In driving through Moll's Gap on the national secondary route from Killarney to Kenmare parts of the road are barely wide enough to take a single car, yet the speed limit is 100 km/h.  This shows how in the maintenance of these roads local authorities are out of touch.</p><p>  It was reported last week in the media in Limerick that cases involving GoSafe vans were being thrown out of the Circuit Court in Newcastle West.  Solicitors claimed that as individuals before the court had not received notices by registered post, there was no proof that they had received the notices.  The system is unravelling.  GoSafe vans are positioned on the side of the road, but their operators cannot give evidence before the court.</p> <p>In the context of making the roads safer, it is not exactly sending out the best signal to have loopholes through which one could drive a lorry with regard to the implementation of speed detection operations on our road network.</p><p> Another issue that has been raised before is the Road Safety Authority's operation of the National Driving Licence Service, NDLS.  At the outset I vocally outlined concerns about the implementation of service and our concerns have been shown to be well founded.  Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise are within 25 miles of each other but there are towns in the west of Ireland covering large counties where there is no outreach service for the NDLS.  In my county of Limerick, there are locations more than 40 miles away from the Parkway shopping centre where the NDLS operates.  Elderly people and those from rural and far-flung areas have no access to the service at the point of contact, which is causing much difficulty.  The problem arises routinely.</p><p> Another issue on the RSA's radar will be those people who restore and maintain vintage engines and vehicles for use on our road network who are being treated almost as some sort of pariah, for want of a better word.  There is a suggestion in some quarters that they should bring their vehicles to the 2014 standard.  As I indicated at a recent committee meeting, if the people seeking regulations had them imposed across the board, we would have former President de Valera's Rolls-Royce, with the registration ZJ 5000, dismantled in order to fit rear seatbelts, headrests and new mirrors.  That demonstrates how unrealistic are some of the new regulations for parts of our heritage.</p><p> I welcome the opportunity to have the witnesses before us and it should happen on an ongoing basis.  I hope we see them regularly.  I hope the RSA will challenge us, as this should not be a one-way street.  With the issues of road safety and potential carnage, nobody should be safe from criticism, including the Government, local authorities and the Garda.</p></speech>

With regard to engineering issues, the National Roads Authority, NRA, is responsible for major road networks but there is ongoing engagement with local authorities.  Speed limits and the quality of roads at local authority level is a matter for those authorities.  Although there is some engagement and collaboration as I understand it, I do not have authority over the state of local roads.  Of course, it is an important issue.</p></speech>

We know some of them.  One can get lost on some roads in this country not for the want of signs but because of the size of potholes.  Deputy McEntee's county would be an example of somewhere with a serious problem in that regard, along with my county.  The authority's role should be to shame these local authorities into maintaining the roads.</p></speech>

Deputies and Senators will have to understand that I have only been nominated to take up the position and I have not looked under the bonnet of the organisation yet.  I am reading myself into the brief.  Forgive me if I am not in a position to answer detailed questions such as the positions of GoSafe vans.  I will have a reply for the queries in this engagement sent to Deputies.</p><p>  There were teething problems with the driving licence function and Deputies, Senators and local representatives were not shy in bringing these to our attention.  There is a greater level of security now attached to the issuing of a new card.  I asked this question because of public concerns about delays in the initial setting up of service and the driving licence card is now being turned over in between five and eight days.</p> <p> On the Deputy's point on the siting of the driving licence service centre locations, I will have to get back to him on that because I am not familiar with this issue.  He referred to the distance between the siting of centres, particularly in Limerick.  I will arrange for a reply to be sent to him on that matter.</p><p> On the Deputy's point regarding vintage cars, it is not an aspect I had considered previously.  I am sure the staff in the Road Safety Authority will have a reply for me on that to send to the Deputy in due course.  </p><p> I agree with the Deputy that it is important that I would come back at regular intervals to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications of the Houses to report on my views and my progress in taking on the role as chair of the authority.  Constant advocacy and constant audit of how we are getting on or any trends that need addressing are important.  I am happy to come back to the committee and be accountable on behalf of the organisation.</p></speech>

I note that one in five, or 20%, of those killed on our roads in 2013 was not wearing a seatbelt.  Those are startling and alarming figures.  I was going to call Ms O'Donnell "Minister" but she is not a Minister now although she might be again.  </p><p>  The issue of national schools is a hobby horse of mine.  Many of our national schools are located on very busy roads.  I instance one school in Kildare that has five different signs alerting motorists to slow down passing the school.  I took photographs of the signs.  There are flashing lights and four or five signs on either side of the road outside the school but the only way to slow the traffic was to put down speed bumps.  It should be a policy of every local authority where national schools are located on busy routes to contemplate the installation of speed bumps to safeguard children exiting buses or cars, or crossing a busy road to enter school.  Unless such provision is made these locations are an accident waiting to happen.</p><p>  I congratulate Ms O'Donnell on her appointment and wish her every success.  She is well qualified for it and, as the Chairman said, she will have big shoes to fill.  I acknowledge Mr. Gay Byrne's contribution to the NRA over the years.</p></speech>

This means that at last the Road Safety Authority has become self-financing.</p> <p>Its financing comes from the provision of demand-driven services, the national car testing regime and the driver licensing system.  The authority's remit is very broad and includes road safety awareness and education, driver testing, and vehicle standards and related matters.  Requirements regarding driving hours and rest periods, and the use of tachographs, also come within its remit, as well as the application of the working time directive in the road transport sector.  The authority is also involved in bus and truck driver vocational training, enforcement issues relating to bus operator and road haulage operator licensing, commercial vehicle standards, and statistical data collection and research functions.  All of these are in addition to the NCT system.  The RSA is charging fees for all of these services and that is how it has become self-financing.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that inspections should cease or anything like that, but the people to whom I have spoken are saying that prices have increased to such an extent that they may be a factor in putting some people out of business.  It is really a question of balance.  Is it envisaged that the RSA will at some stage be a profit-making entity?  The business people who approached me have always made sure their delivery lorries were up to specification and so on, but now their drivers are being stopped on the road.  Ms O'Donnell might not be able to respond on this point today, but it is a concern I have.  The business owners who brought this issue to my attention are not law-breaking people.</p></speech>

Perhaps a better example is the one Deputy O'Donovan gave regarding vintage cars.  Those types of vehicles are seldom involved in accidents, as far as I am aware, and their owners often do a great deal of charitable work, which is particularly important in the rural economy.  It is about getting the balance right.</p></speech>

When farmers get talking, it is hard to stop them.  I look forward to seeing Ms O'Donnell regularly in the coming months and hope she will enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship with the committee.  We have discussed the issues that will be under her remit and some of the issues that are more appropriate for the National Roads Authority or local authorities.  I met Ms O'Donnell's predecessor at various events in recent years and he was never afraid to speak his mind.  I hope the chairman designate will bring the same enthusiasm to the role.</p><p>  It is disappointing that the road fatality figures are up this year.  We were on a fantastic downward streak for quite some time, but it is very hard to keep the numbers going in the same direction.  I am particularly struck by the figures for last year showing the number of pedestrians who were killed.  I have seen the new television advertisement which shows how different road users see the road in different ways.  There needs to be greater focus on safety for pedestrians.  Although I did not know until recently what the "N" stood for, the introduction of N-plates is a welcome development.</p> <p>There is a huge focus on young people being aware and taking care - knowing what to do on the road - but there should be more focus on pedestrians, as the numbers speak for themselves.  I wish Ms O'Donnell the best of luck.</p><p> Since the bus crash at Johnstown, County Meath, road safety measures have doubled, and people must adhere to what is set out in a large booklet, but this means less work is being done.  Fewer roads are being resurfaced and this creates danger, so a balance must be struck.  Safety is the priority.  I again wish Ms O'Donnell the best of luck and hope she is back before this committee soon.</p></speech>

Too many pedestrians have been killed on the roads so far this year.  The figure stands at 30, which represents too many fatalities in a vulnerable user group.  The RSA will make vulnerable road users the focus of forthcoming campaigns as the dark evenings approach.  Members of the public must be more aware and drive more slowly; they must be aware that hitting a pedestrian at even a slow pace is frequently fatal.  I am conscious of this issue and it will be a focus of mine.</p></speech>

What does Ms O'Donnell think of the fact that the number of penalty points for speeding offences has increased from two to three?  A driver who accumulates 12 penalty points is off the road.  Anecdotally, I have been told that there are locations in towns and villages across the country where speed detection is perceived to be an area of revenue generation.  I do not condone the breaking of speed limits, but is the scale of the penalty proportionate to the offence?  A driver accrues three penalty points for driving at 54 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, and one who accumulates 12 penalty points is off the road.</p></speech>

People will be careful not to exceed the speed limit in the knowledge that doing so will cost them three penalty points.  This applies to me too.  This deterrent works, and I support the respective increases to three and five penalty points.  Notwithstanding the inconvenience to people, the fear factor influences people to reduce their speed.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Donnell for attending and laying out her strategy.  I propose to send a transcript of today's discussion to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, for his information and consideration.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I do not see obstacles in the way.  I congratulate Ms O'Donnell on her appointment.</p></speech>
