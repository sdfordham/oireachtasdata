Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  At the last meeting the Comptroller and Auditor General agreed to provide the committee with a note on the timelines of audited financial statements of public bodies.  This was circulated to members yesterday.  Are there any comments?</p></speech>

It arose from queries by Deputy Ross about how many sets of financial statements do not meet the requirement of submission within six months of the end of the financial year.  We have gone through the requirements in regard to all sets of financial statements that we audit.  That includes the appropriation accounts which have a completion date of the end of September.  On departmental funds, there are a variety of legal requirements and none, in some cases.  There are practical reasons they have to be done together with an appropriation account, and therefore they move in lockstep.</p><p>  There are 229 State bodies which are subject to the six-month rule specified in the code of practice.  As I said at the last meeting, we prioritise the ones with the larger turnover values.  At the end of June we had completed the audit of 71 of those bodies.  </p></speech>

There is a provision in the code of practice that if it is not practically possible to complete them by the end of June an extension of time can be given by the Ministry.  That is more honoured in the breach than the observance.  Formal deadlines would not be extended.  In general, a Department should know if it has not received financial statements by the end of June that-----</p></speech>

There are constraints in many private companies in terms of meeting deadlines.  The Chairman will be well aware of this.  There are small companies which cannot meet their filing requirements within nine months and run the risk of being struck off.  Suddenly, there is a situation where taxpayers' money is tied up in various bodies.  I am not being personal, but one has to make the observation that it is patently unfair.  Proper corporate governance procedures are not in operation.  As a committee we need to make a firm statement that deadline dates have to be complied with.</p></speech>

If they were publically quoted they would lose their quotation for behaving like this.  They would not be allowed to have a quotation on the market.  These State agencies produce statements late, willy-nilly, and everybody indulges them.  It does not matter.  We get them every week and sometimes they are a year late.</p></speech>

They have reasonable budgets and I have no doubt the bulk of them have in-house accountants.  This is basic corporate governance and meeting deadlines.  The worry is the same application of deadlines which are applied by the State to private companies is not being applied in the same measure to public companies which are funded, in many cases, by taxes paid by private concerns.  As a committee we have to have consistency.  It is incumbent upon us as a committee to find out why this is happened, if it is, as Mr. McCarthy said, a resource issue and whether are there other issues.  </p><p>  We can talk about getting value-for-money and whatever, but in a lot of cases one needs to do the simple things well.  One of those is to have proper deadlines, accountability and figures delivered on time so that we are not examining figures which, in some cases, are six and seven years old.  As a committee, we have to send the message out that what applies in the private sector must apply in the public sector.  If there are issues we need to address to make sure that happens, let us address them.  At the moment we are operating in a vacuum.  Every week we come in here and invariably see accounts which are one, two or three years old.  That is just not good enough.</p></speech>

There is a definitely a capacity issue in some organisations.  The audit of the financial statements does not just focus on the true and fair opinion.  There is also the regularity and propriety work that we do, as well as the statement of internal financial control.  The difficulty can arise if there is an accounting problem and there may not be the capacity on the other side to deal with it.  That can slow down some of the work.  In other situations, if we raise an issue around travel and subsistence or the use of credit cards, for example, it can be quite time consuming to get an explanation and we are not in a position to close off the financial statements until such time as we have that explanation.  Those would be contributory factors.</p><p>  In the fishery harbours, there was undoubtedly a problem that should have been dealt with quicker but there was a capacity and resource problem.  It is an endemic problem.  I would absolutely agree with the point the Chairman made about the submission of timely financial statements.  It is something that we are trying to encourage.  I also agree with the point that the Chairman made at a previous meeting that there should be an annual report and annual discussion on this.  I would like to build on this note that I have prepared and present it on a regular basis to the committee to allow it to be monitored so that its policy and resource implications can be addressed.</p></speech>

Practically everything, except for the education sector, where there is a very particular problem, is due at the end of December.  Therefore, we are looking to carry out all of the work in the first six months of the year and that physically cannot be done.  There would be an opportunity to take everybody from the reporting side and put them into the process but then that leaves us with no reporting work being done and that area is already under strain.  To be quite honest, it is the reporting work that is generally more of a focus for the committee, rather than the financial statements.  We try to do as much work during the year of account as we can in the bigger entities, where it is efficient to do so, on an interim basis and to finish the audits of the financial statements of the bigger entities with higher turnovers and more critical issues so that they are done in the first half of the year.  We also contract out work.  The field work is actually done by contractors on our behalf but we still have to review that work when it comes in and review the findings.  Ultimately, I issue the audit opinion, not the contractors.  We contract in staff so as to boost the numbers available during the first half of the year.  We also have a general prohibition on staff taking leave in the first half of the year.  We are doing everything we can to maximise the resource that is available for the audit in the first half of the year but inevitably, then, it is the second half of the year, at management level, before we can turn to reviewing the financial statements of the smaller entities.</p></speech>

There is a graphic on page three of the note which basically shows the number of audits completed in a particular year and the number uncompleted at the end of that same year.  That could include work that has been ongoing for two years or more, in some cases.  It is a constant struggle to try to ensure that at least within 12 months everything is cleared.  We always have cases that persist and carry on into the following year.</p></speech>

If persistent problems arise every year with audits, they need to be highlighted.  It is incumbent on us as a committee to ensure that this happens.</p><p>  The budget is drawn up every year and has an impact on ordinary peoples' lives.  If accounts are filed on time, we will know exactly what is happening in particular sectors and decisions can be taken quickly which could end up saving money for the taxpayer and consequently, making more money available for the delivery of services on the ground.  This is not rocket science but on the face of it, if around 70% of accounts are not audited or provided on time-----</p></speech>

Our remit is very simple.  We are charged with ensuring proper accountability <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the public purse and taxpayers' money.  When I talk about taxpayers I include unemployed people who pay VAT, for example.  I refer to every person who is walking the streets and is spending money.  We must get to the root of this problem.  It is boring and is not up in stars but it is a bread and butter issue that affects real peoples' lives.</p></speech>

Is there any way he could give us the figures for a period before 2008?

We are up at approximately 375 entities and there had been a build up from 2000 in that regard.  Ironically, one of the issues that is causing a difficulty now is the amalgamation of bodies because that makes it trickier to close out the financial statements and so on.  When a new entity is created we must decide on the appropriate format for the accounts and that can also contribute to delays.  I do not particularly want to make excuses for the situation.  I am not happy with it either.  I agree absolutely with Deputy O'Donnell's remarks.  We see it as a priority to increase the timeliness of the presentation of audited financial statements.</p></speech>

What has also increased the difficulty for organisations is the emphasis we have put, since 2009, on propriety and regularity issues.  We are looking at more things than would normally be looked at in the course of a financial audit.</p> <p>That has put a demand on the resource of our audit teams, but it also puts a resource onus on the entity to provide explanations of a type that is not necessarily amenable to analytic work.  Not only must documents be read, they must be interpreted.  Committee members have seen here how difficult it can be sometimes to get a clear explanation from an Accounting Officer and how difficult it can be for him or her to find the information to give to the committee.</p></speech>

There is also an issue in terms of the different agencies throughout the State in regard to how they account or how seriously they take their job as members of audit committees and so on.  I am concerned by a number of examples of this.  Tipperary Hostel was reported on here, but nothing constructive has come back from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, or any of the other Departments involved, in regard to that project.  We do our work.  We highlight the issues and in that case forwarded a note to the line Minister and the Department but got no real response in the letters we received.</p><p>  We also have the example of the Waterford Institute of Technology, which was in the news again recently.  There has been no clear cut ending to that examination.  This lack of a conclusion creates significant doubt around the organisations concerned and their ability to deliver as they should.  We received a report from Cork Institute of Technology and we constantly receive letters from the VEC, all complaining about the loose spending of taxpayers' money or governance issues.  However, we have not received a reply from the Department yet, even though it is some months since the report was made available to it.  We have had no response whatsoever.  Again, this is a question of how serious the Departments are about taking on board the issues raised at this committee and doing something to stop them arising again.</p><p>  The issue of time is also of significant concern, both to me and other committee members.  Last week, we dealt with the harbours accounts.  These date back over years and one of the buildings mentioned was going through a sale process for 21 years.  Surely somebody on the audit committee or involved in that process should have brought that issue to the attention of someone more senior.  In the context of new legislation etc., it appears that agencies do not acknowledge or do not step up to the plate in terms of their responsibilities.  As a result, we see a massive loss of taxpayers' money to the State and an undermining of the sector in terms of how it is viewed within and without the Department.</p><p>  We are all aware of the issues with the HSE.  All of these issues were highlighted and brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but nothing has been done about them.  There is little correction in the system.  I believe the time has come for an audit of the various agencies, with a particular emphasis on their governance, how they view it and what steps they have taken, in line with the new legislation, to ensure they are at the edge of best practice.  That is not happening currently.  For as long as that does not happen and for as long as there are no consequences for these agencies, the system just trundles on and the Committee of Public Accounts will remain in business and be as busy as ever for the foreseeable future.  That should not be the case.</p><p>  I suggest there is a need for a special report into governance issues for every organisation responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor General or for every organisation that presents its books to his office for audit.  Following that audit, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the political leadership within Departments can be informed of the position.  Somebody must take a stand on this issue, because there is a massive loss of public moneys.  It seems to me that everybody is quite happy for us to do our job here on a Thursday morning and then to turn a blind eye to the issues and walk away.  With respect, the ball is in the court of the Comptroller and Auditor General as much as it is in ours.  If it is a question of resources, this must be explained clearly to the Departments.  Someone must cry "stop", say that this will not happen again and point out the consequences.  This must be a policy issue, so that it is then for us to say -I am saying it now - there should be a consequence for every organisation that does not comply with the rules, just as happens in the private sector.  Until this policy is part of the system, we will not change the culture of the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting here on a Thursday morning and then going back to his desk and treating everything as if nothing ever happened.</p></speech>

He indicated that in the first six months of the year he contracts some consultancy staff to help with the field work and contracts out some of the work to other companies.  The bottleneck appears to be at senior manager review level.  This begs the question whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has contracted people in or out at that level.  He says he has contracted out work at field work level, but the area requiring greater concentration is that of the manager review, after the field work is done.</p><p>  Following on what the Chairman has said, this discussion is pointless unless we raise this again at the Estimates meeting for the Vote for Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which will arise as part of the Estimates discussion for 2015.  Most people would assume this Vote comes under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but it does not.  It comes under the Department of Finance.  The reason for that is that it concerns an audit of expenditure.  Therefore, it would not be right that a Minister responsible for public expenditure would be responsible for allocating the Estimate to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the year.</p><p>  We should make a point of raising this issue when the group of Estimates for the Department of Finance, which includes the Vote for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, arises.  I suspect the Minister for Finance would like the issue to be dealt with.  Unless the Oireachtas takes some action, we are just talking away here and blowing smoke.  There is an opportunity to raise this matter now and I give a commitment that I will be at the meeting when the Estimate debate takes place.</p></speech>

Last year and this year, we asked a retired deputy director to come back to help clear some of the backed-up accounts.  We got agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase our resources, but not as much as we wanted.  We are having discussions with the Department officials tomorrow in regard to how we may apply those resources, because while we get the resources, we must also get permission to use them the way we want.  That discussion takes place tomorrow.  We continue to work and push on this issue and will welcome any support we get.</p></speech>

If we get the issues sorted and if the Comptroller and Auditor General gets his work sorted, that means we will have greater scrutiny of the expenditure of public moneys.</p><p>  We have witnesses waiting and do not wish to delay further, but I will point out one issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on the difficulty of getting information.  A letter we have here from a Secretary General raises a number of questions for us, but I will just give a headline regarding the information sought -the amount spent on design team fees.  Not a single figure is mentioned.  It is beyond me how a paragraph or two on that issue can be created without mentioning fees or figures.  Another headline question regards the ongoing rental cost, but no figure is mentioned in the response.  There is no mention of a figure either in regard to the need for a school building.</p> <p>It is all just text and that is not what we want.  We want a factual response with figures so we can do our jobs.  We will come back to this next week and I will ask the clerk to draft a letter, including a transcript of this meeting, to the different agencies and Departments.</p></speech>

In this context they are key allies of ours in ensuring a more timely presentation of financial statements.  I envisage that we will have a conference day with interested chairpersons and members of audit committees to discuss how they can better perform their functions.

Around 50,000 of these admissions occurred after emergency presentation for treatment.  The bulk of the surgical procedures, 80%, or just under 200,000 cases, were elective or planned surgery cases, and two thirds of these were treated on a day surgery basis.</p><p>  Day surgery refers to surgical treatment provided in hospital, generally under anaesthetic, where the patient is expected to return home on the same day.  It requires formal admission of the patient to the hospital and is different to minor surgical treatment provided in an outpatient clinic.  Day surgery has a number of benefits over the same procedure provided on an inpatient basis, where the patient occupies a hospital bed for one or more nights.  These benefits include reduced risk for patients of contracting a hospital-acquired infection and reduced costs for hospitals.  Properly managed, day surgery should also lead to a reduction in waiting time for elective procedures because of improved throughput of cases.</p><p>  Since 2006, the HSE has required acute hospitals to provide details of the total number of admissions and the number carried out as day surgery for 24 targeted surgical procedures.  The target procedures range across all the major specialties and accounted for 31% of all elective surgical procedures in 2012.  Appendix A lists the target procedures, together with a layman's description of each one.</p><p>  The examination was carried out to establish the extent to which there had been progress in switching the delivery of treatment from an inpatient to a day surgery basis, to identify factors that assist in that switch or that might be impeding it and to assess if there was scope for the use of day surgery to be extended.  In view of the specialist medical knowledge required regarding the nature of surgical procedures and hospital processes, we contracted in two experienced medical consultants based in the UK to assist the examination team drawn from my office.</p><p>  The examination report is presented in two main parts.  Chapter 2 presents an analysis of the available data on elective surgical procedures designed to identify key trends and outcomes at individual hospital and procedure level over the period since 2006.  Chapter 3 is a review of procedures adopted by hospitals in planning and delivering day surgery treatment and supporting patients after discharge.  It includes recommendations aimed at ensuring hospitals are in a position to deliver elective surgery in the most appropriate and effective setting.</p><p>  Figure 2.1 indicates that the volume of elective surgery reported by hospitals increased by around a quarter between 2006 and 2012.  There was a small reduction in the volume of elective surgery carried out on an inpatient basis.  This contrasts with a big increase in the volume of day surgery.  As a result, the proportion of elective surgery carried out on a day surgery basis increased from 55% to 69%.</p><p>  For the years 2009 to 2012, the HSE set all acute hospitals a target of achieving an overall day surgery rate of 75% for the set of 24 procedures.  In 2012, the rate achieved across all hospitals was 74%, just below the target.  However, there was significant variation in performance between the different acute hospitals that have a significant surgical case load.  In 2012, the day surgery rate for the target procedures in individual hospitals varied from 50% to 92%.</p><p>  The HSE specified only a single day surgery target rate even though existing practice varied widely for the different types of procedures.  The mix of surgical procedures varies between hospitals and this influences the overall hospital day surgery rate relative to the target.</p><p>  Figure 2.5 shows how treatment delivery has changed regarding each of the target procedures since 2006.  The diagram can be seen on the screens.  The darker bands indicate the balance between inpatient and day surgery in 2006, while the lighter bands show the 2012 balance.  Overall, the relative shift to the right of the lighter bands reflects a trend towards delivery of more treatment via day surgery.</p><p>  For some procedures there was little change over time in the balance between inpatient and day surgery.</p> <p>For example, more than 75% of operations for correction of a squint were carried out on an inpatient basis in 2006.  By 2012, the balance had reversed with 75% of squint correction carried out on a day surgery basis.  There have also been considerable shifts towards day surgery for removal of cataracts and to relieve a condition that results in contraction in the hand.  In contrast, there were only minor changes in the day surgery rates for tonsil removals and removal of bladder tumours.</p><p> It is notable that across hospitals several of the procedures targeted by the HSE for improvement in day surgery rates were already at or above the 75% day surgery level in 2006.  This included cases involving post-fracture removal of pins or plates, internal examinations of joints, treatment of glue ear and treatment for nasal fracture.</p><p> Some clinicians expressed the view to the examination team that several of the 24 target procedures monitored by the HSE are not suitable for day surgery.  This viewpoint may be reflected in very low day surgery rates for some high volume procedures, such as removal of tonsils, 5,200 cases in 2012, with an 8% day surgery rate and gall bladder removal, 3,700 cases in 2012 with a 27% rate.  The examination found that in three hospitals, the day surgery rate for gall bladder removal increased from 1% in 2006 to between 56% and 70% in 2012.  In other hospitals, the day surgery rate for gall bladder removal remained low at around 1%.  Figure 2.7 in my circulated paper indicates the very considerable variation that existed between hospitals in two other high-volume target procedures, namely laparoscopy and repair of hernia.  We found that across all hospitals, the day surgery rate increased for both procedures between 2006 and 2012 while the gap in performance between hospitals narrowed.</p><p> The overall conclusion from the data analysis is there has been a significant increase in the day surgery rate for many of the targeted procedures but that scope exists for further improvement.  We recommended the HSE should seek to identify the factors associated with increased day surgery rates and transferable good practices.  We also recommended that instead of a single global target, appropriate targets should be set for different procedures and that targets should be set for a wider range of elective procedures.  It is important to acknowledge that setting a target rate for day surgery for a category of procedure cannot override the professional judgment of the relevant clinicians in deciding on the appropriate delivery setting in any individual case which must take account of all factors, including the patient&rsquo;s condition and circumstances.</p><p> The HSE estimates day care surgery is, on average, almost 60% less costly than performing the same procedure on an inpatient basis.  However, both the HSE and the Department of Health have pointed out that because a high proportion of hospital costs are fixed in the short term, the full potential savings of a significant shift from inpatient to day surgery will not accrue immediately.  Related measures to reduce cost are also needed to achieve the potential cash savings.</p><p> The primary focus of the examination was on the procedures targeted by the HSE for monitoring and target setting.  However, we also looked at the trends in elective surgery that were not subject to targeting.  Figure 2.10 in my circulated paper presents a comparison of the numbers of targeted and non-targeted procedures reported which indicates a significant difference.  The total number of elective procedures carried out in the target categories increased by only 3% over the seven years.  Within the targeted procedures, it is evident the increase in day surgery admissions was broadly offset by a corresponding decrease in inpatient admissions.  This suggests a strong substitution effect which over time should yield savings or free up resources for other activity.  In marked contrast, the total number of elective procedures in non-target categories increased by 39% over the same period.  There was little change in the number of inpatient admissions for those procedures but a very striking 74% increase in day surgery admissions.  Underlying demographic changes such as an aging population are highly unlikely to explain a trend shift of that order of magnitude in one category without apparently affecting other categories.</p><p> The HSE concluded that an increasing number of minor surgical procedures are being carried out as day surgery cases when it would be more economical to carry them out in outpatient clinics or in primary care settings.  It estimates it would be more appropriate to carry out as many as three in five of the non-target day surgery treatments in other settings and at less cost.  It attributes this shift to the incentive effect of the current method of funding of hospitals under which the payment rate for a procedure performed in a day surgery setting is higher than if the same procedure is performed, appropriately, in an outpatient setting.  This is an inefficient outcome and I have recommended the HSE should closely monitor cases currently classified as day surgery with a view to ensuring that all hospitals direct surgical cases to the most appropriate and economical settings.</p><p> The examination included a survey of hospitals and site visits to a number of hospitals where the medical consultants examined the processes around management and delivery of day surgery.  The results were measured against criteria identified by the medical consultants based on established good practice for day surgery is UK hospitals.  Procedures were examined at each stage of the day surgery pathway which is outlined in figure 3.1 in my report.  Recommendations are presented in the report aimed at achieving improvements in the way day surgery is managed in hospitals.  The HSE has agreed to implement the recommendations.  It remains to be seen what impact this will have on efficiency and cost in the delivery of elective surgery, as well as on the quality of the service provided to patients.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-06a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony O'Connell" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014110600007#L00300"><p>The special report from the Comptroller and Auditor covers in detail many of the aspects to the development and deployment of elective surgery capacity.  I will, therefore, confine my opening statement to highlight a number of key issues for the HSE.  I welcome the report and the HSE is well under way to implement its recommendations.  Staff from the HSE worked closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide much of the information contained in the report and to share with his staff examples of the current work we are already engaged in this area.</p><p>  The key recommendations of the report are to improve and to reduce variation in day surgery rates, to drive more standardised approaches, to improve information for patients, to optimise the locations for day surgery, to streamline business processes, improve funding arrangements and to better manage hospital performance with regard to surgery services.  It is important to note the HSE had a specific focus on both elective and day surgery rates for several years with each successive improvement approach adding to impacts seen.  For example, we have seen day case activity rise from 675,162 to 838,922 discharges between 2009 and 2013, a rise of 24% in activity volumes which translates into an additional 163,760 patients seen on a day case basis.  During this time, most of the additional patients seen came as a result of specific improvements in the utilisation of resources and capacity by hospitals.</p><p>  As part of our service planning process, the HSE sets a range of access and performance targets.  Each year, the one area where the HSE has consistently exceeded its target is in the provision of day case treatments.  However, in parallel to focusing on improvements in the areas of day case, the HSE has also focused on ensuring overall elective surgery services are improved.  It is important to note our surgical inpatient activity rates increased from 417,846 in 2010 to 484,167 in 2013, an increase of almost 16% or 66,321 cases.  At the same time, we have reduced the number of bed days for this group meaning that the length of stay of patients has significantly reduced while utilising our surgery resources more efficiently.  Our current target length of stay is 5.3 days and in 2014 it is 5.2 days.  We intend to target further reductions in 2015.</p><p>  We are making overall surgery more efficient with a shorter inpatient stay and not just focusing on day case procedures alone.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we have also seen improvements in our day of surgery admission, DOSA, rate which currently stands at 64%.  We have further work to reach our target of 85% across all hospitals and we will talk further about that during our session this morning.</p><p> To give committee members a summary of how the HSE has and will be targeting improvements in the area of elective day surgery, I will highlight some examples from our overall approach.  That approach has been in three broad areas: redesigning surgery service delivery, which is an important element of a larger reform programme; facilitating numerous initiatives at a local level; and implementing performance monitoring and management systems to consistently track and drive improvements in the key surgical areas.  I will briefly highlight a number of elements and key initiatives in each of these domains to illustrate the important work that is ongoing.</p><p> From a redesign and reform perspective, we see optimising utilisation of surgery resources and providing clarity for hospitals about their roles as key deliverables in our overarching reform agenda.  Our approach seeks to provide consistency across regions in the standards for surgery and to deliver efficiencies through networking the delivery of surgery between hospitals in the new hospital groups.  Improvement in surgery services and other areas of activity in acute hospitals will be significantly facilitated by the changes that come with the establishment of hospital groups and subsequently trusts.  This is because hospital group boards and executives will be able to be more responsive to local demands while being accountable for a much more manageable size of entity.  We have already quite successfully targeted a number of smaller hospitals to increase elective and day surgery activity volumes within them.  The national clinical programmes are also working within the HSE to address acute and elective surgery efficiency and effectiveness.  The  relevant programmes in this respect are surgery, anaesthesia, major trauma and orthopaedics.</p><p> The surgery clinical programme has prepared and launched two special reports on the appropriate models of care for acute and elective surgery in Ireland.  I am very pleased to have Professor Frank Keane with me today, because in his role as lead of the surgery program he has been instrumental in driving the majority of the improvements we have seen.  The HSE is also working closely with the anaesthetics clinical programme on a pre-admission model of care, which will be launched in December.  Our new approach to funding episodes of care, called Money Follows the Patient, or activity-based funding, will also provide an opportunity to better incentivise day case models.</p><p> With regard to facilitating improvements at the front line, we are rolling out a range of surgery-related improvement initiatives.  The productive operating theatre, TPOT, programme is a joint quality improvement initiative between the HSE, the Royal College of Surgeons, RCSI, and the College of Anaesthetists, CAI.  TPOT is now operational in 17 hospitals nationally.  The TPOT programme is designed to enable hospitals to continuously improve across four quality domains, which include patient experience and outcomes, safety and reliability of care, team performance and staff well-being and value and efficiency.  In conjunction with the anaesthetic clinical programme, the HSE will be implementing a range of pre-admission clinics across hospitals nationally.  Currently about 90% have anaesthetic pre-admission clinics.  Pre-admission encompasses the entire process around the peri-operative management of a patient scheduled for surgery, be it a day case or an inpatient being admitted on the day of their operation.</p><p> Importantly, we have recently started rolling out a web-enabled interactive reporting tool called NQAIS that uses a hospital's own surgery data to present information in a user-friendly way.  This encourages better management by surgeons, clinical directors and hospital managers of their local surgery resources.  We have commenced work with the primary care sector to improve standardisation of GP referral pathways and thresholds for referral.  We will also be driving better compliance with the recommendations which arise from the various HIQA health technology assessments so that surgery is only performed when there is an appropriate evidence base.</p><p> We are more rigorously managing surgery performance at hospital and hospital group levels.  Targets have been set globally and individually for each hospital in respect of day case rates and DOSA rates. These are regularly monitored in the HSE and the subject of on-going discussions with hospitals.  The HSE has developed and expanded its range of surgery indicators and will include these in its 2015 national service plan, which we are currently finalising. This is all being done within a performance framework for hospital groups in which I meet with each of the individual hospital group executives monthly to analyse their recent performance across a balanced scorecard and we agree improvement strategies.</p><p> There remain challenges to the HSE to successfully implement our goals.  We acknowledge that there is a need to focus on continuing to move minor surgical cases and less complex care to less intensive environments such as out-patient departments and the community.  This requires changes to practice and infrastructure and the alignment of payment approaches with these goals.  Similarly, despite the significant efforts of hospitals and clinicians, there continues to be pressure on waiting lists for scheduled care as unscheduled care demands continue to rise and hospitals struggle to discharge patients ready for placement in the community to nursing homes and other supported community settings.</p></speech>

In going through the report I wish to compliment them on the Comptroller and Auditor General's observation that from 2009 to 2012, the HSE set a 75% target day surgery rate for all acute hospitals for the 24 procedures and reached a rate of 74%.  It is rare that we see targets actually being reached, so I compliment the witnesses on that.  However, the next sentence says that there is a significant variation in performance rates between the individual hospitals.  This variation can be dramatic, ranging from 50% to 92%.  Reading between the lines of the report, some clinicians expressed the view that the 24 target procedures are not suitable for day surgery.  Another one mentions that consultants and so forth were possibly objecting.  Is it the case that the variance is due to individual consultants in individual hospitals who have a different view to the HSE on how certain day case procedures should be treated and that they would rather these procedures were treated as in-patient surgeries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-06a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony O'Connell" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014110600008#M00500"><p>I can give Deputy Nolan the latest figures.  We have the year-to date 2014 figures on that basket of 24 procedures to which he referred.  For the 41,500 cases this year to date the day case rate is now up to 77%, so we are continuing to improve.  However, Deputy Nolan is correct, there is a variance between the rates for individual procedures.  I might just quote a handful of them to give an example.  Procedures which everyone is quite comfortable doing as day cases have quite high rates.  For example, removing a ganglion, which is a swelling in a tendon in the hand, or orchiopexy, or repairing a nasal fracture.  Each of these have rates of day case procedures that are well in the 90s.  The four that are lowest are tonsillectomy at only 10%, 18% for bunions, 34% for transurethral resection of the prostate and 34% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  I think bunions are an aberration, but tonsillectomy is a good example of the answer to the question the Deputy is raising, namely whether consultants are comfortable with doing these procedures as day cases.</p><p>  Tonsillectomy is something which ENT surgeons and anaesthetists have been quite uncomfortable about doing as a day case procedure.  It has taken many years across the globe for practice to change in this regard, because they all remember cases of a bleeding that first night after the tonsillectomy which was horrendous, which was in the airway and which threatened the life of the patient, requiring them to come in from home to almost repeat the tonsillectomy in order to get the bleeding under control.  They are plagued by the memory of these cases from the past, which make them uncomfortable saying that they are going to change their entire practice to doing every tonsillectomy as a day case.  They will change over time and that rate will increase, but they must be reassured that there are systems in place where a patient can come in from home rapidly, where their entry to the hospital's emergency department will be accelerated and where the time between leaving home and getting to the operating theatre is not so long that they expire from the haemorrhage.  It is uncommon for a haemorrhage to occur on that first night after the operation but it is such a worrying event that it has swayed the opinions of doctors.</p> <p> I was pleased that, in his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that we cannot have metrics overriding professional judgement.  Ultimately, we have to convince our surgeons that their practice needs to change, and convincing independent, strong-willed people like competent surgeons is a challenge.  This is the reason there will always be some variation.  The other reason there will be variation is that there is a different range of numbers of cases in each of those 24 procedures in the various hospitals.</p></speech>

For example, if there is a strong orthopaedic and general surgery service, there might be a preponderance of minor orthopaedic work, or of ganglions, which could be done as day cases.  If there is no ear, nose and throat service, nasal fracture reduction surgeries will not necessarily be taking place.  Each individual hospital will have a different profile of the numbers and percentage of cases that contribute to the total 24 which are in this nominal basket of indicative procedures.</p></speech>

This has been listed as one of the day-case surgery target routines since 2006.  We are eight years into it; it seems a long time to be trying to win over and sympathise with consultants and to assure, coax and cajole them into believing it can be done as a day-case procedure.</p></speech>

We are attempting to convince individual surgeons that they need to improve their rates, but ultimately they will make the decisions. Over a period of time we hope there will be a number of prominent clinical champions for these new ways of doing business who will drive a change in behaviour.  There will be an opportunity to incentivise through different funding arrangements.  We could quite artificially alter the reimbursements in the new activity-based funding arrangements, for example, by preferentially rewarding hospitals for doing day cases.  In other words, we would pay them above cost to carry out a procedure as a day case, and below cost for in-patient care of equivalent procedures.  There would then be much more local pressure from the hospital managers, who have to deal with the budget, on people they bump into every day in the hospital.</p></speech>

The individual surgeons would articulate the quality and safety perspectives louder, but the whole environment is clearly at issue.  They need to feel comfortable about the nurses who would be discharging the patient from the ward and about the referral pathways back to the hospital, as I said.  The whole environment in which surgeons are working needs to be conducive to this significant change in behaviour for what is ultimately 90% of tonsillectomies.</p></speech>

Is there another contradiction in that the HSE has labelled this as a day-case surgery, as something that should be targeted and promoted and resources put into treating as a day-case surgery, when only 10% of surgical activity actually agrees with this?

It is evident from the NHS figures the Deputy cited that there is a similar disquiet across the water, where a minority, only 40%, of tonsillectomies are done as day cases.  There is varying comfort with each of those 24 procedures as to whether we can achieve the goal.  I ask Professor Keane to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-06a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Frank Keane" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014110600009#N01200"><p>I agree with everything that has been said.  It is difficult and quite slow, and it is not unique.  The English rate of 40% is quite high in terms of national figures for tonsillectomies and it took them a long time to get to that point.  It has been difficult to persuade hearts and minds that the systems are in place for people to manage these patients safely.  A combination of coaxing and persuasion of hearts and minds is required.</p><p>  I have been in surgical practice for 30 years.  When I started out we did absolutely nothing as day cases.  If someone came in for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy they came in for two weeks and that was it.  We have changed hugely over the years and  in my practice we now do the majority of laparoscopic cholecystectomies as day cases.</p><p>  The other issue is that for clinicians - and I am just articulating the truth behind it, without necessarily answering the Deputy's question satisfactorily - there is a comfort factor in having one's patients in hospital the night after they have been operated on.  There is an intuitive comfort factor in knowing they are in safe hands.  For the first while doing them as day cases, the surgeon goes home and thinks, "My God, what is happening to my patient tonight, how are they?"  Returning to what Dr. O'Connell said about tonsils, it is very emotive on a practice basis.  Many of the patients are children and people are very uneasy about the prospect of a child being put at risk because they bleed torrentially after they go home and something terrible happens to them.  It is quite a significant risk, in other words.  </p><p>  When we try to encourage people to do day cases, the constant response is, "What will happen if I send somebody home and they bleed to death?  Where will I be then?  I can see it all over the newspapers".  It is difficult to persuade people.  It takes leaders and we can see that there are some places that are now doing much more, up to 20% or 25% of tonsillectomies being carried out as day cases.  It is usually those people, the pathfinders, who show that it is safe and then it gradually trickles into the system.  </p></speech>

Hospitals do not have the same degree of complexity in the cases they are dealing with.  If we stick with the tonsillectomy example, if a child is severely obese and has obstructive sleep apnoea exacerbated by large tonsils in their upper airway, that is a case where the clinician is going to be less comfortable.  If a hospital tends to attract large numbers of that kind of case - children with obstructive sleep apnoea - it is going to be different to the practice of a hospital where the majority of tonsillectomies are just done on the indication of a few episodes of tonsillitis.</p></speech>

We would not expect to see the same rates of day-case surgery for the same procedure, even by the same surgeon, when he operates in one small hospital compared to when he operates in a large teaching hospital.</p></speech>

His answer puts a lot of stock in the national clinical programme for surgery and how this is changing.</p> <p>While acknowledging the bona fide nature of the witnesses' contribution, it does not give me much confidence in the programme if eight years after introducing tonsillectomy as day case surgery, we have gone from approximately 8% to 10% and the goal is still a long way off.  It is difficult to say the programme will be really successful if ten years into it we have not made progress.  It is a different culture from the one I understand.  We spoke previously about the private sector.  If a business decides to do a procedure, it develops a business model and follows it.  Everyone signs up to it.  If a business had to spend ten years coaxing and cajoling its managers to follow the business model, it would not survive.  I accept I am introducing a business element but it is a difficult to have faith in a programme when it takes so long to get change.</p></speech>

That connection of trying to understand in a granular manner what individual people and services are doing has only come about since the programmes have started engaging in the whole inquiry into the data so that we have become more familiar with what is going on.</p><p>  Part of the programmatic activity is not only writing models of care but also interrogating the data of what is going on and visiting hospitals.  We visited all the hospitals in the country on a number of occasions, presented their data to them and also showed them how their performance compared with other hospitals and with the best performing hospitals in the country.  That is a relatively new process and it has had significant gains in that period, in particular in a time which has been difficult because of financial and staffing cutbacks and other factors.</p></speech>

Its percentages were dragged down dramatically by, for example, the extraction of cataracts.  Is it a case of there being a difficulty with people getting comfortable with the idea of moving to a different way of doing things?</p></speech>

That is in the process of being corrected.  We are aware the hospital is behind the line on cataract outcomes.  It has come down to the fact that the hospital did not have the set-up to do such operations as day cases.  That might sound peculiar but part of the process of day case activity is having the resources to carry out the activity.  It is rather like what we have been talking about with tonsils in that not only does one have to be careful about how one assesses people beforehand and do all the work-out before they come in, but that has to be done very close to the time they have their operation.  The reason for that is in order for it to be within a safety span of having been seen and worked out, and then having one&rsquo;s procedure and having systems set up in order that people are managed after they go home.  If one does not have all the bits and pieces one needs to deliver the service set-up, it is not safe to carry out the procedure and one will continue to do some as day cases.  That has been the situation with Cork University Hospital.</p></speech>

That is a short way of saying it.  Some procedures are just done under local anaesthetic.  What we heard in the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General is that there is a perverse incentive because of the funding arrangement to count as much as one can as something that is happening within the hospital.  That is something we must resist and we will do that much more forcefully as we introduce the money follows the patient activity-based funding arrangements.  We will be able to financially reward much more appropriately something that is good clinically, which is good for the hospital.</p><p>  There are some perverse financial incentives which are currently running in the system.  There is also an incentive because of changes in the recent reimbursements to count cases as overnight cases rather than day cases.</p></speech>

A number of hospitals have an embarrassment in their financial situation.  A component of the embarrassment is attributable to the fact that if they continue to do cases appropriately as day cases rather than overnight, they would effectively be penalised in terms of their income.  We must overcome the perverse financial incentives to ensure that what is clinically right for the patient is reflected in an appropriate financial reimbursement.  Perhaps Professor Keane has something to add to what I said.</p></speech>

Strictly, a day surgery unit is an equipped operating theatre that gives a general anaesthetic in which one does substantive day case work, not the relatively trivial operations which Deputy Nolan identified.  There is no question that because of facilities and the number of operating theatres in certain hospitals that they are having to carry out all their inpatient work and their outpatient or day case work within the same resource.</p> <p>That is an historical fact because that is what we are dealing with.  A county hospital with four operating theatres will be providing a range of inpatient treatments in a number of different surgical specialties such as orthopaedics, obstetrics, gynaecology, paediatrics and ENT from those four operating theatres.  One must fit that into a week's work.  One must also carry out the day stuff through there.  The best way to do day surgery is to run it in effect as a factory in order that there is a set-up that allows one to process patients through dedicated admission wards and dedicated operating theatres and then out the other end.  Processing patients sounds a bit callous because it makes it sound like an industry, but to a certain extent it works best like that.</p><p> There is a process of transition within the groups of hospitals becoming dedicated day centres where this kind of process works much more efficiently.  The way a majority of surgeons work their operating time in the theatre is often to do two day cases at the beginning of the list and then do the rest of the inpatient operations.  I have done this for a long period.  That is fine but it does not work the day case system as efficiently as it should be worked.  It does not work the beds so it is better if it is isolated.  It will take time for that system to evolve, especially at this particular moment.  This does create efficiencies.</p><p> Certainly there are things being done as day cases in day theatres that are inappropriate because they do not require a general anaesthetic and that needs to be sorted.  Part of the problem with that and the reason it did not happen up to this point is because people are not incentivised to perform these things, even in the outpatient department.  The reason is because one does not get a coded procedure.  The hospital, and nobody else, gets funded for that activity if it is done in the outpatients department because outpatient procedures are not coded.  In many cases, patients in minor operation rooms that hospitals operate do not get coded so they are missing out.  Clearly, that needs to be gradually corrected, and the money follows the patient exercises will do that.  These things must become coded activities in order that they start being done in the right place.</p></speech>

My remit is not to look at primary care but I have been liaising with primary care doctors and asking how we can move some of this work out of the acute hospitals in order that it is done in primary care settings.  There are issues in primary care.  Again, it comes back to reimbursement because part of the reimbursement for doing substantial procedures is insufficient to pay for the actual equipment with which they do the procedure.  I am talking about the local anaesthetic, the sutures and everything necessary to do that work.  Those are all things that must be looked at.</p></speech>

As the first step, it is addressing the issue that Professor Keane referred to.  In an ideal world, day case procedures would be done in a quarantined separated procedure - a cold surgery factory, so to speak, where there is no pressure on beds and where the business is very much attuned to churning through people, getting them ready to be sent home and providing them with standard information packages, etc.  That is the first step.</p><p>  The next step of getting the GPs to do the procedures involves a much higher level of difficulty because it requires the GP to be somehow financially incentivised to do that because GPs are not my direct employees.  We need to cajole and pay them in a way which makes it worth their while to do these minor procedures when they are under a lot of pressure to churn through cases every 15 to 20 minutes from non-surgical procedures.</p></speech>

There is a national association of general practitioners practising surgery which has 66 members, so that is quite a substantial membership of people who are keen and enthusiastic.  They are doing things.  They are very keen to get into that space.  That process of persuading has started.</p></speech>

The Deputy asks why we do not do so.  One must realise that every hospital in the country is different.  Let us take a big volume thing.  A hospital might provide ophthalmic surgeons and surgery and do a considerable amount of cataract surgery.  We know that 95% of cataract surgery is done as a day case, so that will skew that hospital which will find it much easier to reach that target of 75%, 80% or whatever it is.  If a hospital only carries out laparoscopic cholecystectomies and tonsillectomies, about which we have been talking, it will find it very hard to reach that 75%.  Different hospitals have very different specialty mixes and using that 75% figure to compare hospitals in terms of their performance is not terribly effective.  What is much more effective is looking at individual procedures.  This is what we are doing now with the nursing instrument for quality assurance, NIQA, system described by Dr. O'Connell where we are feeding back to clinicians data that are now as close as three months old.  One must remember that this has only just come about because, before that, we were showing them data that were a year to a year and a half old, which is not meaningful for a practising clinician in terms of changing their practice.  We have this system that looks at individual procedures.  Not only does it tell individuals or individual specialty units what their performance is, it sets them a target for each of those procedures and compares them with national targets, national activities relating to what is going on and the best in class, so to speak.  That is designed to stimulate and cajole change and make sure that people understand their performance.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties of grouping everything is that one is assuming the case mix and complexity of each patient is precisely the same.  There are some hospitals which attract patients with a particular type of case mix, in terms of what they are like themselves, their age, their level of infirmity and how complex a procedure is.  Comparing hospitals and patients is a complex process.  If there is a hospital dealing with very complex and very sick patients, clearly it is going to have a different performance picture from hospitals which are dealing with very healthy patients who have no and low complexities.</p></speech>

Clearly, it is necessary to be careful in terms of people's access to it.  It is a web based system so people actually can get into it, but clearly they have to use passwords and all that sort of thing.  This is being rolled out and every clinician will be able to look at his or her own data; one's last three months, one's last six months, one's year, how one's last year compared to the year before - all that information is going to be provided for them.</p></speech>

The way to do this is to do it at a local level.  This requires clarity about what the targets are, what the metrics are, and an audit approach to check on them.  In the end, especially when we have a health system - as we do in every Western democracy - where individual clinicians are making patient-by-patient decisions, a better way to change their behaviour in a sustainable way is to do it much more at a local level.  This is why the movement towards hospital groups is so important.  We have clinical directors who are now responsible for only a handful of hospitals rather than, for instance, me being responsible for all 50 of them.  It is not possible for me to dive down into the individual performance and check the clinical indication for day case versus inpatient case by individual surgeons without doing an enormous amount of work.  Having a clinical director for just a handful of hospitals with sub-clinical directors in each individual hospital is a much better way to get a mindset and an approach and a consensus change in practice rather than doing it on a national level.  They have to be complementary, but the sustainable change comes from much more local implementation of the principles and the clinical champions.</p></speech>

When patients come into hospital, basic demographics such as age and address and all that sort of stuff is obtained.  Then they are coded by diagnosis, in other words, pneumonia, heart attack, cancer or whatever is their code.  That is one of the coding systems.  The other coding system is for whatever procedure they have.  Every procedure for which a person comes into hospital is given a code, from a scan to an operative procedure.  All those codes are different.  It is possible to interrogate that to find out how many cases of a specific procedure were carried out.  That is all fed into a system that creates what we call DRGs.  These are diagnostic related groups.  That is how the system is funded.  There are about 690 diagnostics groups.  That is what is used for the funding process.</p></speech>

There is an expectation that hospitals will do so many thousand outpatient visits every year.  Therefore, they are funded for that.  That funding does take into account the range of procedures, interviews and interactions which occur in an outpatient setting.  In a sense, the block funding for outpatient activity has already taken into account the fact that some of those patients who attend an outpatients department would, for example, have been having some local anaesthetic and a small mole on the back of their hand taken off.  The issue is the difference between the reimbursement for that in block funding form and the reimbursement for calling it a day case activity.</p></speech>

I would also have a concern at this kind of movement from procedures that really should be categorised and treated and monitored as outpatient attendances and, if one likes, transferring them into the admissions side.  It has a potentially distorting effect on the waiting lists for both sides as well.  I would be quite concerned that there would be proper categorisation of the procedures.  It is something I have recommended as needing to be addressed by the HSE.</p></speech>

I am looking at the documentation we have, including the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, and I thank the witnesses for the briefing note they furnished also. We also have our own summary.  I am trying to understand the big picture before we get into the little picture.</p> <p> We have been told that there were 247,000 surgical procedures in 2012, the year of the report.  Accident and emergency services accounted for 49,000 of these or approximately 20%, with inpatient services accounting for 61,000 or 25% and day surgeries accounting for 137,000 or 55%.

Some 14% of people who opt for day surgery are private patients, but the comparable percentage opting for inpatient treatments is much higher.  Does this have anything to do with the operation of the private health industry?  If someone needs a day case procedure, he or she may need to pay for it and reclaim the cost from a private health insurer at a later date.  If someone is an inpatient and is kept overnight, though, the VHI, Laya or so on pays for everything and the client will not have to write a cheque.  The consultant, the anaesthetist, the hospital's bed manager and so on send a bill to the insurer.  As such, there is an incentive for private patients to have procedures done on an inpatient basis.  This is borne out by the HSE's figures.  A higher percentage of private patients opt for overnight treatment.  Does Dr. O'Connell follow my point?</p></speech>

It was a valid, if not empirically proven, observation, but even the HSE's figures demonstrate that more private patients want to be kept in overnight.  That approach might suit the surgeon, but it certainly suits the client, as the bills go straight to the VHI, Laya or another insurer.  Convenience is a factor.</p><p>  I have not seen particular information in the reports of the HSE or the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are meant to be considering the breakdown of the 24 selected day surgery procedures that account for 137,000 separate cases.  Does anyone in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, the HSE or the Department have that figure?  We have a report on day surgery in which 24 items have been measured, but we do not have a breakdown of how many tonsillectomies, submucous resections, laparoscopies, nasal fracture treatments and the like were carried out.

I do not accept for one moment that the medical cases presenting in hospitals have become so much less complex that we can go from a day case rate of 60% four years ago to 77% now.  That represents a phenomenal number of patients being dealt with on a day surgery basis who, four years ago, would have been treated as inpatients.  If, as I accept, procedures and patients are not being compromised, then it means that this volume of day cases should have been happening all along.  It is good that we are catching up and getting more out of the procedures.  The delegates might say that some of the complex ones are left, but they never were going to be part of the day surgery comparison.</p><p>  On the question of medical outcomes, we have been told there is a 2% return rate, where patients need to return for further treatment or a procedure was not right.  The delegates' submission states that the HSE's target surgical readmission rate is less than 3% and the actual figure is currently 2%.  Does that figure refer to day cases only and, if so, what is the figure for inpatients and how does it compare internationally?</p></speech>

It oscillates between 2% and 3% for individual hospitals.  Looking at hospitals and their readmission rate is not especially useful.  We are on a journey and readmission rates are one of the outcome measures.  The other measures are process measures.  If all of one's day cases are running into complications and being admitted the next day because of those complications, one is clearly not doing a very good job.  It is important to monitor the readmission rate.  When one looks at a list of different procedures, one usually gets a really low figure.  We find it sits at around 2% to 3% for all hospitals.  It is only when one becomes more granular in terms of looking at either specialties or individuals' procedures that differences begin to show.</p><p>  Another issue is that readmission rates can be difficult to quantity because we do not have a system of unique patient identifiers.  Patients who run into complications after a procedure might then present at a different hospital, in which case one does not have that-----</p></speech>

I am thinking of a case, for example, where an elderly person is treated in Portlaoise, returns to his or her nursing home and is readmitted to Naas the following week.  My understanding is that there will be no match-up in this case because there is no unique identifier for the patient.  I hope it is not as bad as it seems.</p></speech>

The cost of implementing such a system is quite significant.  It is not just a matter of asking for a PPS number; we will have to change thousands of databases to accept the number.  It is a huge cost, but it is absolutely within the programme of work of the HSE's IT programme.  It is seen as very important.  Unfortunately, we are limited as to the budget available to us for information technology.  However, it is something that will be done in the next few years.</p></speech>

Public service cards, complete with photographic ID, are being issued to people for use in their dealings with social welfare offices and Revenue.  We are being told today that the HSE is not part of that system and, for some reason, patients cannot use the public service cards that have been issued across the board.  When the property tax was introduced last year, it was possible to match every home in the country with the relevant PPS numbers.  As I said already, there has been no difficulty with Irish Water accessing PPS numbers.  Yet patients cannot be identified in this way.  It is a bizarre situation.</p><p>  Will the delegates speak to Revenue or the Department of Social Protection and ask one of them to design a system for the HSE?  The HSE should not be spending its money on this; it is a public service issue.  I have a list a mile long of organisations that can share PPS numbers across the public service, including Revenue, local authority housing departments and social welfare offices.  That system should be extended to include the HSE.  I am amazed that the delegates are apparently determined to reinvent the wheel.  The submission tells us there were 838,922 day case discharges in 2013.  On that basis, I would estimate that 1.2 million or 1.3 million people go through the hospital system every year, including inpatients, outpatients and day patients.  All of those people have PPS numbers, but the delegates want to spend time and money developing a whole new system.  The HSE's resources are simply too valuable to be spent in this way.  We look to it to care for the health of the nation.  This type of administrative function should be outsourced to some other public body that has already done it several times.</p></speech>

Indeed, it is integral to much of what we want to do from a health reform perspective.  The issue is being deal with in the health information Bill we are currently working on.  It is a complex, resource-intensive issue and we have been working on it for some time.</p></speech>

Legislation is not required.  Every one of the 1.2 million people who went through the door of a hospital last year has a PPS number.  We do not need to waste time drafting legislation to identify them.  It would amount to another PPARS if we were to use resources to design a system that is already operating in other Departments and offices.  There should be no money spent in the Department of Health or the HSE on this issue.  The delegates' job is to deliver health services; several Departments could sort out this administrative issue for them.  I do not accept the need for legislation to be drafted to cope with this.  If that is the mindset in the Department, then it is a classic example of the silo approach, with each Department or body going off and doing its own thing instead of working together to serve the public.  If we are to achieve anything in terms of public efficiency, we will have to break down this silo mentality and tell whomever is drafting that legislation to concentrate on health and let somebody else do the administration.  I am shocked at this situation.</p></speech>

What we are talking about here is someone coming in with an injury, such as a fractured arm, and being taken to theatre to be operated on under general anaesthetic or to have a cast put on.  That is happening in many places.  We have not reached the stage of adopting a programmatic approach to identifying specific common conditions which should go through a day case process.  Again, it is a difficult one because people are often running their elective practices and dealing with acute admissions concurrently.  So it comes down to the availability of staff.  If a person comes in with a condition which could be dealt with on an acute day patient basis, it is a matter of having an individual of sufficient seniority available to carry out the relevant procedure.  We are moving forward very quickly in this regard and we have written a model of care for elective surgery, which is mainly what we have been discussing at this meeting, and a model of care for acute surgery.  What we are recommending is that we try to create situations in hospitals where there will be a surgeon on call to deal specifically with emergencies.  Such surgeons will be taken away from their duties relating to their elective practices in order that they will be available to both assess and treat patients.  We refer to them as senior decision-makers and patients will be seen sooner by them and given appropriate treatment.</p></speech>

I just wanted to provide some reassurances to the committee in that regard.  If memory serves, the unique identifier element was removed from the Health Information Bill, as it was then titled, last year because there was a recognition within the Department that it needed to be prioritised as a result of the fact that it forms such a key part of the reforms we have been discussing at this meeting.  My understanding is that the HSE is working to establish the individual health identifier registers that will be required across the board to manage the operation of the identifier system.  No doubt a budget has been allocated in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

It would be fair to say that this has been a challenge for all public hospital systems throughout the world, especially those in western democracies.  The implementation of a system of unique health identifiers for the millions of people who use services has always taken years to complete.</p> <p>It is costly because it requires changes to the thousands of individual applications used to manage the various processes within the hospitals.</p></speech>

The patient would go to a ward if he or she required admission and that information would come across.  The short cut is, of course, to ask the patient the name of the doctor or surgeon who dealt with him or her in Limerick and then contact that individual directly.</p></speech>

I am considering this matter in terms of beds, and the case study for me is Limerick, with which Dr. O'Connell will be familiar, and the mid-west hospital network.  We have a major problem in terms of accident and emergency services and the big issue is beds.  In terms of discharge policies and everything else, we are currently discussing elective procedures.  If someone comes in for a day procedure, he or she would not take up a bed but an overnight inpatient would take up a bed.  As Dr. O'Connell will be aware, one of the problems facing accident and emergency services in Limerick is the availability of beds through the system.  If someone moves from inpatient to day procedure status, how many bed days are typically freed up?</p></speech>

The inpatient figure has decreased but not to the level one would like.  In the system as it currently operates, what is the incentive for a consultant to treat somebody as a day patient?</p></speech>

Patients often request that they be allowed to go home that night because they do not want to stay in hospital overnight.  It is a more efficient system for the hospital and if the consultant is altruistic, he or she will be very interested in the overall efficiency in the running of the hospital and its ability to stay within budget.  The Deputy implied that there are incentives which work in the opposite direction.</p></speech>

The consultant might have a sense of reassurance that the patient is safer being looked after by nurses.  Occasionally, a patient wants a night away from home and does not want to leave if there is a risk that his or her pain might not be as well managed outside the hospital setting.  There is also a potential financial incentive for the hospital from an inpatient stay.  There are a number of incentives, and we are dealing with a balance between the two sides.  That is why it is such a complicated change of practice.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of the accident and emergency service in the past.  The new emergency department that is under construction in Limerick is very welcome.  It appears that it will not be up and running until 2016.  Could more be done to free up beds in the regional hospital in Limerick?  I am aware that people have been transferred from that hospital to St. John's Hospital.  We need to take the pressure off the accident and emergency department in the regional hospital in Limerick until the new emergency department is opened.  HIQA said recently that the existing department is not fit for purpose.  We need to do something to bridge the gap over the next year - this coming winter and the following winter.  Dr. O'Connell is probably aware of the proposals that have been made.  The medical assessment unit that is operating at the hospital is, in effect, a day facility.  If it were to be converted into a temporary inpatient facility adjacent to the accident and emergency department, perhaps it could relieve some of the current problems.  Dr. O'Connell is familiar with the ongoing pressures that have resulted from the reconfiguration within the region.  I refer, for example, to the decrease in the number of beds.  The emergency department at the regional hospital in Limerick is now the only such department in the mid-west region.  There is no other level 3 hospital in the region.  Everything is being funnelled into one hospital.  Dr. O'Connell might give me his overall perspective.  I suppose I am trying to be constructive.  This is an ongoing issue in Limerick and the mid-west as a whole.  I supported the proposal to move the existing 30-bed medical assessment unit to another part of the hospital to allow an area that is beside the current accident and emergency department to be used as an inpatient facility - a type of a spillover from the accident and emergency department - for the next year until the new emergency department is up and running.</p></speech>

There is a clear need to ensure the balance of activity between each of the four hospitals is appropriate.

I think that is a palpable reason to make more use of those hospitals.  That would require a more aggressive approach to how we move patients.  There is an opportunity for a kind of step-down, back-transfer way of approaching patients.  After they have had their more complicated procedures in the largest hospital, they could move back to a hospital closer to home for the lower-acuity end of their stay in hospital.  We have already started to provide for much more use of Ennis and Nenagh hospitals along these lines.  I referred earlier to the increase in day cases and things like endoscopies, etc.  The Deputy also raised the separate issue of how to make more appropriate use of the beds that are available.  I am disinclined to promote use of the medical assessment unit because I think its advantage lies in its ability to churn patients through rapidly.  It makes sure they are given a kind of holistic assessment with a level of clinical input.  They are then moved to an appropriate place in the community, if that is reasonable, hopefully with minimal double handling.</p></speech>

As a Deputy who represents the constituency of Limerick City, I regularly get telephone calls very late at night telling me about people, many of whom are elderly, who are on trolleys.  I am acting on this purely because that is my role.  I am bringing it to Dr. O'Connell's attention that the number of people who are on trolleys on an ongoing basis is a major issue.  There is a factual reason for it.  A number of years ago - not too long ago - there were 35 accident and emergency beds between Ennis and Nenagh hospitals, St. John's Hospital and the regional hospital in Limerick.  Seventeen of these beds were in the regional hospital.  Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals had six beds each.  The 18 beds in those three hospitals are gone.  They no longer have 24-hour, functioning accident and emergency departments.  The regional hospital continues to have just 17 beds.  The number of beds has been halved.  It is a major problem as we come into the real winter months, when the weather gets very bad.  We have already had some problems even though the weather has been relatively mild.  What can be done to ensure I no longer receive telephone calls at 11 p.m. or 12 midnight from people who have been on trolleys for many hours?  The staff in the regional hospital are excellent.  When one rings them, they deal with it.  People are working within very difficult confines.</p><p>  We have a unique set of circumstances.  HIQA, which is an independent body, has said it is not fit for purpose.  It is clear that the reconfiguration has resulted in a reduction in the number of accident and emergency beds.  Obviously, this falls directly under Dr. O'Connell's remit.  I appreciate that he is here for another purpose today.  Given that this is about beds, I think it falls within the same context.  What can be done?  I acknowledge that a new accident and emergency department is being built.  I would have liked to have seen it being developed more quickly.  We are now being told that it will be in place in early 2016 and that it will be a state-of-the-art facility when the physical structure is there and is fitted.  What can the HSE do to ensure additional bed capacity is available for people who are coming through the accident and emergency department at the regional hospital in Limerick over the period until the new emergency department is up and running in 2016?</p></speech>

That can happen quite quickly.  As the Deputy said, we may have to do certain things during surges in demand like those we expect to see in winter.  For example, we may have to convert wards that currently accept patients for just 12 hours a day and start using them 24 hours a day.</p></speech>

I think there is much more opportunity for better utilisation of the four sites.  I totally agree with the Deputy that it is unacceptable to have patients on trolleys in Limerick.</p></speech>

It is a question of the particular circumstances that arose coming out of the reconfiguration.  I will put it this way.  While Dr. O'Connell would like everything to be explored, he is not averse to the medical assessment unit being made available on a short-term-basis, subject to discussions with local management, if extreme pressures arise.  He is willing to explore the use of a ward that is currently being operated on a 12-hour basis.</p></speech>

Deputy Sean Fleming made the astute observation that cost figures are not included in the report.  It was something that we looked at.

That is where money follows the patient comes in.  That is where the huge opportunity is in terms of diagnosis related group-based, DRG, costing.

We have a note on the public moneys going to Irish Water in 2014 which we can examine once due diligence has been completed on the transfer.  Last week we asked for clarification of the matter which we have now received.  The clerk has also provided a note outlining the figures in the list of correspondence.</p><p>  The next item of correspondence is dated 24 October and was received from Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and follows up a Committee of Public Accounts meeting.  This correspondence is to be noted and published. </p><p>  The next item is correspondence, dated 24 October 2014, from Mr. John Murphy, Secretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, regarding a follow-up from a Committee of Public Accounts meeting with Shannon Development.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  I have received further correspondence on the matter and I do not know whether other Members have received the same.  It arrived late yesterday and this morning.  We will circulate the correspondence.  I ask the clerk to pull together the information and also to provide a cover note.</p></speech>

I wish to mention one other item.  I refer to the reply to the question regarding the liabilities incurred by the Exchequer due to the Irish aviation superannuation scheme.  I am not sure if I have taken the right implications from the reply.  It suggests that all liabilities, duties, etc. were transferred when Shannon Development became a commercial enterprise to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am concerned that there is a major debate taking place on the IAS scheme and whether certain liabilities on the pension scheme was picked by the Department.  At present the vast majority of the people covered by the scheme in terms of deferred pensions, whether they are active or retired, have a major controversy raging.  People wonder whether this matter was dealt with prior to the commercialisation of Shannon Development for those employees who came under the scheme in that remit.  I seek further clarification that the decision would be relevant to the current decision that is covered statutorily.</p></speech>

I request that we adjust the work programme to include those commitments and, if necessary, we can meet for a second day during the week just to clear it between now and Christmas.

All such complaints referred after the commencement of Part 4 will be subject to the reformed procedures.<br/>Amendment No. 83 is necessary to ensure that all relevant provisions within other individual enactments and statutory instruments which are provided for in Schedule 2 will be repealed upon the commencement of Part 4 of the Bill.<br/>In simple terms, this is providing that the appeal procedures of the new provisions will apply once they are in place.</p></speech>

In the current structures, there are persons within the process for two and three years.  This amendment seeks to ensure there is timely resolution and that employers, instead of having six weeks' notice, would have two weeks' notice served by the inspector to the Labour Court.  That is sufficient time to lodge an appeal.  It would ensure there would not be vexatious issues with regard to compliance.</p></speech>

They seek to reduce the time period from 42 days, as provided for in the Bill, to 14 days.</p> <p>The Bill seeks to standardise the time periods for appeals across the broad spectrum of employment rights legislation and provides for a 42 day appeal period for decisions of workplace relations commission, WRC, adjudicators and the Labour Court.  This was the existing provision in respect of the Equality Tribunal, for example, and it is in accordance with the rules of court.  The proposed amendments would not be consistent with the standardisation of time limits in employment rights legislation generally, which this Bill strives to achieve.  This is regarded as a reasonable standard to allow someone who has had an adjudication to provide an assessment of it in the case of a compliance notice or a fixed payment notice.  This is regarded as reasonable in terms of a procedure of this nature, which is of considerable significance in the case of those adjudicated against.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The topic is something we have discussed on a regular basis in the past three and a half years.  There are many examples.  Let us suppose company A tenders for a local authority project.  Company A will have the necessary length of time in existence, the necessary insurance capacity, the necessary funds and the necessary turnover, etc.  Company A then wins the tender and employs staff through another associated company.  Usually these companies have the same directors.  This is known as a corporate veil.  A paper wall is built within one entity, creating two entities, in an effort to achieve a specific objective.  In the case I have in mind, company B, which employed the staff, then went to the Labour Court and argued that it could not afford the rates of pay and was in a position in which it was about to collapse.  The determination was that there would be some decrease in the wages of the staff as a result.  We have seen this with retail outlets as well.  We have also seen it in certain insolvency cases whereby certain people maintained they could not afford redundancy payments, etc.  It is an important issue.<br/>The <i>status quo</i>has the effect, in the construction, waste disposal and retail sectors, of significantly reducing people's rights, entitlements, wages and conditions, and often their redundancy and future pensions.  I have sought information and advice on the matter.  Previously the view was that constitutionally nothing could be done because a corporate entity was a specific person in front of the law.  I understand that although we may attribute a criminal offence to such individuals, it cannot be done.  Anyway there is no doubt in my mind that there have been cases before the Labour Relations Commission whereby company B has been made responsible for the actions of company A.  For example, I know of a case in which an individual employed people under a transport name to, mar dhea, transport items to a construction site.  Then, on the construction site, those individuals were involved in construction.  The purpose was to avoid paying the rate agreed under the registered employment agreement for the construction site.  This amounted to wholesale manipulation of the loophole for the benefit of unscrupulous employers and to the detriment of the workers.  It is interesting that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has supported this particular amendment and said that it is a necessary measure.  I am requesting that the Minister support the amendment to pierce the corporate veil.</p></speech>

In the case of offences under this Act, extending liability for the debts of an insolvent company to the officers of the company would, I am advised by the Attorney General, be constitutionally suspect and would represent a major departure in company law.</p><p>  The overriding principle of company law is that a director's duties are owed to the company and not to the individual shareholders or employees.  If there is a breach of duty on the part of a director which causes damage to the company, he can be sued or held liable for damages.  Claims can be brought by shareholders, by a financial institution or on a director-versus-director basis.  Liability may arise out of lack of care and skill in the performance of the director's duties, negligent advice or a misstatement.  Any act which goes beyond the limits of the company's constitution, such as excessive borrowing, unauthorised payments, failure to disclose the full extent of the director's interests or a failure to comply with requirements, may involve a director or officer in personal liability.</p><p>  Company law penalties vary from restriction or disqualification orders to fines and periods of imprisonment.  The Companies Bill provides for a four-tier categorisation for most of the offences, with the exception of fraudulent trading and market abuse.  The Companies Bill also contains a new provision in section 872 whereby, following conviction for an offence under the Companies Act, a trial judge can order that the convicted person should remedy any breach of the Companies Act in respect of which he was convicted.  In effect, the provisions of the Companies Bill amount to a more constitutionally robust rewording of section 383 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 100 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  From a company law perspective, the proposed amendment challenges the entire principle of company law.  If it were to be implemented, the doctrine of separately legal personality would become a exception rather than the rule.</p><p>  Having regard to the foregoing, I am not going to accept the amendment.  What the Deputy is suggesting is, on the advice of the Attorney General, not something I can accept.  We are looking to have new enforcement procedures under this Bill.  This is one of the areas we are seeking to improve.  Where there is a breach and a finding for the worker, the idea is that it becomes easier to enforce such cases, and that is being provided for in this legislation.  The Deputy's amendment is seeking to reconstitute company law and, for the reasons outlined, that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I am not an expert in the field.  We do not set statutory obligations in respect of redundancy, except for the statutory two weeks plus provision.  That is statutory redundancy.  I gather that what the Deputy is referring to are companies that have structures such that when they close they do not pay money in addition to statutory redundancy.  I do not believe we have provision in law to oblige people to adjudicate on what ought to be the non-statutory redundancy.  There has never been any such provision.

This section is relevant to the debacle that took place at the Kishoge site.  The ICTU has sought an amendment such that not only an individual contractor but also the long chain of subcontractors would be subject to procurement rules.  Specifically, the contracting authority should be empowered to exclude from a tendering process any operator who has not been responsible with regard to employment law.  This type of arrangement is in place in the United States where, under state contracts, not just the main contractor but also the subcontractors can be paid directly and should be subject to procurement rules.  It should also be borne in mind that EU directives will be brought into law by 2016 which refer to joint and several liability.</p></speech>

One of these problems is that the existing regime does not necessarily have the teeth to ensure unscrupulous employers fulfil their responsibilities.  Penalties must represent sufficient incentive to bring such employers into line.  I realise there is a constitutional consideration in that any fine over &euro;5,000 is, owing to precedence, considered to be a criminal matter and, therefore, cannot be adjudged in such a forum as the workplace relations commission.  However, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from increasing the maximum penalty to &euro;4,000.  Setting the maximum fine at that level might prevent certain employers from taking a strategic decision to break the law.</p></speech>

The three "relevant offences" are those under section 11 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 which relates to the requirement for an employer to consult employees' representatives and the Minister on collective redundancies; section 4(4) of the Payment of Wages Act 1991 which relates to an employer's obligation to provide an employee with a pay slip; and section 23 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 which relates to an employer's obligation to provide an employee with a written statement of his or her average hourly pay.</p><p>  My concern in regard to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment is that doubling the maximum fee would be excessive.  I am taking advice on whether it would be appropriate to issue regulations setting out guidelines as to the appropriate monetary amount of notice in specific circumstances.  The overriding concern in practice is to ensure consistency in the application of this section and its provisions.  We are retaining the full weight of enforcement for more serious offences; this particular subsection, which sets out the fixed notice approach, might be seen as akin to how one deals with more minor traffic offences.  The nature of the offences dealt with curtails the level of fine we are considering.</p></speech>

The Bill, as published, provides that those offences created thereunder will be prosecuted by the commission.

Sections 36 to 39, inclusive, of the Bill, as published, provided separately for the appointment of case resolution officers and mediation officers by the director general to ensure that parties to complaints referred to the director general had access to a range of early intervention options.  The proposed amendments provide for the appointment of a single class of mediation officer who will deliver the full range of early intervention options.  This is a more streamlined and efficient arrangement from an internal operations perspective.

The competition for inclusion on the external adjudicator panel was advertised on 26 September and the closing date was 16 October.  There were approximately 300 applications.  The National College of Ireland has developed a 20-day training programme for WRC adjudicators.  It has been accredited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  It is intended to run the training programme as soon as the external panel of adjudicators has been appointed which will be on or very soon after the establishment day of the WRC.  Those selected for appointment will then have to complete the training programme and pass the associated examination which will cover the full range of requirements.  The training will cover all types of cases.</p></speech>

The Workplace Relations Bill seeks to standardise these time periods across the broad spectrum of employment legislation, that is, six months for referral of a complaint which can be extended to 12 months where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.  I consider that a period of two years within which to refer a complaint to the WRC would be unnecessarily long and unreasonable.  Such a proposal would also be inconsistent with employment legislation in other EU member states.  Therefore I am not going to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The wording, as published, could also be read as vesting in the adjudication officer or the Labour Court the power to determine whether a particular person could accompany or represent a party appearing before him, her or it.  This was not intended.  <br/>The proposed amendment removed the ambiguity in both respects by specifying in detail the full range of persons whom a party may choose to be accompanied or represented by and by carefully identifying the specified matters in which an adjudication officer or the Labour Court may exercise their discretion - that is, in accepting whether a body which purports to do so in fact represents the interests of employers and whether, in respect of a particular complainant, it is appropriate to permit some other person who does not come within the categories listed, (a) to (d), to represent a part in respect of that complainant.  The purpose of the latter discretion is to ensure that an adjudication officer or the Labour Court can intervene when he, she or it is of the view that it is in the best interests of the party concerned to do so in the matter of that party's choice of representation in circumstances where the party has chosen to be represented by a person not falling within the usual categories of representative.</p></speech>

This power of the Equality Tribunal was created in August 2011 and has not been used to date.

This amendment also provides for the standardisation of the relevant time limit applicable to refer an appeal to the High Court on a point of law in line with the corresponding provisions of amendment No. 44.</p><p>  Amendment No. 52 is a drafting amendment consequential as a result of amendment No. 53.  Amendment No. 66 provides for the insertion of a specific provision in the Unfair Dismissals Act to allow either party to a decision of the Labour Court on appeal under the 1977 Act to appeal the Labour Court's decision on a point of law to the High Court.  Currently, there is no statutory provision for such an appeal under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  This amendment also provides for the standardisation of the relevant time limit applicable to refer an appeal to the High Court on a point of law in line with the corresponding provisions of amendments Nos. 43 and 44.</p><p>  The reason we are not encouraging appeals on points of law at an early stage is that it gives the stronger party an opportunity to go to appeal on a point of law early in a procedure.  That would be contrary to what we are trying to achieve in terms of adjudication being a less legalistic arena and where people would have a better chance of getting a quick resolution of concerns.</p></speech>

The parties to the claim can refuse to have the matter dealt with by way of written submission but equality advocates argue that under equality legislation, this is another hill to climb for highly vulnerable complainants.  It may deflect a complainant from proceeding.

Section 70(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Employment Equality Acts of 1998 to 2011 empowers the director of the Equality Tribunal to propose to the parties concerned that suitable cases be dealt with on the basis of written submissions only and without the need for a hearing to the director of the WRC.  The parties in such a case are currently afforded the opportunity to make written representations in response to any such proposal by the director.  If either party objects to the matter being dealt with on the basis of written submissions only, the director is prohibited from investigating the case in that manner and a hearing would be scheduled.  The right of parties to object in such circumstances will also be replicated in the Workplace Relations Bill.  Based on the experience of the Equality Tribunal, it is envisaged that this power would only be used very sparingly by the director general.  Therefore I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

This amendment aims to provide consistency and universality for the priority payments of awards under all relevant enactments in the context of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment extends this enabling provision in like manner to the services of the Labour Court.<br/>I note Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's opposition to section 69.  Section 69 is an enabling provision which would allow the Minister to levy fees and charges on users of services to be provided by the commission or the Labour Court.  However, I have decided not to introduce charges for access to workplace relations commission services for many reasons, chief among which is the belief that forum shopping will not be a feature of the new system.  The only exception will be in the case where a party who failed to appear at the first instance hearing of the workplace relations commission without good cause wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court; he or she will have to pay a fee of &euro;300 when lodging the appeal.  I wish to clarify that the introduction of any fees will require regulations, and such regulations can be annulled by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

While the present Minister might have good intent, and makes a logical argument for an application of a fee to prevent people skipping the first part of the process, the regulations mean it will be in the hands of future Ministers and there is the possibility a future Minister could be inequitable in his or her application of a fee.

It must be presented to the Oireachtas.  This is the basis on which it is proposed.  Some people wanted fees and others did not want fees under any circumstances.  I made the decision to provide for fees only in the case of an unreasonable failure to appear at the first instance.  It is reasonable to allow experience inform a Minister in future.  There is no ulterior motive in this.  It is just to allow flexibility without primary legislation.  It would require regulations and the Oireachtas has scrutiny of these.</p></speech>
