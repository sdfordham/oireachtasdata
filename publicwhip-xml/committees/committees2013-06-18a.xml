Agreed.</p><p>  Four of the proposals listed in Schedule A are grouped together.  COM (2013) 260 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council regarding animal health.  COM (2013) 262 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the production and making available on the market of plant reproductive material.  COM (2013) 265 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on official controls and other official activities.  COM (2013) 267 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on protective measures against pests of plants.  It is proposed that these proposals warrant further scrutiny and, as such, we request officials from the lead Department to attend before the committee to give a full explanation of the proposals in order to assist us in our scrutiny of them.  The committee can then decide whether it wishes to take further action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The remaining proposal, COM (2013) 245, is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1198/2006 and Council Regulation (EC) No. XXX/2011 on integrated maritime policy.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I thank them for attending the meeting and assisting us in our consideration of this issue.  I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are further asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I apologise on behalf of the Chairman who is unavoidably absent and attending the funeral of a long-standing friend.  I invite Mr. Medlycott to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

We convey the apologies of the regional manager at the Wicklow Mountains National Park, Mr. Wesley Atkinson, who had to be in Glendalough today for the visit of Ms Michelle Obama and her daughters.  It is a shame he cannot attend because his participation emphasises the inclusive nature of the work Wicklow Uplands Council is doing with a range of interest groups.  He has given us a good deal of help in preparing our presentation.</p><p>  Wicklow Uplands Council, established in 1997, is an independent voluntary organisation which provides a forum for interested non-statutory organisations and individuals to have their say in the decision-making process affecting the sustainable development of the local environment in the spirit of Local Agenda 21.  The council endeavours to promote the sustainable use and enjoyment of the Wicklow uplands in partnership with the people who live, work and recreate there.  Our logo which members can see on the screen comprises two hands reaching across to form a mountain.  This symbolises our commitment to working together with all interested parties to achieve a sustainable environment.  That type of co-operation sometimes leads to difficulties, but we operate on the principle that consensus is all.</p><p>  I will now hand over to our co-ordinator, Ms Heraty, who will speak about our study to identify the best management of upland habitats in County Wicklow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cara Heraty" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800003#C00700"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to present the recommendations made in our report.  I will be referring to the PowerPoint presentation on the screen.  The objective of the study was to use good science and collaboration to identify best management of upland habitats in County Wicklow, with the optimal balance of farming and biodiversity.  The study was financed by Leader funding provided by County Wicklow Partnership.</p><p>  As Mr. Medlycott remarked, the handshake in the hills in our symbol represents our <i>modus operandi</i> of consensus.  We only move forward when consensus is achieved.  After two very well attended public meetings hosted by Wicklow Uplands Council in 2011, a working group was established to tackle the issue of vegetation management in the Wicklow hills.  A grassroots approach was followed, encompassing representation by upland farmers, recreational users, Teagasc, staff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the council itself and the Irish Uplands Forum.  There was very strong upland farmer participation in the working group, with 11 farmers involved, and 30 meetings were held over a period of two years.  Each participant put in 60 hours, which is indicative of the commitment shown by local participants.  The group also liaised with staff of the Forest Service, the Heritage Council and Wicklow County Council.  In addition, there was consultation with farmers in the Comeragh and Cooley Mountains who experience some of the same issues which I will detail in the course of the presentation.</p></speech>

We will now take questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800005#E00300"><p>I welcome the delegation and thank them for the very comprehensive presentation.  There has been much work and research done on the area.  I come from Donegal, which is also a county of hills with lots of commonage grazing and hill grazing areas.  We have had our own difficulties, particularly with destocking on the hills and the dreadful fires in May 2011, when large parts of the county were burned.  Houses were almost lost and we came very close to loss of human life.  Thankfully, that did not happen.</p><p>  I will be as brief as possible.  County Wicklow has extensive Natura land, including SACs and SPAs and the national park.  The combined SACs and SPAs amount to 60,000 ha, which is a very large expanse of land.  We have had difficulties in Donegal with the designation of SPAs in particular and the total lack of consultation with landowners and farmers prior to decisions.  I ask if the council has any view on the designations made in Wicklow or the manner in which those designations have taken place.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This may be a tangential point but I ask if the council is of the view that designations should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, given the affinity between landowners and that Department, rather than of a Department that has no direct link with landowners.</p><p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the council's proposal.  The commonage framework directive and destocking on hills have come about as a result of EU policy - for example, the Natura sites, SPAs and SACs.  Hill farmers have to undertake restrictive farming practices and they must be compensated, because the overall allocation or the pot of money available to this country under the transfers from Europe, between Pillars 1 and 2, is about &euro;1.6 billion.  The reason we are getting that pot of money is that we have a substantial element of restricted farming and SAC and SPA lands.  The farmers concerned play an active part in protecting the Natura sites, which means we are in receipt of a bigger chunk of funding from Europe.  There has to be a compensation element built in.  The current compensation includes the disadvantaged area payment.  However, I am always fascinated at the manner in which the disadvantaged area scheme is administered.  For example, people with the best land in the country were in receipt of disadvantaged area payments while the guys on the hills were getting only a few euro extra per hectare for the poorest land in the country with all sorts of restrictions on stocking.  That was wrong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800006#F00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  I concur with much of what Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill said, particularly about the uncertainty surrounding the framework for Pillar 2 and the level of funding it will provide.  The problems experienced by hill farmers in County Wicklow, as outlined by the delegates, are the same as those facing farmers on the west coast, in my own county of Kerry, in west Cork and every area in which hill farmers are struggling to make a living on very marginal land.  The types of proposal the delegates have brought forward must be considered as part of a national plan in order to maintain family farm living in hilly and mountainous areas.  Ensuring people have a sustainable income which supports their families will have benefits for the wider community in the form of a knock-on effect for local businesses and employment.</p><p>  In terms of eligibility for the scheme, the delegates have proposed that 10 ha be the minimum eligible area.  Did they come across any farmer with a smaller holding than this in the course of their research?  They mentioned that under-grazing in some areas as a consequence of restrictions and so on was causing problems in controlling burn-off.  I agree that the problem is the existence of two separate burning calendars on the two parts of the island.  Will the delegates comment further in this regard?</p><p>  I acknowledge the effort the delegates have put into their proposals and I am particularly impressed that the committee included 11 farmers.  It is vital that stakeholders have a role in determining their own future.  Who knows better what needs to be done than those who are at the coalface and whose living is dependent on the outcome?  My party shares the concerns expressed by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill regarding Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP.  Pillar 2 is clearly the poor relation which seems destined to have only the crumbs from the table.  If there is to be a support mechanism such as that outlined by the delegates, it must be sufficiently funded to have a real impact in ensuring the sustainability of hill farming across the island.</p></speech>

What is Wicklow Uplands Council's relationship with Coillte?  Does the designation of the area to which they are referring as a national park assist or hinder them in their efforts and, if either is the case, will they explain why?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800007#G00200"><p>I will be brief because the previous three speakers have done an extremely good job of summing up and posing some questions.  Well done to the delegates on their collaboration, which was impressive.  It is not easy to collaborate different points of view and they all come from different areas.  Along the lines of what Senator O'Keeffe said, I do not come from a hill farming area; rather, I come from the valley beside the shore, the land of milk and honey, and I need some education.  I would be interested in particular to hear from Mr. Pat Dunne about the reality of being a farmer in that area.  To return to Senator O'Keeffe's point, how can we incentivise young farmers to enter or stay in this area?  I am one of those people who visit this area on a Sunday and I idolise and enjoy it.  I was very taken by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's visualisation of what will happen in five to ten years if we do not sit down and consider this.  I feel empathy for the delegates because we have two pillars in the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, whom we need to get into a room to engage properly on this.  It is pity the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has responsibility for burning policy and that it does not come under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Scotland, England, Wales and the Northern Ireland have the burning dates that were given but there must have been some reason a decision was made here to designate another period in line with the Wildlife Act.  Perhaps that decision was wrong, but I would like the delegates to clarify that.  I would welcome the alignment of the periods and I am desperately keen that we encourage the delegates to be careful of our wildlife and to protect all species.</p><p>  The slide showing the trend in ewe numbers is shocking.  In some areas the number of ewes has more than halved.  How and why has that happened?  Can the delegates educate us about how we can bring those numbers back up to the level pertaining in 2000?  What exactly has happened?  The decline in the ewe numbers has been dramatic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800007#G00300"><p>I thank the delegates from Wicklow Uplands Council for their presentation.  It was very interesting.  It was equally interesting to hear from the delegates we had in regarding the equivalent scheme in Burren.  We have to consider this matter in a way that supports rural Ireland, which is facing many pressures.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and others referred to the vision for this area in five to ten years' time.  We brought in an EU directive which had a vision regarding the destocking of our hills five to ten years ago and we can now see the effect it has had on sheep numbers in Wicklow.  We got that wrong.  Some of the plants on the hills, especially the ferns, have grown wild, and their growth has not been controlled because sheep are the best animals to do that.</p><p>  It is hard to get sheep back on a hill, because they have to be bred and trained to live on that hill; that is a long-term aspect in regard to restocking, and I agree with the delegates on that.  I did not see anything wrong with the farming practices that were in place ten, 15 or 20 years ago but bureaucracy went mad in terms of what we did in destocking our hills.  When the sheep were removed from the hills, I know there was increased biodiversity, with certain plants regenerating and taking over, but was there much of increase in the population of wildlife such as deer on the hills?</p><p>  As a Kilkenny man, I know Wicklow well as it is nearly a neighbouring county.  What percentage of the land in Wicklow is defined as upland?  I remember when I was campaigning for election to the Seanad that I did not realise the time it took to travel from east to west Wicklow across the hills, as shown on the map of Wicklow in the presentation.  It is a long drive to cover that large area late at night.  I understand the position of the farmers in the area.  I would say this is the largest upland area in Ireland and it has been a big challenge for farmers in the area to cope with, especially in the past two years when we have had wet and cold winters.  The delegates said that 300 to 400 farmers were involved.  How many of those farmers would be totally reliant on the upland area?</p><p>  The delegates stated that the scheme should look after active farmers.  We are engaged in the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, which are possibly the most important negotiations for this country for next seven years, and one of the stumbling blocks we find when we meet any group, whether it be EU representatives, Department officials or farm organisations, is how to define an active farmer.  I would interested to hear the delegates' definition.</p><p>  On the issue of burning policy, to which the previous speakers referred, I know that such burning cannot be done willy-nilly or at any time of the year but I do not agree with farming by dates, which, as we have seen in the context of the nitrates directive, has had a detrimental effect.  We have an extension under the nitrates directive until the end of September this year because of the pressures farmers are under due to fodder crisis.  The Department - whether it be the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - should examine the situation and stop trying to ensure that farmers farm according to dates directed by the EU.</p><p>  The delegates said that under the proposed scheme there would be an average payment of &euro;8,000 to between 300 and 400 farmers.  That would amount to approximately &euro;3.2 million, which would have to come out of Pillar 2 funding - that is, approximately 5% of the budget for Pillar 2.  We know the budget will be &euro;313 million, which the Government will have to match, and hopefully it will match it to the tune of 50% or 55%.  Even leaving aside payments under other schemes, nearly 5% of the budget for Pillar 2 would go to County Wicklow.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said the scheme should be supported under Pillar 1.  The Senator's party is proposing that people farming upland areas such as this with a flat rate payment and equalisation would be the beneficiaries from Pillar 1 under what is being proposed by Commissioner Cioloş.</p></speech>

Did the delegates have any communication or correspondence with the group there when it was compiling its scientific plan and drawing up proposals?  The Burren group was before the committee in recent months when it made an interesting presentation.  Am I correct in saying reference was made in the presentation to a funding scheme not drawn down under Pillar 2?  I would like to hear more about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cara Heraty" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800008#H00300"><p>I will deal with the first question on the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  There was a difficult period in County Wicklow, as in the rest of the country, when the designations were first made.  I am pleased to say that during the years the relationship with the National Parks and Wildlife Service has dramatically improved in County Wicklow.  We co-operate with it on a number of projects, one of which involves the protection of rural and upland environments and collecting material illegally dumped, together with Coillte and the local authorities.  We work with the service on some very successful projects.</p><p>  To clarify, the area of special protection is a subset of the SAC.  We are not talking about an additional 32,000 ha; it is a case of 32,000 ha of SAC, of which the SPA is a subset.</p><p>  From attending various presentations by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and as a member of the national working group that has been exploring a scheme for the uplands of Ireland, it is clear that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is moving from desk-based to evidence-based management plans.  The designation phase is now complete and according to the commitment to the EU 2020 biodiversity strategy, we must at least maintain and improve the condition of upland habitats.  In some cases European Court of Justice fines have been imposed.  That is why there is a response on issues such as the freshwater pearl mussel.  We know that the National Parks and Wildlife Service's priorities include such issues as the restoration of raised bogs, restoring the freshwater pearl mussel to eight rivers and sustainable management of uplands.  Another priority is grassland management in EU grassland habitats.  From discussions with staff at national level, farmers are recognised as being key to the delivery of the plans, not just because they own some of the areas which are designated but also because the staff and resources are not exist available within the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The service recognises the value of farmers, sometimes through holding grazing rights, even within national parks, and that they have a key role to play in improving the condition of habitats.  Currently, there is a huge gap in terms of the optimal stocking rates for production of biodiversity in the various types of habitat.  That is why in our report we recommend the parallel study to identify this and carry out some research.  We would love to work with Teagasc and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the study in the future.</p></speech>

He would have answered Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question about the relationship between our organisation and the national park in County Wicklow because if there was a difficulty, it is clear that the manager of the national park would not be presenting with us.  It is one of the more important aspects of what we have managed to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Dunne" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800008#H00500"><p>A number of issues were raised.  Understocking has been a huge problem in County Wicklow.  We never had an overstocking problem in County Wicklow, apart from in a couple of isolated places.  Even when the commonage framework plans were drawn up, at the time it was generally recognised in County Wicklow that we did not have an overstocking problem.</p><p>  As to the reason for understocking, it is simple; there is not a sufficient return from hill farming.  I am one of the few full-time hill farmers left on the Wicklow hills.  Most people have off-farm income because they need it.  It is as simple as that.  </p><p>  Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe asked a question about young farmers.  I have four sons, two of whom are keen to farm the hills, but, unfortunately, there is not sufficient income for them to do so.  That is the reality.  There are several similar situations in my area where other young fellows are mad keen to farm because there are good hills in parts of County Wicklow, but they must have an income to be able to provide in the future for a wife and children, whatever the case may be.  As it stands, that is not possible.  I would not be able to do it if I had a mortgage to pay.  Most of my family have gone through college at this stage.  As I have only one fellow left, I do not have the huge commitments someone with a younger family would have.  That is the reality.</p><p>  Burning dates was one issue that was raised.  It has been a huge problem in County Wicklow since the system was introduced and it was introduced without any consultation.  We were just told that was the case and that was the end of the story.  We have campaigned for a long time through the Wicklow Uplands Council to try to have the dates changed back to where they were but to no avail.  We have met various people and nearly all feel the same way about it.  We would like to see sensible burning dates and a proper rotational burning system which would ensure massive and dangerous burning similar to what happened in Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s place in County Donegal would not happen.  We had this a few years ago in the Sally Gap area of County Wicklow where thousands of acres were burned.  It did not make the same headlines because there were no houses close to it and there was no health risk, as such.  This spring there was a big burning in Ballycroy National Park in County Mayo where 15,000 acres were burned.  If one goes back to the days when farmers managed the hills and they burned a little every year, there was never any big burn because if a fire happened to start, it ran into an area that had been burned the previous year and it did not go any further.  That system worked for generations.  Because I am out on the hills for a good deal of my time - I also do a good bit of hillwalking with a walking group - I am aware that the number of grouse has declined dramatically since the burning dates were changed.  Where I used to see ten and 12 packs of grouse on the hills when out gathering sheep, I am now lucky if I see two or three grouse, such is the decline in numbers.</p></speech>

If we have the very fine weather that we had a fortnight ago and a very good summer, members can be quite certain that there will be a major fire in County Wicklow.  That will destroy not just the heather and the mountains but also the wildlife and everything else.  With the heather at the height it is at now, there is potential for major destruction and it could be a catastrophe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Byrne" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800009#J00500"><p>To pick up on sheep numbers, the figures Ms Heraty has displayed are for the numbers of sheep in the different district electoral divisions, DEDs.  This hides a much larger problem in County Wicklow in that while the sheep are there, the farmers do not put them out on the hills.  They may still have the same numbers, but they are not putting them out on the hills and if they are, it is for a very short period.  The problem is much more severe than what has been highlighted.  Unfortunately, we do not have figures, but anecdotally, from talking to farmers, we know that many still have sheep, but they are not putting them out near the hills.  That is a much bigger problem.</p><p>  On the reason sheep numbers fall, the main reason is that they are not making money.  The national farm survey shows that, without direct payments, hill farmers are losing money.  That is the bottom line.  Why would they keep more sheep to lose more money and endure more hardship?  That is the reason sheep numbers are falling.</p><p>  In terms of incentives for young farmers and so on, we have had various discussions among ourselves, but one of the issues in hill areas is that young farmers do not have access to the hills because of the way the schemes - the single farm payment and the area aid scheme - have been structured.  Farmers already have their payments based on the land area they are farming.  They need to keep these areas on their area aid or single farm payment scheme forms to receive their payments.  Therefore, young farmers starting out do not have access to the hills.  If we could free this a little, that would be one possible avenue by which to encourage young fellows to take up farming.  The other big one is if there was a profitable sheep enterprise.  If there is no money in it, they will not stay.</p><p>  Someone brought up the issues of under-grazing on the hills and heather management.  Traditionally in County Wicklow the heather is grazed and when it becomes too strong, we have to burn it to generate young growth.</p><p>  I deal with farmers from Teagasc and so on, but the pattern of sheep grazing on the hills is very important.  This also leads to the problem with burning.  We no longer put sheep on the hills for the winter months.  The winter and early summer months are the time of the year when sheep graze on the heather.  These are the periods in County Wicklow, in particular, when sheep are not being put back on the hills and unless we can do something to address this, the heather getting strong and having to continue to burn it will still be an issue.</p><p>  Some years ago a trial was undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service on Djouce mountain.  It carried out a controlled burn and swiping operation.  It achieved great results, but because sheep were not put back out at the appropriate time to graze on the heather, it was fit to be done again.  Using sheep is the most effective way of controlling the problem.  Unfortunately, even if one is actively farming with sheep, one still needs to burn the heather as part of a long-term control plan.</p></speech>

We do not have any control over them, but obviously hill farmers would love to see as much money as possible coming to them under the CAP.  However, what we want is not a payment - I have stressed this point on several occasions - for simply owning land.  It is a payment for works done.  If one happens to own an area of mountain land and is prepared to go out and get the vegetation on it into good condition for livestock, wildlife, biodiversity and recreational users, one will be compensated or paid in a meaningful way for doing this rather than receiving a flat, across the board payment per hectare.</p></speech>

That issue will have to be worked on.  There is a lot of work to be done on the plans.  I believe each commonage will have to be looked at in a separate way to see what stock is needed to keep the vegetation in proper condition.  We want a payment for work done, not just because somebody happens to own ten, 20 or 50 ha of land.  We want people to be paid for work done rather than just owning land.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800009#J01300"><p>I am sorry; I was at another meeting and could not attend earlier.  </p><p>  There is a great deal of sense in the various points the delegates have raised.  I would like to address my colleagues and the delegates on the single farm payment issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has produced figures for me based on productivity, excluding tillage farmers.  What they show is that the farmers receiving more than &euro;400 or &euro;500 per hectare are less than twice as productive as those receiving less than &euro;250 per hectare.  If the minimum payment was fixed at &euro;200 for those now receiving under &euro;250, it should be less than &euro;400 for those now receiving &euro;500 or more.</p><p>  That brings me to the issue of what is an active farmer.  A farmer rang me last night.  Like many farmers around where I live, he farms 2,000 ft. above sea level.  If one does not have to be active to do this, one does not have to be active to do anything.  It is not easy to get a tractor to the top of the mountains where he is located.  I think we will park the issue of what is an active farmer.  As I said, on the production aspect, there is no factual basis to the argument being made by the Irish Farmers Association on production because the figures provided by the Senator's own Minister give the lie to it.  Unless the Senator wants to take up the figures with him, I have to go by whatever figures he gives me and they are the production figures.</p><p>  To return to the issue of hill farming, it seems everybody wants to have a slice of the hills and to have the hill farmer keep the hills in the way they want them kept, but it seems nobody wants to pay for keeping them in the way they want them to be kept.  The hill walker wants to walk on the hills and I am all for hill walking.  I was a great promoter of hill walking through Comhairle na Tuaithe which I set up.  However, I recognise that people walking the hills of Ireland are walking on private land.  The ecologists want to have a slice of the hills and want us to keep them in a fancy way to preserve all the heathers, the grouse and everything else.  In return for grants, the agriculturalists also want to have access to the hills and want to know what we are producing on them.  We should put down a clear marker.  If we want people farming on the hills, they will have to be paid.  They have to have a livelihood, directly or indirectly, from which there is no getting away.  If we close one door to them, we will have to open another because the public good demands that the hills be kept in good order.</p></speech>

He asked the reason the systems of sheep production changed.  The biggest reason was that what people were doing was not making money.  The nature of sheep production has changed.  Years ago, when people were actively farming the hills, there was no such thing as spring lamb.  Now everyone is pushing for spring lamb.  In County Wicklow we had a market for the Suffolk Cheviot cross ewe lamb, but, again, that trade has died off and it is not as profitable as it used to be.  </p><p>  The Deputy has asked the reason farmers began to bring sheep down off the hills and feed them away from them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Dunne" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800011#L00200"><p>As a hill farmer, I would certainly agree with many of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's comments.  It is obvious that he knows a good deal about hill farming.</p><p>  I would make a couple of points in addition to what Mr. Byrne said.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service in Wicklow, which was mentioned here on a few occasions, takes in sheep to graze on the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  There are 34 or 35 farmers who pay a nominal fee per head each year to put sheep in.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service's idea is that it is the best way of managing the commonage and keeping the vegetation right.  Likewise, the Department of Defence owns approximately 9,000 acres of land in the Glen of Imaal, which is a shooting range.  They take in sheep there per head by the year as well and they tell me that it is the same idea.  They take them in there because that is how they keep the vegetation in condition, for health and safety, etc.</p><p>  There was a question raised earlier about AEOS by Senator O'Neill.  I did not pick up on it at the time and he has gone now.  He stated that there was &euro;12,000 paid in AEOS.  As we all will be aware, the maximum payment in AEOS is &euro;4,000.  I was in REPS and I came out of it.  I was drawing a payment of &euro;12,336 per year in REPS and when that ran out, I went into AEOS where I am getting &euro;4,000.  That is a hell of a difference.  One cannot make that up by selling extra stock.  It is just not there.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned collops in Wicklow.  There are some collops in Wicklow.  Also, there are equal shares.  Some of the mountains in Wicklow are owned outright by farmers.  There is a range of ownership issues in Wicklow and there is much work to be done there.</p><p>  What Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated about some farmers would not be able to farm the hills or do the work that is needed is quite true.  He spoke of a farm at 2,000 ft. above sea level.  The one that I farm runs up to the top of Log na Coille, up to 3,000 ft. above sea level.  One cannot get a tractor up to it.  It is as simple as that.  A quad bike can go part but not all of the way.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's idea of the rural social scheme, RSS, workers is certainly a good one.  If farmers are unable to do the work themselves and if there are funds available that would pay a young fellow or a couple of fellows to do the work that is needed to be done, that should be encouraged.</p><p>  On the scheme, as Mr. Byrne stated, while we think that the whole commonage should be taken into consideration, it has to work somewhat like the basis on which REPS worked.  It also must be optional.  If there are farmers who do not want to be in it, one cannot force them into it.</p></speech>

I was trying to be in two places at the same time.</p><p>  Mr. Brown said that various people suggested changing the breed of sheep.  He stated this would require research and that he hoped to do this.  I would have believed that with all the various organisations involved in farming, research and education, it would not be necessary to start again in this regard.  I would have believed somebody would have known the answer.  Perhaps I did not understand what Mr. Byrne said.</p></speech>

Very little has been done in the interim.  The research was mostly carried out in the west on increasing output in respect of the Scotch horny ewe or mountain black-faced ewe.  We propose an economic study rather than a physical study.  It is a question of selling the concept of change to farmers.</p></speech>

If we had it and could demonstrate the results to farmers, it would represent a big sea change. The traditional choice in Wicklow is the Cheviot ewe.  The tradition is significant and I am not running it down.  I am just suggesting that a hardy breed may be more suited to certain hills.  Perhaps the Cheviot ewe needs to be made more hardy to stay on the hill for longer.  Increasingly, spring lamb production is becoming the trend but spring lamb production and hill farming do not go together.</p></speech>

With very few exceptions, if farmers put sheep to the hills at all, it is for just six weeks or a month after weaning.  The dry ewes are brought to the hill and are soon brought down.  Basically, the sheep farming system is a lowland sheep farming system.  What we need to do in the longer term is return to proper hill farming, but this involves a big sea change for many farmers.</p></speech>

All this work started because people such as Mr. Dunne and other members of our board decided we should study the Burren.  We have had much contact with Mr. Michael Davoren in the Burren and Mr. Dunford.  If it had not been for them and their support for us, we probably would not be present today.  There are very strong links.</p><p>  A question was asked about the selling of Wicklow lamb at an earlier stage.  Cheviot sheep owners decided two or three years ago to try to develop a scheme for the sale of Wicklow lamb.  This scheme did not get off the ground because there was a big drop in lamb prices that coincided with its introduction.  However, the scheme is still in the background.</p><p>  A question we have not fully answered is the question of young farmers.  There are 27 members on our board, one of whom is a member of Macra na Feirme who represents quite a large number of young and active farmers in Wicklow.  One of the people most involved in the lamb scheme is a young farmer who lives in the Glencree-Glencullen area.  We still have some young farmers in Wicklow, some of whom are operating on a full-time basis.</p><p>  This report is not just a report produced on behalf of the hill farmers of Wicklow.  It is also very clearly produced on behalf of the Wicklow Uplands Council.  It is important to understand that the council is not just an organisation of farmers.  It represents motorbike users, scramblers, mountaineers, climbers, community groups, etc.  Before the report saw the light of day and before its launch by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, a couple of weeks ago in Glendalough, it had the unanimous support of the entire board of the council.  When it was discussed at council meetings, nobody was really against it.  The reason we are all in favour of it is that we are concerned about protecting and preserving the hills of Wicklow, as implied by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>

A total of 17 early warning notices are also listed for noting by the committee.  I propose that we deal with the Schedule B items first.</p><p>  It is proposed that the proposals listed on Schedule B - COM (2013) 142, COM (2013) 143 and COM (2013) 152, do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is also proposed that the committee note the 17 early warning notices listed on Schedule B.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<b></b><br /><b></b>There are two proposals listed on Schedule A.  COM (2013) 207 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups.  The proposal relates to the corporate governance of large companies.  Its purpose is to increase the relevance, consistency and comparability of non-financial information published by companies across the European Union, the objective being to improve companies' transparency and performance on environmental and social matters and thereby contribute to long-term economic growth and employment.  The Department has indicated that this proposal will have limited application in Ireland and that no subsidiarity issues arise.  However, as it will involve extra reporting obligations on large companies and the Department has yet to formally engage with stakeholders on the issue, it is proposed that the committee engage directly with stakeholders by seeking submissions from interested parties on the proposal via its website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This is an important issue.  We can decide later if we want to proceed further and have a round-table discussion on the proposal.</p><p>  COM (2013) 237 is a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No. 1344/2011 suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on certain agricultural, fishery and industrial products.  On 21 May the committee requested that an advice note be drafted on this proposal which was listed as a Schedule B item.  The proposal relates to a duty suspension scheme operated by the European Union which allows operators in the Union to apply for a suspension of duty on imported raw materials.  Based on the advice note provided and our discussion thereon, it is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome all of our guests to our discussion on the report into which Senator David Cullinane has put a great deal of work in the past few months.  He has carried out many interviews and engaged with many stakeholders, but before we finalise the report, it is important that we have a chance to discuss some of the issues involved with our guests.  We have set aside today to discuss all of the options, suggestions and areas in which we can make improvements.  The committee is anxious to ensure the report will help in pulling together existing reports and information and, apart from adding a critique, add new suggestions and value to them.    </p><p>  I welcome to our first session Mr. Joe Crockett, Kilkenny county manager; Ms Nora Widgre, president, Waterford Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Michael Walsh, Waterford city manager; and Mr. Senan Cooke, Dunhill Community Enterprises.  All of our guests are very welcome, but I extend a special welcome to Mr. Crockett.  We had him in County Meath when I was first elected to the local authority and I am delighted that he is here as part of the group.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

If members have questions about the rest of the presentation, I can address them.</p><p>  On how the region should perform, in 2010 Kilkenny County Council started to examine how we might develop an economic model for ourselves.  In examining the issue of economic development the key elements to be considered are what the State is trying to do, what its main economic policies are and where the competitive advantages it sees for itself lie at national level.  One then works down through regional economic policy, as identified by Forf&aacute;s which has been the most active agency in dealing with this issue.  It has produced the regional competitiveness agendas, while the council has produced its own economic development strategy which focuses on the issues I mentioned, namely, third level education and research, tourism, agribusiness and so on.  </p><p>  A new regional economic model is being prepared by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We do not know what its shape will be, but there is a need for an alignment between the three levels, namely, national, regional and local.  If there was policy and objectives harmonisation between all of the enterprise agencies involved, there would be a greater focus and better spend by everybody.  That would be very helpful, not only to the south-east region but to all regions.</p></speech>

I was recently appointed President of Waterford Chamber of Commerce and I am joined today by my fellow board member Mr. Jonathan Earl.  Since 1787 the chamber has offered a voice to Waterford business.  At present its membership ranges from the smallest SMEs to multinationals with a base in Waterford.  The chamber of commerce represents a cross-section of commercial life and is committed to working closely with all who champion Waterford.</p><p>  SEEDS is the acronym for the south east economic development strategy, which Senator Cullinane is working on as a rapporteur for the committee.  In a way, seeds are also the topic of my presentation, in which I will speak about what Waterford Chamber of Commerce sees as the seeds of economic recovery for the city and the region.  While I want to take the opportunity to look to a better future and how we might reach it, we cannot ignore the real and serious economic challenge we face, with more than 55,000 people on the live register in the region in May.  It is no coincidence that just 23.1% of people in the south east who have completed their full-time education have a third-level qualification, compared with a national average of 29%.  In short, not enough job opportunities are being created in the region and too few of those out of work have the skills for the available jobs.</p><p>  Having outlined the challenges, I will now strike a more positive note by mentioning the first-class employers that are currently operating in Waterford.  There are more than 30 IDA-supported multinational companies in Waterford city and county, employing well over 5,000 people.  Our success stories include TEVA, Honeywell, Sun Life Financial and Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, which currently employs more than 1,200 people.  We are also very proud of Genzyme, which employs more than 550 people at its Waterford site.  An equally welcome new arrival is Nypro Healthcare.  In the indigenous sector, Eishtec is an outsourced contact centre that was established by three local people who had worked together previously and now employs more than 400 people in Waterford, although as recently as May 2011 it had only nine employees.  Two entrepreneurs who used to work together in a pharmaceutical multinational in Waterford have set up EirGen Pharma, which employs around 80 people.  It is a great example of the spin-off benefits to be gained from building expertise in world-class manufacturing.  In addition, there was announcement last May from a WIT spin-out company called FeedHenry of the creation of an extra 100 jobs and an investment of &euro;7 million, which was also very welcome.</p><p>  Whether we are talking about multinational or indigenous companies, the key for Waterford and the south east is to have operations that are constantly moving up the value chain, so that they are less exposed to relocation to cheaper sites overseas.  We also need to avoid over-reliance on a single employer, as happened with Waterford Crystal.</p><p>  The food sector is also important to Waterford.  Glanbia is investing &euro;150 million in a world-class milk processing facility at Belview.  Also in the agri-business sector, Dawn Meats is creating 65 additional jobs, so agribusiness is a very important sector for Waterford and the south east.  While the unemployment situation in Waterford and the south east is grave, we are certainly not without hope or without the drive and energy to achieve the region's potential.</p></speech>

Waterford and the south east general are under-performing economically.  Relative to other regions there has been a decline.  In some respects that is not rational because the region has a lot of natural advantages.  As Mr. Crockett outlined, there is fertile land and an agri-industry which is at the forefront nationally and is world class by any standard.  Equally the region is proximate to internal and external markets.  It should not be the case that it is under-performing.  It seems to be a systemic weakness, something that is not right.  I will not over-elaborate on the reasons because there is a multitude of them and the situation is complex.  Some of the reasons include a reliance on traditional industries up to relatively recently.  That transition is now happening and it needs to be given even more energy to bring about a new economy.  There is a little bit of an issue with educational attainment and there is talk of a technological university but the statistics do not lie in that context.  External competition is a catch-all I use but the reality is that the external competition is very near, the two big brothers in Dublin and Cork are now within one and a half hour's journey.  They are pulling at the edges of the region which has a population of 500,000 but the two big beasts are attracting the population on either side of the region.  Internal competition may be over-egged but the region is unique in the country in that it contains four significant urban areas within a 30 mile range which are competing with each other.</p></speech>

I will be steering the discussion to community enterprise level, where real changes can be made and the benefits of the new strategy, infrastructure enhancements and all the other improvements at the higher level can impact significantly.  There is, unfortunately, a sense of real helplessness in many communities in the context of high unemployment and forced emigration.  For young people in particular, leaving college and seeking to secure employment is a daunting prospect.  Our population is better educated, more business literate, more well travelled and well networked and more confident than ever before.  However, families, clubs and communities are heavily impacted by unemployment and forced emigration.  People have every incentive to get involved in efforts to improve the situation where the opportunity is available.</p><p>  Community enterprise is often taken to be exactly the same as social enterprise, but there is a difference.  There are different levels of enterprise support, namely, fully-funded employment, partly-funded employment and self-sustaining, profit-making enterprises.  We are interested in the third of those.  I have been a voluntary activist and researcher in enterprise development in the Waterford area since 1993, Dunhill being my local area.  People have come from all over the country to Dunhill to discuss what can be done at grassroots level in communities.</p><p>  Community enterprise is not just social enterprise, which brings up a whole range of problems in terms of a definition, about fully-funded employment, partly funded employment and third level which we are interested in is self-sustaining employment, profit-making enterprises.  research from 1993</p></speech>

Before I call Deputy Calleary, l will first call our rapporteur, Senator Cullinane.  As we have had a number of presentations, we are a little behind on time and while the rapporteur may need some more time, I ask the members to be brief in their questions.  I will take three groupings of questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming here today.  I met some of them already as part of the consultation process and there are some I have not met.</p><p>  Mr. Michael Walsh clearly set out the challenges the south east faces.  Any of the research we carried out into examining the south east economically, and the Forf&aacute;s report was the most recent one, showed that, unfortunately, the region has underperformed in terms of educational attainment, entrepreneurial activity and economic activity generally, and that it has a high level of unemployment.  Equally, there are huge strengths in the region, and Mr. Michael Walsh hit on a key point when he said that there is no good reason the south east is underperforming to the extent that it is.  There is probably a myriad of reasons that is the case.  During my consultations across the region, it struck me that there is huge potential in the region, and if we exploit that and can make things work, we can certainly turn things around.  The key factor here is integration and cohesion at a regional level.</p><p>  I agree with the Kilkenny county manager, Mr. Joe Crockett, that we need to join up policy from national to local level.  That is one of the problems.  We have not had that.  We can all be critical of enterprise agencies in terms of perhaps their perceived failures in the region, but what we need to do is identify the strengths of the region and the key areas, and some of those have been identified, and how we can develop an integrated strategy that is rooted in the needs of the community and, more importantly, in the region, but also that is rooted in the needs of enterprise and industry.  We do not have that to the extent we need it.  We need to do a bit more work in that area, and we need to take that on board in terms of vision and policy.</p><p>  I have a few questions on some issues that arose during the consultations.  One of the criticisms is that the enterprise agencies are not doing enough, and whether that is fair or unfair or that is a perception or reality, that is an opinion.  The IDA has produced its own reports and a breakdown, on a county by county basis, of the number of site visits there have been for each county and region and the number of jobs that have been created and lost.  Unfortunately, during the past four to five years, the south east has not faired all that well.  One of the reasons the IDA offers for this is that while it has a job of work to do to bring jobs to the State, equally it would cite a lack of property solutions as a problem in the region.  Is that the case?  I know that might be different in certain counties.  It seems to be more of a problem in Wexford and there may be other areas.  Is that a problem and, if it is, local authorities have a responsibility also to be part of that solution.</p><p>  Is there merit in the IDA having a regional office in the south east?  How important would that be and would that be something the mangers present and the chamber of commerce would support?</p><p>  Regarding the university issue, we all accept that would be a game changer.  I am very supportive of a technological university.  I know there are people who would have a different view and they make comparisons with Trinity, UCC and UCD, but it comes down to the needs of the community in the region.  I would favour a university that is based on innovation, research and development, creating that critical mass of research and development and fostering creativity.  That is what it is about for the region and we are certainly very strong on that.  I know that Waterford IT will address us later and the Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group, TSSG, is first class in terms of research and development.</p></speech>

I welcome the groups, particularly the chamber of commerce witnesses.  I know many of their predecessors.  They have done a great job.  I also know Mr. Crockett.</p><p>  If I want to go to the south east in the morning, what is the labour profile and skills analysis that is available to me?  What qualifications are available within the region if I want to locate a factory or tech centre there in the morning?  What kind of labour force is available to me?</p><p>  Could someone clarify the exact position with regard to the port at Belview?  I gather it is in Kilkenny but it is part of Waterford Port.  It pays rates in Kilkenny.  What is the management structure?  I do not want to get into the row between Waterford and Kilkenny but the chamber might be freer to express a view on the issue.  Is the expansion and promotion of the city of Waterford an issue?  I come from Ballina, from where we used to ship a lot of material from a couple of local industries to Waterford.  We ship a lot less there now as it goes to Dublin.  What is the unique selling point of a port in Waterford when there is the Europort in Rosslare and Dublin Port?  What is the position in terms of the future port strategy?</p><p>  I support the technological university but I am also concerned.  Institutes of technology have served the country well and there is a rush to get rid of them.  It is like moving the car up a model.  Mr. Walsh said he wants to promote the engineering sector.  Is there a danger that in moving to a technological university and all that goes with it, including research and development, we will forget the nuts and bolts of what the IT sector was set up to do?  It is an area we are very much coming back to focus on again in this country.  Perhaps it is a question for the groups that will come later, but what is being done to ensure the traditional engineering focus of institutes of technology will be maintained in the new technological university?</p><p>  I am from the west and we would say we are not getting enough love either.  We hear from every group that comes before the committee and as we travel around the country that all the funding is going to Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Waterford seems to be getting huge exposure this week on Today FM in particular.  Well done on that.  What is different about the south-eastern region?  What can the witnesses say is specifically different about their region and what does it have that another region could not offer to an employer?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for being present today.  I will start with Mr. Joe Crockett.  He spoke about the general issue of harmonisation of national, regional and local policies, which is critical.  I have been thinking about that myself.  Ms Widger gave two specific examples of pieces of infrastructure that need consideration, namely, the airport and the ports.  I will single out the airport.  It is a critical time now for the airport, which is a key piece of infrastructure, and we have been talking about it for a long time.  The manager of the airport, Mr. Graham Doyle, is leaving - which is bad news, in my opinion - to become an assistant secretary in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is significant that he is departing.  There are three options for the airport.  We are talking about &euro;1.25 million for the first and cheapest option.  The second option would cost approximately &euro;7 million.  To bring 737s into Waterford would cost approximately &euro;10 million.  Realistically, we are talking about an extension that would cost approximately &euro;1.25 million, the cost of a three-bedroom semi-detached house in parts of this city a few years ago.  It is not a lot of money.  As far as the Department is concerned, the case is being made, successfully, that it is worth investing in the airport.  The people who have worked there for the past four years have used every penny to try to lay the ground at the airport for additional expansion at the north and south ends of the runway to bring in different kinds of jet aircraft, as Ms Widger outlined, and to connect to London in particular.</p><p>  I will come to what Mr. Crockett said, but we have a national issue in terms of how we look at our budgets and how flexible and adaptable our budgets are generally.  I wish to focus on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for a moment, and examine how money is allocated.  We all have a responsibility - to use the words of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar - to invest in infrastructure and other items that are drivers of growth.  If we are all of the opinion that the airport is a key piece of infrastructure then we must examine the entirety of the transport budget and ask ourselves one question, namely, whether we are prioritising what we should prioritise from the budget.  In that context, the answer is "No".  I am having a discussion on the matter with the Minister currently.</p></speech>

Whether they are infrastructural, societal or governmental we are very much on the hind foot, so to speak.  It was once a strong manufacturing region that depended on traditional industry, as the manager said, but we now face new challenges, and Government recognises that.  What concerns me most, however, is the lack of coherence within the region.  As a region we are not competing with other regions.  That has been the case for many years but it is explicit now with the challenges we face.</p><p>  As policy makers and as politicians we must take into account what the witnesses have come here today to say to us.  We know much of it already but we must ask ourselves how we can best achieve what we set out to achieve.  I agree with Mr. Crockett that the first thing we need is a coherent regional strategy that identifies growth areas into which we can put our resources, as Deputy Deasy said, prioritise our budgets, prioritise our policies and go for it.  Unfortunately, the south east region has been fragmented heretofore.  We have a good deal of work to do.  That is even in recent debates whether on the medical side, industry or education in that segments within our own region are pulling it apart.  That is the way I see it.  Until we come together as a region and adopt a coherent regional strategy, we will not make the progress we need to make.  When we identify that strategy and adopt those objectives, we must identify the priorities and the drivers.  It is then up to all of us, as stakeholders in the region, to put in the resources that are required.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Calleary, I know the west has suffered in the past but it is not suffering as badly as the south east region is currently, especially Waterford city, which is on its knees economically.  It needs help, and I ask him to open his eyes and ears to what the people are saying here today.  </p><p>  My question is to both managers.  How best do they believe we can achieve that regional coherence from a local authority and service level?  How can Government, and we as policy makers, support that?</p><p>  I address my remarks to Mr. Senan Cooke.  The bottom up proposal of enterprise in communities is very important.  I come from a family that has created 15 jobs in our community.  I can tell the witnesses it has taken a generation of hard work to create those jobs, with only some support in the latter years.  It is a huge challenge to create jobs in small communities but it is not a challenge we should give up on.  We must motivate our citizens, our local authorities and our policy makers to look again to communities where there is real potential, and small jobs is where we will make the difference.  I fully support Mr. Cooke's proposal and I hope this committee will examine more closely the bottom up approach because small micro-enterprises growing over generations will be more sustainable and viable in the longer term.  I hope we will see progress on that front.</p></speech>

I was a member of Kilkenny County Council when we adopted the economic strategy in 2010.  I welcome Mr. Senan Cooke because I believe his initiative in the communities is extremely important, and not just in terms of job creation.  We continually talk about creating jobs but it is important to keep what is already in place to ensure we do not slide under that critical element where there is no road back.  I support Mr. Cooke in all of that.</p><p>  My question is to Mr. Crockett.  I have had this discussion with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, after the TalkTalk episode in Waterford where I put forward the notion that we can let IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland do what they were set up to do because they are the icing on the cake but we must be looking at our indigenous industries in the south east region.  Mr. Crockett mentioned some of them but I want to talk about the Carlow end where we have an excellent company called Keenan's.  </p><p>  A down side of what happened in the region was the loss of the sugar industry.  We will have a presentation on that later but even the dogs in the street knew that was the worst possible idea, and we have regretted it ever since.  It was a very large employer, and not just of the farmers who were growing the crop.  The road haulage industry was involved also.  Everybody benefited from it, even down to the local newspaper shop.  That was a retrograde step.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Crockett's outlook that we need to harmonise from the top down.  When he brought all his chief executives officers together what barriers, if any, did they say there were to doing business in Ireland?  What do we need to do, as public representatives, to break down those barriers if any exist?</p></speech>

I have just one question and it relates to the airport.  Obviously, having the longer airport runway means that planes with jet engines can land, which opens up opportunities.  Are there any discussions on the possibility that if this were to happen particular airlines would be willing to consider opening up routes in Waterford?</p><p>  I want to keep this conversation real.  I am a Dublin based Deputy and the reality, in terms of foreign direct investment, is that when the executives of companies like Google, PayPal and their brother and sister companies come to this country they do not want to travel any further than about an hour when they got off a transatlantic flight to go to their company.</p></speech>

However, before turning to the answers for this session, I remind members we are running a little late.  I apologise again to the presenters for the next two sessions but we are slightly behind.  I suppose the first session was going to take some time just to set the scene, but I ask the witnesses to be brief in their answers.  They may forward additional written information or add it to the report being drawn up by Senator Cullinane.  However, many questions have been asked and I acknowledge they cannot respond within a minute either.  Many areas have been covered, some of which have touched on issues for the second session on the third level sector.  Consequently, the witnesses may leave some of those questions if they do not wish to deal with them during this session.  In keeping the same order as the presentations were made, I invite Mr. Joe Crockett to respond.</p></speech>

I will try to go through them as briefly as possible.  With the permission of the Chairman, I will leave the Waterford Airport questions to my colleague, Mr. Michael Walsh.  While we both are on the Waterford Airport board, I would be most grateful were Mike to deal with that.</p><p>  Like the other members, I thank Senator Cullinane for his work as rapporteur in highlighting the issues.  He asked a number of questions and I agree with all the points he and all the other speakers made on the need for an integrated strategy, which for me is critical.</p><p>  On the question of property and property solutions, it is the case at present that for any place in which the Celtic tiger had been roaring, the property boom took place and there are leftover office buildings, there are particular commercial advantages to taking up such buildings at present because they can be let at such a low rent.  In the case of any city or place that does not have major office facilities in place, it is not possible to compete with the very low prices that are available in locations such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and this is a difficulty.</p><p>  In respect of other property solutions, it is the case that I suspect there is plenty of zoned land around the region.  As to whether there is plenty of serviced land and with regard to the supply that is needed, that is another question.  One thing we did collectively with regard to, for instance, Belview as a strategic site was to state it did have the strategic resource of having a block of land, a huge supply of water, a huge wastewater treatment capacity, a port and the railway right on the dockside.  This is a strategic advantage which, for example, Cork does not have and is one reason the Port of Cork was refused permission to expand.  Consequently, we have strategic advantage and it is a case of following through on the strategic advantage that exists.</p><p>  On the question Senator Cullinane asked regarding what steps could be taken to support the education sector, I suggest there are two key steps.  The first obviously pertains to the follow-through on the technological university.  In addition, I refer to the allocation of research funding by bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland.  If, for example, the State recognises the south east is to grow in areas such as agriculture and agribusiness and the related technology as well as in areas such as medical devices or the life sciences, then the resources must travel with it.  If one is to be serious about economic development, there must be a fair sharing out around proven leaders such as Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow that in turn link and work collaboratively with others.</p><p>  For example, Deputy Calleary asked what is the specific thing the south east does better than everyone else, and that thing is food and agribusiness.  This is something on which the south east leads the world.  We will be supplying into Europe and into China and our companies such as Glanbia, Keenan or Dawn Meats supply the world.  Therefore, it is my contention that we should do everything we possibly can to be world leaders in everything to do with agribusiness, agribusiness development and support, research and development, technology and so on.  The same point applies in respect of the other big area we have, which is medical devices.</p><p>  Again, every region has its strengths.  In the case of the west or the mid-west, it may be aviation, for example, or in the case of Dublin, it might be financing.  However, every place has its strengths and there will be some overlaps, such as can happen in respect of tourism.  In the whole, however, everyone will contribute.  For example, because the west has a very good tourism offering, as does the south east with regard to, for example, Kilkenny or the Viking past in Waterford, we can all contribute nationally to this.  I hope I have dealt with the three principal points made by Senator Cullinane.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary also raised questions on Belview and on the skill set.  The Forf&aacute;s regional competitiveness agenda report sets out the full data he sought and we can supply that to him, if he wishes.  However, the key thing to note about the region is that it has a population of approximately 500,000, which is a viable economic market in its own right.  Therefore, from my point of view, the south east as it currently stands should have its own subregional development.  I note the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has proposed that there be three super regions but that within this, there should be room for subregional development.  On the question of Belview, in my view it is a strategic national asset as well as being a regional asset and an asset for Kilkenny and Waterford.  We work collaboratively to make that what it is today.  Many members have mentioned that Glanbia has gone into that site and there is no doubt in my view that once Glanbia has put in its &euro;160 million worth of investment, others will follow.  Consequently, I am interested in getting ready for the next wave of development.</p><p>  Another point to bear in mind in respect of the Harvest 2020 proposals is that agricultural development will not stop at 2020.  This was one of the surprises to me.  It will continue to grow post 2020, as there still is a lot of capacity post 2020 for agriculture and agriproducts, and this is something we must bear in mind as we think about potential and where we should put our research and development money.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy raised the specific question of critical infrastructure priorities, and I agree completely with his assessment on the need for the State and the region to agree on the key infrastructure drivers we must have to drive strategic economic growth.  For me, the airport is one of the elements of strategic infrastructure, as is the port.  In place-making terms, the city of Waterford and the two hubs of Wexford and Kilkenny are equally important economic considerations that we must develop because place-making in its own right is a key requirement for economic development.  In respect of foreign direct investment or indigenous development, it is known that a place must have all the services and must be attractive.  It must appeal to tourists and citizens and to investors at national, regional, international and local levels.  These are the things we must bear in mind.  I take what Deputy Deasy said about the need for airport expansion and I agree with him completely.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey raised the question of the lack of regional coherence and asked what is the best regional model.  My hope for the reform programme or the next level of announcement from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or from the Government is a new model of regional economic development that aligns objectives and focuses on the new energies that might be possible by bringing in the cutting-edge thinking of the chief executive officers in the key sectors and which sets out high level strategies on which each region and subregion must agree, whether it pertains to the port and the airport or Waterford city and the hubs, as well as one's key sectors.  This for me is the way ahead and I really hope this is what will emerge next.  Consequently, I agree completely with Deputy Coffey's view on the need for a new model of regional development that overcomes the current levels of disparity that exist.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked what barriers the chief executive officers identified in the discussion.  The key points to emerge from those discussions were the need for closer alignment with the State sector in respect of regulatory issues, specifically on the water framework directive and on the nitrates directive, and to come up with new solutions to overcome the potential business risks these two issues present,  Clearly, we must hold the nitrates derogation we have at present.</p></speech>

In particular, on Deputy Calleary's question on national ports, the national ports policy formally recognised that Waterford and Rosslare are ports of national significance.  He asked about competitive advantage.  The competitive advantage of Waterford and Rosslare is their proximity to the south of England and all that offers for economic development for us in the south east, and also mainland Europe.</p><p>  On the connectivity issue, Waterford port is the only port which has direct rail connectivity for low-load container traffic to lift on and lift off.  It is vital that the Government pursues a roadmap for Waterford port to give it new impetus and energy to develop to its potential, and Rosslare likewise.  During the boom, Dublin Port grew as a result of all of the imports coming into the country and the ancillary services - distribution centres - that were built up closely associated with it.  Waterford and Rosslare, and the south east ports, need the Government, as part of the national ports policy, to formally adopt a new roadmap for the south east ports.</p><p>  On the airport, I am pleased to hear Deputy Deasy refer to &euro;1.25 million, which seems like a small sum of money to get an extended runway in Waterford airport, which is vital for its future and survival.</p><p>  With regard to the ongoing talks with various agencies, I will let Mr. Michael Walsh, Waterford city manager, take that up.  He sits on the board there.  On connectivity to the rest of Ireland, the M9 now offers fast access from Dublin to Waterford from the point of view of FDI companies investing in Waterford.  Moving on to the FDI issue,-----</p></speech>

Birmingham is a hub to the rest of the world and if Waterford airport has the connectivity to Birmingham, that, in turn, delivers connectivity to the rest of the world.</p><p>  Returning to the FDI question, it is important that there is a key location in Waterford and in the south east for IDA Ireland-based investment companies.  There are sites in Waterford which may not be readily suitable for new FDI companies.  Going back to Mr. Michael Walsh's point about new companies coming in, we have not seen one for quite a while.  I believe that a regional director and regional presence from IDA Ireland is needed now in Waterford.</p><p>  Finally, on indigenous businesses, the ten-point chambers' plan contains many ideas on incentives for indigenous companies regarding tax and creating employment.  That is certainly something of merit that can be looked at.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Widger.</p></speech>

The regional coherence issue is one.  The technological university can be a significant platform for building that.  Equally, it is about concentrating on the matters from which there are outputs and results.  Tourism and the agri-sector, as Mr. Crockett stated, are two areas, along with the technological university, that can give us a real focus at a regional level and start to deliver that coherence which, perhaps, has not been here heretofore.</p><p>  I agree with Ms Widger in the context of an IDA Ireland regional director.  Certainly, at a perception level, the relationship between performance in the FDI area and the non-presence of an IDA Ireland director is strongly reinforced across the south east region.</p><p>  There is continuing dialogue with the airlines.  There is an issue in the context of the existing runway length.  A very moderate investment will significantly increase the potential operators there.  Certainly, there are operators interested.  Getting that signed up is akin to the chicken and the egg.  If one had the limited extension, I would be fairly satisfied one could deliver the airlines.  We already have Flybe.  We certainly have a viable Luton route.  We are not seeking to build an international airport to compete with the likes of Dublin, Cork and Shannon but we are seeking a niche regional airport that can give direct connectivity.  It is based also on tourism and building our tourism proposition overall.  The simple reality, for example, on that previous Luton route was that well over 50% of the traffic was inbound in the context of tourism, targeting a relatively niche element of the London market and helping to pull through localised marketing, in other words, pulling additional tourists into Ireland Inc. rather than merely robbing it from any place else.  That point needs to be made.</p><p>  On the basic point about FDI in terms of the hour for the airport and otherwise, it is one of the players in the game in our experience.  With many bigger players, competitiveness is their key issue.  We lost a good deal of jobs in Waterford.  If we are honest about it, Ireland Inc., through the Celtic tiger years, got slightly uncompetitive in many contexts and we certainly saw manifestations of that.  There has been a phenomenal transition, in Waterford and right across the south-east region, in terms of living costs, wage costs and a host of areas that are bringing us significantly back into that piece.  Certainly, be it the likes of Bausch + Lomb or Teva Pharmaceuticals, in terms of the skill-sets that are available, they have no difficulty in attracting staff.  The reality is that much of the population in the south east developed their skills elsewhere.  We are tending to lose them.  The challenge is to bring them back.  Once we do, one of the great stories we must tell is that we retain better than any other region.  That, of course, is because of the good weather and the overall living environment.</p></speech>

One is that Dunhill completed two Interreg projects recently.  One of them was Interreg Action, which was on social enterprise.  It was to identify, develop and promote social enterprise.  We found that there were 218 social enterprises in County Waterford and we suspect there are approximately 300.  All of them are central to rural communities, to urban communities and especially to isolated communities.  The main recommendation from it was that we develop a south east social enterprise brokerage and that we could do the same in every county in the south east, which would amount to over 1,000 or maybe 2,000.  We believe that when people would see the result of the audit they would suddenly realise that these were crucial to maintaining the social and economic fabric of communities.</p><p>  The second recommendation concerned Interreg HERCULES, which was about tourism's sense of place.</p> <p>The main recommendation that came from that was that we could, through collaboration, set up a 12-month tourism season in County Waterford and the rest of the south east.  It was clear that if we could do it, additional jobs could be created.  If we acted on this immediately, jobs could be created.  Even if only a small number of jobs were created, it would be a signal that jobs would be created from the bottom up.  It would mean so much to the people involved and their communities.</p></speech>

I will give a brief overview of IT Carlow and its current position.  I will then hand over to Mr. Brian Ogilvie, who will discuss the enterprise development aspects of what we do in the institute.  I will then outline some of the challenges and opportunities we face.</p><p>  The institute is committed to research and enterprise-related activities.  We will discuss some of these as we make our presentation.  In common with the other institutes of technology, IT Carlow is a little over 40 years old.  We intend to maintain our technology and technician-based training at levels 6 and 7 on the national framework.  Jointly, the institutes have committed to this.  We work right up to PhD level.  While I will not speak for Waterford Institute of technology, I consider both institutions to be university-level institutions.  IT Carlow delivers programmes in three counties, namely, Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow.  We also have a very strong initiative with the Defence Forces, in particular, and the Irish Aviation Authority.  We have strength in the areas of aviation and aircraft and aerospace engineering.</p><p>  We deliver 82 programmes, from bio-environmental sciences through to engineering, ICT, business and accounting.  We ask ourselves from where demand is coming.  We need to examine what our graduates are doing and the types of companies to which they are adding value.  We have a very strong humanities department and are providing courses in youth and community development.  This is adding to the social fabric of the region.</p><p>  In addition to facilitating Masters degrees by research, particularly in biotechnology, software engineering and electronics engineering, we have taught programmes, such as an MBA and MSc in IT management.  There are other programmes listed in the documentation we have provided.</p><p>  One challenge we face, which is partly good, is filling our postgraduate places for research and taught programmes, particularly in the areas of ICT and biotechnology.  Our final-year honours degree graduates are successfully gaining employment, including quite well-paid employment, in the region and beyond.  This is a very positive sign.  As a consequence, our business graduates, particularly accounting graduates, are also finding employment relatively quickly after graduation owing to the upturn in export-led business.  Obviously, there is a need for graduates with business skills.</p><p>  One of the most important issues for us, which will require much of the energy of all our staff over the next couple of years, is the development of the technological university.  I assume there will be questions on this.  Between February 2012, when the landscape document was issued by the HEA, and 31 July, when the joint submission was made by the south-east institutes of technology, much work was done on developing linkages and collaboration between the two colleges.  This came to a halt while the submissions were being reviewed.  It is only in the past couple of weeks that the Minister has issued recommendations and made a decision.  The work that will be done on stage 2 of the application will be an important part of the activities of our college in the next six to nine months.  I hope that, from there, we will proceed to stage 4 and eventual redesignation as a technological university.</p></speech>

We recognise the continuing need to enhance and expand business liaison, regional involvement and commercialisation activities as an essential part of the overall strategy of the institute.</p><p>  Our enterprise development framework looks at developing spin-in companies which come from outside the institute and spin-out companies which develop out of research activities within the college.  There is a diagram before the committee.  It shows in green the potential funding areas from which we can source finance to allow these activities to happen.  In red are shown the training programmes and support structures which allow companies to develop.  These are located in specialised buildings which are focused solely on enterprise development.  Projects emerge from a variety of finance and funding sources, including INTERREG.  We have operated a WISE project on sustainable companies in the engineering sector.  That project has been completed for about 12 months.  We are using Enterprise Ireland's funding structure, including innovation vouchers, to work with small and medium enterprises to develop a sense of innovation and provide them with a taste of the research expertise we have at the IT.</p><p>  We have run the enterprise platform programme for seven years.  We bring potential entrepreneurs to the institute to develop knowledge-based, export-focused companies.  The end goal is to develop high potential start-up units.  The new structure of the enterprise platform programmes consists of the new frontiers programme from Enterprise Ireland, which is in its second year.  It is the second year we have run it in collaboration with Waterford Institute of Technology.  Another programme we have just launched is called Inspire, which stands for initiating pathways for researchers, entrepreneurs and SMEs.  The idea behind the programme is to get SMEs involved in innovation and recognise the importance of research, development and the exploration of new avenues to build new business platforms into their companies.</p><p>  New infrastructure at IT Carlow includes a research, development and innovation building which is under construction.  It will be ready for occupation in January 2014.  We will consolidate all our research groups in the building.  At IT Carlow we have what we call COREs which are centres of research and enterprise.  These represent concentrated areas of expertise in specific fields, including industrial design, security, environmental sciences and computer gaming.  By consolidating these research groups with incubation and start-up companies in one building we hope to add to the enterprise development structure at the institute.</p></speech>

We deliver programmes at all of these levels through our lifelong learning centre which focuses on flexible learning, continuing education and employee development.  Depending on whose figures one looks at, the institute has the highest or second highest proportion of learners who come through the lifelong learning centre model.  We are approaching a figure of 30% of learners coming through that mode.  We work with local companies to identify customised programmes, as well as our normal degree programmes.  The training from levels six to nine is accredited.  Springboard is an important part of what we have done in labour market activation measures in the past couple of years.  We have had some good outcomes since the programme started.  The results from the next round of Springboard programmes are being announced on Friday.  We are very optimistic for a positive outcome and that we can start to engage with the employee development needs of clients.</p><p>  We have opportunities, as well as challenges.  One of the opportunities is to harness our teaching and research to link with specific economic objectives within the region to better match education provision with industry needs.  Part of this depends on greater engagement with industry and part of it involves examining our internal processes.  Some of us may have sons and daughters concluding their leaving certificate studies.  They will enter college on a three, four or five year programme in September.  We are committed to delivering these programmes, irrespective of needs and changes to policy.  There is a commitment to learners once they embark on a programme.  The speed of change is affected by this, as one cannot change midstream.  Another opportunity involves knowledge creation through research and technology transfer.  We are engaging in that process in our fourth year undergraduate programmes and across our masters level research to identify where there are opportunities.</p><p>  The big challenge is the integration of local, regional and national policy to provide for a level of joined-up thinking in which we can all engage.  HEIs require better engagement and inclusion within regional development action plans to match education and industry needs.  Part of this involves the development of a better framework for engagement, regional development and understanding.  We are currently working on this.</p></speech>

I am here to address facilitating employment opportunities in the south east.</p><p>  There are 40 adult education guidance services nationally.  As set out in the operational guidelines from the Department of Education and Skills, we offer a guidance service to adults which includes impartial adult education information, one-to-one guidance and group guidance to help people to make informed educational, career and life choices.  There are offices in Carlow, Kilkenny and Dungarvan, while outreach work takes place in rural towns, including Castlecomber, Callan, Wexford town, Waterford city and various other locations.  My service has three staff members and 2,000 beneficiaries come through our doors annually.  Last year we had 512 sit-down, one-to-one appointments, met 643 people in groups and fielded 921 general public inquiries.  Our service is provided for adults and young people aged 16 years and over with low or no formal qualifications and low literacy levels.</p></speech>

Regions and cities have become the primary spatial units where knowledge is transferred, innovation systems are built and competition to attract investment and human talent takes place.  The EU innovation flagship emphasises the smart specialisation of regions as key to future competitiveness.  The economic development of the south east requires investment in research and development infrastructure, the creation of human capital and the enticement of experts and entrepreneurs to the region.  Strategies are required to create an innovation culture which will drive the growth of indigenous industries, attract foreign direct investment and support the commercialisation of research and the professionalisation of manufacturing and services across a range of sectors.  The challenge for the south east is to mesh these activities together in a cohesive, co-ordinated, collective manner to drive sustainable regional economic growth.  Fragmentation of effort must be overcome through the production of an integrated regional development strategy.  This strategy should incorporate an investment plan to attract the best scientists, engineers, professionals and entrepreneurs to the region which will, in turn, attract multinational industries and high potential start-ups.</p><p>  Waterford Institute of Technology plays a pivotal role as a catalyst for regional economic development, mainly through the innovation of its research and the creation of an effective knowledge transfer framework.  In the past 12 years the institute has secured &euro;112 million in research funding through competitive bidding.  The guiding principle behind our research strategy is the development of research centres of critical mass and international reputation which support the economic development of the region.  However, building competitive advantage through research and innovation requires the creation of a sustainable innovation environment.  An open innovation environment is an environment that interconnects research, innovation and development investment to deliver high quality, sustainable growth.</p><p>  Further strengthening of investment in the research and innovation infrastructure and the intellectual capacity of the south east is crucial to its future.  Investment should focus, first, on sectors that have the capacity for regional economic growth, particularly in the ICT, bio-pharma and advanced manufacturing areas.</p></speech>

The common thread that has emerged from the presentations is the need for an integrated strategy from national to local level across a number of different areas.  Dr. Donnelly was strong during the consultations in Waterford on the need for an integrated economic development strategy for the south east, which would examine its potential, strengths and weaknesses and so on but, in particular, its needs socially, economically and educationally and build from there.  While that makes sense, it does not always happen.  According to the research and facts presented by Forf&aacute;s and other departmental agencies, to which Mr. Walsh, the city manager referred, the region has underperformed in educational attainment and experiences high unemployment and low entrepreneurial activity.  Part of the reason for that is the lack of a joined up approach in the region and lack of integration of national and local policy.  Education has not been immune to that.  We hope and expect that a technological university might bring that cohesion and there will be stronger links between WIT and ITC.  If we need to examine the strengths of the region, we need to have a strategy that aligns national policy with local policy and we need then to provide certainty to entrepreneurs and industrialists in order that when they look at the south east, they see that there is a plan and the infrastructure, supports, graduates and funding are in place.</p></speech>

It is important to put on record our positions and the challenges we face, as well as identifying opportunities.  The witnesses have outlined where opportunities exist and engagement, discussion and debate is how we can improve how we, as policymakers, respond to the challenges that face us.  I visited Carlow IT before Christmas and I was very impressed by the service delivery and the courses on offer.  I am a regular visitor to WIT and, like Senator Cullinane, I visited TSSG a few weeks ago.  I was pleasantly amazed to witness the uplifting innovation and research that goes on and the connection between that and the potential for industry and employment.  I am not just saying that as a loyal Waterford person.  I knew a lot of work went on there and we are now starting to see the real benefit.  FeedHenry and Betapond have announced investments by companies such as Intel, global players, and that can only continue.  It must be matched by appropriate global strategy and policy to ensure it continues.</p><p>  I raised concerns about regional coherence.  I feel we have not been coherent as a region until now.  In fairness to both colleges represented before us, it is no coincidence that the collaboration between WIT and Carlow IT has seen major strides towards the achievement of a technological university for the south east.  Previously, we were divided and had differences of opinion but now the Government recognises it for the first time.  That we must, and will, have a technological university for the south east was included in the programme for Government and endorsed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  That does not mean serious challenges remain for Carlow and Waterford.</p><p>  I am interested in hearing how to focus on the challenge, which is immediate and essential, to benefit both colleges.  There is possibly duplication between existing colleges in the south east.  Some negotiation and debate must occur to ensure departments are set up to meet the growth areas we have spoken about.  Perhaps the witnesses have information on how to address challenges.</p><p>  The witnesses referred to innovation vouchers, which are a Government initiative.  Dr. Willie Donnelly mentioned 250 companies having taken advantage of the vouchers.  How are the vouchers used?  Is it for marketing or support in the creation of new products, or innovation within the companies?  How do they use them and what does it mean in terms of job creation?</p><p>  I am concerned to hear Mr. Shane Rooney refer to the lack of engagement between industry, education and policymakers and the Government.  It is a concern I share but Mr. Rooney is now a main player as part of the new SOLAS body.  It is a challenge for colleges, industry and policymakers to ensure we match courses with growth and demand.  We are now three or four years into the recession and we have major unemployment.  I am concerned that we do not have that level of engagement, although it is the fault of no one at this committee meeting.  We need to identify why the engagement is not taking place.</p><p>  I do not agree with all of the statements made here.  I am a qualified electrician and came through the vocational apprenticeship system.  One of the witnesses mentioned that trade-related skills are not happening and that we are not engaging with industry.  WIT has a successful programme where former electricians upskill to engineering courses and manufacturing courses.  That is working quite well and perhaps someone on the panel can give us more information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1023" speakername="John Lyons" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800018#T00200"><p>I will start with questions to the witnesses from the institutes of technology, who can respond if they have the figures.  Do they have any figures on the employment rate of graduates from the institutes?  How do they compare to other institutes around the country?  Do they have any figures on employability from the courses they run?</p><p>  Mr. Declan Doyle mentioned the need to match education provision with industry needs.  I am a little shocked that that is what he is presenting in 2013 given that the issues we are talking about date back at least to 2008, if not before.  DCU, a university of good practice, has a programme called Generation 21.  It has revamped all of the modules in all of its courses and has introduced a set of soft skills that companies are seeking.  I am a little concerned that has not been done in the institutes and that they are only talking about doing it now.</p><p>  Mr. Shane Rooney is someone who is quite involved in labour activation measures but from listening to his presentation, it sounds to me that labour activation measures and the Pathways to Work strategy have not hit the south east yet.  Perhaps he would be able to give me some figures.  I know it is not directly his responsibility, but how far has the Intreo model been rolled out in the south east?  How many places on the Momentum initiative, which is for the long-term unemployed, have been given to the south east?  How many of them have been taken up?  Are there any vacancies?</p><p>  In regard to those responsible for career guidance, I assume that in many cases the local employment service takes on the job of offering career guidance, jobs skills and jobs clubs to the unemployed where there is not a local employment office or an Intreo office.  These are things that people should be doing.  Jobs clubs are responsible for supporting people in getting jobs while jobs centres are responsible for helping people to develop a career path.  That has been formalised much more in the Pathways to Work strategy.  I was a bit taken aback because it sounded as though none of this was happening in the south east.  I imagine more needs to happen.  I would like a response on some of those issues.  </p><p>  It was mentioned that there was no link between employers and education providers or labour activation providers.  Whose responsibility is this?  Is it not everybody's responsibility?  For too long there has not been that connection with providers, whether from the education side or from the Department or those contracted on behalf of the Department - often community and voluntary agencies that do a really good job in many respects in some cities and counties.  Whose responsibility is it to create that link?  I assumed it was everybody's responsibility to create that link between the jobs available and the local employment service or the local Intreo office.  I know I sound a little critical but I am very surprised by this.  People who know me know I do not mince my words on these issues.  </p><p>  I would appreciate whatever information the witnesses can give me.  I know none of the witnesses is responsible for the Intreo model, so I do not expect facts and figures to be completely accurate, but given that Mr. Rooney had many facts and figures, he might be able to shed some light on some of those issues.  I have asked a number of questions to which the witnesses can do their best to respond.  There is no need for witnesses to repeat answers.  I suggest the appropriate witness answer each question.</p></speech>

A certain level of engagement takes place across the region and across the higher education sector, but it is not formalised.  The Vice Chairman said it was everybody's responsibility but unfortunately, it is a clich&eacute; that if something is everybody's responsibility, it becomes no one's responsibly.   Perhaps one of the recommendations should be that a formal process be put in place to ensure this type of regional engagement happens.</p><p>  One of the positive things that has aided enormously the development of the joint submission of the two institutes was the formation of a committee chaired by the city manager, Mr. Michael Walsh.  Mr. Joe Crockett and all the county managers in the region were members of this committee, together with representatives from the enterprise development agencies.  That was hugely positive in drawing together the different objectives of the stakeholders and in getting that type of programme going.  One might think that was something very obvious.  It is obvious but it never happened before.  </p><p>  The task force pulled together by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, following the closure of TalkTalk was mentioned.  One might say that was obvious but it had not happened before.  I am part of that forum.  It needs to be formalised in some way to try to ensure that the HEIs have a formal method of interacting with the other stakeholders, whether economic, community or local authority-based. </p><p>  The mention of the technological university in the programme for Government was extremely welcome.  As I said previously, the work towards stage two and, hopefully, on to stage four and redesignation as a technological university is one of the primary objectives of IT Carlow and the management team.  Without getting into the nitty-gritty of mapping academic departments and how that is done, obviously there is overlap.  The institutes of technology were set up in 1970 as regional technical colleges.  They all had a school of business, a school of science and a school of engineering.</p></speech>

While I am not here to speak for the Department of Social Protection, the reason for that is that in the past there were adult learners who were what is termed "going around the houses", doing course after course at FETAC 5 level with no progression up the national framework to FETAC 6 or to HETAC level in the institutes of technology and the universities.  That is why that condition exists.  There may be a possibility for exemptions in areas where there are employment opportunities, for example, in science, technology and ICT.  However, there are many courses at FETAC 5 level for which the employment opportunities are limited or non-existent.  While some courses, in community development and health care support, for example, are meeting a need in the community, other courses are not.  The demand for beauty therapists, hairdressers, for example, is far lower than the number of students completing those courses and therefore, a balance needs to be struck in that area.</p><p> On the issue of apprenticeships and those who worked in construction moving on, the  important point is that there is a variety of apprenticeships available that match the needs of employers.  The apprenticeships must be very specific.  One could do a FETAC 5 course in business studies or secretarial studies but there are no jobs in those areas in Carlow.  Therefore, there is no real point in doing a FETAC 5 course in those subjects unless one intends to progress to third level.  The objective is to make FETAC 5 courses and apprenticeships more specific to industry demands.  Recently, for example, there was a JobBridge apprenticeship for a cheese-maker, where the apprentice will be trained up in a very specific area in which there are employment opportunities.  While generic skills are important, students also need to develop more industry-specific skills in order to be employable.  </p><p>  Deputy John Lyons mentioned the Pathways to Work initiative.  As part of our service, the local jobs club runs courses five mornings a week and we meet clients from those courses all of the time.  We do our best to provide courses and opportunities for them, as well as giving them information and guidance.  </p></speech>

He said there is as much IT generated in Kansas as in Silicon Valley and asked why all the companies are located in Silicon Valley.  It is because they have an open innovation culture.  This is very important.  We need to build such a culture in the southern region.  Our experience when I set up the TSSG was that there were no ICT industries.  We had to create one but when the IDA would bring companies to Waterford, there would not be any capacity in human resource terms.  For multinationals, the human resource is the critical factor.  Why do ICT companies go to Dublin?  It is because there is a flow of ideas and people.  They need connectivity to similar companies.  They do not shy away from that competition.  In the south east we need to identify those areas of critical mass in order that we can create industry and plan to develop the necessary infrastructure, like in Silicon Valley.  That involves people, structures and support.</p><p>  The problem we have is that we talk about increasing employment in the south east but we never ask what are the areas where we could attract a critical mass.  That is what we did in the TSSG.  When we saw we did not have these people, we decided to create spin-out companies, where we seek out people from abroad, and we had people from 20 different countries come to work in the south east.  We then moved them out into the companies.  These are activities we must undertake and that is what I mean by strategic planning.  There is no point in doing this on a yearly basis.  We must plan on a five year basis, with an objective, and identify the resources we need.  Does Enterprise Ireland match the investment from the IDA?  Are both agencies seeking the same industries and promoting the same resources?  Are educators developing the skills that are needed?  Entrepreneurs like to be next to other entrepreneurs, so we must create a platform to entice them into the region.</p><p>  The Kilkenny county manager, Mr. Joe Crockett, gave us an opportunity to take the TSSG model and recreate it in Kilkenny.  We did not say that in Waterford our focus is on mobile services so we should have the same focus in Kilkenny.  We asked what the natural industrial base was around Kilkenny.  Agriculture was one answer, but from talking to Mr. Crockett, if we look at the opportunity for growth in agriculture in the region, we can see there are challenges in environmental impacts.  I began to wonder how ICT could link to agriculture.  The Republic of Ireland is at the forefront of ICT and by combining our natural resources and ICT, we could create not just a whole new industry but one that has huge export potential.  This is not just about an integrated strategy, it is about having an understanding of our goals, and all the players must understand that.</p><p>  In that strategy, when we talk about education, we must look not just at third level but at primary and secondary education.  At secondary level, there are schools in the south east that are not offering some science subjects because of cutbacks.  Those are the subjects the companies we are trying to attract want to see.</p><p>  We brought in &euro;112 million in research funding.  The universities have baseline funding for research of about &euro;240 million per year while we receive nothing.  We are starting from a much lower base.</p><p>  The other reason the region needs a technological university is common sense.  Technology is changing rapidly.  Many of the leading companies in the world such as Cisco do not look beyond three years because they cannot predict what will happen beyond that.  If we are to train the next generation of graduates and engage with industry, how do we train ourselves?  How much would it cost the taxpayer if we had to reskill every academic every three years in order that he would be current?  We do that by research instead.  Research helps if we bring it into the undergraduate programme.  Not only do we train people to go into industry, but they must be upskilled every three years.  Through research, we are offering people the ability to do this.</p><p>  Sun Life is a good example of such upskilling,  We have a masters programme where we and the company looked at its needs and then defined the programme around those needs.</p></speech>

I work in the school of lifelong earning and education.  I would like to pick up on what has been said by Dr. Donnelly and others.  There is no doubt that the region faces challenges from the perspective of educational attainment.  There are positive examples of what both institutes are trying to do at present.  We hope to hear something positive from Springboard later this week.</p><p>  I will give some examples of engagements we have been involved with over the past couple of years.  A number of people from the construction industry are participating in our ICT skills programme.  I am originally a civil engineer.  I know better than most the skills one acquires in the construction industry, particularly in the whole area of project management.  Those skills are needed in the software industry.  A number of those who are currently taking our ICT skills courses come from a background in architecture or construction.  Last year, we were successful with a number of programmes in the whole Springboard domain.  I refer, for example, to the postgraduate diplomas in innovative technology engineering and in lean practice.  This links back to the discussion we had earlier about building the capacity for advanced manufacturing in the south east.  When I give feedback to groups like this committee, I emphasise that we engage in "mark to market" practices in terms of the numbers we might get on these programmes.  If we are to leverage them, we need to be above the market.  We need to build them up over a period of three to five years so we can deliver for the region.  That would be one of the recommendations I would make in this regard.</p><p>  I wish to return to what Dr. Donnelly said about engagement.  We have argued for some time that a transformation in the way we deliver the curriculum will have to be one of the key features of the technological university.  It should not always be about people coming into the classroom.  We should use technology to engage remotely with them.  We should make provision for our students to go out on internships and solve real-world problems.  We are working to ensure this is one of the key features of the technological university.  I hope I have given the committee an idea of what I consider to be positive initiatives that can further leverage both institutes in assisting the region and improving its educational attainment.</p></speech>

It will be a new organisation.  There will be no such thing as the Institute of Technology, Carlow or Waterford Institute of Technology - there will be a single integrated institute.  That addresses the problem regarding the overlap in courses.</p><p>  The Chairman also asked how companies use innovation vouchers.  This is one of the challenges we face in the research area.  It is no coincidence that the majority of companies that engage with Science Foundation Ireland are huge multinational organisations with their own research laboratories.  They are able to take research output in the rawest form and integrate it into their products.  If one is running a company with four or five employees, one will not have the luxury of being able to allocate one of those people to engage at the research level.  We transfer the highly specialist knowledge we have created through our research and innovation to companies by means of product development, for example.  The document we furnished to the joint committee mentions a local indigenous company, EirGen Pharma, which operates in the area of biopharmaceutics.  It is working with the Pharmaceutical and Molecular Biotechnology Research Centre, which is our biopharmaceutics research group, on an innovation voucher.  The centre isolated and identified three impurities in a tablet product that was being developed by EirGen.  The project allowed EirGen to file the product with the European Medicines Agency and it was approved in 2010.</p><p>  This example gives us a clear view of how deeply the main research can be translated into something a company can use.  This helps the development of the company.  We do that over and over again.  I believe this demonstrates the difference between a technological university and a traditional university.  A traditional university is like a thoroughbred.  Its focus is on its independence.  Our focus will be on our responsiveness as a technological university.  We will take the results of our research and customise it to the needs of companies.  We will engage with them on a continual basis to ensure we understand their needs.  I think I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

We were also present in the Visitors Gallery for the previous discussion on the south east during which we heard about education and agriculture.  The collaboration between Waterford Institute of Technology and Kildalton Agricultural College has been of great benefit to agricultural students studying at the Kildalton site.</p><p>  For reasons of time, I will not read the entire submission.  I propose instead to highlight some of the main issues.  There are 18,000 people employed directly in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in the south-east region, which is twice the national average.  The reason is the quality of the land in the region and the ability of its people to produce agricultural products.  This message has been reinforced by the investment commitment of &euro;180 million given by Glanbia plc to process milk produced in the region beyond 2015. </p><p>  The agri-food sector employes 8,000 employees in the south-east region in the areas of farmhouse cheeses, ice creams and meats.  Opportunities will also arise for retraining in the area of light engineering to serve the agriculture sector.</p><p>  Under the ambitions set out in Food Harvest 2020 for the period between 2015 and 2020, the primary duty of stockmen, other than stockmanship, will be the production of raw materials for the food industry.  They will also be required to provide other services for farmers which will provide opportunities in the years ahead. </p><p>  I acknowledge the role of Enterprise Ireland and Leader groups in providing financial and practical supports for individuals who are establishing agri-food enterprises.  The south-east region covers only four and a half counties.  I am from County Tipperary, half of which is in the south east, while the other half is outside the region.  Despite its size, the south east accounts for 22% of the country's milk output.</p><p>  Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will have a major impact of farmers in the south east who fear the possibility of convergence of payments.  Such a move could undermine the prospects of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, given that in 2009 direct payments accounted for 123% of farmers' incomes.  For this reason, we are concerned about the current proposals. </p><p>  The abolition of quotas will also present challenges.  Mr. O'Loughlin is a supplier to Glanbia which has moved to flatten the peaks and troughs in milk supply by providing back-to-back contracts with purchasers.  This move provides stability for the primary producer, the purchaser and, ultimately, the employment structure in the association.  We view Wicklow ICSMA as a leader in that regard.</p><p>  Members of the joint committee feed into the CAP reform process through their contacts with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach.  The Irish Presidency is a critical six month period for CAP reform.  The primary producer must be protected under the proposals if employment is to be enhanced and we are to avail of the opportunities that will arise after the abolition of quotas in 2015.  As a country which exports 85% of our produce, we are conscious of the various aids available under the Common Agricultural Policy, including aid for private storage.  We raised this issue with the Department and I encourage the joint committee to follow up on it.  This aid is very important to the dairy sector, given the seasonality of milk supply.  </p><p>  The availability of credit is another issue that is creating serious challenges for our members and industries across the economy.  Given the climatic conditions we have experienced in the past 18 months, these are especially serious for farmers.  At the end of 2011 farmers owed &euro;1.9 billion, which was &euro;307 million lower than in the previous year.  However, the past 18 months have undone much of the progress made in this regard.  Merchant credit is also an issue.  I have met various merchants in the south east who have expressed major reservations about their ability to continue in the event that credit does not become available and farmers are not given an opportunity to repay outstanding loans over a number of years.  Merchants want the banks to function properly because they are currently operating as bankers for individual farmers. </p><p>  The review of the nitrates directive is another issue facing farmers.  We would like the current derogation to be maintained and have approached the relevant authorities in that regard.  The south east has the best land in the country and the derogation is necessary to allow us to engage in intensive farming.  We would also like the bureaucracy associated with the directive to be reduced.  The application process should be simplified, for example, by rolling over derogations for individual farmers rather than requiring them to reapply each year.  The ending of the period within which farmers may export slurry on 31 December is also a significant issue for them.  If they were allowed to export up to 15 February, many of them could meet the requirements of the nitrates directive without needing a derogation.  It is impossible to export slurry from 15 to 30 December as this is a closed period. </p><p>  The main challenges facing the dairy sector are reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and farm fragmentation.  I ask the political parties represented on the joint committee to lobby the relevant Ministers to ensure steps are taken in the budget to facilitate the consolidation of holdings.  The milking platform around the parlour is the critical issue for dairy farmers in delivering expansion and further employment opportunities.  Price volatility is also a major challenge for us and we seek some form of price stabilisation or relevant market support in that regard.  </p><p>  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association is involved with the European Milk Board.  We seek the establishment of an EU dairy market monitoring agency which would issue early warnings where oversupply appeared to be imminent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kelly" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800023#Y00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present on the committee's strategy report.  Given the long afternoon, I do not intend to read my presentation in detail but will summarise it in my own words.  It is about the restoration of the sugar industry in Ireland.  I advise the committee that I became aware of this initially in 2006 when I was the CEO of Carlow County Enterprise Board and was approached by a number of people regarding their desire to review the decision that had been made and see whether there was an opportunity to restore it.  I recommended to the board that we carry out a feasibility study.  I propose to elaborate on the findings of that study.  The study was drawn up by former senior executives of Irish Sugar, Greencore, scientists in UCD and farmer representatives, and the financial figures within the study, which is available, were verified by the international consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>  The primary findings of the report are in the conclusion which states that a viable and profitable industry based on sugar beet as the primary raw material and sugar and ethanol as the main products can be established in Ireland.  The industry would have very significant employment opportunities during construction and operation and wider benefits for growers, contractors, hauliers and the local and national economy.  Some obstacles would have to be overcome before it would become a reality, although these are not considered insurmountable.  The report is approximately two years old.  Some of the figures quoted at the time would have changed, for example, the price of sugar would have increased.  Obstacles is a word one could use but if I were asked what needs to be done now to take this to the next level, one is quite imminent.</p><p>  Shortly after the report was concluded we met the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  While he supported our endeavours at the time he clearly stated, and has since stated, that any venture to develop a combined sugar or bio-ethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense to be viable and to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.  Clearly, that was giving us the position of Government at the time.  The second issue that needs to be addressed is the quota.  Again, historically, in 2005, at the time of the reform, Greencore, which was the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of the voluntary scheme and dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006.  In other words, there is no mechanism that would enable us to grow beet and produce sugar.  However, under the Irish Presidency, negotiations are ongoing to finalise the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform package that will be in place for the future, including provisions for sugar production in the European Union post 2015.</p><p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, as president of the Council, made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a majority of member states to extend the current quota regime for a further two years until September 2017 when it would finally cease.  This is now the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council as it enters the final phase of the ongoing CAP reform negotiations with the European Parliament and the Commission.  We understand that a decision on the overall CAP reform package, including the future of the EU sugar regime, will be sought at the next session of the Agriculture Council beginning on 24 June when it is hoped it can be brought to a successful conclusion before the Irish Presidency ends on 30 June.  Clearly, that is a key date from the point of view of the findings in this particular report.  We are hopeful that a conclusion can be reached and, if so, planning can take place.  Without a quota it is very difficult to engage with investors who will be required.  For the proposal to be progressed, presuming we get clarity after the end of June, expressions of interest from farmers will be key.  They are going to produce the raw material.  Therefore, we need expressions of interest from farmers.</p><p>  I think we can advance a suitable site, even while awaiting the outcome of the CAP negotiations.  Our group is of the view that given the competitive nature of the production of sugar in Europe, we have to be extraordinarily competitive.  One of the key fundamentals will be cost of transport.  Therefore, this plant has to be central to the growing area - the southern parts of Offaly, Kildare, Carlow, Wexford, east Cork and east Tipperary.  Our research identifies that it is somewhere between Carlow and Kilkenny.  We are not being specific but we clearly believe it is in the south east and is driven 100% by virtue of the cost of transporting the raw material to the factory.  Any particular site must have good road structures and must be central to the heart of beet growing in Ireland.</p><p>  That is a short summary of the findings of the study.  Some of the figures in the study are being updated.  Certainly it gives us food for thought.  If there are any questions, I will certainly answer them.  We see this as an opportunity.  It will be a challenge because of our competitors.  We are entering an already well-established business.  As there is no evidence of a shortage of sugar in Ireland, there are players already in a position to supply Ireland with its quota.  However, one of the significant benefits of Ireland having its own industry is that some of our significant employers in the confectionery business would be guaranteed a supply.  There is a whole list of reasons we should do this.  We have to be realistic also and recognise the challenges that lie ahead and see how, working together, we can make it happen.</p></speech>

As the Vice Chairman said, we have the presentations and they will be factored into our report.  I do not know if the visitors heard the session with the Kilkenny county manager.  The whole area of agriculture and Food Harvest 2020 was raised.  The visitors have reinforced much of what was said earlier.  Everybody agrees that the targets for Food Harvest 2020 are ambitious but realistic and deliverable.  If they are to be achieved, we must ensure the infrastructure is in place.  If we are to expand milk production - obviously we have opportunities with the abolition of milk quotas - we must ensure the infrastructure is in place to process milk.  We have had a positive announcement from Glanbia on the Belview site.  That is hugely important for the south east, midlands and the south west in terms of taking the increased milk.</p><p>  The infrastructure at that level is only part of the jigsaw.  Certainly the farmers in the region want their concerns addressed.  For example, if they need to expand their herd or their on-farm infrastructure, they will need access to credit and, perhaps, employment supports if they are taking people on.</p></speech>

As recently as last week, one of the main banks sent an e-mail to all public representatives updating them on how well it was reaching its access to finance targets.  Sometimes, it is anecdotally correct to claim that finance is not being provided.  From our guests' experience, are banks providing finance to people who are legitimately in a position to access it?</p><p>  My second question is for Mr. Kelly.  What are the employment figures in terms of constructing and operating the sugar beet industry?</p></speech>

The Tipperary Co-op has invested heavily in its cheese plant to move forward with its Food Harvest 2020 ambition.  I omitted to mention that the Irish Dairy Board had made a significant investment in securing markets for post-2015.  As an exporting nation, we need this.</p><p>  The farmers to whom the Senator spoke were right.  If a farmer goes from milking 60 cows to milking 100 cows, he or she does not want to spend four hours in the parlour or whatever the case may be.  There is a dairy equipment scheme.  With the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, we hope that an enhanced scheme will be available to farmers under Pillar 2 as we head towards 2014 and 2015.  If farmers increase their numbers, they must have sufficient slurry storage facilities.  We made a strong case to Teagasc and the Department regarding the nitrates directive.  The dairy cow is not permitted to be outwintered.  Facilities must be available, even if there is only an eight week winter.  In particular, parts of County Kilkenny-----</p></speech>

Farmers there could outwinter some of their stock.  Capital will be required.  Mr. O'Loughlin will take the Chairman's question.</p><p>  The dairy industry would welcome a return of the beet industry.  The sugar industry's by-product would be a significant boost to milk production, particularly in the late third and early fourth quarters.  The industry's return would be significant for our Food Harvest 2020 ambition.</p></speech>

I am also the chairman of our local discussion group.  Banks have copped on and are lending money when they know they will get it back.  They are providing money more sensibly.  In 90% of cases previously, farmers tended to borrow sensibly.  The banks know that the farmers' businesses have made steady returns.</p><p>  A number of problems have arisen.  For example, some of the legal charges have gone bananas.  Legal charges are unrelated to the amount of money loaned or borrowed.  Often, banks, and borrowers, solicitors' fees are paid at both ends.</p><p>  Fees are an issue.  The banks are really sucking hard on them.  They are reluctant to offer money based solely on a business plan - the capacity to make a return on the borrowed money - and are more concerned with getting deeds into their vaults.  This is disappointing.  Traditionally in the agricultural sector, borrowed money was repaid without bother.  In light of the bad weather this spring, however, my bank of AIB has been conscious of farmers' needs.  It has been proactive in our area by approaching farmers before their situations worsened.  If feed or an overdraft was required, the bank moved.  If a farmer's situation was fine, the bank did not move.  Credit should be given where it is due.</p></speech>

I do not want to quote statistics, but I will put the issue in context.  The study went into great detail.  Based on a yield of 60 tonnes per hectare, some 24 tonnes per acre, there would be a requirement of 20,000 hectares or 50,000 acres of sugar beet.  At an average of ten acres per grower, this would involve approximately 2,000 growers.  This is what we need to deliver a significant project.  They would need to be high end growers, that is, open to technology.  The yields can be increased considerably with the co-operation of Teagasc.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman referred to jobs.  We have concluded that between 400 and 500 jobs would be created during the construction period and approximately 200 people would be employed to operate the plant.  Crucially, significant indirect employment amounting to 5,000 jobs would be created among farmers, agricultural contractors, hauliers and input suppliers.  It would be a major contributor.</p><p>  We need a serious commitment from farmers.  On the night of the ministerial decision, sugar was the item that held up matters.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode, as they will interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>  The first item on our agenda is a discussion of the topic democratic legitimacy and accountability in the European Union.  On behalf of the joint committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. Francis Jacobs, head of office at the European Parliament Information Centre in Dublin.  This is another in a series of discussions we are having on the future of the European Union.  Today our focus is on the role of an ever-more assertive European Parliament in underpinning democratic legitimacy and accountability.  As members know, the 2008 Lisbon treaty placed directly elected MEPs at the heart of the European Union's decision-making process.  As the European Union shifts from crisis management to a more proactive approach, we will explore the role the European Parliament is playing in bolstering public confidence in the Union's capacity to deliver for its citizens through measures such as, for example, the youth guarantee initiative.  This session with Mr. Jacobs gives us the opportunity to debate such issues.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, make charges against or criticise a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her easily identifiable.

I also welcome the initiative taken by the committee which it has been carrying out in recent weeks and months.  Its inquiry is timely.  The European Union has been going through a major economic crisis which has undoubtedly weakened support for its institutions and policies.</p></speech>

Before I ask for contributions from the floor I would like some clarification on a few of the points that Mr. Jacobs raised.  He mentioned how European Parliament committees could take more input from national parliaments and spoke about the yellow card and so on.  Does he envisage that people from national parliaments would attend committees of the European Parliament?  What are his thoughts on how that link-up could be improved?</p><p>  Second, he mentioned the Danish Parliament's initiative to increase awareness among Danish citizens of the work of the European Parliament.  As I am not familiar with that work, could he outline what exactly it does?  We could then see whether we could do something similar here.</p><p>  Many of us would welcome the proposal and prospect of having a real European election as opposed to a referendum on government performance, which is what many European elections have been.  What work will organisations such as the European Parliament Information Office do to put pressure on, and encourage, political parties on issues such as greater representation by women, early choice of candidates and putting out a political message based on the European vision as opposed to the local vision?  What will Mr. Jacobs' organisation and others such as the European Movement be doing to try to steer the political agenda that way?</p></speech>

I was very happy to discover when I spoke to him earlier in the hallway that he had many Reilly and O'Reilly relations in County Cavan.  Indeed, Senator Kathryn Reilly may well also be related to him, but he and I have established family ties in Cavan.  I will let him explain later, but it seems that on his mother's side he has a whole Cavan connection.  I was delighted by that and when I heard the quality of his contribution I was convinced of the genealogy.</p></speech>

We have been present during his many presentations on this issue.  I have three specific questions.  First, how likely is a treaty change in the short term?  If such a change is likely, in which area is it likely to be?  Second, is he aware of a change in the public perception in the context of the additional powers the European Parliament has recently gained?  My sense is that there has been a shift in public understanding of the role of the European Parliament and the power it has.  I do not overstate how much the needle has shifted but I think there has been a change.  I am interested in hearing his perception of that issue.</p><p>  Finally, in regard to further economic integration, which he referenced briefly, how does he envisage the shape of further economic integration?  If I look at budgetary policy, with the two-pack, the six-pack, the fiscal treaty, it is quite difficult to see how that could move further without the role of national parliaments being radically diminished.  If I look at the role of tax competency within the European Union, I find it difficult to see how that will radically shift without parliaments all over the European Union becoming very upset.  I see potential for further integration in the area of a banking union, euro bonds and euro bills but beyond that, I always struggle to see to what areas people are referring, when speaking in terms of greater integration.</p></speech>

This time next year we will have 600 plus fewer county councillors, and depending on the passage of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, we may have fewer Members of the Oireachtas in 2016.  The number of politicians in Ireland will be reduced.  That will give more of a profile or the possibility of a higher profile for MEPs.  Does Mr. Jacobs agree that this scenario would offer an opportunity to our MEPs?</p><p>  European elections are often dominated by national issues.  I am sure in other countries that local and European election coincide, in order to boost turnout and save money.  Will we ever reach the stage in which the elections to the European Parliament will be focused entirely on European issues?  I know we have very good debates on the national media when European elections are being held.  The increase in the power and influence of the European Parliament, while a positive development, has implications for the smaller member states because as such states have lower numbers of MEPs.  This leads to a perception that the influence of the power of the European Parliament lies with the larger states.  That is a concern, and as Deputy Joe O'Reilly stated we are likely to lose one MEP in the next review.</p><p>  When it comes to choosing a President of the European Parliament, would that choice be determined by the party, the nationality of the various candidates, the language abilities of candidates, which is a positive for those who are multilingual, or the political blocs to which they belong?  Would it play into the hands of those parties that chose a candidate from a smaller or a neutral country?</p></speech>

The Chairman asked the simplest question on the Danish Parliament.</p><p>  I was referring to the Folketing visitors centre.  I do not know when they set it up but all school groups who come to the Danish Parliament come here to learn how the Danish Parliamentary system works, with simulations and so on.

Is Mr. Jacobs saying that will change within the next five years and, if so, why?  Is it because of population growth?</p></speech>

The Irish Members pointed out that Ireland has had the fastest population growth of any member state, yet it is losing a seat.  Next time, population growth should be one of the factors to be considered.  For example, at one stage Italy, France and the UK, all of which have the same number of seats in the European Parliament, had roughly similar populations.  Italy's population has stagnated while that of the UK has grown, but France's population has grown the most, so that it now has 3 million or 4 million more people than Italy although it has only one more seat.  The UK and Italy have the same number of seats although the UK has 2 million more people than Italy.  The whole issue needs to be examined.  Spain is under-represented in the European Parliament in terms of population per MEP.  There are a number of anomalies, including Ireland.  The idea is that before the next elections that issue should be examined in order to arrive at a fair system of digressive proportionality.</p></speech>

Among the 28 countries, as will be the case from July, the country with the most seats has a greater population per seat than the next country down.

If it was proportional, which the German constitutional court would love, and if there really was a federal united states of Europe, then Germany would have 170 or 180 MEPs and Malta and Luxembourg would have one.  One can work it out one's self.  What has happened is a compromise, because the European Union system is already complicated enough.  If it was like the United States, as some have suggested, there would two chambers in the European Parliament, one in which Ireland would have the same number of Members as Germany and another one which would be proportional.  In the US, California has 60 congressmen and two senators while Wyoming has one congressman and two senators.  That has been debated by many people within the European Parliament, but it is seen as making the system, which is already complicated enough, even more complicated.  This is why, within one European Parliament, the term "digressive proportionality" is an example of the horrible jargon I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

However, it has tried to insist on at least one third or more being women candidates.  A country putting forward a woman nominee - so far it has been that way rather than the other way round - is obviously already winning some support for itself, as long as the candidate is good in quality terms.  In fact, the candidate the Parliament did not like the last time and who had to be withdrawn was the Bulgarian candidate who was a woman.  She was replaced by another Bulgarian woman candidate who was an excellent candidate and easily passed her confirmation hearing.</p><p>  The confirmation hearings are a really gruelling process lasting over two hours.  Many factors are taken into account during them.  They are based, to some extent, on the US model.  When they were set up for the first time in the early 1990s, the European Parliament sent some of its staff and politicians to the United Stated to see how the Americans did it and learn positive and negative lessons from the US confirmation hearings process.</p><p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne mentioned the issue of the European elections inevitably being more on national issues.  I believe that will be the case for a long time.  Inevitably, it is an opportunity to raise issues.  That is why many people in the European Parliament are worried about next year's elections, at a time when there could still be a severe economic crisis in many countries.  It could be a chance to protest against incumbent governments and protest parties could do very well in the elections in many countries.  There is a great deal of concern about this.  What the European Parliament is trying to do, especially by having a more presidential election, is to have some of the Europe-wide issues raised.  If the Greens group, the socialist group, the European People's Party, the left socialists and the European United Left, GUE, group within the Parliament have candidates for the post of President, it is not only a chance for that person to gain a higher profile but also for the political programme of that political group to be diffused better throughout the European Union.  It is a policy option opportunity, as well as a personality matter.</p></speech>

I will try to find out a little more about it.  I understand the process could not even be started until the formal decision was taken.  Now we have reached the point where it can be done and I presume it will take place early in the autumn.  Incidentally, Ireland is unique in requiring an adaptation of constituencies.  The other ten countries which have lost seats just reduce the list by one person.  There are some other countries with constituencies, but I am not aware that any of them has formally lost seats.  None of the countries that has lost seats will require a boundary commission to reallocate constituencies.  In that sense, Ireland is unique.</p></speech>

The only reason I mentioned that is that I remember the late Brian Lenihan giving a talk in our building and saying that maybe one day that will happen.  The assumption is that the constituencies will continue but the basis on which it will do comes under purely national competence.</p><p>  There was a long debate in the European Parliament about having a uniform electoral system and it was abandoned because there were too many differences between the member states.  The compromise reached was that there should be a few key principles which were common such as proportionality, which is why the British eventually had to abandon the first past the post system for the European elections, as it was distorting the political balance in the European Parliament.  In 1979 there were 22 Conservatives more than they would have been proportionally.  The Conservatives were not too worried about that but in 1994 when there were 20 more socialists because the British Labour Party got 60 out of the 75 seats, or whatever number it was, the Conservatives started to take it seriously and it was later changed during Tony Blair's period as Prime Minister.  The principle of each system had to be proportional but it was up to each member state whether to have a single transferable vote, open lists, closed lists and so on.</p><p>  An idea that was put forward but which has not gone anywhere, which Andrew Duff, the rapporteur, and some other members, have long advocated, is that, in addition to the individual member states, there should be one Europe-wide constituency where candidates who would stand at a Europe-wide level.  However, that idea was dropped in favour of the idea of having candidates for President of the Commission for the obvious reason that it would mean that countries like Ireland and others would have even fewer seats.  There is great reluctance to go down that route, although some people have posed the question, would that not give a more European flavour to the elections, but others have said the European Union is not ready for that, that is not yet a federal system and therefore that would be too federal an element.  That idea, which has been put forward by some in the Parliament, has never had a majority.  I cannot envisage it having a majority in the foreseeable future but some members have advocated it.</p><p>  Deputy Donohoe's questions are difficult ones for me to answer because treaty change in the past has typically happened in a very <i>ad hoc</i> way.  A series of demands built up for areas where problems emerged for a country or a group of countries and eventually there was a  compromise where a number of these concerns were put together and it was decided to draw up a treaty.  There was not a master plan to provide that this is what we need to do at European level.  It has been very much an <i>ad hoc</i> process and this may have been part of the problem of getting the public on-side.  There was an attempt to get away with that in the Constitutional Convention held a few years ago when John Bruton was on the presidium, Dick Roche was the Government representative, Proinsias De Rossa was another member and John Gormley was there as well.  It was a mixture of national and European parliamentarians who examined the structure of the European Union to see where treaty changes needed to be made.  There are still many people in the Parliament who like this method of debate between the European Parliament and national parliaments - rather than it being decided by executives - on what does and not does not need to be changed and putting that forward for the future.  The discussion currently tends to be, as the Deputy said, on a complete banking union, Angela Merkel saying that we need a treaty change to do that and other members saying what we should do on another area.  This is currently done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The only thing on which the Parliament is very strong and, I am sure, on which the committee would be very strong, is that whatever changes are needed they need to strengthen this democratic accountability element.  That is critical if European citizens are to be brought on board.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the public perception of the European Parliament.  One may or may not like opinion polls.  We have a very regular measure of this; the Eurobarometer does a series of polls, many of which ask questions about faith and trust in the European institutions, including the European Parliament.  We also have our own small opinion poll unit.  It does not do its own polls but it helps to commission some, focusing more particularly on the role of the European Parliament.  I am happy to share with the committee the work with which it comes up.  Unsurprisingly, it shows that the economic crisis has led to a drop in the support for and popularity of all the European Union institutions and the EU as a whole - the Parliament, the Commission and the Council are all less trusted than they were a few years ago.  An interesting consideration is that when there is economic recovery, will that change and, if so, how quickly? The biggest problem the European Parliament has is its distance from citizens.  It has very great powers.  </p><p>  As the Deputy said, there are 11 Irish MEPs who have to cover the whole range of European Parliament activities which are becoming increasingly complex.  They have to meet and look after their constituents and attend committee meetings and plenary sessions, and that is the same for all members of the European Parliament.  They have to look after the home base, take part in an increasingly difficult legislative and non-legislative control and accountability work and inevitably sometimes citizens find that they are a bit remote.  </p><p>  There is a wider problem of trust in the whole political process, therefore, the turnout in elections has decreased in even national elections, but it is something of which we must be very aware.  As the European Parliament has got more powerful, the turnout in elections has tended to go down rather up.  A key factor recently has been the big enlargement in 2004 where a large number of new member states joined.  The turnout in even national elections in some of the new member states have been very low and they have been new lows.  One of the new member states has only a 17% turnout in the last European Parliament elections and that brought down the overall turnout considerably.  That member state was Slovakia.  The percentage turnout in Poland was in the low 20s.  Of the older member states, the only one in which the turnout has been consistently at a very low level is the United Kingdom, where the turnout has fluctuated between 24% and 36%.</p></speech>

The US Congress, regardless of whether one likes it or does not like it, is a very powerful parliament and yet the turnout in mid-term elections is typically 40% to 50% as well.  That percentage turnout is not very high for the US Congress.  That is not a defence or an argument and clearly one of the key challenges will be to try to raise turnouts in individual countries and in Europe as a whole.  The turnout at elections is an important factor in the legitimacy of all parliaments.</p></speech>

I do not know what will happen in terms of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  One of the ideas considered was that the presidential elections in the future would be held on the same day but that was rejected by the Constitutional Convention.</p></speech>
