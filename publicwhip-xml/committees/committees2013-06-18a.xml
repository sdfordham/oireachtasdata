We convey the apologies of the regional manager at the Wicklow Mountains National Park, Mr. Wesley Atkinson, who had to be in Glendalough today for the visit of Ms Michelle Obama and her daughters.  It is a shame he cannot attend because his participation emphasises the inclusive nature of the work Wicklow Uplands Council is doing with a range of interest groups.  He has given us a good deal of help in preparing our presentation.</p><p>  Wicklow Uplands Council, established in 1997, is an independent voluntary organisation which provides a forum for interested non-statutory organisations and individuals to have their say in the decision-making process affecting the sustainable development of the local environment in the spirit of Local Agenda 21.  The council endeavours to promote the sustainable use and enjoyment of the Wicklow uplands in partnership with the people who live, work and recreate there.  Our logo which members can see on the screen comprises two hands reaching across to form a mountain.  This symbolises our commitment to working together with all interested parties to achieve a sustainable environment.  That type of co-operation sometimes leads to difficulties, but we operate on the principle that consensus is all.</p><p>  I will now hand over to our co-ordinator, Ms Heraty, who will speak about our study to identify the best management of upland habitats in County Wicklow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cara Heraty" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800003#C00700"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to present the recommendations made in our report.  I will be referring to the PowerPoint presentation on the screen.  The objective of the study was to use good science and collaboration to identify best management of upland habitats in County Wicklow, with the optimal balance of farming and biodiversity.  The study was financed by Leader funding provided by County Wicklow Partnership.</p><p>  As Mr. Medlycott remarked, the handshake in the hills in our symbol represents our <i>modus operandi</i> of consensus.  We only move forward when consensus is achieved.  After two very well attended public meetings hosted by Wicklow Uplands Council in 2011, a working group was established to tackle the issue of vegetation management in the Wicklow hills.  A grassroots approach was followed, encompassing representation by upland farmers, recreational users, Teagasc, staff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the council itself and the Irish Uplands Forum.  There was very strong upland farmer participation in the working group, with 11 farmers involved, and 30 meetings were held over a period of two years.  Each participant put in 60 hours, which is indicative of the commitment shown by local participants.  The group also liaised with staff of the Forest Service, the Heritage Council and Wicklow County Council.  In addition, there was consultation with farmers in the Comeragh and Cooley Mountains who experience some of the same issues which I will detail in the course of the presentation.</p> <p>I will give a quick overview of what I will talk about.  We will identify the need for support in managing the hills in the form of a sustainable uplands agri-environment scheme, or SUAS.  We will identify how this will help to meet Government targets and commitments and fulfil the key recommendations from the report, and we will speak about how controlled burning is instrumental and some of the issues around that.  Specifications for the proposed scheme will then follow.</p><p> I will discuss management issues in the Wicklow uplands.  One of the key things is a decline in traditional hill farming in Wicklow.  In general, upland habitats are considered to be in poor ecological condition.  Uncontrolled wildfires are common, not just in Wicklow but across the country.  Uncontrolled vegetation, including tall heather and gorse, poses a threat to public safety and public and private property, including forest, which covers a large part of County Wicklow.</p><p> On access by recreational users, Wicklow is Dublin's playground and there are a lot of associated pressures which local people, including landowners, have to manage, as well as the National Parks and Wildlife Service and statutory bodies.  There are associated issues, such as dog control.  There is a huge deer population in Wicklow and control of deer is also a major management issue.  This is set against a background of the designation of much of the Wicklow uplands as national park areas.  We have the largest national park in the country, at 21,500 ha.  A special area of conservation comprises 32,500 ha and special protection areas are a subset of that at 28,600 ha.</p><p> The chart provided shows the decline in ewe numbers in Wicklow upland DEDs between 2000 and 2010.  Seven upland DEDs were selected and a marked decline can be seen.  We realise the national figures for sheep numbers are increasing, but these numbers support our case and show sheep numbers are in decline in the hills.</p><p> The green area in the next chart shows commonage in County Wicklow.  It is the most recent chart.  Based on the latest figures, we estimate that about one fifth of the area of the Wicklow uplands consists of commonage.  Areas above 200 m are marked in orange.  This shows that any proposed upland agri-environment scheme must take commonage into account.  The next slide shows the special area of conservation in the Wicklow uplands.  It is a massive area, comprising well over half the uplands.  It also highlights what a special area Wicklow is.</p><p> We hope our proposals will help to meet some Government targets and commitments, including improving rural employment.  The scheme should encourage young farmers to farm the hills and serve to support rural economies, keeping them alive and thriving.  It will also assist in achieving growth through Food Harvest 2020, given that sheep numbers and farmers are in decline in the Wicklow hills.  It is an area on which we can improve.  One of the major commitments that could be met is to halt the deterioration in the status of all species and habitats covered by EU nature legislation and to achieve a significant and measurable improvement in their status by 2020.  It is the first target of the 2020 EU biodiversity strategy. </p><p> There is great opportunity for interdepartmental co-operation between the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  What we propose would also reduce the risk of fire to forestry plantations, which is a major problem in Wicklow, especially as the reconstitution grant is no longer available.  Some 21% of the county is covered by forest.</p><p> I will summarise the key recommendations of the report.  It highlights the need for support for upland farmers through an upland agri-environment scheme.  Controlled burning should be supported through the scheme, as it is in neighbouring countries; I will show this to the committee in the next slide.  There is a need for the dates for the Irish burning season to be brought back in line with the UK and Northern Ireland.  This is outside the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but we ask for the support of the committee in lobbying the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to change the dates.  We are also in contact with the Minister.</p><p> We propose that local learning management groups, as per the Cooley Mountains model, be established.  A project in County Leitrim has undertaken a similar approach and there is a local burning management group for the management of grouse in Boleybrack Mountain.  There is a need for research on sustainable grazing levels, the associated economics of upland farming and the factors influencing it.  We are looking for practical trials of management techniques to monitor the effect on biodiversity.  A parallel study area should be run alongside an uplands agri-environment scheme.  There is a lack of data and we do not want to wait for a scheme to happen because farmers are in decline.  Once they are lost it will be very difficult to get farmers and sheep back on the hills.  That needs to happen in parallel with any scheme.</p><p> Ireland is out of line with neighbouring countries in terms of controlled burning dates and permissible burning dates.  Farmers in Ireland are allowed to burn from 1 September to the end of February.  Those dates were reduced by six weeks with the amendment of the Wildlife Act in 2000.  We are out of line with all of our neighbouring countries.  People in Meath look at Carlingford Lough and see that their neighbours in Northern Ireland can burn until 14 April.  This is the case across the board in Scotland, England and Wales.  In some cases the date is 31 March.  The majority of other countries distinguish between upland and lowland areas, something Ireland does not do.  In addition, in neighbouring countries the licensing systems allow for derogations, which provide flexibility to burn outside legal burning dates.  We ask that such a measure be considered.</p><p> We have a picture of what we would call a good burn.  There is a difference between good and bad burning.  The picture shows a light, low-intensity burn which probably happened quite fast.  The seed layer was not destroyed and the vegetation has the capacity to recover quite quickly.  That is the type of burning we are talking about.  The next picture shows what we would call a bad burn.  It is a black, high-intensity burn.  The soil layer has been affected, which causes plasticisation and disintegration of the soil.  Often the seed layer is also affected.  That is something we should not do.</p><p> I will discuss the key principles of the sustainable upland agri-environment scheme which we would like to see established as soon as possible.  The priority objective is to enhance and improve the condition of upland habitats through hill farming.  The scheme must be tailored to recognise the commonage system of management.  As we showed, they comprise such a large area that they have to be included.  Payment for production of biodiversity, as per the Burren Farming for Conservation programme, should be on a sliding scale.  One of the main principles is that one should be paid for work done or production of biodiversity.  Payment should be additional to any additional scheme such as AEOS.  Farmers should be supported by an advisory service.  Flexibility is key.  All of the upland farmers want some flexibility in how they achieve the end product and how they farm.  Government administration of an overall scheme with local administration and promotion by specialists in upland ecology and agriculture are also key.</p><p> On the eligibility criteria for the scheme as proposed by our group, eligible land will be unenclosed land and associated lowland with which it is farmed.  Lowland areas sometimes help to support upland areas.  Sheep are often brought down to those areas.  We seen no reason they should not be included.  The area should contain at least one of the following upland habitat types on at least 10% of its upland: dry heath; wet heath; blanket bog; upland acidic grassland; white grass; flushes; and montane heath or rocky slopes.  We propose that for the purposes of economies of scale 10 ha should be the minimum eligible area.</p> <p>This is quite a bit higher than the Burren Farming for Conservation scheme, but the uplands are an entirely different environment.  Eligible farmers must be active farmers and participation should be based on agreement to farm according to a farm plan prepared in consultation with the farmer.  This plan should be reviewed after year fours, informed by an audit of the habitat's condition.  There should be an initial assessment of habitat condition followed by a review of other farm plans and lengthy consultation with the farmer.  A short colour-coded plan using aerial photography should be used to identify actions for annual implementation.</p><p> I will show the committee a photograph of upland and associated lowland on Pat Dunne's farm.  The photograph also shows Pat Dunne's farm and the start of the zig-zag route which is the main access route to Lugnaquilla, the highest mountain in Leinster.  Pat informs us that this route is like a highway with the numbers of people using it every weekend.  The photograph shows the path that Pat manages and maintains as part of the walk scheme.  Another photograph shows an area of white grass or Molinia which we are informed is no good either for farming or for ecology or biodiversity.  It is a result of undergrazing, which is the biggest issue in Wicklow.  I know the commonage framework plans dealt with overgrazing, but undergrazing is the issue in Wicklow.  The area in the photograph is to the left of the fence line.  Pat Dunne informed us that the area to the right, which is grazed, appeared green three weeks in advance of the area to the left.  This shows the benefits of grazing.  Along the forestry on the right-hand side there is an area of heather which has regenerated because it was left without any grazing.  This means that encouraging heather growth or the management of existing heather can also be an option.</p><p> I have listed the proposed measures that the Wicklow Uplands Council is recommending through the scheme as per REPS.  Five measures have been identified.  The first measure is to manage designated land and other areas of Annex 1 habitat.  This would mean payment for production of biodiversity on a sliding scale.  Measure two is enhancement of habitat diversity through particular actions; measure three is enhancement of particular species; measure four, is support for sustainable upland farming, recreation and the management of cultural heritage, including protected monuments; and measure five is to co-operation on commonages and the establishment of local burning management groups and deer management groups.  This is an issue we have discussed more recently so it is not in the report, but we are continually adapting and developing.  Under Article 36 of the rural development plan, if the Government decides to allocate funding, money is available under Pillar 2 for co-operation measures such as those I have listed.  This article has never been switched on by the Irish Government and we call for that to happen as soon as possible in order to facilitate a top-up payment for the extra work required.  We are asking for payment for work done and additional work is required for co-operation.  We all know the difficulties with commonages, and there is additional work for local burning management groups and also the deer management group, one of which has been in existence in Wicklow for the past ten years.</p><p> I will summarise the scheme and payment rates.  I will not deal in detail with particular payment rates because these change all the time.  I will list the actions.  Measure one is to reach particular targets for habitat condition; measure two is to implement changes to the grazing regime, remove bracken and furze, engage in targeted burning according to a ten-year plan or for fire breaks, engaging in swiping and felling of tall heather or gorse, and reduce areas covered by Molinia.  Measure three is to improve the status of species, for example through the use of small-scale fencing around rare species, a few of which are in Wicklow, and to engage in targeted management to improve habitats for upland birds.  Measure four is rush control in enclosed land associated with upland farms and drain maintenance in enclosed land, and inspection and management of hill access routes.  We had also included the installation of stiles and regular inspection of infrastructure, but the walk scheme, as I understand, was recently extended for five years.  This may be something that could be omitted from our proposals.</p><p> With regard to the cost breakdown, the average payment would be similar to the Burren Farming for Conservation programme at approximately &euro;8,000 per year, based on an average-sized farm in Wicklow.  We have 350 to 400 eligible farmers with land in fee simple and commonages.  The cost of local scheme administration is estimated at &euro;140,000 per year.  Farmers are to pay a proportion of the cost of the management plan and possibly contribute to capital actions to improve the condition of habitats.  We are talking about a contribution of 25% if the measure one payment could be increased.  The total cost of the scheme for County Wicklow is estimated at &euro;3.7 million to &euro;4.2 million per year.  We recommend that funding for this scheme be negotiated under pillar 2 of CAP.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800005#E00300"><p>I welcome the delegation and thank them for the very comprehensive presentation.  There has been much work and research done on the area.  I come from Donegal, which is also a county of hills with lots of commonage grazing and hill grazing areas.  We have had our own difficulties, particularly with destocking on the hills and the dreadful fires in May 2011, when large parts of the county were burned.  Houses were almost lost and we came very close to loss of human life.  Thankfully, that did not happen.</p><p>  I will be as brief as possible.  County Wicklow has extensive Natura land, including SACs and SPAs and the national park.  The combined SACs and SPAs amount to 60,000 ha, which is a very large expanse of land.  We have had difficulties in Donegal with the designation of SPAs in particular and the total lack of consultation with landowners and farmers prior to decisions.  I ask if the council has any view on the designations made in Wicklow or the manner in which those designations have taken place.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This may be a tangential point but I ask if the council is of the view that designations should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, given the affinity between landowners and that Department, rather than of a Department that has no direct link with landowners.</p><p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the council's proposal.  The commonage framework directive and destocking on hills have come about as a result of EU policy - for example, the Natura sites, SPAs and SACs.  Hill farmers have to undertake restrictive farming practices and they must be compensated, because the overall allocation or the pot of money available to this country under the transfers from Europe, between Pillars 1 and 2, is about &euro;1.6 billion.  The reason we are getting that pot of money is that we have a substantial element of restricted farming and SAC and SPA lands.  The farmers concerned play an active part in protecting the Natura sites, which means we are in receipt of a bigger chunk of funding from Europe.  There has to be a compensation element built in.  The current compensation includes the disadvantaged area payment.  However, I am always fascinated at the manner in which the disadvantaged area scheme is administered.  For example, people with the best land in the country were in receipt of disadvantaged area payments while the guys on the hills were getting only a few euro extra per hectare for the poorest land in the country with all sorts of restrictions on stocking.  That was wrong.</p> <p>There are potentially several ways of dealing with this and I support the delegates' suggestions in this regard.</p><p> Agreement is expected to be reached soon on a renewal of the Common Agricultural Policy and there has been a great deal of discussion by farmers throughout the country of what it might mean for them.  My colleague, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and I do not wholly subscribe to the argument that Pillar 2 will offer a solution to all of the difficulties being faced by farmers on marginal land.  The largest element of change will come under Pillar 1 which accounts for some &euro;1.2 billion of funding.  Pillar 2, on the other hand, will offer only some &euro;450,000, a sum which could diminish between now and the end of the year as a consequence of the current fiasco with the drawdown of Leader funding.  That delay could have knock-on connotations for the drawdown of funding under the new CAP.</p><p> The difficulty is that we do not yet know what will be involved under Pillar 2.  We do know that there will be a rural development aspect, for example, and that suckler cow quotas and the disadvantaged areas scheme will have to be accommodated, but it is difficult to ascertain how much money will be left over for schemes such as the delegates are proposing.  Funding for some of their proposals such as measure 1 which suggests a per hectare payment would more suitably come under Pillar 1.  Some of the other measures could come under Pillar 2, but there must be an up-front payment, particularly for farmers on lands which could be described as marginal or hilly.  That up-front payment should come from the Pillar 1 budget which is three times that of Pillar 2.  The Irish Farmers Association has maintained that the Pillar 2 budget is the appropriate pot from which farmers on poorer land in the west and places such as County Wexford and County Wicklow can receive their top-up payment.  That is somewhat disingenuous.  Why should farmers on marginal lands struggle to obtain funds under Pillar 2 when the owners of large farms are getting the benefit in any case as a result of the restrictive farming practices being undertaken by farmers on peripheral land?</p><p> The scheme the delegates are proposing is an excellent one, but I could not support a situation where it would be implemented only in County Wicklow.  We would love to steal parts of it for implementation in other parts of the country.  I am sure the delegates will take that as the compliment it is intended to be.  There is not a huge amount of money involved, with the delegates indicating that some 350 to 400 farmers in County Wicklow would be eligible.  There is work for the committee to do in discovering how many might be eligible and the cost of including all of them on a nationwide basis.  Hill land is one of our greatest natural assets and farmers are best placed to protect it.  They must, however, be compensated for that work and the way to do so is via a cheque in the post.  It goes without saying there must be conditions and we must ensure the work is being done and the money spent properly.  Identifying the source of income will be key.</p><p> My main concern is that this worthy proposal might suffer because of diminishing funds under Pillar 2.  I urge the delegates to be careful of this.  The argument needs to be made that some of the Pillar 1 funding should be allocated for schemes such as this.  That would benefit thousands of farmers, particularly along the west coast from counties Cork and Kerry right up to County Donegal.  It would allow people to stay on the land and protect it.  We can talk about productivity and so on, but in the absence of such support, we will see in five or ten years time people leaving the land because there is no source of income.  They will move to urban areas or leave these shores, leading to a significant rural decline.  In fact, this is already happening throughout the country, with young people leaving the family farm because it does not provide a sustainable income.</p><p> The delegates' proposal in respect of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 is a no brainer for me.  It makes no sense to have two burning policies on a small island like ours.  I met a delegation from the North last night to discuss wind energy.  There is a strong case to be made for an all-island policy in terms of planning and so forth in that area.  Likewise, a  common-sense approach is required on the issue of burning and it should be possible to work out an island-wide policy.  There is no difference between the hills around Maghera and those in County Wicklow or County Donegal; why, therefore, would there be two burning policies?  It makes absolute sense to have a co-ordinated approach on issues such as this.</p></speech>

I concur with much of what Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill said, particularly about the uncertainty surrounding the framework for Pillar 2 and the level of funding it will provide.  The problems experienced by hill farmers in County Wicklow, as outlined by the delegates, are the same as those facing farmers on the west coast, in my own county of Kerry, in west Cork and every area in which hill farmers are struggling to make a living on very marginal land.  The types of proposal the delegates have brought forward must be considered as part of a national plan in order to maintain family farm living in hilly and mountainous areas.  Ensuring people have a sustainable income which supports their families will have benefits for the wider community in the form of a knock-on effect for local businesses and employment.</p><p>  In terms of eligibility for the scheme, the delegates have proposed that 10 ha be the minimum eligible area.  Did they come across any farmer with a smaller holding than this in the course of their research?  They mentioned that under-grazing in some areas as a consequence of restrictions and so on was causing problems in controlling burn-off.  I agree that the problem is the existence of two separate burning calendars on the two parts of the island.  Will the delegates comment further in this regard?</p><p>  I acknowledge the effort the delegates have put into their proposals and I am particularly impressed that the committee included 11 farmers.  It is vital that stakeholders have a role in determining their own future.  Who knows better what needs to be done than those who are at the coalface and whose living is dependent on the outcome?  My party shares the concerns expressed by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill regarding Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP.  Pillar 2 is clearly the poor relation which seems destined to have only the crumbs from the table.  If there is to be a support mechanism such as that outlined by the delegates, it must be sufficiently funded to have a real impact in ensuring the sustainability of hill farming across the island.</p></speech>

What is Wicklow Uplands Council's relationship with Coillte?  Does the designation of the area to which they are referring as a national park assist or hinder them in their efforts and, if either is the case, will they explain why?</p> <p>The delegates spoke about recreational use.  Have they anything more to say on that matter?  Is it something they view as significant for the future, or do they see it as being less significant because the priority is on the farming side?  What is the status of protected species in that area?  What work, if any, have the delegates done in that regard?</p><p> The delegates spoke about the decline in the number of sheep in the area.  Have they done any research into whether there is a market for such sheep, particularly Wicklow upland sheep or hill sheep?  Often, it is possible designate food accordingly.  Would it help the delegates with their proposal if they were marketing a particular animal?  The food lovers among us would always ask that question, and it is a worthwhile one, but I wonder whether the delegates have come down to that level.  When one is asking for help, one should outline one's strengths and say that one could do well in that respect.  Have the delegates any targets or figures for where they see the increase coming from and how much growth there might be?  Everything they are doing is in order to improve things, and I wonder whether they have quantified that.</p><p> The delegates said that the scheme should encourage young farmers, which it should, and it should also support the rural economy.  Have they any more to tell us about how it might do that?  All of us in this committee have an interest in encouraging young farmers.  Farming is a difficult enough job at present, with many pressures, and part of the argument is how can we encourage people to enter farming.  While the delegates would say the scheme would be good for young farmers, how exactly would it be good for them and have they any idea of the number of young farmers who might be drawn in as a consequence?  When seeking funding for or trying to persuade people to support a proposal, having those extra details would be helpful.</p></speech>

Well done to the delegates on their collaboration, which was impressive.  It is not easy to collaborate different points of view and they all come from different areas.  Along the lines of what Senator O'Keeffe said, I do not come from a hill farming area; rather, I come from the valley beside the shore, the land of milk and honey, and I need some education.  I would be interested in particular to hear from Mr. Pat Dunne about the reality of being a farmer in that area.  To return to Senator O'Keeffe's point, how can we incentivise young farmers to enter or stay in this area?  I am one of those people who visit this area on a Sunday and I idolise and enjoy it.  I was very taken by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's visualisation of what will happen in five to ten years if we do not sit down and consider this.  I feel empathy for the delegates because we have two pillars in the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, whom we need to get into a room to engage properly on this.  It is pity the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has responsibility for burning policy and that it does not come under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Scotland, England, Wales and the Northern Ireland have the burning dates that were given but there must have been some reason a decision was made here to designate another period in line with the Wildlife Act.  Perhaps that decision was wrong, but I would like the delegates to clarify that.  I would welcome the alignment of the periods and I am desperately keen that we encourage the delegates to be careful of our wildlife and to protect all species.</p><p>  The slide showing the trend in ewe numbers is shocking.  In some areas the number of ewes has more than halved.  How and why has that happened?  Can the delegates educate us about how we can bring those numbers back up to the level pertaining in 2000?  What exactly has happened?  The decline in the ewe numbers has been dramatic.</p></speech>

It was very interesting.  It was equally interesting to hear from the delegates we had in regarding the equivalent scheme in Burren.  We have to consider this matter in a way that supports rural Ireland, which is facing many pressures.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and others referred to the vision for this area in five to ten years' time.  We brought in an EU directive which had a vision regarding the destocking of our hills five to ten years ago and we can now see the effect it has had on sheep numbers in Wicklow.  We got that wrong.  Some of the plants on the hills, especially the ferns, have grown wild, and their growth has not been controlled because sheep are the best animals to do that.</p><p>  It is hard to get sheep back on a hill, because they have to be bred and trained to live on that hill; that is a long-term aspect in regard to restocking, and I agree with the delegates on that.  I did not see anything wrong with the farming practices that were in place ten, 15 or 20 years ago but bureaucracy went mad in terms of what we did in destocking our hills.  When the sheep were removed from the hills, I know there was increased biodiversity, with certain plants regenerating and taking over, but was there much of increase in the population of wildlife such as deer on the hills?</p><p>  As a Kilkenny man, I know Wicklow well as it is nearly a neighbouring county.  What percentage of the land in Wicklow is defined as upland?  I remember when I was campaigning for election to the Seanad that I did not realise the time it took to travel from east to west Wicklow across the hills, as shown on the map of Wicklow in the presentation.  It is a long drive to cover that large area late at night.  I understand the position of the farmers in the area.  I would say this is the largest upland area in Ireland and it has been a big challenge for farmers in the area to cope with, especially in the past two years when we have had wet and cold winters.  The delegates said that 300 to 400 farmers were involved.  How many of those farmers would be totally reliant on the upland area?</p><p>  The delegates stated that the scheme should look after active farmers.  We are engaged in the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, which are possibly the most important negotiations for this country for next seven years, and one of the stumbling blocks we find when we meet any group, whether it be EU representatives, Department officials or farm organisations, is how to define an active farmer.  I would interested to hear the delegates' definition.</p><p>  On the issue of burning policy, to which the previous speakers referred, I know that such burning cannot be done willy-nilly or at any time of the year but I do not agree with farming by dates, which, as we have seen in the context of the nitrates directive, has had a detrimental effect.  We have an extension under the nitrates directive until the end of September this year because of the pressures farmers are under due to fodder crisis.  The Department - whether it be the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - should examine the situation and stop trying to ensure that farmers farm according to dates directed by the EU.</p><p>  The delegates said that under the proposed scheme there would be an average payment of &euro;8,000 to between 300 and 400 farmers.  That would amount to approximately &euro;3.2 million, which would have to come out of Pillar 2 funding - that is, approximately 5% of the budget for Pillar 2.  We know the budget will be &euro;313 million, which the Government will have to match, and hopefully it will match it to the tune of 50% or 55%.  Even leaving aside payments under other schemes, nearly 5% of the budget for Pillar 2 would go to County Wicklow.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said the scheme should be supported under Pillar 1.  The Senator's party is proposing that people farming upland areas such as this with a flat rate payment and equalisation would be the beneficiaries from Pillar 1 under what is being proposed by Commissioner Cioloş.</p> <p> Reference was made to Food Harvest 2020 and achieving goals.  If we are to achieve the goals set, we must stock hills to the maximum and get the maximum return.  I accept that it is challenging to farm in such areas because of the weather.  One cannot have sheep on a hill unless one has a good dog and the sheep are trained.  One must have a lot of co-operation between neighbours, especially on commonage land.  I would welcome comments on the points I have made.</p><p> It is important to define &ldquo;active farmer&rdquo; and ascertain how many of the 400 farmers mentioned are totally reliant on uplands.  It was said the average payment would be &euro;8,000.  Given that such farmers are in the AEOS also, they are starting with &euro;12,000 and then there are Pillar 1 payments, flat-rate payments, which would not be too bad if they were along the lines suggested by some.</p></speech>

Did the delegates have any communication or correspondence with the group there when it was compiling its scientific plan and drawing up proposals?  The Burren group was before the committee in recent months when it made an interesting presentation.

There was a difficult period in County Wicklow, as in the rest of the country, when the designations were first made.  I am pleased to say that during the years the relationship with the National Parks and Wildlife Service has dramatically improved in County Wicklow.  We co-operate with it on a number of projects, one of which involves the protection of rural and upland environments and collecting material illegally dumped, together with Coillte and the local authorities.  We work with the service on some very successful projects.</p><p>  To clarify, the area of special protection is a subset of the SAC.  We are not talking about an additional 32,000 ha; it is a case of 32,000 ha of SAC, of which the SPA is a subset.</p><p>  From attending various presentations by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and as a member of the national working group that has been exploring a scheme for the uplands of Ireland, it is clear that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is moving from desk-based to evidence-based management plans.  The designation phase is now complete and according to the commitment to the EU 2020 biodiversity strategy, we must at least maintain and improve the condition of upland habitats.  In some cases European Court of Justice fines have been imposed.  That is why there is a response on issues such as the freshwater pearl mussel.  We know that the National Parks and Wildlife Service's priorities include such issues as the restoration of raised bogs, restoring the freshwater pearl mussel to eight rivers and sustainable management of uplands.  Another priority is grassland management in EU grassland habitats.  From discussions with staff at national level, farmers are recognised as being key to the delivery of the plans, not just because they own some of the areas which are designated but also because the staff and resources are not exist available within the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The service recognises the value of farmers, sometimes through holding grazing rights, even within national parks, and that they have a key role to play in improving the condition of habitats.  Currently, there is a huge gap in terms of the optimal stocking rates for production of biodiversity in the various types of habitat.  That is why in our report we recommend the parallel study to identify this and carry out some research.  We would love to work with Teagasc and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the study in the future.</p></speech>

He would have answered Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question about the relationship between our organisation and the national park in County Wicklow because if there was a difficulty, it is clear that the manager of the national park would not be presenting with us.  It is one of the more important aspects of what we have managed to achieve.</p></speech>

Understocking has been a huge problem in County Wicklow.  We never had an overstocking problem in County Wicklow, apart from in a couple of isolated places.  Even when the commonage framework plans were drawn up, at the time it was generally recognised in County Wicklow that we did not have an overstocking problem.</p><p>  As to the reason for understocking, it is simple; there is not a sufficient return from hill farming.  I am one of the few full-time hill farmers left on the Wicklow hills.  Most people have off-farm income because they need it.  It is as simple as that.  </p><p>  Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe asked a question about young farmers.  I have four sons, two of whom are keen to farm the hills, but, unfortunately, there is not sufficient income for them to do so.  That is the reality.  There are several similar situations in my area where other young fellows are mad keen to farm because there are good hills in parts of County Wicklow, but they must have an income to be able to provide in the future for a wife and children, whatever the case may be.  As it stands, that is not possible.  I would not be able to do it if I had a mortgage to pay.  Most of my family have gone through college at this stage.  As I have only one fellow left, I do not have the huge commitments someone with a younger family would have.  That is the reality.</p><p>  Burning dates was one issue that was raised.  It has been a huge problem in County Wicklow since the system was introduced and it was introduced without any consultation.  We were just told that was the case and that was the end of the story.  We have campaigned for a long time through the Wicklow Uplands Council to try to have the dates changed back to where they were but to no avail.  We have met various people and nearly all feel the same way about it.  We would like to see sensible burning dates and a proper rotational burning system which would ensure massive and dangerous burning similar to what happened in Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s place in County Donegal would not happen.  We had this a few years ago in the Sally Gap area of County Wicklow where thousands of acres were burned.  It did not make the same headlines because there were no houses close to it and there was no health risk, as such.  This spring there was a big burning in Ballycroy National Park in County Mayo where 15,000 acres were burned.  If one goes back to the days when farmers managed the hills and they burned a little every year, there was never any big burn because if a fire happened to start, it ran into an area that had been burned the previous year and it did not go any further.  That system worked for generations.  Because I am out on the hills for a good deal of my time - I also do a good bit of hillwalking with a walking group - I am aware that the number of grouse has declined dramatically since the burning dates were changed.  Where I used to see ten and 12 packs of grouse on the hills when out gathering sheep, I am now lucky if I see two or three grouse, such is the decline in numbers.</p> <p> We all have to work together.  During the years burning dates, sheep farming and grouse management always went hand in hand.  I believe this was a mistake.  I am not sure the people who pushed for the change in the burning dates realised the consequences of doing this, but the position must be brought back into line with that for our neighbours in the North of Ireland and across the water.</p></speech>

If we have the very fine weather that we had a fortnight ago and a very good summer, members can be quite certain that there will be a major fire in County Wicklow.  That will destroy not just the heather and the mountains but also the wildlife and everything else.  With the heather at the height it is at now, there is potential for major destruction and it could be a catastrophe.</p></speech>

This hides a much larger problem in County Wicklow in that while the sheep are there, the farmers do not put them out on the hills.  They may still have the same numbers, but they are not putting them out on the hills and if they are, it is for a very short period.  The problem is much more severe than what has been highlighted.  Unfortunately, we do not have figures, but anecdotally, from talking to farmers, we know that many still have sheep, but they are not putting them out near the hills.  That is a much bigger problem.</p><p>  On the reason sheep numbers fall, the main reason is that they are not making money.  The national farm survey shows that, without direct payments, hill farmers are losing money.  That is the bottom line.  Why would they keep more sheep to lose more money and endure more hardship?  That is the reason sheep numbers are falling.</p><p>  In terms of incentives for young farmers and so on, we have had various discussions among ourselves, but one of the issues in hill areas is that young farmers do not have access to the hills because of the way the schemes - the single farm payment and the area aid scheme - have been structured.  Farmers already have their payments based on the land area they are farming.  They need to keep these areas on their area aid or single farm payment scheme forms to receive their payments.  Therefore, young farmers starting out do not have access to the hills.  If we could free this a little, that would be one possible avenue by which to encourage young fellows to take up farming.  The other big one is if there was a profitable sheep enterprise.  If there is no money in it, they will not stay.</p><p>  Someone brought up the issues of under-grazing on the hills and heather management.  Traditionally in County Wicklow the heather is grazed and when it becomes too strong, we have to burn it to generate young growth.</p><p>  I deal with farmers from Teagasc and so on, but the pattern of sheep grazing on the hills is very important.  This also leads to the problem with burning.  We no longer put sheep on the hills for the winter months.  The winter and early summer months are the time of the year when sheep graze on the heather.  These are the periods in County Wicklow, in particular, when sheep are not being put back on the hills and unless we can do something to address this, the heather getting strong and having to continue to burn it will still be an issue.</p><p>  Some years ago a trial was undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service on Djouce mountain.  It carried out a controlled burn and swiping operation.  It achieved great results, but because sheep were not put back out at the appropriate time to graze on the heather, it was fit to be done again.  Using sheep is the most effective way of controlling the problem.  Unfortunately, even if one is actively farming with sheep, one still needs to burn the heather as part of a long-term control plan.</p></speech>

We do not have any control over them, but obviously hill farmers would love to see as much money as possible coming to them under the CAP.  However, what we want is not a payment - I have stressed this point on several occasions - for simply owning land.  It is a payment for works done.  If one happens to own an area of mountain land and is prepared to go out and get the vegetation on it into good condition for livestock, wildlife, biodiversity and recreational users, one will be compensated or paid in a meaningful way for doing this rather than receiving a flat, across the board payment per hectare.</p></speech>

That issue will have to be worked on.  There is a lot of work to be done on the plans.  I believe each commonage will have to be looked at in a separate way to see what stock is needed to keep the vegetation in proper condition.  We want a payment for work done, not just because somebody happens to own ten, 20 or 50 ha of land.  We want people to be paid for work done rather than just owning land.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800009#J01300"><p>I am sorry; I was at another meeting and could not attend earlier.  </p><p>  There is a great deal of sense in the various points the delegates have raised.  I would like to address my colleagues and the delegates on the single farm payment issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has produced figures for me based on productivity, excluding tillage farmers.  What they show is that the farmers receiving more than &euro;400 or &euro;500 per hectare are less than twice as productive as those receiving less than &euro;250 per hectare.  If the minimum payment was fixed at &euro;200 for those now receiving under &euro;250, it should be less than &euro;400 for those now receiving &euro;500 or more.</p><p>  That brings me to the issue of what is an active farmer.  A farmer rang me last night.  Like many farmers around where I live, he farms 2,000 ft. above sea level.  If one does not have to be active to do this, one does not have to be active to do anything.  It is not easy to get a tractor to the top of the mountains where he is located.  I think we will park the issue of what is an active farmer.  As I said, on the production aspect, there is no factual basis to the argument being made by the Irish Farmers Association on production because the figures provided by the Senator's own Minister give the lie to it.  Unless the Senator wants to take up the figures with him, I have to go by whatever figures he gives me and they are the production figures.</p><p>  To return to the issue of hill farming, it seems everybody wants to have a slice of the hills and to have the hill farmer keep the hills in the way they want them kept, but it seems nobody wants to pay for keeping them in the way they want them to be kept.  The hill walker wants to walk on the hills and I am all for hill walking.  I was a great promoter of hill walking through Comhairle na Tuaithe which I set up.  However, I recognise that people walking the hills of Ireland are walking on private land.  The ecologists want to have a slice of the hills and want us to keep them in a fancy way to preserve all the heathers, the grouse and everything else.  In return for grants, the agriculturalists also want to have access to the hills and want to know what we are producing on them.  We should put down a clear marker.  If we want people farming on the hills, they will have to be paid.  They have to have a livelihood, directly or indirectly, from which there is no getting away.  If we close one door to them, we will have to open another because the public good demands that the hills be kept in good order.</p> <p> I was very interested in the delegates' comments on sheep and the manner in which the nature of hill sheep farming had been changed by some of the great ideas people had come up with such as taking sheep off the hills in the winter, feeding ewe lambs near the bottom during the winter and so on.  When I was Minister, I recall coming to Dublin with the late Michael O'Toole who worked for a long time for Teagasc in respect of something about which some of the hill men might not have known.  I spent three hours trying to persuade D&uacute;chas and the National Parks and Wildlife Service that the rote destocking of hills and the changes it was forcing on the way hill sheep farmers did their business would change the grazing pattern on the hills and create both under and overgrazed sections on the same hill.  </p><p> I am interested in teasing out this issue.  I am not from the hills, but I have been working with hill sheep farmers for a long time.  At one time I was a hill sheep farmers' co-operative manager and at peak, we rented 1,000 acres of land.  While I did not engage in day-to-day farming - I had people to do this - I still had ultimate responsibility for it.  It appears as though sheep are no different from cats and I always used to define what we were doing as the cat-at-the-back-door syndrome.  I have a cat at home which will sit on the window until it receives one's attention.  Moreover, it knows to go to the back door when it is hungry and it gets to feed there.  Of course, the cat's nature was not to do this.  It's nature was to forage widely over a territory to get its food until human beings changed the nature of the cat.  The cat kept coming to the back door because after a while, it twigged that this was where the food was.  My understanding is that if one continues to change the nature of how one feeds sheep, by bringing them inside in the winter or whatever else, they get it into their heads that that is where the food is and the way in which they graze the hills will change radically.  Will it be necessary to go back and start breeding new sheep that will not be kept in and not fed on the low part of a hill?  Will it be necessary to let nature take its course if the objective is to have the whole of the range of the hill grazed in a much more even pattern?  This seems to be becoming an increasingly major issue in that no matter how much one destocks, if one continues to follow this pattern, one will continue to have the same worn section where the sheep will continue to graze.</p><p> The second question is whether, as the people from the Burren have advocated, farming and prescriptions for hill sheep farmers should be based on the outcome, not the inputs.  In other words, the tendency is for Departments to tell people they can keep so many sheep, can put so many of them on a hill in the winter or can keep them in for this or that number of days, irrespective of the weather.  We actually take the farmers and their inherited knowledge spanning hundreds of years out of the equation and substitute it with rote and prescriptions on a piece of paper.  Should we instead tell them that we seek to have the land kept in a particular order but that we do not care how they do it because they know their job?  Should we tell them that we do not care on what dates they put sheep up and down on a hill because what we will measure is the condition of the hill and the way they leave it?</p><p> Third, I am interested in the delegation's suggestion this payment should be given, as well as an agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, payment, which raises a series of questions.  On a recent visit to Brussels I found that they were not clear on it, but perhaps the Minister might provide clarity tomorrow in this regard.  My understanding had been that to comply with good farming and agri-environmental conditions, one would be obliged to comply with the commonage framework plan.  Put in simple English, my understanding, although those in Brussels seem to think otherwise, was that to receive one's single farm payment, one would be obliged to comply with the commonage framework plan.  My understanding of the next round of the AEOS was that it was much more likely to comprise the kinds of thing the delegates have listed than its past format which, in the main, was a payment for destocking hills.  That is how we worked it in all cases.  The people in County Wicklow were very lucky because they experienced less destocking than those in the west.  I refer to how the process was worked out and what they actually were getting on average.  Therefore, with regard to the double payment principle in the European Union, I wonder how practical this really is.  However, I agree that the delegates must be paid.</p><p> My final issue pertains to active and inactive farmers.  My understanding is that farmers in County Wicklow have collops or, in other words, certain rights to put certain numbers of sheep on hills as opposed to the position in the west where one has an undivided share of a hill and everyone owns it.  It is only a subtle difference, but I presume that were I to take a hill in County Wicklow on which, for example, there were 100 shares, 33 might be completely dormant and not claimed for in any area aid application, that a further one third might be held by farmers who claimed but did not keep sheep on the hill, while the remainder would keep sheep on it.  In this example, the second group actually would claim the hill as being part of their farm because it is part of the farm under the area aid scheme, while they farm the low land.  One must recognise that there are farmers who will farm their farms but who will not feel up to all of the additional work the delegates have laid out.  The same problem in respect of maintenance arose when the waymarked way scheme was being devised, as some farmers could not maintain their section of the waymarked way.  They might not have been in a physical condition to so do because all of us will age and succession can be a problem on farms.  It does not mean that they cannot farm, but they cannot do this kind of work.</p><p> This goes back to a wider vision I had of rural Ireland.  It is a more <i>communautaire</i>vision than the individualistic way we approach everything today.  The vision was that in a rural community such as west Wicklow and the mountains, for those farmers who would not feel up to doing such work, one would employ the young farmers on the rural social scheme to do the work for them.  One would get the work done through the rural social scheme, which would mean that the young farmers would have the guarantee of a fixed income through the aforementioned scheme for 19 hours work per week.  Moreover, they would also have a profit from the hill farm because nowadays, if one is participating in the farm assist schme, one is working 100% for the Department of Social Protection.  Unfortunately, the European Union has not got this far in its thinking on farm subsidies and so on, but my idea was that taking together the rural social scheme, the fact one could build one's family home on one's farm - it would be a little cheaper to build than a house one might buy - and one's farm, one could have a good, comfortable lifestyle for a family.  In this way, one would not be dependent on 100% of the people being capable of doing all of the additional work the delegates want to have done.  The idea is to do this work for those who cannot do it for themselves by using young farmers.  Young farmers would be given a supplementary income in order that they would be encouraged to stay in their home place and farm the land.  Do the delegates envisage this as being part of their vision?  </p><p> My final point is that I saw an area being changed utterly.  I acknowledge that it is hard to be a full-time farmer on hill land, unless one has an awful lot of it, but we must have that land farmed.  We changed that area with the concept of having a modest job and the farm income supplementing each other to give a family income.  This created stability and kept families intact, thereby allowing them to rear children and live in comfort.  How would this fit into the delegates' vision of a future for farming in County Wicklow?  It is a little more complicated than the direct payments because it also states the social welfare code or rather, through these work schemes, the rural social scheme has a valid part to play in creating sustainable, viable farming in upland areas.</p></speech>

He asked the reason the systems of sheep production changed.  The biggest reason was that what people were doing was not making money.  The nature of sheep production has changed.  Years ago, when people were actively farming the hills, there was no such thing as spring lamb.  Now everyone is pushing for spring lamb.  In County Wicklow we had a market for the Suffolk Cheviot cross ewe lamb, but, again, that trade has died off and it is not as profitable as it used to be.  </p><p>  The Deputy has asked the reason farmers began to bring sheep down off the hills and feed them away from them.</p> <p>They were taking grass on the flatlands in Kildare and putting sheep away for the winter because it was easier and more profitable for them to do so.  That is what happened.  As a result, it is difficult to get the sheep to graze on the hills.  Unless someone is putting sheep out on the hills every year, they stand inside the gate and wait to be fed.  That is the problem.</p><p> Before we came in here I spoke to Mr. Dunne about it.  He is one of the few farmers left in Wicklow who puts ewes with lambs to the hill.  From an economic point of view, we were wondering whether he should do it at all.  I do not know whether he should because then his lambs are smaller and it is less profitable.  Leading on from that, Mr. Dunne asked should we change our ewe type completely and opt for a different type of ewe that is hardier and that we could leave on the hills.  Maybe that is a solution.  These are the issues we were looking at and we have had many discussions at our meetings about them.  Definitely, that is something that has to change.  As I stated earlier, the timing of the sheep grazing the hill has a significant impact on what they do to the heather and it is important to take sheep back down at the different times of the year.  Someone mentioned earlier the branding of Wicklow lamb.  Perhaps there should be some such scheme, but we must get the sheep with the lambs onto the hills during the summer and get the ewes back out for the winter grazing.  If that involves a change in ewe type or a change in product we are selling, that will have to be worked on.  We do not have the answers to this.  We ourselves came up with these questions but we do not have the answers.  We were looking for a study to get some answers to this.</p><p> Mention was made of measuring the condition of the hills and paying farmers on that basis.  That is the system which works in the Burren.  Unfortunately, we in Wicklow can draw up what we think are the best plans and tell farmers what will happen if they go out to do so, but that might not happen at all.  The reason what happened in the Burren worked so successfully is they started with a great deal of research behind them and the schemes were built one on top of the other.  This built up confidence among the planners drawing up the plans that they knew what would be the result if they drew up a plan and told a farmer to do something, and farmers were also confident that such would be the case.  Farmers would not buy into extending such a scheme over the whole of the uplands areas because they would be afraid someone would come out to assess it.  Definitely, it is something towards which we could work in the long term, but farmers would want some guaranteed payment at the start and maybe work towards being paid in the future on the basis of the condition of the hills regardless of how they do it.</p><p> Everyone keeps coming back to this question of Pillars 1 and 2.  In talking among ourselves here, we have a big fear with compensating farmers under Pillar 1.  In the past, under Pillar 1 a farmer had to comply with GAEC.  There were minimum stocking rates for the sheep and the hills had to be kept in a certain condition with regard to invasive species, heather, overgrowth, etc.  There has not been much policing of this in that one can tell a farmer that he or she must hold a number of sheep between a certain range, but who will go out to the hills to count them to see whether the farmer is putting them out or not?  That is a big issue.  The other aspect, with a great deal of heather on the hills, is that if one tells farmers they will lose their single farm payments if they do not control the heather on that hill, the danger is they will set fire to it and burn the whole hill.  The following year the hill will start to green up again and they will be laughing.  They will be fine for the next few years because there will be vegetation on the hill and they will qualify for the payment.</p><p> What we are talking about in the scheme here separately is that we tell the farmers exactly what we want.  We want a long-term approach to this.  It is not a simple overnight answer.  For burning, we are talking about it on a 15 to 20 year rotation.  We are talking here about telling farmers to get back out on the hills with sheep at certain times of the year and for that we need a specific scheme for compensating the farmers.  We are telling them exactly what they have to do in order to get that funding whereas if one were talking about paying it out under Pillar 1, there would be very loose regulations where the gain for the hills would be questionable.  We would probably end up with a system such as REPS where farmers got the funding but there was no advantage on the hills.  That is our big fear and that is why we are proposing that there would be funding set aside specifically for these upland schemes.  That is our issue in that regard.</p><p> The active farmer question is a tricky one.  I was involved in a group talking among ourselves about these hills and other matters and it is difficult to come up with a definition of an active farmer who qualifies for the payment.  In our scheme, we were talking about taking a collective approach in which those on the entire commonage would join the scheme together.  Within that, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, some farmers may not want to put any sheep to the hills.  Others may want to put more to the hills.  I was involved with the new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, before Christmas and we had a situation on a commonage where one farmer was told he had to put an extra 100 sheep on the hills to qualify for AEOS payments while his next door neighbour was told he had to take 150 off it.  If we take a whole of commonage approach, if farmers want to decide among themselves that one will put up more than another that should be the way it goes.  Our definition of active farmers then would be someone who is contributing towards our scheme in terms of controlling and managing the hills for the future if that involves the farmer putting sheep to the hill.  If that involves the farmer getting somebody else to put his or her share of the sheep up to the hills, maybe the farmer is also an active farmer in that he or she is contributing towards the hills for the future.  It is a grey area.  As I say, one must look at individual farmers.  If one has ten farmers on a commonage and one gets six of them into the scheme who do everything, it all could be completely undone by the other four who do not join the scheme.  That is why we are looking at it on a whole of commonage approach.</p><p> That addresses most of it.  As for who gets paid, that is also a way to bring in and encourage young farmers.  If some of the older shareholders are not interested in putting sheep to the hills, maybe they can encourage young lads to come in to do the herding and put their own sheep up for older shareholders.  That is why we are looking at having a whole of commonage approach.  That is a new system that has not been tried here previously.  It has been done in England.  It is a more complex system but merely because it is complex does not mean that it is not more appropriate.  That is our view on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Dunne" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061800011#L00200"><p>As a hill farmer, I would certainly agree with many of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's comments.  It is obvious that he knows a good deal about hill farming.</p><p>  I would make a couple of points in addition to what Mr. Byrne said.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service in Wicklow, which was mentioned here on a few occasions, takes in sheep to graze on the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  There are 34 or 35 farmers who pay a nominal fee per head each year to put sheep in.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service's idea is that it is the best way of managing the commonage and keeping the vegetation right.  Likewise, the Department of Defence owns approximately 9,000 acres of land in the Glen of Imaal, which is a shooting range.  They take in sheep there per head by the year as well and they tell me that it is the same idea.  They take them in there because that is how they keep the vegetation in condition, for health and safety, etc.</p><p>  There was a question raised earlier about AEOS by Senator O'Neill.  I did not pick up on it at the time and he has gone now.  He stated that there was &euro;12,000 paid in AEOS.  As we all will be aware, the maximum payment in AEOS is &euro;4,000.  I was in REPS and I came out of it.  I was drawing a payment of &euro;12,336 per year in REPS and when that ran out, I went into AEOS where I am getting &euro;4,000.  That is a hell of a difference.  One cannot make that up by selling extra stock.  It is just not there.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned collops in Wicklow.  There are some collops in Wicklow.  Also, there are equal shares.  Some of the mountains in Wicklow are owned outright by farmers.  There is a range of ownership issues in Wicklow and there is much work to be done there.</p><p>  What Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated about some farmers would not be able to farm the hills or do the work that is needed is quite true.  He spoke of a farm at 2,000 ft. above sea level.  The one that I farm runs up to the top of Log na Coille, up to 3,000 ft. above sea level.  One cannot get a tractor up to it.  It is as simple as that.  A quad bike can go part but not all of the way.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's idea of the rural social scheme, RSS, workers is certainly a good one.  If farmers are unable to do the work themselves and if there are funds available that would pay a young fellow or a couple of fellows to do the work that is needed to be done, that should be encouraged.</p><p>  On the scheme, as Mr. Byrne stated, while we think that the whole commonage should be taken into consideration, it has to work somewhat like the basis on which REPS worked.  It also must be optional.  If there are farmers who do not want to be in it, one cannot force them into it.</p> <p> Mr. Byrne referred to flat-rate payments across the board.  If it works like that, farmers will do the minimum amount possible.  One cannot stand over them and make them change.  There should be an incentive for farmers to do the work.  They should be paid according to a scoring system or otherwise.  Such a system is operated in the Burren and it seems to be working very well.</p><p> My final point on this matter, which echoes what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, is that the most-cost effective way of keeping the mountains in good shape is to keep the hill farmers farming on them.  If people have to be brought in to do the work and if they are to be supervised and checked, considerable expenditure will be incurred very quickly.</p></speech>

I was trying to be in two places at the same time.</p><p>  Mr. Brown said that various people suggested changing the breed of sheep.  He stated this would require research and that he hoped to do this.  I would have believed that with all the various organisations involved in farming, research and education, it would not be necessary to start again in this regard.  I would have believed somebody would have known the answer.  Perhaps I did not understand what Mr. Byrne said.</p></speech>

Very little has been done in the interim.  The research was mostly carried out in the west on increasing output in respect of the Scotch horny ewe or mountain black-faced ewe.

If we had it and could demonstrate the results to farmers, it would represent a big sea change. The traditional choice in Wicklow is the Cheviot ewe.  The tradition is significant and I am not running it down.  I am just suggesting that a hardy breed may be more suited to certain hills.  Perhaps the Cheviot ewe needs to be made more hardy to stay on the hill for longer.  Increasingly, spring lamb production is becoming the trend but spring lamb production and hill farming do not go together.</p></speech>

With very few exceptions, if farmers put sheep to the hills at all, it is for just six weeks or a month after weaning.  The dry ewes are brought to the hill and are soon brought down.  Basically, the sheep farming system is a lowland sheep farming system.  What we need to do in the longer term is return to proper hill farming, but this involves a big sea change for many farmers.</p></speech>

It is up to the Government to decide how much to devote to the article or whether to switch it on.  It would offer an innovative way for farmers to work together and in partnership, particularly with the collective approaches suggested for commonages and to deal with some of the big issues in Wicklow such as deer management.  The collective approach is recognised as the only way forward in that regard.  It is estimated that 40% of Ireland's deer population is in Wicklow.</p></speech>

All this work started because people such as Mr. Dunne and other members of our board decided we should study the Burren.  We have had much contact with Mr. Michael Davoren in the Burren and Mr. Dunford.  If it had not been for them and their support for us, we probably would not be present today.  There are very strong links.</p><p>  A question was asked about the selling of Wicklow lamb at an earlier stage.  Cheviot sheep owners decided two or three years ago to try to develop a scheme for the sale of Wicklow lamb.  This scheme did not get off the ground because there was a big drop in lamb prices that coincided with its introduction.  However, the scheme is still in the background.</p><p>  A question we have not fully answered is the question of young farmers.  There are 27 members on our board, one of whom is a member of Macra na Feirme who represents quite a large number of young and active farmers in Wicklow.  One of the people most involved in the lamb scheme is a young farmer who lives in the Glencree-Glencullen area.  We still have some young farmers in Wicklow, some of whom are operating on a full-time basis.</p><p>  This report is not just a report produced on behalf of the hill farmers of Wicklow.  It is also very clearly produced on behalf of the Wicklow Uplands Council.  It is important to understand that the council is not just an organisation of farmers.  It represents motorbike users, scramblers, mountaineers, climbers, community groups, etc.  Before the report saw the light of day and before its launch by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, a couple of weeks ago in Glendalough, it had the unanimous support of the entire board of the council.  When it was discussed at council meetings, nobody was really against it.  The reason we are all in favour of it is that we are concerned about protecting and preserving the hills of Wicklow, as implied by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>

A total of 17 early warning notices are also listed for noting by the committee.  I propose that we deal with the Schedule B items first.</p><p>  It is proposed that the proposals listed on Schedule B - COM (2013) 142, COM (2013) 143 and COM (2013) 152, do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is also proposed that the committee note the 17 early warning notices listed on Schedule B.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<b></b><br /><b></b>There are two proposals listed on Schedule A.  COM (2013) 207 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups.  The proposal relates to the corporate governance of large companies.  Its purpose is to increase the relevance, consistency and comparability of non-financial information published by companies across the European Union, the objective being to improve companies' transparency and performance on environmental and social matters and thereby contribute to long-term economic growth and employment.  The Department has indicated that this proposal will have limited application in Ireland and that no subsidiarity issues arise.  However, as it will involve extra reporting obligations on large companies and the Department has yet to formally engage with stakeholders on the issue, it is proposed that the committee engage directly with stakeholders by seeking submissions from interested parties on the proposal via its website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This is an important issue.  We can decide later if we want to proceed further and have a round-table discussion on the proposal.</p><p>  COM (2013) 237 is a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No. 1344/2011 suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on certain agricultural, fishery and industrial products.  On 21 May the committee requested that an advice note be drafted on this proposal which was listed as a Schedule B item.  The proposal relates to a duty suspension scheme operated by the European Union which allows operators in the Union to apply for a suspension of duty on imported raw materials.  Based on the advice note provided and our discussion thereon, it is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome all of our guests to our discussion on the report into which Senator David Cullinane has put a great deal of work in the past few months.  He has carried out many interviews and engaged with many stakeholders, but before we finalise the report, it is important that we have a chance to discuss some of the issues involved with our guests.  We have set aside today to discuss all of the options, suggestions and areas in which we can make improvements.  The committee is anxious to ensure the report will help in pulling together existing reports and information and, apart from adding a critique, add new suggestions and value to them.    </p><p>  I welcome to our first session Mr. Joe Crockett, Kilkenny county manager; Ms Nora Widgre, president, Waterford Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Michael Walsh, Waterford city manager; and Mr. Senan Cooke, Dunhill Community Enterprises.

If members have questions about the rest of the presentation, I can address them.</p><p>  On how the region should perform, in 2010 Kilkenny County Council started to examine how we might develop an economic model for ourselves.  In examining the issue of economic development the key elements to be considered are what the State is trying to do, what its main economic policies are and where the competitive advantages it sees for itself lie at national level.  One then works down through regional economic policy, as identified by Forf&aacute;s which has been the most active agency in dealing with this issue.  It has produced the regional competitiveness agendas, while the council has produced its own economic development strategy which focuses on the issues I mentioned, namely, third level education and research, tourism, agribusiness and so on.  </p><p>  A new regional economic model is being prepared by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We do not know what its shape will be, but there is a need for an alignment between the three levels, namely, national, regional and local.  If there was policy and objectives harmonisation between all of the enterprise agencies involved, there would be a greater focus and better spend by everybody.  That would be very helpful, not only to the south-east region but to all regions.</p> <p> With regard to any policy document we might have, rather than being about policy it is more important that it be about strategy, and real strategy at that.  Instead of being a wish list for everybody in the audience, it would be far more effective if it were limited to high-level strategic objectives that would lead to real change on a multi-annual basis.  For example, in the south east we could focus on key infrastructure that is required and the key sectors for development.  I suggest that a new model for economic development should be aligned and should comprise a unified set of national, regional and local objectives.  It should be strategic and multi-annual, and focus on a relatively small number of key infrastructures and policies that would have an impact over a five or six-year period.    </p><p> The key requirement for the south east is a new type of third level education and research that is based on an applied education model and that focuses on the sectors identified for growth.  Rather than a traditional university, which is focused on academic research and so on, we need an applied university that is closely aligned with cutting-edge objectives of key sectors in the region that are capable of export or indigenous growth.  That is the single most important measure that the Government could implement to help the region.  We need a technological university in the south east that focuses on applied education, particularly research, and that must be aligned with what the growth sectors in that region which could deliver on a national and international basis.  The key research arm of Waterford Institute of Technology is the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG.  The group has been very successful and I want to express my full support for what it does.  An expansion would be beneficial, working with Institute of Technology, Carlow.</p><p> With regard to the potential for a sectoral approach, obviously farming or agri-business is the single most important growth sector not just in the south east but across many other regions.  One of the things we did that was useful - I would suggest this as a case study of how to find new ways to develop - was that, rather than relying on the State agencies to provide the best thinking on growth, we decided it would be better to bring in the chief executives of key companies in the sector one wants to expand.  That is what Kilkenny County Council did.  We asked the chief executives of Glanbia, Dawn Meats, Brett Brothers, Connolly's Red Mills and Oldtown Bakeries, as well as Leader representatives and ourselves at the county council, to set out the high-level objectives that agri-business could deliver, not just for Kilkenny but for the whole region.  The chief executives outlined for us their thoughts and those of their companies when it came to growth.  With that information we could work upwards by talking to others - county councils, farmers, the IFA, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or whoever - about how we can grow and about the key objectives and strategies.  The high-level group identified two strands of growth, one of which was expansion of the milk industry.  As the committee will be aware, the milk quota will be lifted in 2015.  That means there should be growth of between 40% and 60% in milk supply across Ireland, of which most will be in the south-east region, which is at the centre, as it comprises the bulk of the milk field.  We are looking at growth of about 30% in cow numbers, and the rest will be achieved through productivity and other measures.</p><p> This is a significant opportunity for the country because all of this development is for export growth.  If, as a country, we decide to be the world leader in everything related to agri-business, whether we are talking about milk or beef, and to drive the sector as far up the value chain as possible for exports, that is the way to go.  We should back this up with research and development at the new applied university and become the best at everything to do with farming, particularly engineering, technology and industry.  That is my suggested model for growth in this sector, but also in other sectors.  For too long we have relied heavily on IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, good as they are.  Although they are good at what they do, we need to find new models of partnership comprising top-level chief executives in the sectors that we want to expand.</p><p> I have other models for regional tourism and services.  The county council has bought the Smithwicks site in Kilkenny, which offers great potential for growth.  Life sciences are important, and we work with our colleagues in Waterford on strategic water and wastewater facilities.  We need strategic infrastructure such as Waterford port, Waterford airport and a linked hub consisting of Waterford city, Kilkenny city and Wexford.</p><p> Local authorities can establish links with the markets in which we want these sectors to grow.  Kilkenny County Council has been twinned with Suzhou in China, where Glanbia has its overseas operation.  The county council is working on that relationship, and that is a model on which other authorities should focus.  Twinning should be used as means to foster and provide a foundation for export-led growth, however limited.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nora Widger" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800004#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting Waterford Chamber of Commerce to make a presentation to the joint committee.  I was recently appointed President of Waterford Chamber of Commerce and I am joined today by my fellow board member Mr. Jonathan Earl.  Since 1787 the chamber has offered a voice to Waterford business.  At present its membership ranges from the smallest SMEs to multinationals with a base in Waterford.  The chamber of commerce represents a cross-section of commercial life and is committed to working closely with all who champion Waterford.</p><p>  SEEDS is the acronym for the south east economic development strategy, which Senator Cullinane is working on as a rapporteur for the committee.  In a way, seeds are also the topic of my presentation, in which I will speak about what Waterford Chamber of Commerce sees as the seeds of economic recovery for the city and the region.  While I want to take the opportunity to look to a better future and how we might reach it, we cannot ignore the real and serious economic challenge we face, with more than 55,000 people on the live register in the region in May.  It is no coincidence that just 23.1% of people in the south east who have completed their full-time education have a third-level qualification, compared with a national average of 29%.  In short, not enough job opportunities are being created in the region and too few of those out of work have the skills for the available jobs.</p><p>  Having outlined the challenges, I will now strike a more positive note by mentioning the first-class employers that are currently operating in Waterford.  There are more than 30 IDA-supported multinational companies in Waterford city and county, employing well over 5,000 people.  Our success stories include TEVA, Honeywell, Sun Life Financial and Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, which currently employs more than 1,200 people.  We are also very proud of Genzyme, which employs more than 550 people at its Waterford site.  An equally welcome new arrival is Nypro Healthcare.  In the indigenous sector, Eishtec is an outsourced contact centre that was established by three local people who had worked together previously and now employs more than 400 people in Waterford, although as recently as May 2011 it had only nine employees.  Two entrepreneurs who used to work together in a pharmaceutical multinational in Waterford have set up EirGen Pharma, which employs around 80 people.  It is a great example of the spin-off benefits to be gained from building expertise in world-class manufacturing.  In addition, there was announcement last May from a WIT spin-out company called FeedHenry of the creation of an extra 100 jobs and an investment of &euro;7 million, which was also very welcome.</p><p>  Whether we are talking about multinational or indigenous companies, the key for Waterford and the south east is to have operations that are constantly moving up the value chain, so that they are less exposed to relocation to cheaper sites overseas.  We also need to avoid over-reliance on a single employer, as happened with Waterford Crystal.</p><p>  The food sector is also important to Waterford.  Glanbia is investing &euro;150 million in a world-class milk processing facility at Belview.  Also in the agri-business sector, Dawn Meats is creating 65 additional jobs, so agribusiness is a very important sector for Waterford and the south east.  While the unemployment situation in Waterford and the south east is grave, we are certainly not without hope or without the drive and energy to achieve the region's potential.</p> <p>Late last month, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, gave approval for Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow to continue their work towards a merger with a view to being re-designated as technological university of the south east.  The provision of a university in the south east is of tremendous importance and rapid progress towards delivery on this overdue issue is perhaps the highest-impact intervention that could be made to accelerate the region&rsquo;s journey towards economic recovery.  The university will act as a catalyst for increased inward investment but it will also foster emerging enterprises and provide a pool of skilled graduates for those companies with growth potential.  As well as the direct economic impact, there will also be tremendous spin-off effects as Waterford and the south east no longer see the annual brain drain of some of our highest-achieving young people to universities in other regions in what often becomes a permanent relocation as they go on to build their lives in the university cities.</p><p> In addition to university-level education and the related fourth-level research, development and innovation, we also need to see more targeted training interventions to allow those who lose their jobs in traditional factories, shops or call centres or who have been out of the labour market for some time, to get the skills needed for those jobs that are now available.  Similarly, those in low-skilled employment need specific support to position themselves better for roles in the smart economy.</p><p> As Waterford counts down to its 1,100-year celebrations in 2014, the rich history of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest city is captured brilliantly through the three top-class museums in our Viking triangle.  Tourism and hospitality is an important sector for Waterford and the south east.  We have been fortunate to see the House of Waterford Crystal flourish.  This year, an estimated 160,000 visitors will tour the facility with four out of five of those coming from outside of Ireland.</p><p> The infrastructure work completed over the last five years leaves Waterford much more accessible from Dublin with over a &euro;1 billion invested between the M9 motorway and the N25 Waterford city bypass.  However, there are two major infrastructure assets in Waterford that are currently under-used but which offer huge potential for further growth.</p><p> Waterford Airport currently has direct passenger flights operated by Flybe that connect the south east with Birmingham and Manchester as well as onward destinations through those two hubs.  A key priority for the chamber of commerce at the moment is to see the airport sustained and developed further with the resumption of a London service and further investment to copper-fasten its future.  Direct air access to our biggest trading partner is obviously vital.  Waterford Airport supports considerable direct and indirect employment.  A relatively modest investment in a runway extension at the regional airport would allow it to cater for a wider range of aircraft and this is part of the key to attracting new carriers.</p><p> Given our location as the closest port of Ireland to southern Britain and mainland Europe, the port of Waterford at Belview in south County Kilkenny is another key piece of infrastructure located in the south east but serving a much wider area.  The port is of national significance and this was formally recognised in the national ports policy published in March.  The south east is somewhat unusual in that it has two ports of national significance &ndash; Waterford and Rosslare &ndash; and another of regional significance in New Ross.  Our challenge is to ensure that each port develops to its maximum potential and that taken together they deliver the greatest value to the region and the country.  For Ireland Inc. to continue trading successfully globally, it is clear that we need to make more efficient use of our port capacity and reduce the reliance on Dublin port.  If Ireland is to offer competitive shipping services for exporters then we need to make maximum use of all our existing port capacity and not continue to over-centralise in Dublin port.</p><p> As well as addressing that imbalance in a way that benefits all businesses which ship goods internationally, supporting the development of an appropriate suite of shipping services at the south east ports will also allow us to better leverage the massive road infrastructure investment that has already been made.  Having mentioned some of their blue-chip clients in Waterford and conscious that they continue to focus intensively on the south east, I am not about to criticise IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for their work in the city and the wider region.  Rather, I ask that they keep up the good work, maintain the momentum that is beginning to build and also to reach out to the various Waterford stakeholders to ascertain if there is anything additional we can usefully do to support their efforts.  I would be particularly keen to know that we are developing and maintaining a sound strategic land bank and turnkey business premises for investors with the potential to create sustainable employment.  Have we the sites and properties ready to go for the next generation of companies?  If not, we must act now.  Not a single job creation opportunity can be lost for the want of a base location.</p><p> Given the jobs crisis that exists in the south east, Waterford Chamber of Commerce would argue that the region should now qualify for the highest available level of incentives to support investment that leads to sustainable job creation.  Indeed, we would see merit in a special designation of certain locations for development once there was a corresponding commitment to create and sustain employment in growth sectors.</p><p> Along with the more obvious hard infrastructure of roads and third and fourth-level education, the task of attracting additional foreign direct investment and supporting home-grown companies to grow is undoubtedly made easier where there is a vibrant urban core to a region&rsquo;s gateway city.  With disposable incomes in the south east lagging behind the national average and dragging down consumer spending and confidence, this is an acute challenge for Waterford.  Some great work is under way by Waterford City Council and its partners, including the chamber of commerce, to revitalise the city centre.</p><p> In mentioning the city council, I also welcome the decision by Government to give local authorities a stronger and more formalised role in promoting economic development as part of the local government reform programme.  This makes sense as it recognises the unique contribution that local authorities can make in helping to create a business-friendly environment that supports enterprises &ndash; whether this is a craft jeweller starting his or her own market stall or a multinational looking at potential sites for a 500-job manufacturing plant.  Indeed, given that small start-ups have some of the greatest potential to flourish and to put down deep roots in Waterford, I know that the council will continue to support that sector so that one and two-person companies starting out do not flounder for the want of low-cost but high-value support.</p><p> In the wider national context, Waterford Chamber of Commerce endorses the alternative Chambers Ireland ten-point plan for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.  Key taxation initiatives and reforms will also be sought in the chambers of commerce movement&rsquo;s national pre-budget submission.  Taken together, these interventions have the potential to create up to 30,000 new jobs in this sector.  As a country, we need ambition, vision and drive so that working together we can deliver on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s challenge to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.</p><p> I thank the Chairman on behalf of Waterford Chamber of Commerce for inviting us to input to the committee's discussions today.  I wish you and your colleagues, including Senator Cullinane from Waterford, all the best with your work on the south east economic development strategy.  We hope the seeds planted now will bear rich fruit for years to come.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800005#F00300"><p>I will be brief as both Mr. Crockett and Ms Widger have covered a lot of the ground.  Waterford and the south east general are under-performing economically.  Relative to other regions there has been a decline.  In some respects that is not rational because the region has a lot of natural advantages.  As Mr. Crockett outlined, there is fertile land and an agri-industry which is at the forefront nationally and is world class by any standard.  Equally the region is proximate to internal and external markets.  It should not be the case that it is under-performing.  It seems to be a systemic weakness, something that is not right.  I will not over-elaborate on the reasons because there is a multitude of them and the situation is complex.  Some of the reasons include a reliance on traditional industries up to relatively recently.  That transition is now happening and it needs to be given even more energy to bring about a new economy.  There is a little bit of an issue with educational attainment and there is talk of a technological university but the statistics do not lie in that context.  External competition is a catch-all I use but the reality is that the external competition is very near, the two big brothers in Dublin and Cork are now within one and a half hour's journey.  They are pulling at the edges of the region which has a population of 500,000 but the two big beasts are attracting the population on either side of the region.  Internal competition may be over-egged but the region is unique in the country in that it contains four significant urban areas within a 30 mile range which are competing with each other.</p> <p>That is a good thing in some respects, but it sometimes means we are all fighting over the same cake and must be alert to the danger of somebody else coming in and stealing it.  I do not wish to overemphasise that aspect, but it does happen.</p><p> The south east's relatively poor performance in terms of attracting foreign direct investment is a significant challenge.  In the past ten or 15 years, Waterford and the south east have been outperformed by most other regions.  Again, there is probably no simple answer to this problem.  IDA Ireland is applying significant energy to addressing it and there have been several wins recently, which are more than welcome.  In the case of Waterford city specifically, in the 13 years or so since Genzyme opened its facility, there has been nothing in the realm of foreign direct investment where there was not a distinct Waterford connection, either in the form of the expansion of a local enterprise or a personnel connection, for example.</p><p> Another problem we are facing is that branding has been an issue for the region historically.  When one thinks of the west or south west, for instance, a very concise image comes into one's head.  The south east, on the other hand, is lacking a distinctive branding.  That is a challenge for us.  In the case of Waterford itself, as the gateway city, there have been specific issues with branding, whether arising from industrial strife or other issues that fed into it.  We are doing significant work to rectify that.</p><p> I was careful in choosing my wording when I referred to political priority.  If I were to be kind about it, I would say that taking a long-term view, a period of 20 or 30 years perhaps, we did not always have sufficient weight in the scrum of political decision making on the national stage.  That has negatively impacted to some extent over the longer term.</p><p> In terms of actions that can be taken to address these problems, Mr. Crockett has touched on many of them.  Any analysis of recovery for regions and cities as a generality would suggest that collaboration is the key.  In our case, this would involve collaboration not just across individual local authorities but across a whole range of sectors, including the private sector.  That is a challenge we are determined to meet.  We have convened a south-east forum which includes representation by Mr. Crockett, my other colleague managers, the institutes of technology and enterprise agencies.  We are looking to develop that as an action forum which could function as a catalyst for recovery.</p><p> The Cabinet decision to establish a technological university in the south east is extremely welcome.  As Mr. Crockett observed, there must be a close relationship with business, not only in terms of the provision of the academic and professional skills which feed enterprise but also in terms of a research relationship which fits the distinct role and functionality of a technological university.  The provision of technological university status is a psychological game changer in many respects and one that must be delivered as soon as possible.</p><p> Another area where there is no conflict whatsoever in terms of our collective goals is food and tourism.  There is an opportunity in the south east to build a serious tourism proposition around heritage and culture.  Mr. Crockett mentioned agrifood as a particular area of strength.  We have, in addition, a distinctive pharmaceutical and life sciences presence in the region as a whole, as well as significant activity in the area of engineering.  While some aspects of engineering are seen as old school, the reality is that innovations in that sphere are very new school indeed.  Aerospace technology, for example, is represented in the region, and there is activity in the area of technical standards and so on.  There are certainly opportunities in that regard.</p><p> I have already referred to the problems with branding.  The rebranding work is an ongoing effort, with a particular focus on culture and festivals.  We have engaged in several initiatives with Waterford Crystal, the visitor centre being an important aspect of that, as part of a package of rebranding measures for the city.  That rebranding effort is also taking place at the regional level.</p><p> In terms of public sector prioritisation, the question is whether the south east needs help.  We are saying that it does and, moreover, that it deserves a degree of priority at Government level.  In fairness to the Minister, he has personally chaired the action plan on jobs for the south east.  I would like to see that engagement transition into a scenario where leadership would be given at departmental and cross-departmental level.  Going back to the issue of collaboration and joined-up Government, there are very few initiatives that can be delivered by single entities working independently.  A cross-representational approach is usually required.  Such would be a natural transition in this case, but I am not sure it is fair to expect the Minister to lead it on an ongoing basis in the context of the required time commitment.</p><p> We are working to make the local realignments work across the region, in conjunction with the enterprise boards and community development organisations.  We have developed an economic strategy which we hope the Minister will publish in the coming weeks.  We have no agenda other than to obtain the best possible output in economic development terms.  In Waterford city we are seriously engaged in the effort to resource economic development.  We have appointed a dedicated director of services for economic development and we intend, as part of the amalgamation, to resource that role very significantly.  We are also looking to build on external relationships, including the connection with our twin city of Rochester in New York state.  That city is an interesting case in terms of how it has managed the transition of Eastman Kodak from a company which employed 70,000 people less than ten years ago to 7,000 today.  We have much to learn from that engagement.</p><p> In the shorter term we could do with a few wins, and we are working hard with the enterprise agencies and others in that regard.  As I said, the establishment of a technological university is a game changer and we must immediately commit ourselves to its delivery.  It will be a resource for enterprise and for the region as a whole in terms of economic development.  It also offers scope for additional labour activation measures for unemployed people in Waterford and elsewhere in the south east.  Another short-term measure that would be of help would be the provision of enhanced broadband connectivity.  I have mentioned the efforts to improve our foreign direct investment, FDI, performance.  In addition, any assistance in the infrastructure area would be very helpful.  In short, we are seeking to invest very significantly in the regeneration of Waterford city centre, and any support in that regard would be most welcome.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Senan Cooke of Dunhill Community Enterprises to make a statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Senan Cooke" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800006#G00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I will be steering the discussion to community enterprise level, where real changes can be made and the benefits of the new strategy, infrastructure enhancements and all the other improvements at the higher level can impact significantly.  There is, unfortunately, a sense of real helplessness in many communities in the context of high unemployment and forced emigration.  For young people in particular, leaving college and seeking to secure employment is a daunting prospect.  Our population is better educated, more business literate, more well travelled and well networked and more confident than ever before.  However, families, clubs and communities are heavily impacted by unemployment and forced emigration.  People have every incentive to get involved in efforts to improve the situation where the opportunity is available.</p><p>  Community enterprise is often taken to be exactly the same as social enterprise, but there is a difference.  There are different levels of enterprise support, namely, fully-funded employment, partly-funded employment and self-sustaining, profit-making enterprises.  We are interested in the third of those.  I have been a voluntary activist and researcher in enterprise development in the Waterford area since 1993, Dunhill being my local area.  People have come from all over the country to Dunhill to discuss what can be done at grassroots level in communities.</p><p>  Community enterprise is not just social enterprise, which brings up a whole range of problems in terms of a definition, about fully-funded employment, partly funded employment and third level which we are interested in is self-sustaining employment, profit-making enterprises.  research from 1993</p> <p> We have been invited to speak in communities from Kerry to Mayo and from Monaghan to Carlow.  This proposal is a result of all that consultation and research.  There is significant evidence available for anyone who wants to examine it that indicates that this proposal will work.  The proposal is that a programme for economic self-reliance is developed which targets the creation of ten jobs in every community in the region.  We all know that the modest target of ten jobs could be achieved if we mobilised all the resources available in every community, the business people, the farmers, the craftspeople and everyone else being the main resource.  If that is achieved, we know that the community will have identified its own resources, developed a good relationship with the agencies, gained a great deal of confidence, built up a network and will go on to create 20, 30 or 40 jobs in the area.</p><p> We would hope that by empowering people in their own community, those with the biggest stake in the community would get involved, and it would only take one person in any community to start this programme.  It does not need the involvement of many people.  One person who is highly motivated could organise a business mentor group that would mentor individuals within that community to create the jobs.</p><p> We believe this programme would require a south-east enterprise development forum that would mobilise and co-ordinate the resources, pilot a variety of enterprise projects across the five counties for replication across the region, remove barriers to progress, establish a shared learning centre of best practice and projects, and maximise third level engagement directly with communities through joint funding and research.</p><p> We believe this programme would best work if local government agencies could be changed slightly but dramatically from being a support agency structure to a solutions enterprise structure.  The difference between being a solutions enterprise structure and a support agency structure is massive, but not in terms of restructuring.  It is a change of mindset and the introduction of skills.  If we could get State agencies to become solutions agencies, there would be a dramatic engagement by dedicated, committed, highly qualified people living in communities who are watching helplessly their own communities, clubs and families being affected badly by high unemployment and emigration.  This is something that would work and would be seen to work within the community, and instead of helplessness we would have hope.  Instead of standing back, we would have full engagement.  There are hundreds of such examples throughout the country and perhaps even 100 in the south east.  All that is needed is to identify them, establish best practice and get the best from the ones that are working and offer to assist the rest of the communities within the region.</p><p> Following the 1980s, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress 1991-1993 was agreed and from it emerged the Leader partnership and the county enterprise boards structures.  They helped communities to make dramatic improvements across a range of developments from heritage to tourism to social and charitable initiatives.  Those communities that organised themselves under the Leader partnership, the county enterprise boards and the local authorities are now ready to take the next step - which is a much tougher and challenging step but a necessary one - to create enterprises.  A range of community groups in the south east and other regions are ready to take that step.</p><p> We need the Government and the EU to devise a complementary economic stimulus and it need not be in the form of money.  If Leader II or CEB II, as it were - I do not know what is happening regarding the restructuring of local authorities - were brought in, through Government policy, to link up and engage directly with the communities on the ground, that would have a profound effect on the political atmosphere, on gaining respect for political institutions and for the local authority.  All I ask is that the report would recommend that this proposal for community enterprise with the target of creating of ten jobs per community be investigated.  The evidence is there to support it and if the proposal were investigated, it would be acted on straight away.</p></speech>

I will take three groupings of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800007#H00300"><p>I will be as brief as I can, to be helpful.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming here today.  I met some of them already as part of the consultation process and there are some I have not met.</p><p>  Mr. Michael Walsh clearly set out the challenges the south east faces.  Any of the research we carried out into examining the south east economically, and the Forf&aacute;s report was the most recent one, showed that, unfortunately, the region has underperformed in terms of educational attainment, entrepreneurial activity and economic activity generally, and that it has a high level of unemployment.  Equally, there are huge strengths in the region, and Mr. Michael Walsh hit on a key point when he said that there is no good reason the south east is underperforming to the extent that it is.  There is probably a myriad of reasons that is the case.  During my consultations across the region, it struck me that there is huge potential in the region, and if we exploit that and can make things work, we can certainly turn things around.  The key factor here is integration and cohesion at a regional level.</p><p>  I agree with the Kilkenny county manager, Mr. Joe Crockett, that we need to join up policy from national to local level.  That is one of the problems.  We have not had that.  We can all be critical of enterprise agencies in terms of perhaps their perceived failures in the region, but what we need to do is identify the strengths of the region and the key areas, and some of those have been identified, and how we can develop an integrated strategy that is rooted in the needs of the community and, more importantly, in the region, but also that is rooted in the needs of enterprise and industry.  We do not have that to the extent we need it.  We need to do a bit more work in that area, and we need to take that on board in terms of vision and policy.</p><p>  I have a few questions on some issues that arose during the consultations.  One of the criticisms is that the enterprise agencies are not doing enough, and whether that is fair or unfair or that is a perception or reality, that is an opinion.  The IDA has produced its own reports and a breakdown, on a county by county basis, of the number of site visits there have been for each county and region and the number of jobs that have been created and lost.  Unfortunately, during the past four to five years, the south east has not faired all that well.  One of the reasons the IDA offers for this is that while it has a job of work to do to bring jobs to the State, equally it would cite a lack of property solutions as a problem in the region.  Is that the case?  I know that might be different in certain counties.  It seems to be more of a problem in Wexford and there may be other areas.  Is that a problem and, if it is, local authorities have a responsibility also to be part of that solution.</p><p>  Is there merit in the IDA having a regional office in the south east?  How important would that be and would that be something the mangers present and the chamber of commerce would support?</p><p>  Regarding the university issue, we all accept that would be a game changer.  I am very supportive of a technological university.  I know there are people who would have a different view and they make comparisons with Trinity, UCC and UCD, but it comes down to the needs of the community in the region.  I would favour a university that is based on innovation, research and development, creating that critical mass of research and development and fostering creativity.  That is what it is about for the region and we are certainly very strong on that.  I know that Waterford IT will address us later and the Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group, TSSG, is first class in terms of research and development.</p> <p>I could not speak more highly of it.  It has expanded into the Kilkenny area as well.  It is doing significant work that goes unnoticed and, if we can, we must sell what is being done there more.  This is an opportunity for us to do it.  I would see that as an advantage.  If we are going to have a technological university it must be based on the needs of the region and be clearly aligned to industry.  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?</p><p> In terms of research and development capacity, a hub could be created linking in with Clonmel.  There are links with Limerick IT and Wexford and there is a new relationship between Carlow IT and Waterford IT.  What more could be done to ensure we have enough research and development capacity to meet the needs of industry?  In what industries do we not have sufficient research and development capacity?</p><p> Reference was made to two ports &ndash; Rosslare Europort and Waterford Port - by Ms Widger.  Unfortunately, both of them have seen a drop in activity.  Rosslare Europort, which is a roll-on roll-off port, has seen a 30% drop in freight since 2008, which is a considerable number.  The situation in Waterford Port is worse than that.  It has gone from 20% of the national share of lift-on lift-off traffic to 5%.  We must identify the challenges and see what can be done.  A review of ports is currently ongoing.  The situation in Rosslare is unique because of the complication of the relationship with Fishguard.  There was a call for a single independent authority for Rosslare.  I would welcome the views of managers and others on the issue.</p><p> How important is the Belview site?  We have received good news from Glanbia.  Its announcement is positive but there is still considerable potential for the site, with its abundant water supply.  Mr. Crockett referred to that.  What more could we do to exploit the potential of the Belview site?</p><p> My next question relates to the airport and is aimed at everyone.  One could argue whether the airport is in the right location.  However, it is where it is and it is the regional airport.  There is a need to expand the runway to allow for different types of aircraft, which would open up new opportunities for the region.  How important is the airport economically?</p><p> In response to what Mr. Crockett said about agriculture, there is significant potential in the context of Food Harvest 2020.  With the abolition of milk quotas and the expansion in dairy and beef production there will be significant opportunities, and that is one thing on which the south east must focus, because we can benefit enormously.  I referred to the Glanbia announcement.  What supports must be put in place to allow farmers to capitalise on the opportunities?  Mr. Crockett previously mentioned compliance with the EU water framework directive and the nitrates directive, which are important, but farmers will also require practical supports from the banks if they want to expand their businesses.  All such issues will be important and we must plan now.  We can have all the targets we like but if we do not plan for it, it will not happen.  We must do some work in that regard.  What is Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s view?</p><p> With regard to regional tourism, the south west and the west have been very good in terms of marketing and branding.  What more can we do in the south east to provide a regional offering?</p><p> My final point relates to life sciences, which has been mentioned.  We face challenges in terms of the expiry of patents and competition with eastern European countries and Asia.  How relevant is that to the south east?</p><p> I support Mr. Cooke&rsquo;s contribution on community enterprise, which is hugely important.  Co-operatives are another matter we must examine.  I endorse everything he said about the importance of community enterprise.</p></speech>

I welcome the groups, particularly the chamber of commerce witnesses.  I know many of their predecessors.  They have done a great job.  I also know Mr. Crockett.</p><p>  If I want to go to the south east in the morning, what is the labour profile and skills analysis that is available to me?  What qualifications are available within the region if I want to locate a factory or tech centre there in the morning?  What kind of labour force is available to me?</p><p>  Could someone clarify the exact position with regard to the port at Belview?  I gather it is in Kilkenny but it is part of Waterford Port.  It pays rates in Kilkenny.  What is the management structure?  I do not want to get into the row between Waterford and Kilkenny but the chamber might be freer to express a view on the issue.  Is the expansion and promotion of the city of Waterford an issue?  I come from Ballina, from where we used to ship a lot of material from a couple of local industries to Waterford.  We ship a lot less there now as it goes to Dublin.  What is the unique selling point of a port in Waterford when there is the Europort in Rosslare and Dublin Port?  What is the position in terms of the future port strategy?</p><p>  I support the technological university but I am also concerned.  Institutes of technology have served the country well and there is a rush to get rid of them.  It is like moving the car up a model.  Mr. Walsh said he wants to promote the engineering sector.  Is there a danger that in moving to a technological university and all that goes with it, including research and development, we will forget the nuts and bolts of what the IT sector was set up to do?  It is an area we are very much coming back to focus on again in this country.  Perhaps it is a question for the groups that will come later, but what is being done to ensure the traditional engineering focus of institutes of technology will be maintained in the new technological university?</p><p>  I am from the west and we would say we are not getting enough love either.  We hear from every group that comes before the committee and as we travel around the country that all the funding is going to Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Waterford seems to be getting huge exposure this week on Today FM in particular.  Well done on that.  What is different about the south-eastern region?  What can the witnesses say is specifically different about their region and what does it have that another region could not offer to an employer?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for being present today.  I will start with Mr. Joe Crockett.  He spoke about the general issue of harmonisation of national, regional and local policies, which is critical.  I have been thinking about that myself.  Ms Widger gave two specific examples of pieces of infrastructure that need consideration, namely, the airport and the ports.  I will single out the airport.  It is a critical time now for the airport, which is a key piece of infrastructure, and we have been talking about it for a long time.  The manager of the airport, Mr. Graham Doyle, is leaving - which is bad news, in my opinion - to become an assistant secretary in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is significant that he is departing.  There are three options for the airport.  We are talking about &euro;1.25 million for the first and cheapest option.  The second option would cost approximately &euro;7 million.  To bring 737s into Waterford would cost approximately &euro;10 million.  Realistically, we are talking about an extension that would cost approximately &euro;1.25 million, the cost of a three-bedroom semi-detached house in parts of this city a few years ago.  It is not a lot of money.  As far as the Department is concerned, the case is being made, successfully, that it is worth investing in the airport.  The people who have worked there for the past four years have used every penny to try to lay the ground at the airport for additional expansion at the north and south ends of the runway to bring in different kinds of jet aircraft, as Ms Widger outlined, and to connect to London in particular.</p><p>  I will come to what Mr. Crockett said, but we have a national issue in terms of how we look at our budgets and how flexible and adaptable our budgets are generally.  I wish to focus on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for a moment, and examine how money is allocated.  We all have a responsibility - to use the words of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar - to invest in infrastructure and other items that are drivers of growth.  If we are all of the opinion that the airport is a key piece of infrastructure then we must examine the entirety of the transport budget and ask ourselves one question, namely, whether we are prioritising what we should prioritise from the budget.  In that context, the answer is "No".  I am having a discussion on the matter with the Minister currently.</p> <p> In terms of the way it works, there is a capital budget for roads, a capital budget for rail and a capital budget for smarter travel.  There are projects such as the Greenway projects throughout the country.  When it comes to the local authorities, they have some discretion to use the money allocated to them for a capital project, such as the airport, but it is not entirely within their "ask" responsibility to do that.  My point is that budgets within the Department are not flexible enough.  If we are all in agreement that this is a key piece of infrastructure, and it does not involve a lot of money, why has it not been done?  </p><p> Mr. Walsh said he did not want to be political but in the past ten years, and with respect to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleague on my right, the decline of those two key pieces of infrastructure started when there was a Cabinet member in Waterford, and everybody in Waterford will acknowledge that.  The decline of the port and the airport started while that was the case, but we are where we are.  </p><p> In terms of what we need to do, the country managers are present.  Picking up on what Mr. Crockett said with regard to the harmonisation of the regional, the national and the local, we have to have an urgent discussion within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on what we believe are the key pieces of infrastructure and what needs to be funded.  That might mean examining the budgets for roads and smarter travel and deciding that we may not need all of that.  It may not be wise for us to continue spending millions of euro on something like smarter travel when a vital piece of infrastructure for the south east is not being funded sufficiently, and it does not involve a lot of money.  We have these meetings all the time but it is key that we deal with a specific area and start thinking about how to get around a problem that has existed for a long time.  If we do not do that, we will be having this discussion five years from now.  In a way that answers Deputy Calleary's question about the way we spend the money.  The question is the way we should be spending money in the different regions.</p><p> I thank Senator Cullinane for his work on putting all of this together.  It is valuable.  I hope we can get something out of it, but that is the main question I wanted to pose.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Cullinane, as rapporteur, for this report.  I look forward to its publication because it will be an important document in terms of how we identify where we want to go in the south east region.</p><p>  I grew up in Waterford, in the south east region, and I agree that we have fundamental flaws in the structure of the region.  Whether they are infrastructural, societal or governmental we are very much on the hind foot, so to speak.  It was once a strong manufacturing region that depended on traditional industry, as the manager said, but we now face new challenges, and Government recognises that.  What concerns me most, however, is the lack of coherence within the region.  As a region we are not competing with other regions.  That has been the case for many years but it is explicit now with the challenges we face.</p><p>  As policy makers and as politicians we must take into account what the witnesses have come here today to say to us.  We know much of it already but we must ask ourselves how we can best achieve what we set out to achieve.  I agree with Mr. Crockett that the first thing we need is a coherent regional strategy that identifies growth areas into which we can put our resources, as Deputy Deasy said, prioritise our budgets, prioritise our policies and go for it.  Unfortunately, the south east region has been fragmented heretofore.  We have a good deal of work to do.  That is even in recent debates whether on the medical side, industry or education in that segments within our own region are pulling it apart.  That is the way I see it.  Until we come together as a region and adopt a coherent regional strategy, we will not make the progress we need to make.  When we identify that strategy and adopt those objectives, we must identify the priorities and the drivers.  It is then up to all of us, as stakeholders in the region, to put in the resources that are required.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Calleary, I know the west has suffered in the past but it is not suffering as badly as the south east region is currently, especially Waterford city, which is on its knees economically.  It needs help, and I ask him to open his eyes and ears to what the people are saying here today.  </p><p>  My question is to both managers.  How best do they believe we can achieve that regional coherence from a local authority and service level?  How can Government, and we as policy makers, support that?</p><p>  I address my remarks to Mr. Senan Cooke.  The bottom up proposal of enterprise in communities is very important.  I come from a family that has created 15 jobs in our community.  I can tell the witnesses it has taken a generation of hard work to create those jobs, with only some support in the latter years.  It is a huge challenge to create jobs in small communities but it is not a challenge we should give up on.  We must motivate our citizens, our local authorities and our policy makers to look again to communities where there is real potential, and small jobs is where we will make the difference.  I fully support Mr. Cooke's proposal and I hope this committee will examine more closely the bottom up approach because small micro-enterprises growing over generations will be more sustainable and viable in the longer term.  I hope we will see progress on that front.</p></speech>

I was a member of Kilkenny County Council when we adopted the economic strategy in 2010.  I welcome Mr. Senan Cooke because I believe his initiative in the communities is extremely important, and not just in terms of job creation.  We continually talk about creating jobs but it is important to keep what is already in place to ensure we do not slide under that critical element where there is no road back.  I support Mr. Cooke in all of that.</p><p>  My question is to Mr. Crockett.  I have had this discussion with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, after the TalkTalk episode in Waterford where I put forward the notion that we can let IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland do what they were set up to do because they are the icing on the cake but we must be looking at our indigenous industries in the south east region.  Mr. Crockett mentioned some of them but I want to talk about the Carlow end where we have an excellent company called Keenan's.  </p><p>  A down side of what happened in the region was the loss of the sugar industry.  We will have a presentation on that later but even the dogs in the street knew that was the worst possible idea, and we have regretted it ever since.  It was a very large employer, and not just of the farmers who were growing the crop.  The road haulage industry was involved also.  Everybody benefited from it, even down to the local newspaper shop.  That was a retrograde step.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Crockett's outlook that we need to harmonise from the top down.  When he brought all his chief executives officers together what barriers, if any, did they say there were to doing business in Ireland?  What do we need to do, as public representatives, to break down those barriers if any exist?</p></speech>

I have just one question and it relates to the airport.  Obviously, having the longer airport runway means that planes with jet engines can land, which opens up opportunities.  Are there any discussions on the possibility that if this were to happen particular airlines would be willing to consider opening up routes in Waterford?</p><p>  I want to keep this conversation real.  I am a Dublin based Deputy and the reality, in terms of foreign direct investment, is that when the executives of companies like Google, PayPal and their brother and sister companies come to this country they do not want to travel any further than about an hour when they got off a transatlantic flight to go to their company.</p> <p>This point is something of an elephant in the room.  While this may open up something, from a practical point of view and in particular with regard to foreign direct investment, not many companies - and transatlantic companies in particular - will be willing to consider flying to London and then on to Waterford.  There are issues in this regard, and I would be doing the witnesses a disfavour were I not to make this point.  However, Deputy Ann Phelan made a good point that one strength Waterford will have will be in its indigenous industries, in particular given the changes to the milk quota regime and so on from 2014 onwards.  However, I seek an answer to that question on the runway and, were this to happen, the intention of any airline in this regard.</p></speech>

However, before turning to the answers for this session, I remind members we are running a little late.  I apologise again to the presenters for the next two sessions but we are slightly behind.  I suppose the first session was going to take some time just to set the scene, but I ask the witnesses to be brief in their answers.  They may forward additional written information or add it to the report being drawn up by Senator Cullinane.  However, many questions have been asked and I acknowledge they cannot respond within a minute either.  Many areas have been covered, some of which have touched on issues for the second session on the third level sector.  Consequently, the witnesses may leave some of those questions if they do not wish to deal with them during this session.  In keeping the same order as the presentations were made, I invite Mr. Joe Crockett to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Crockett" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800010#L00300"><p>I thank members for their questions.  I will try to go through them as briefly as possible.  With the permission of the Chairman, I will leave the Waterford Airport questions to my colleague, Mr. Michael Walsh.  While we both are on the Waterford Airport board, I would be most grateful were Mike to deal with that.</p><p>  Like the other members, I thank Senator Cullinane for his work as rapporteur in highlighting the issues.  He asked a number of questions and I agree with all the points he and all the other speakers made on the need for an integrated strategy, which for me is critical.</p><p>  On the question of property and property solutions, it is the case at present that for any place in which the Celtic tiger had been roaring, the property boom took place and there are leftover office buildings, there are particular commercial advantages to taking up such buildings at present because they can be let at such a low rent.  In the case of any city or place that does not have major office facilities in place, it is not possible to compete with the very low prices that are available in locations such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and this is a difficulty.</p><p>  In respect of other property solutions, it is the case that I suspect there is plenty of zoned land around the region.  As to whether there is plenty of serviced land and with regard to the supply that is needed, that is another question.  One thing we did collectively with regard to, for instance, Belview as a strategic site was to state it did have the strategic resource of having a block of land, a huge supply of water, a huge wastewater treatment capacity, a port and the railway right on the dockside.  This is a strategic advantage which, for example, Cork does not have and is one reason the Port of Cork was refused permission to expand.  Consequently, we have strategic advantage and it is a case of following through on the strategic advantage that exists.</p><p>  On the question Senator Cullinane asked regarding what steps could be taken to support the education sector, I suggest there are two key steps.  The first obviously pertains to the follow-through on the technological university.  In addition, I refer to the allocation of research funding by bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland.  If, for example, the State recognises the south east is to grow in areas such as agriculture and agribusiness and the related technology as well as in areas such as medical devices or the life sciences, then the resources must travel with it.  If one is to be serious about economic development, there must be a fair sharing out around proven leaders such as Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow that in turn link and work collaboratively with others.</p><p>  For example, Deputy Calleary asked what is the specific thing the south east does better than everyone else, and that thing is food and agribusiness.  This is something on which the south east leads the world.  We will be supplying into Europe and into China and our companies such as Glanbia, Keenan or Dawn Meats supply the world.  Therefore, it is my contention that we should do everything we possibly can to be world leaders in everything to do with agribusiness, agribusiness development and support, research and development, technology and so on.  The same point applies in respect of the other big area we have, which is medical devices.</p><p>  Again, every region has its strengths.  In the case of the west or the mid-west, it may be aviation, for example, or in the case of Dublin, it might be financing.  However, every place has its strengths and there will be some overlaps, such as can happen in respect of tourism.  In the whole, however, everyone will contribute.  For example, because the west has a very good tourism offering, as does the south east with regard to, for example, Kilkenny or the Viking past in Waterford, we can all contribute nationally to this.  I hope I have dealt with the three principal points made by Senator Cullinane.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary also raised questions on Belview and on the skill set.  The Forf&aacute;s regional competitiveness agenda report sets out the full data he sought and we can supply that to him, if he wishes.  However, the key thing to note about the region is that it has a population of approximately 500,000, which is a viable economic market in its own right.  Therefore, from my point of view, the south east as it currently stands should have its own subregional development.  I note the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has proposed that there be three super regions but that within this, there should be room for subregional development.  On the question of Belview, in my view it is a strategic national asset as well as being a regional asset and an asset for Kilkenny and Waterford.  We work collaboratively to make that what it is today.  Many members have mentioned that Glanbia has gone into that site and there is no doubt in my view that once Glanbia has put in its &euro;160 million worth of investment, others will follow.  Consequently, I am interested in getting ready for the next wave of development.</p><p>  Another point to bear in mind in respect of the Harvest 2020 proposals is that agricultural development will not stop at 2020.  This was one of the surprises to me.  It will continue to grow post 2020, as there still is a lot of capacity post 2020 for agriculture and agriproducts, and this is something we must bear in mind as we think about potential and where we should put our research and development money.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy raised the specific question of critical infrastructure priorities, and I agree completely with his assessment on the need for the State and the region to agree on the key infrastructure drivers we must have to drive strategic economic growth.  For me, the airport is one of the elements of strategic infrastructure, as is the port.  In place-making terms, the city of Waterford and the two hubs of Wexford and Kilkenny are equally important economic considerations that we must develop because place-making in its own right is a key requirement for economic development.  In respect of foreign direct investment or indigenous development, it is known that a place must have all the services and must be attractive.  It must appeal to tourists and citizens and to investors at national, regional, international and local levels.  These are the things we must bear in mind.  I take what Deputy Deasy said about the need for airport expansion and I agree with him completely.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey raised the question of the lack of regional coherence and asked what is the best regional model.  My hope for the reform programme or the next level of announcement from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or from the Government is a new model of regional economic development that aligns objectives and focuses on the new energies that might be possible by bringing in the cutting-edge thinking of the chief executive officers in the key sectors and which sets out high level strategies on which each region and subregion must agree, whether it pertains to the port and the airport or Waterford city and the hubs, as well as one's key sectors.  This for me is the way ahead and I really hope this is what will emerge next.  Consequently, I agree completely with Deputy Coffey's view on the need for a new model of regional development that overcomes the current levels of disparity that exist.</p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked what barriers the chief executive officers identified in the discussion.  The key points to emerge from those discussions were the need for closer alignment with the State sector in respect of regulatory issues, specifically on the water framework directive and on the nitrates directive, and to come up with new solutions to overcome the potential business risks these two issues present,  Clearly, we must hold the nitrates derogation we have at present.</p> <p>We have to comply with the water framework directive, not alone as a regulatory requirement but also as a contractual requirement for major international buyers.  If one examines the contracts for major bulk-buying for Dawn Meats, Glanbia or anybody else, the contract might be the thickness of two or three telephone directories approximately one third of which will be on environment requirements.  Therefore, there is a need for a fundamental shift in our understanding of water and the ownership of water to ensure high performance and compliance with the water framework directive.</p><p> On the food side, the CEOs raised the offer of the major companies being able to support SMEs in that sector.  Glanbia, to give the company its due, set out a strategy for export growth for 12 to 14 small food companies across the region and it is a model that other major companies could adopt.  I would commend Glanbia for its support for this development.  Those were the two particular matters identified.</p><p> Deputy Lyons raised the question of the airline and the predominance of the great economic powerhouse of Dublin, plus all of its considerable critical mass in labour force, services and infrastructure, including the airport.  If, however, one is serious about regional economic development for a region that is experiencing difficulty, one must look at the services such as key infrastructure, such as airport, port, cities and technological universities, to ensure there is a platform for growth.</p></speech>

In particular, on Deputy Calleary's question on national ports, the national ports policy formally recognised that Waterford and Rosslare are ports of national significance.  He asked about competitive advantage.  The competitive advantage of Waterford and Rosslare is their proximity to the south of England and all that offers for economic development for us in the south east, and also mainland Europe.</p><p>  On the connectivity issue, Waterford port is the only port which has direct rail connectivity for low-load container traffic to lift on and lift off.  It is vital that the Government pursues a roadmap for Waterford port to give it new impetus and energy to develop to its potential, and Rosslare likewise.  During the boom, Dublin Port grew as a result of all of the imports coming into the country and the ancillary services - distribution centres - that were built up closely associated with it.  Waterford and Rosslare, and the south east ports, need the Government, as part of the national ports policy, to formally adopt a new roadmap for the south east ports.</p><p>  On the airport, I am pleased to hear Deputy Deasy refer to &euro;1.25 million, which seems like a small sum of money to get an extended runway in Waterford airport, which is vital for its future and survival.</p><p>  With regard to the ongoing talks with various agencies, I will let Mr. Michael Walsh, Waterford city manager, take that up.  He sits on the board there.  On connectivity to the rest of Ireland, the M9 now offers fast access from Dublin to Waterford from the point of view of FDI companies investing in Waterford.  Moving on to the FDI issue,-----</p></speech>

Birmingham is a hub to the rest of the world and if Waterford airport has the connectivity to Birmingham, that, in turn, delivers connectivity to the rest of the world.</p><p>  Returning to the FDI question, it is important that there is a key location in Waterford and in the south east for IDA Ireland-based investment companies.  There are sites in Waterford which may not be readily suitable for new FDI companies.  Going back to Mr. Michael Walsh's point about new companies coming in, we have not seen one for quite a while.  I believe that a regional director and regional presence from IDA Ireland is needed now in Waterford.</p><p>  Finally, on indigenous businesses, the ten-point chambers' plan contains many ideas on incentives for indigenous companies regarding tax and creating employment.  That is certainly something of merit that can be looked at.</p></speech>

The regional coherence issue is one.  The technological university can be a significant platform for building that.  Equally, it is about concentrating on the matters from which there are outputs and results.  Tourism and the agri-sector, as Mr. Crockett stated, are two areas, along with the technological university, that can give us a real focus at a regional level and start to deliver that coherence which, perhaps, has not been here heretofore.</p><p>  I agree with Ms Widger in the context of an IDA Ireland regional director.  Certainly, at a perception level, the relationship between performance in the FDI area and the non-presence of an IDA Ireland director is strongly reinforced across the south east region.</p><p>  There is continuing dialogue with the airlines.  There is an issue in the context of the existing runway length.  A very moderate investment will significantly increase the potential operators there.  Certainly, there are operators interested.  Getting that signed up is akin to the chicken and the egg.  If one had the limited extension, I would be fairly satisfied one could deliver the airlines.  We already have Flybe.  We certainly have a viable Luton route.  We are not seeking to build an international airport to compete with the likes of Dublin, Cork and Shannon but we are seeking a niche regional airport that can give direct connectivity.  It is based also on tourism and building our tourism proposition overall.  The simple reality, for example, on that previous Luton route was that well over 50% of the traffic was inbound in the context of tourism, targeting a relatively niche element of the London market and helping to pull through localised marketing, in other words, pulling additional tourists into Ireland Inc. rather than merely robbing it from any place else.  That point needs to be made.</p><p>  On the basic point about FDI in terms of the hour for the airport and otherwise, it is one of the players in the game in our experience.  With many bigger players, competitiveness is their key issue.  We lost a good deal of jobs in Waterford.  If we are honest about it, Ireland Inc., through the Celtic tiger years, got slightly uncompetitive in many contexts and we certainly saw manifestations of that.  There has been a phenomenal transition, in Waterford and right across the south-east region, in terms of living costs, wage costs and a host of areas that are bringing us significantly back into that piece.  Certainly, be it the likes of Bausch + Lomb or Teva Pharmaceuticals, in terms of the skill-sets that are available, they have no difficulty in attracting staff.  The reality is that much of the population in the south east developed their skills elsewhere.  We are tending to lose them.  The challenge is to bring them back.  Once we do, one of the great stories we must tell is that we retain better than any other region.  That, of course, is because of the good weather and the overall living environment.</p></speech>

One is that Dunhill completed two Interreg projects recently.  One of them was Interreg Action, which was on social enterprise.  It was to identify, develop and promote social enterprise.  We found that there were 218 social enterprises in County Waterford and we suspect there are approximately 300.  All of them are central to rural communities, to urban communities and especially to isolated communities.  The main recommendation from it was that we develop a south east social enterprise brokerage and that we could do the same in every county in the south east, which would amount to over 1,000 or maybe 2,000.  We believe that when people would see the result of the audit they would suddenly realise that these were crucial to maintaining the social and economic fabric of communities.</p><p>  The second recommendation concerned Interreg HERCULES, which was about tourism's sense of place.</p> <p>The main recommendation that came from that was that we could, through collaboration, set up a 12-month tourism season in County Waterford and the rest of the south east.  It was clear that if we could do it, additional jobs could be created.  If we acted on this immediately, jobs could be created.  Even if only a small number of jobs were created, it would be a signal that jobs would be created from the bottom up.  It would mean so much to the people involved and their communities.</p></speech>

I will give a brief overview of IT Carlow and its current position.  I will then hand over to Mr. Brian Ogilvie, who will discuss the enterprise development aspects of what we do in the institute.  I will then outline some of the challenges and opportunities we face.</p><p>  The institute is committed to research and enterprise-related activities.  We will discuss some of these as we make our presentation.  In common with the other institutes of technology, IT Carlow is a little over 40 years old.  We intend to maintain our technology and technician-based training at levels 6 and 7 on the national framework.  Jointly, the institutes have committed to this.  We work right up to PhD level.  While I will not speak for Waterford Institute of technology, I consider both institutions to be university-level institutions.  IT Carlow delivers programmes in three counties, namely, Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow.  We also have a very strong initiative with the Defence Forces, in particular, and the Irish Aviation Authority.  We have strength in the areas of aviation and aircraft and aerospace engineering.</p><p>  We deliver 82 programmes, from bio-environmental sciences through to engineering, ICT, business and accounting.  We ask ourselves from where demand is coming.  We need to examine what our graduates are doing and the types of companies to which they are adding value.  We have a very strong humanities department and are providing courses in youth and community development.  This is adding to the social fabric of the region.</p><p>  In addition to facilitating Masters degrees by research, particularly in biotechnology, software engineering and electronics engineering, we have taught programmes, such as an MBA and MSc in IT management.  There are other programmes listed in the documentation we have provided.</p><p>  One challenge we face, which is partly good, is filling our postgraduate places for research and taught programmes, particularly in the areas of ICT and biotechnology.  Our final-year honours degree graduates are successfully gaining employment, including quite well-paid employment, in the region and beyond.  This is a very positive sign.  As a consequence, our business graduates, particularly accounting graduates, are also finding employment relatively quickly after graduation owing to the upturn in export-led business.  Obviously, there is a need for graduates with business skills.</p><p>  One of the most important issues for us, which will require much of the energy of all our staff over the next couple of years, is the development of the technological university.  I assume there will be questions on this.  Between February 2012, when the landscape document was issued by the HEA, and 31 July, when the joint submission was made by the south-east institutes of technology, much work was done on developing linkages and collaboration between the two colleges.  This came to a halt while the submissions were being reviewed.  It is only in the past couple of weeks that the Minister has issued recommendations and made a decision.  The work that will be done on stage 2 of the application will be an important part of the activities of our college in the next six to nine months.  I hope that, from there, we will proceed to stage 4 and eventual redesignation as a technological university.</p> <p>We are here to talk about our RDI activities and the ways we develop entrepreneurship.  People in the room will be familiar with Maslow and his psychological model.  He said that when a country was trying to build and develop, it did not need 100 philosophers, it needed 100 entrepreneurs.  Much of what we have been doing in Carlow in recent years is developing our infrastructure to support business ideas through technology transfer, protection of intellectual property and the development of fully commercial organisations which provide jobs.  Mr. Ogilvie will talk the committee through the model we use in the college.</p></speech>

We try to utilise the resources, infrastructure and research expertise of the institute to build entities which can move through technology transfer processes into industry.  We work with entrepreneurs and start-up companies.  We recognise the continuing need to enhance and expand business liaison, regional involvement and commercialisation activities as an essential part of the overall strategy of the institute.</p><p>  Our enterprise development framework looks at developing spin-in companies which come from outside the institute and spin-out companies which develop out of research activities within the college.  There is a diagram before the committee.  It shows in green the potential funding areas from which we can source finance to allow these activities to happen.  In red are shown the training programmes and support structures which allow companies to develop.  These are located in specialised buildings which are focused solely on enterprise development.  Projects emerge from a variety of finance and funding sources, including INTERREG.  We have operated a WISE project on sustainable companies in the engineering sector.  That project has been completed for about 12 months.  We are using Enterprise Ireland's funding structure, including innovation vouchers, to work with small and medium enterprises to develop a sense of innovation and provide them with a taste of the research expertise we have at the IT.</p><p>  We have run the enterprise platform programme for seven years.  We bring potential entrepreneurs to the institute to develop knowledge-based, export-focused companies.  The end goal is to develop high potential start-up units.  The new structure of the enterprise platform programmes consists of the new frontiers programme from Enterprise Ireland, which is in its second year.  It is the second year we have run it in collaboration with Waterford Institute of Technology.  Another programme we have just launched is called Inspire, which stands for initiating pathways for researchers, entrepreneurs and SMEs.  The idea behind the programme is to get SMEs involved in innovation and recognise the importance of research, development and the exploration of new avenues to build new business platforms into their companies.</p><p>  New infrastructure at IT Carlow includes a research, development and innovation building which is under construction.  It will be ready for occupation in January 2014.  We will consolidate all our research groups in the building.  At IT Carlow we have what we call COREs which are centres of research and enterprise.  These represent concentrated areas of expertise in specific fields, including industrial design, security, environmental sciences and computer gaming.  By consolidating these research groups with incubation and start-up companies in one building we hope to add to the enterprise development structure at the institute.</p></speech>

We deliver programmes at all of these levels through our lifelong learning centre which focuses on flexible learning, continuing education and employee development.  Depending on whose figures one looks at, the institute has the highest or second highest proportion of learners who come through the lifelong learning centre model.  We are approaching a figure of 30% of learners coming through that mode.  We work with local companies to identify customised programmes, as well as our normal degree programmes.  The training from levels six to nine is accredited.  Springboard is an important part of what we have done in labour market activation measures in the past couple of years.  We have had some good outcomes since the programme started.  The results from the next round of Springboard programmes are being announced on Friday.  We are very optimistic for a positive outcome and that we can start to engage with the employee development needs of clients.</p><p>  We have opportunities, as well as challenges.  One of the opportunities is to harness our teaching and research to link with specific economic objectives within the region to better match education provision with industry needs.  Part of this depends on greater engagement with industry and part of it involves examining our internal processes.  Some of us may have sons and daughters concluding their leaving certificate studies.  They will enter college on a three, four or five year programme in September.  We are committed to delivering these programmes, irrespective of needs and changes to policy.  There is a commitment to learners once they embark on a programme.  The speed of change is affected by this, as one cannot change midstream.  Another opportunity involves knowledge creation through research and technology transfer.  We are engaging in that process in our fourth year undergraduate programmes and across our masters level research to identify where there are opportunities.</p><p>  The big challenge is the integration of local, regional and national policy to provide for a level of joined-up thinking in which we can all engage.  HEIs require better engagement and inclusion within regional development action plans to match education and industry needs.  Part of this involves the development of a better framework for engagement, regional development and understanding.  We are currently working on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Rooney" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800013#O00400"><p>I work in the adult education guidance service of County Carlow VEC which is changing its name to Kilkenny-Carlow ETB.  I am here to address facilitating employment opportunities in the south east.</p><p>  There are 40 adult education guidance services nationally.  As set out in the operational guidelines from the Department of Education and Skills, we offer a guidance service to adults which includes impartial adult education information, one-to-one guidance and group guidance to help people to make informed educational, career and life choices.  There are offices in Carlow, Kilkenny and Dungarvan, while outreach work takes place in rural towns, including Castlecomber, Callan, Wexford town, Waterford city and various other locations.  My service has three staff members and 2,000 beneficiaries come through our doors annually.  Last year we had 512 sit-down, one-to-one appointments, met 643 people in groups and fielded 921 general public inquiries.  Our service is provided for adults and young people aged 16 years and over with low or no formal qualifications and low literacy levels.</p> <p> The Government's activation schemes have identified priority groups with whom we can work, including in particular the long-term unemployed and the under employed.  People who are working part-time but could benefit from full-time employment or better opportunities for employment and training form a significant part of our work.  We also meet people in the workplace who have basic skill needs and education and training boards are important in providing for such individuals.  We also deal with people aged 16 years or older and those in adult literacy and community education programmes.</p><p> I will now speak about the challenges for the south east from an adult education guidance perspective.  I am sure members have studied the Forf&aacute;s south east region employment plan, Spotlight on the South East, which was published in 2011.  Compared to the national average, the south east region has a higher concentration of people with limited educational attainment in both the labour force and the unemployed cohort.  The fall off in opportunities in construction and traditional manufacturing has had a particularly hard impact on certain occupational groups in crafts and production operatives.  That trade and technical training gap has not been filled.  In 2008, our service dealt with 80 adults who applied for third level courses through the CAO.  That is a higher number than in any subsequent year.  These are individuals who recognise that prospects in construction are limited and hope to find new career opportunities.  The Forf&aacute;s report argues that a focus on activation measures, career advice and progression pathways for the unemployed is needed, including upskilling with accredited qualifications.  It is a huge step for our adult clients to return to education.  If someone has been out of education for 20 years, he or she probably has a negative attitude towards education.</p><p> Reintroduction into employment is a slow and steady process for someone who has been unemployed for years.  It takes time to rebuild confidence and self-belief but nothing succeeds like success.  We begin with short courses aimed at building confidence and re-familiarising clients with routine and challenge.  Much of our work involves educating unemployed clients who may come from a family background of long-term unemployment.  How can one progress and achieve in the education system when there is no family history of formal education?  We set out short, medium and long-term goals for clients and regard any academic success as positive, be it FETAC level 3, 4 or 5.  If I got &euro;5 every time a client told me he or she had hands-on experience but lacked the paperwork to prove it, I would be a rich man.  We need to find ways of incentivising learners and unemployed clients who have extensive experience to return to education and the workforce.  For an unemployed person returning to education, there is a big gap between certifications and qualifications.  </p><p> In regard to the policy challenges, many of our clients are not aware of the opportunities available to them.  The Forf&aacute;s reports are not filtering down to the general populace and clients may have limited awareness of science, technology or enterprise.  They need to be shown how to avail of such opportunities through training.  There is a specific need for clients aged between 40 years and 50 years to be given confidence boosters through, for example, exemptions from certain modules in recognition of prior learning and experience.  Compared to countries like Germany and Holland, there is limited recognition in Ireland of prior experience.  This is one way of inviting clients who have extensive hands-on experience back into the workforce and giving them a leg up.  We could recognise some of their informal experience while also persuading them to achieve formal certifications in other areas.  Early school leavers require basic skill acquisition tools and to learn how to learn.  There is a gap between unemployment and certain high technology positions but it is often perceived as much wider than is actually the case.  Once clients have the right attitude they can benefit from education.  In many cases, it is lack of affirmation and self-belief rather than lack of ability that discourages adults from returning to education.  Support and encouragement from adult guidance services and others is especially important when clients begin the process of developing their skills.  As they persevere in education and develop independence and confidence in their skills and abilities, they no longer require the same level of support.  They can move up the national framework of qualifications and gain unemployment while also contributing more to their local communities.</p><p> Our clients tend to have developed their skills on the job but they lack paperwork.  Many of them have only partially completed apprentices or college degree courses.  They may have left education to take up jobs during the boom period.  Recognition of prior learning would be of great benefit in terms of bringing them back into education.  Programmes should be designed to build confidence and reintroduce capable people to the workforce.  For example, Waterford Institute of Technology's access programme, which runs between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. a couple of nights per week, is very beneficial in helping our clients to learn how to learn and build confidence.  Courses should be provided on a flexible basis, particularly during evening hours.  At present clients must finance themselves on many of the lifelong learning courses.  Under employed people in particular need educational opportunities in the evenings.  Springboard is going some way towards meeting that need by providing classes during the evenings.  Many under employed people are afraid to take up educational opportunities because they think they will be prevented from taking up full-time job opportunities.  It is a catch-22.  If the courses were provided free of charge during evenings, they could take up employment opportunities while also reskilling.</p><p> The Indecon report on JobBridge contained several interesting observations from the adult education perspective.  The report noted: "An issue for the scheme concerns whether this group represents individuals who are most at risk of extended unemployment."  Even though the highest unemployment levels in Ireland are among people in the adult and further education sector, JobBridge caters mainly for graduates.  Why does it not cater for people in further education or those who want to return to education or employment after being out of both for a long time?  The question also arises as to whether JobBridge should focus more closely on assisting those who have experienced long-term unemployment.  It ignores the long-term unemployed even though they are a significant percentage of the overall number of unemployed.</p> <p>That might be something to examine.</p><p> Other impacts highlighted by participants included that the scheme helped to boost their self-confidence, identify job opportunities suited to their abilities and kept participants close to the jobs market.  That is huge.  Once one is out of employment for a couple of years it is very difficult to get back into the frame of mind and the routine one needs to work in a job.  Another impact was that it helped participants to establish contacts and networks.  We constantly hear from our clients that there is a contact network surrounding being in employment.  If one is outside that employment framework, as one could call it, one is not meeting or networking with people who are working; therefore, one does not know what is out there.  One is out of the loop, so to speak.  Internships for adults who are non-graduates would give them the opportunity to be closer to the workforce and the opportunities to stay in the loop.</p><p> I will refer to a few more issues.  One is provision of workplace relevant skills.  There is a huge need for greater co-operation between private industry and education.  That is obvious to me in my job and I have looked at the situation in Germany and other countries.  The F&Aacute;S equivalent in Germany, for example, is two thirds supported by the private sector.  There is huge co-operation between private and public bodies in providing employment, but that does not appear to happen here.  There is a huge gap and there does not appear to be a huge conversation between employment and education providers at any level, whereby they can talk to each other, share opportunities with each other to look at what is coming down the track and build on what each has and needs.  A bottom-up approach is needed in course provision to match employer needs with educational opportunities.  There is no point in putting on countless courses if there is no possibility of getting a job from them.  A top-down approach where the Government encourages increased co-operation between employers and education and training bodies is needed.  Public private partnership is used all the time to build bridges and motorways.  Why is it not used more to facilitate employment opportunities?  </p><p> As regards the Forf&aacute;s recommendations, two thirds of the dual system of trade education in Germany is financed by the private sector.  There is far greater public private co-operation.  The report also highlights the German model of establishing career paths.  For example, there are 650 types of apprenticeship in Germany, while there are fewer than 100 here.  One undertakes an apprenticeship to become an ice cream maker.  The apprenticeship framework appears to have fallen away and I hope the new SOLAS will replace it.</p><p> There also appears to be an over-reliance on generic transferable skills.  While important, there are very few secretarial business studies opportunities available for people who have done a FETAC 5 course; therefore, specialist industry-related upskilling must become more widely available.  An example is plastic injection moulding positions which still remain unfilled.  These types of specific apprenticeship trade-related skills must be catered for, but it does not appear to be happening to a huge extent.</p><p> To refer to some solutions, one is attracting employees affected by lack of knowledge of career opportunities and negative perceptions of manufacturing.  The "Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020" Forf&aacute;s report highlighted this.  Again, there is a lack of clarity about defining career paths and a lifelong career path whereby one can move from one employment opportunity to another and build one's career.  The Germans have the dual system and the United States has stackable credentials, whereby one can build on the skills and qualifications one already has and build one's career as one proceeds.  That type of stackable credential, recognition of prior learning and building on formal and informal learning does not appear to happen in this country.</p><p> On the next solution, learning pathways to meet occupational standards and provide progressive routes, clients of our service in the past have found themselves at dead ends.  One could be qualified as a carpenter or a civil engineer, but how does one change from that area into another?  One might have specific trade related construction craftsman qualifications, but one is given no credit for this to come back into the third level sector, whereby one can use the credits one has already gained and be invited back into some other line of work, that is, to move across and then move up the national framework.  What we are talking about are pathways that match in company and formal education learning pathways which provide opportunities for cross-linkages and joint provision, such that industry is tracked to higher education qualifications such as time served as an engineer.  Multiple partners are required, as well as industry leadership.  Where everybody comes together in a region such as the south east they see what skills gaps there are and work with employers to fill them.  I was at a talk in the south east previously where employers stated they had come to talks with education providers but that they had not felt particularly welcome.  The issue is to invite employers in and bring them to the table as equals.</p><p> There are a couple of conclusions.  There must be greater interaction between enterprise bodies and agencies and education and training providers in addressing skills demands.  Momentum, for example, is very popular for the youth, but it only caters for a certain amount of under-25s in terms of youth unemployment.  More must be done in that regard.  Education and training provision must have a greater alignment with enterprise skills needs, both current and future.  In my own daily work Carlow VEC which will now be Kilkenny-Carlow ETB has responded to fill the gaps by offering more courses aimed at labour market gaps such as food science and information technology related courses.  Once clients and adult learners know about these opportunities they can move on to Carlow IT and Waterford IT to study these areas.  If one does not know about them, how does one know one is not good at them?  Just because one has not tried something does not mean one is not good at it.  Many adult learners would not know about the opportunities available or where the jobs are because they have no exposure, or in the past they had no exposure, to technology or employment areas.  All promotion of STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - appears to be aimed at leaving certificate students and those coming out of these areas, whereas adult learners and further education participants are just as capable, if not more so, of taking up these opportunities, but they have very limited awareness of them.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

Regions and cities have become the primary spatial units where knowledge is transferred, innovation systems are built and competition to attract investment and human talent takes place.  The EU innovation flagship emphasises the smart specialisation of regions as key to future competitiveness.  The economic development of the south east requires investment in research and development infrastructure, the creation of human capital and the enticement of experts and entrepreneurs to the region.  Strategies are required to create an innovation culture which will drive the growth of indigenous industries, attract foreign direct investment and support the commercialisation of research and the professionalisation of manufacturing and services across a range of sectors.  The challenge for the south east is to mesh these activities together in a cohesive, co-ordinated, collective manner to drive sustainable regional economic growth.  Fragmentation of effort must be overcome through the production of an integrated regional development strategy.  This strategy should incorporate an investment plan to attract the best scientists, engineers, professionals and entrepreneurs to the region which will, in turn, attract multinational industries and high potential start-ups.</p><p>  Waterford Institute of Technology plays a pivotal role as a catalyst for regional economic development, mainly through the innovation of its research and the creation of an effective knowledge transfer framework.  In the past 12 years the institute has secured &euro;112 million in research funding through competitive bidding.  The guiding principle behind our research strategy is the development of research centres of critical mass and international reputation which support the economic development of the region.  However, building competitive advantage through research and innovation requires the creation of a sustainable innovation environment.  An open innovation environment is an environment that interconnects research, innovation and development investment to deliver high quality, sustainable growth.</p><p>  Further strengthening of investment in the research and innovation infrastructure and the intellectual capacity of the south east is crucial to its future.  Investment should focus, first, on sectors that have the capacity for regional economic growth, particularly in the ICT, bio-pharma and advanced manufacturing areas.</p> <p>However, as mentioned by previous speakers, the region must also leverage its natural resources, maximising opportunities in agriculture and tourism and planning for new associated industries such as ICT for agriculture, tourism and eco-innovation.  The TSSG and the associated ArcLabs open innovation model is a blueprint for regional economic development.  The model embodies the institute's stated research philosophy of driving regional economic development through our global reputation for research and innovation excellence.</p><p>  A key component of the model is the co-location of entrepreneurs, business start-ups, researches and students promoting the translation of IP know-how into new products and services.  At the core of the TSSG model is a traditional academic focus on international peer reviewed scientific research and postgraduate education.  This is a key point.  Research has to be at the highest level and it has to be internationally benchmarked but we must extend this through collaborating with industry and enterprise incorporating reference points to state-of-the-art industry and engineering challenges to drive the creation of new products and services.  For instance, the TSSG has created 11 spin out companies in the south east, including FeedHenry, which recently received VEC investment of &euro;7 million and will create an additional 100 jobs in the next year.  The TSSG has also created a mobile services cluster in the region employing more than 200 engineers where no such industry existed previously.  The ArcLabs entrepreneurial development programme, new frontiers, previously known as the south east enterprise platform programme, has created 84 new businesses in the past six years with a combined turnover of &euro;29 million, of which &euro;8.5 million is in export sales.  There are 249 jobs in those companies.</p><p> We also discussed previously the industrial landscape.  It is unfortunate that the south east has attracted only 8% of the overall FDI investment in Ireland.  We, therefore, need to have a targeted approach to FDI investment.  Multinational companies seek locations that provide access to state-of-the-art research through centres of excellence, a ready supply of highly qualified staff and access to international networks of people and ideas.  WIT, through its research centres, is providing the type of research capacity and people skills required by FDI.  Further development in this regard is key to the development of a technological university.  The traditional IOT system is not fit for purpose in the context of where the south east needs to go and that is why there is a need for change.</p><p> The majority of indigenous industries in the south east are micro-industries.  We need to encourage such industries to scale.  However, in the present form they have limited capacity to take up an integrated research input directly into their businesses.  We in WIT have overcome this limitation, particularly in ArcLabs, by customising the IP and know-how generated from our research in a way that is directly applicable to business where technology challenges these micro-industries.  In many cases, we have worked with companies to redesign their products and services in line with new technologies and business opportunities, for instance, companies wanting to move into cloud computing.  The demand for support in the SME sector is evidenced by the fact that WIT has completed more than 240 EI supported innovation voucher projects with SMEs.</p><p> The flow of highly qualified graduates and staff from the research community is an important means of enhancing industry's innovative capacity.  Ongoing continuous proactive engagement between academia, enterprise support and research funding agencies and indigenous industries is essential to sustained growth.  WIT and ArcLabs support the concept of a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs and industry.  The incorporation of academic researchers, entrepreneurs, high potential start ups and multimedia industries in a shared network creates the optimal innovation environment to which I referred, driving the free flow of ideas and transferring IP and know-how to new products and services.  However, it is imperative that the IDA, the regional authorities, local government, industry representatives and WIT and ITC, as higher education providers, work together to ensure the physical and intellectual infrastructure of the south east attracts and sustains both indigenous and multinational industries in the region.  Reference has been made to the profile of the workforce in the region.</p><p> WIT has a strong track record in supporting vocational and labour market oriented education at all levels.  Addressing the needs of the unemployed is a crucial requirement for the economic development and social renewal of the region.  The institute has practically led initiatives to support the reskilling and upskilling of the unemployed, such as ex-Waterford Crystal and TalkTalk employees.  We need to plan ahead and upskill the workforce before a crisis emerges.  We need to have an infrastructure that continually trains and develops the workforce in the workplace.  One area that is important is the Springboard programme, which provides people with the opportunity to reskill and return to work.  Increasingly, we see the importance of lifelong learning.  The typical profile of students is changing.  It is not about four years; it is about continuous education and upgrading.</p><p> The technological university for the south east will not forget its origin and its role as a driver of innovation and employment in the region but it must deliver new models bringing together education, technology, research, business and entrepreneurship to produce industry ready graduates and innovation models such as that in ArcLabs to drive the economic development of the region.  WIT and ITC formally affirmed their intention to create such a university.</p><p> There is a need for the development and implementation of an integrated investment strategy for the south east capable of building an open innovation region.  Such a strategy requires a great alignment of the role of the stakeholders, including Government, industry and higher education.  The creation of a technological university is paramount to the development of the innovation capacity and knowledge base in the south east.  WIT's research and innovation model has proven its ability to create an economic impact.  We now need investment to scale this model and to continue the economic development of the region.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800016#R00200"><p>I thank the witnesses who have travelled from Waterford and Carlow.  The common thread that has emerged from the presentations is the need for an integrated strategy from national to local level across a number of different areas.  Dr. Donnelly was strong during the consultations in Waterford on the need for an integrated economic development strategy for the south east, which would examine its potential, strengths and weaknesses and so on but, in particular, its needs socially, economically and educationally and build from there.  While that makes sense, it does not always happen.  According to the research and facts presented by Forf&aacute;s and other departmental agencies, to which Mr. Walsh, the city manager referred, the region has underperformed in educational attainment and experiences high unemployment and low entrepreneurial activity.  Part of the reason for that is the lack of a joined up approach in the region and lack of integration of national and local policy.  Education has not been immune to that.  We hope and expect that a technological university might bring that cohesion and there will be stronger links between WIT and ITC.  If we need to examine the strengths of the region, we need to have a strategy that aligns national policy with local policy and we need then to provide certainty to entrepreneurs and industrialists in order that when they look at the south east, they see that there is a plan and the infrastructure, supports, graduates and funding are in place.</p> <p>The grants are in place and local authorities and enterprise agencies are aligned to what they need.  There is certainty and it can be seen that these people are serious about those sectors.  If we go down that road, we must be certain of the sectors.  Perhaps the witnesses can offer their ideas on key growth sectors for the region and how best to support them in terms of research and development.</p><p> The speakers from Carlow IT made the point about the need for integrated plans and incorporating higher education institutions, HEIs, into regional action plans.  What more can be done?  Can the witnesses be more specific on what is not happening?  Can they provide examples of how better to achieve integration?  The point made by Mr. Shane Rooney is that we need to make sure the courses we run and the graduates we turn out are meeting the needs of industry and the community.  Are there examples of shortages of skills at third level or fourth level or where skills are not aligned to the needs of industry?  Can Mr. Rooney expand the point about incorporating HEIs into regional action plans?</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Rooney on apprenticeships.  There has been a cultural problem in the State with regard to apprenticeships, where there is a perception problem.  Employers do not see the value in apprenticeships.  There have been problems in the construction industry and it may have tainted our views.  Apprenticeships are much better at European level, where they are better integrated to the industry.  This applies not only to manufacturing but ICT.  The ICT sector has made presentations to us on how we must change our mindset on apprenticeships and encourage a lifelong learning approach, with employers being part of continuous training and education.  Perhaps Mr. Rooney can give his view on this.</p><p> Another point that arose during consultation concerns people who want to do a FETAC course but cannot repeat a course at level 5 even if it is in a different area.  This has presented a problem and it might help if we allowed more flexibility.  Does it not make sense in a situation where people are being asked to diversify and have a need to do so when job opportunities do not exist in the sector in which they have trained?  If we are to examine how we can assist people, it does not make sense to block them.</p><p> The last point concerns the technological university.  Deputy Paudie Coffey and I attended a Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group, TSSG, presentation to Oireachtas Members in Waterford.  I was taken aback by the reach of that research and development company into global companies, including CNN and Disney, through research that has emerged from TSSG and similar work being done in Carlow IT with regard to ENVIROcore DESIGNcore and GAMEcore.  I am a supporter of the technological university even though, traditionally, I was not convinced by whether we needed Trinity, UCC or UCD.  We need a third level institute grounded in the needs of the south east, which is innovation and technology.  Carlow IT has been very good, as has Waterford IT.  What more needs to be done in respect of research and development?  ITs find it difficult to get access to funding.  If we get a new technological university, will it give us new opportunities to access funding for research and development?</p><p> It is interesting that all the participants we have heard from referred to integration, cohesion and a joined-up approach as being very important and something we do not have.  We hope our economic strategy will have that at its core.  It must be about ensuring it delivers for the regions.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations and input into earlier consultations.</p></speech>

It is important to put on record our positions and the challenges we face, as well as identifying opportunities.  The witnesses have outlined where opportunities exist and engagement, discussion and debate is how we can improve how we, as policymakers, respond to the challenges that face us.  I visited Carlow IT before Christmas and I was very impressed by the service delivery and the courses on offer.  I am a regular visitor to WIT and, like Senator Cullinane, I visited TSSG a few weeks ago.  I was pleasantly amazed to witness the uplifting innovation and research that goes on and the connection between that and the potential for industry and employment.  I am not just saying that as a loyal Waterford person.  I knew a lot of work went on there and we are now starting to see the real benefit.  FeedHenry and Betapond have announced investments by companies such as Intel, global players, and that can only continue.  It must be matched by appropriate global strategy and policy to ensure it continues.</p><p>  I raised concerns about regional coherence.  I feel we have not been coherent as a region until now.  In fairness to both colleges represented before us, it is no coincidence that the collaboration between WIT and Carlow IT has seen major strides towards the achievement of a technological university for the south east.  Previously, we were divided and had differences of opinion but now the Government recognises it for the first time.  That we must, and will, have a technological university for the south east was included in the programme for Government and endorsed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  That does not mean serious challenges remain for Carlow and Waterford.</p><p>  I am interested in hearing how to focus on the challenge, which is immediate and essential, to benefit both colleges.  There is possibly duplication between existing colleges in the south east.  Some negotiation and debate must occur to ensure departments are set up to meet the growth areas we have spoken about.  Perhaps the witnesses have information on how to address challenges.</p><p>  The witnesses referred to innovation vouchers, which are a Government initiative.  Dr. Willie Donnelly mentioned 250 companies having taken advantage of the vouchers.  How are the vouchers used?  Is it for marketing or support in the creation of new products, or innovation within the companies?  How do they use them and what does it mean in terms of job creation?</p><p>  I am concerned to hear Mr. Shane Rooney refer to the lack of engagement between industry, education and policymakers and the Government.  It is a concern I share but Mr. Rooney is now a main player as part of the new SOLAS body.  It is a challenge for colleges, industry and policymakers to ensure we match courses with growth and demand.  We are now three or four years into the recession and we have major unemployment.  I am concerned that we do not have that level of engagement, although it is the fault of no one at this committee meeting.  We need to identify why the engagement is not taking place.</p><p>  I do not agree with all of the statements made here.  I am a qualified electrician and came through the vocational apprenticeship system.  One of the witnesses mentioned that trade-related skills are not happening and that we are not engaging with industry.  WIT has a successful programme where former electricians upskill to engineering courses and manufacturing courses.  That is working quite well and perhaps someone on the panel can give us more information.</p> <p> I understand there are positive programmes that will engage craftsmen and people who were employed in the construction sector in finding new career paths and job prospects.  I often meet people who are obliged to go on F&Aacute;S courses on fork lift training, etc., which may not be relevant to where the job prospects lie.  We have work to do in matching the growth sectors in which there are employment prospects with unemployed people.  We must try to bridge that gap.  That is a huge challenge for all of us and I would be interested to hear more detail in that regard.</p><p> Senator Cullinane and others said there is huge potential in the south east region from the perspective of agrifood, life sciences and bioscience, and I understand Teagasc has a role also.  How do the institutes overlap with Teagasc as education partners?  What engagement do they have with it?  When TalkTalk closed, for the first time in the history of the State, all State agencies, education partners and local authorities were brought together by the Minister.  I find it astounding that we do not have a better model of engagement between all the stakeholders to ensure better outcomes and better policy-making.  There is much room for improvement in that area.</p><p> To go back to the agrifood-related area, there is huge potential for unskilled or low-skilled construction workers to gain new skills as farm assistants.  I do not mean as farm labourers but as farm assistants.  Such people can move from construction-related activities, in which they might not have had a craft or a qualification, to hugely productive areas in the farming sector.  There is huge potential in Harvest 2020 and all the associated services.  We should look at improving the skills of former construction workers so that they can work in farming- or agriculture-related areas.  That is something in which we need to engage and I would be interested to hear if there is any work going on in that area.</p><p> I briefly visited the<i>jobs.ie </i>website while the discussion was taking place.  There are 85 jobs currently available in the Waterford area, 59 in Kilkenny, 54 in Wexford, 34 in Carlow and 82 in Tipperary.  There are 314 vacancies in the south east, which are being advertised.  There is a disconnect if we are not matching the skill sets with those vacancies, and that is the challenge for us.  Those 314 jobs are available today.  What will the number be next week, next month or next year?  That is the challenge we all must face.</p></speech>

Do they have any figures on the employment rate of graduates from the institutes?  How do they compare to other institutes around the country?  Do they have any figures on employability from the courses they run?</p><p>  Mr. Declan Doyle mentioned the need to match education provision with industry needs.  I am a little shocked that that is what he is presenting in 2013 given that the issues we are talking about date back at least to 2008, if not before.  DCU, a university of good practice, has a programme called Generation 21.  It has revamped all of the modules in all of its courses and has introduced a set of soft skills that companies are seeking.  I am a little concerned that has not been done in the institutes and that they are only talking about doing it now.</p><p>  Mr. Shane Rooney is someone who is quite involved in labour activation measures but from listening to his presentation, it sounds to me that labour activation measures and the Pathways to Work strategy have not hit the south east yet.  Perhaps he would be able to give me some figures.  I know it is not directly his responsibility, but how far has the Intreo model been rolled out in the south east?  How many places on the Momentum initiative, which is for the long-term unemployed, have been given to the south east?  How many of them have been taken up?  Are there any vacancies?</p><p>  In regard to those responsible for career guidance, I assume that in many cases the local employment service takes on the job of offering career guidance, jobs skills and jobs clubs to the unemployed where there is not a local employment office or an Intreo office.  These are things that people should be doing.  Jobs clubs are responsible for supporting people in getting jobs while jobs centres are responsible for helping people to develop a career path.  That has been formalised much more in the Pathways to Work strategy.  I was a bit taken aback because it sounded as though none of this was happening in the south east.  I imagine more needs to happen.  I would like a response on some of those issues.  </p><p>  It was mentioned that there was no link between employers and education providers or labour activation providers.  Whose responsibility is this?  Is it not everybody's responsibility?  For too long there has not been that connection with providers, whether from the education side or from the Department or those contracted on behalf of the Department - often community and voluntary agencies that do a really good job in many respects in some cities and counties.  Whose responsibility is it to create that link?  I assumed it was everybody's responsibility to create that link between the jobs available and the local employment service or the local Intreo office.  I know I sound a little critical but I am very surprised by this.  People who know me know I do not mince my words on these issues.  </p><p>  I would appreciate whatever information the witnesses can give me.  I know none of the witnesses is responsible for the Intreo model, so I do not expect facts and figures to be completely accurate, but given that Mr. Rooney had many facts and figures, he might be able to shed some light on some of those issues.  I have asked a number of questions to which the witnesses can do their best to respond.  There is no need for witnesses to repeat answers.  I suggest the appropriate witness answer each question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Doyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800018#T00300"><p>When I spoke about harnessing our teaching and research into economic objectives, I meant as a result of whatever jobs initiative or jobs plan for the south east is generated from this report and beyond.  A certain level of engagement takes place across the region and across the higher education sector, but it is not formalised.  The Vice Chairman said it was everybody's responsibility but unfortunately, it is a clich&eacute; that if something is everybody's responsibility, it becomes no one's responsibly.   Perhaps one of the recommendations should be that a formal process be put in place to ensure this type of regional engagement happens.</p><p>  One of the positive things that has aided enormously the development of the joint submission of the two institutes was the formation of a committee chaired by the city manager, Mr. Michael Walsh.  Mr. Joe Crockett and all the county managers in the region were members of this committee, together with representatives from the enterprise development agencies.  That was hugely positive in drawing together the different objectives of the stakeholders and in getting that type of programme going.  One might think that was something very obvious.  It is obvious but it never happened before.  </p><p>  The task force pulled together by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, following the closure of TalkTalk was mentioned.  One might say that was obvious but it had not happened before.  I am part of that forum.  It needs to be formalised in some way to try to ensure that the HEIs have a formal method of interacting with the other stakeholders, whether economic, community or local authority-based. </p><p>  The mention of the technological university in the programme for Government was extremely welcome.  As I said previously, the work towards stage two and, hopefully, on to stage four and redesignation as a technological university is one of the primary objectives of IT Carlow and the management team.  Without getting into the nitty-gritty of mapping academic departments and how that is done, obviously there is overlap.  The institutes of technology were set up in 1970 as regional technical colleges.  They all had a school of business, a school of science and a school of engineering.</p> <p>There are legacy issues there that will be a challenge for the institutes to get through in terms of how centres of excellence, research funding and research strategies are developed.  That is a real challenge because it does not just involve academic and regional engagement issues but also human resources and industrial relations issues, with a whole plethora of different stakeholders who need to be brought on board.  Ultimately, it will happen but it is some way down the road.  </p><p> On the issue of the way in which we engage with industry, we have formal industry advisory boards for each of our programmes to try to ensure that we create what are termed &quot;shovel-ready&quot; graduates, that is, people who are ready to enter the work force on graduation.  The Carlow Institute of Technology was extremely pleased to see the report produced by IBEC recently on graduate employability which showed that IT graduates scored higher than the universities on six out of ten of the criteria under which they were surveyed.  </p><p> On the question of apprenticeships, we had an extremely successful project under the strategic innovation fund.  The aforementioned fund is six to eight years old.  There was a joint initiative between Carlow IT and Limerick IT which developed a progression and conversion route for apprentices.  One course was called a BSc in Craft Management and it allowed apprentices to develop a new, management-based skill set.  Other projects allowed apprentices to look at alternative ways of building on their apprenticeship qualification.  One example of this was the aforementioned course in craft management.  Another, in the engineering faculty, enabled electricians to transfer into electronic engineering.  That reskilling and upskilling of apprentices who have been left unemployed as a result of the construction downturn is continuing.  In that context and to return to something mentioned by Mr. Rooney, the recognition of prior, experiential learning is something we have worked hard on in Carlow IT.  We have taken a number of students in recent years onto our business and ICT programmes.  It is a little bit trickier to do this in some of our engineering programmes because we must ensure that students who come through the programme will achieve Engineering Ireland status or the equivalent status from a relevant professional body.  In some cases, if one gives exemptions for prior learning, the final qualification is not always recognised by the professional body.  That is something we are working on to see if we can overcome it.  Up to two years ago, if Bill Gates applied for a software engineering course at Carlow IT, he would have to start in first year.  That was the reality before we brought in recognition of prior learning, RPL, and we are continuing to develop our policies in that area.</p><p> Flexibility and diversity are key in terms of the conversion programmes, particularly in ICT, business and supply-chain management.  Some of these programmes were funded through Springboard and we hope that will continue.  I mention supply-chain management because we spoke earlier about agri-science and agri-research and one of the areas in which Carlow IT has developed expertise is in the area of supply-chain and agri-logistics.  Graduates of that course are proving to be highly employable.  We are working on a memorandum of understanding with Teagasc, Waterford IT and Carlow IT in agri-ICT and agri-business generally.  That would include the concept of the agricultural assistant, although I had not heard that actual term before.  Without being sexist, we are looking at developing a programme for farmers' sons who went into the construction industry and who are now returning to farming to try to develop their skills to enable them to have a viable future in the agri-industry.  </p><p> The notion of the technological university and the questions on the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, are issues to which the representatives from Waterford IT should respond.  However, aligned to the notion of the technological university is the notion of the entrepreneurial university, that is, one that is outward looking and engaged with industry and that is what we are striving to achieve.  That is what is different about any technological university.  It is not a &quot;me too&quot; university.  It is about engagement and innovation in the way we deliver our programmes, like developing internships for adult learners, building more live projects into our work, ensuring greater linkage between our research capability and the needs of industry and so forth.  We are trying to ensure that this approach is built into the fabric of what we do and not something that simply happens on an <i>ad-hoc</i>basis across departments.  We want it to be at the core of what we do.  We want to ensure that we are engaged within the region.</p><p> The word &quot;university&quot; is probably more important for American multinationals coming in.  Some of the companies based in the Carlow area that have their headquarters in the US are very excited about telling HQ that there is a possibility of a technological university opening in the region.  In that context, it is more than a word.  The word is important but it is more than that.  University status enhances our prospects of becoming involved in higher-level research and producing more fourth-level graduates.  </p><p> On the question of employability, the average employment rate for graduates of Carlow IT in the last five years is 91%.  It peaked at 96% and the lowest point was 87%.  We have 100% employment rates in the ICT and biotechnology areas but the rates are lower in other areas.  Students who entered college in 2007 and 2008 on construction-related courses are still struggling to find employment in Ireland, although they are finding employment overseas.</p><p> I hope I have answered all of the questions that were posed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Rooney" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800019#U00200"><p>The issue of applicants for FETAC 5 courses not getting the back to education allowance if they already have a FETAC 5 qualification was raised.  While I am not here to speak for the Department of Social Protection, the reason for that is that in the past there were adult learners who were what is termed "going around the houses", doing course after course at FETAC 5 level with no progression up the national framework to FETAC 6 or to HETAC level in the institutes of technology and the universities.  That is why that condition exists.  There may be a possibility for exemptions in areas where there are employment opportunities, for example, in science, technology and ICT.  However, there are many courses at FETAC 5 level for which the employment opportunities are limited or non-existent.  While some courses, in community development and health care support, for example, are meeting a need in the community, other courses are not.  The demand for beauty therapists, hairdressers, for example, is far lower than the number of students completing those courses and therefore, a balance needs to be struck in that area.</p><p> On the issue of apprenticeships and those who worked in construction moving on, the  important point is that there is a variety of apprenticeships available that match the needs of employers.  The apprenticeships must be very specific.  One could do a FETAC 5 course in business studies or secretarial studies but there are no jobs in those areas in Carlow.  Therefore, there is no real point in doing a FETAC 5 course in those subjects unless one intends to progress to third level.  The objective is to make FETAC 5 courses and apprenticeships more specific to industry demands.  Recently, for example, there was a JobBridge apprenticeship for a cheese-maker, where the apprentice will be trained up in a very specific area in which there are employment opportunities.  While generic skills are important, students also need to develop more industry-specific skills in order to be employable.  </p><p>  Deputy John Lyons mentioned the Pathways to Work initiative.  As part of our service, the local jobs club runs courses five mornings a week and we meet clients from those courses all of the time.  We do our best to provide courses and opportunities for them, as well as giving them information and guidance.  </p> <p> Courses in generic skills, however, such as Safe Pass and first aid, will not get a person a job.  If a person is in a jobs club and only has generic, construction related skills, that will not get that person long-term employment, although the jobs clubs are great for interview skills and as a start.  Even just to be in a jobs club to talk to others and to network is hugely beneficial because those involved are meeting people who are working or who are not that long out of the workplace.  They are back in the loop and can then look at other opportunities or education and training board courses or going to college.</p><p> We would meet those people every week.  We are very involved under a new interim protocol with the Department of Education and Skills where we meet clients referred directly from the Department of Social Protection on a weekly basis.  There was strong informal co-operation and integration before but it is now on a more formal footing where the IRCU, employment services and the F&Aacute;S activation manager would meet on a far more formal basis than before.  We are getting referrals all the time and our services have never been busier.  That knocks on from Pathways to Work and closer co-operation and integration with that.</p><p> The question was asked if we should be doing this or whether it should come from the Government.  We are very aware of employment opportunities locally and we pass these on to clients.  Every week our information officer would hand to clients a list of jobs from the local press.  Many people are going for generic skilled jobs where a high level qualification is not needed, so it is almost impossible to get those jobs.  The jobs with specific skills, such as in engineering or where computer aided design, CAD, skills are needed, require a person to have some education and FETAC level 5,6 and 7 qualifications.  Just knowing about those job opportunities will not help.  A person must upskill to meet the needs of those employers.</p></speech>

He said there is as much IT generated in Kansas as in Silicon Valley and asked why all the companies are located in Silicon Valley.  It is because they have an open innovation culture.  This is very important.  We need to build such a culture in the southern region.  Our experience when I set up the TSSG was that there were no ICT industries.  We had to create one but when the IDA would bring companies to Waterford, there would not be any capacity in human resource terms.  For multinationals, the human resource is the critical factor.  Why do ICT companies go to Dublin?  It is because there is a flow of ideas and people.  They need connectivity to similar companies.  They do not shy away from that competition.  In the south east we need to identify those areas of critical mass in order that we can create industry and plan to develop the necessary infrastructure, like in Silicon Valley.  That involves people, structures and support.</p><p>  The problem we have is that we talk about increasing employment in the south east but we never ask what are the areas where we could attract a critical mass.  That is what we did in the TSSG.  When we saw we did not have these people, we decided to create spin-out companies, where we seek out people from abroad, and we had people from 20 different countries come to work in the south east.  We then moved them out into the companies.  These are activities we must undertake and that is what I mean by strategic planning.  There is no point in doing this on a yearly basis.  We must plan on a five year basis, with an objective, and identify the resources we need.  Does Enterprise Ireland match the investment from the IDA?  Are both agencies seeking the same industries and promoting the same resources?  Are educators developing the skills that are needed?  Entrepreneurs like to be next to other entrepreneurs, so we must create a platform to entice them into the region.</p><p>  The Kilkenny county manager, Mr. Joe Crockett, gave us an opportunity to take the TSSG model and recreate it in Kilkenny.  We did not say that in Waterford our focus is on mobile services so we should have the same focus in Kilkenny.  We asked what the natural industrial base was around Kilkenny.  Agriculture was one answer, but from talking to Mr. Crockett, if we look at the opportunity for growth in agriculture in the region, we can see there are challenges in environmental impacts.  I began to wonder how ICT could link to agriculture.  The Republic of Ireland is at the forefront of ICT and by combining our natural resources and ICT, we could create not just a whole new industry but one that has huge export potential.  This is not just about an integrated strategy, it is about having an understanding of our goals, and all the players must understand that.</p><p>  In that strategy, when we talk about education, we must look not just at third level but at primary and secondary education.  At secondary level, there are schools in the south east that are not offering some science subjects because of cutbacks.  Those are the subjects the companies we are trying to attract want to see.</p><p>  We brought in &euro;112 million in research funding.  The universities have baseline funding for research of about &euro;240 million per year while we receive nothing.  We are starting from a much lower base.</p><p>  The other reason the region needs a technological university is common sense.  Technology is changing rapidly.  Many of the leading companies in the world such as Cisco do not look beyond three years because they cannot predict what will happen beyond that.  If we are to train the next generation of graduates and engage with industry, how do we train ourselves?  How much would it cost the taxpayer if we had to reskill every academic every three years in order that he would be current?  We do that by research instead.  Research helps if we bring it into the undergraduate programme.  Not only do we train people to go into industry, but they must be upskilled every three years.  Through research, we are offering people the ability to do this.</p><p>  Sun Life is a good example of such upskilling,  We have a masters programme where we and the company looked at its needs and then defined the programme around those needs.</p> <p>The normal academic excellence is still needed, but consideration is also given to skills needs.  I understand that 50 of Sun Life's staff have graduated from that programme.  That is what the technological university is about.  It is about responsiveness.  At national level, the debate about the institutes of technology tends to focus on whether 16 or 18 hours of teaching should be provided.  That is not the question.  That is not how we will enable the south east to grow.  The debate should be about being able to respond to needs by working with industry to define and develop the skills it needs.  Perhaps Dr. Wall will speak about the skills base.</p></speech>

I work in the school of lifelong earning and education.  I would like to pick up on what has been said by Dr. Donnelly and others.  There is no doubt that the region faces challenges from the perspective of educational attainment.  There are positive examples of what both institutes are trying to do at present.  We hope to hear something positive from Springboard later this week.</p><p>  I will give some examples of engagements we have been involved with over the past couple of years.  A number of people from the construction industry are participating in our ICT skills programme.  I am originally a civil engineer.  I know better than most the skills one acquires in the construction industry, particularly in the whole area of project management.  Those skills are needed in the software industry.  A number of those who are currently taking our ICT skills courses come from a background in architecture or construction.  Last year, we were successful with a number of programmes in the whole Springboard domain.  I refer, for example, to the postgraduate diplomas in innovative technology engineering and in lean practice.  This links back to the discussion we had earlier about building the capacity for advanced manufacturing in the south east.  When I give feedback to groups like this committee, I emphasise that we engage in "mark to market" practices in terms of the numbers we might get on these programmes.  If we are to leverage them, we need to be above the market.  We need to build them up over a period of three to five years so we can deliver for the region.  That would be one of the recommendations I would make in this regard.</p><p>  I wish to return to what Dr. Donnelly said about engagement.  We have argued for some time that a transformation in the way we deliver the curriculum will have to be one of the key features of the technological university.  It should not always be about people coming into the classroom.  We should use technology to engage remotely with them.  We should make provision for our students to go out on internships and solve real-world problems.  We are working to ensure this is one of the key features of the technological university.  I hope I have given the committee an idea of what I consider to be positive initiatives that can further leverage both institutes in assisting the region and improving its educational attainment.</p></speech>

It will be a new organisation.  There will be no such thing as the Institute of Technology, Carlow or Waterford Institute of Technology - there will be a single integrated institute.  That addresses the problem regarding the overlap in courses.</p><p>  The Chairman also asked how companies use innovation vouchers.  This is one of the challenges we face in the research area.  It is no coincidence that the majority of companies that engage with Science Foundation Ireland are huge multinational organisations with their own research laboratories.  They are able to take research output in the rawest form and integrate it into their products.  If one is running a company with four or five employees, one will not have the luxury of being able to allocate one of those people to engage at the research level.  We transfer the highly specialist knowledge we have created through our research and innovation to companies by means of product development, for example.  The document we furnished to the joint committee mentions a local indigenous company, EirGen Pharma, which operates in the area of biopharmaceutics.  It is working with the Pharmaceutical and Molecular Biotechnology Research Centre, which is our biopharmaceutics research group, on an innovation voucher.  The centre isolated and identified three impurities in a tablet product that was being developed by EirGen.  The project allowed EirGen to file the product with the European Medicines Agency and it was approved in 2010.</p><p>  This example gives us a clear view of how deeply the main research can be translated into something a company can use.  This helps the development of the company.  We do that over and over again.  I believe this demonstrates the difference between a technological university and a traditional university.  A traditional university is like a thoroughbred.  Its focus is on its independence.  Our focus will be on our responsiveness as a technological university.  We will take the results of our research and customise it to the needs of companies.  We will engage with them on a continual basis to ensure we understand their needs.  I think I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

We were also present in the Visitors Gallery for the previous discussion on the south east during which we heard about education and agriculture.  The collaboration between Waterford Institute of Technology and Kildalton Agricultural College has been of great benefit to agricultural students studying at the Kildalton site.</p><p>  For reasons of time, I will not read the entire submission.  I propose instead to highlight some of the main issues.  There are 18,000 people employed directly in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in the south-east region, which is twice the national average.  The reason is the quality of the land in the region and the ability of its people to produce agricultural products.  This message has been reinforced by the investment commitment of &euro;180 million given by Glanbia plc to process milk produced in the region beyond 2015. </p><p>  The agri-food sector employes 8,000 employees in the south-east region in the areas of farmhouse cheeses, ice creams and meats.  Opportunities will also arise for retraining in the area of light engineering to serve the agriculture sector.</p><p>  Under the ambitions set out in Food Harvest 2020 for the period between 2015 and 2020, the primary duty of stockmen, other than stockmanship, will be the production of raw materials for the food industry.  They will also be required to provide other services for farmers which will provide opportunities in the years ahead. </p><p>  I acknowledge the role of Enterprise Ireland and Leader groups in providing financial and practical supports for individuals who are establishing agri-food enterprises.  The south-east region covers only four and a half counties.  I am from County Tipperary, half of which is in the south east, while the other half is outside the region.  Despite its size, the south east accounts for 22% of the country's milk output.</p><p>  Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will have a major impact of farmers in the south east who fear the possibility of convergence of payments.  Such a move could undermine the prospects of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, given that in 2009 direct payments accounted for 123% of farmers' incomes.  For this reason, we are concerned about the current proposals. </p><p>  The abolition of quotas will also present challenges.  Mr. O'Loughlin is a supplier to Glanbia which has moved to flatten the peaks and troughs in milk supply by providing back-to-back contracts with purchasers.  This move provides stability for the primary producer, the purchaser and, ultimately, the employment structure in the association.  We view Wicklow ICSMA as a leader in that regard.</p><p>  Members of the joint committee feed into the CAP reform process through their contacts with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach.  The Irish Presidency is a critical six month period for CAP reform.  The primary producer must be protected under the proposals if employment is to be enhanced and we are to avail of the opportunities that will arise after the abolition of quotas in 2015.  As a country which exports 85% of our produce, we are conscious of the various aids available under the Common Agricultural Policy, including aid for private storage.  We raised this issue with the Department and I encourage the joint committee to follow up on it.  This aid is very important to the dairy sector, given the seasonality of milk supply.  </p><p>  The availability of credit is another issue that is creating serious challenges for our members and industries across the economy.  Given the climatic conditions we have experienced in the past 18 months, these are especially serious for farmers.  At the end of 2011 farmers owed &euro;1.9 billion, which was &euro;307 million lower than in the previous year.  However, the past 18 months have undone much of the progress made in this regard.  Merchant credit is also an issue.  I have met various merchants in the south east who have expressed major reservations about their ability to continue in the event that credit does not become available and farmers are not given an opportunity to repay outstanding loans over a number of years.  Merchants want the banks to function properly because they are currently operating as bankers for individual farmers. </p><p>  The review of the nitrates directive is another issue facing farmers.  We would like the current derogation to be maintained and have approached the relevant authorities in that regard.  The south east has the best land in the country and the derogation is necessary to allow us to engage in intensive farming.  We would also like the bureaucracy associated with the directive to be reduced.  The application process should be simplified, for example, by rolling over derogations for individual farmers rather than requiring them to reapply each year.  The ending of the period within which farmers may export slurry on 31 December is also a significant issue for them.  If they were allowed to export up to 15 February, many of them could meet the requirements of the nitrates directive without needing a derogation.  It is impossible to export slurry from 15 to 30 December as this is a closed period. </p><p>  The main challenges facing the dairy sector are reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and farm fragmentation.  I ask the political parties represented on the joint committee to lobby the relevant Ministers to ensure steps are taken in the budget to facilitate the consolidation of holdings.  The milking platform around the parlour is the critical issue for dairy farmers in delivering expansion and further employment opportunities.  Price volatility is also a major challenge for us and we seek some form of price stabilisation or relevant market support in that regard.  </p><p>  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association is involved with the European Milk Board.  We seek the establishment of an EU dairy market monitoring agency which would issue early warnings where oversupply appeared to be imminent.</p> <p>The reality is that even with the abolition, it will be supply and demand.  That is a brief presentation.  We are willing to take any questions or comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kelly" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013061800023#Y00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present on the committee's strategy report.  Given the long afternoon, I do not intend to read my presentation in detail but will summarise it in my own words.  It is about the restoration of the sugar industry in Ireland.  I advise the committee that I became aware of this initially in 2006 when I was the CEO of Carlow County Enterprise Board and was approached by a number of people regarding their desire to review the decision that had been made and see whether there was an opportunity to restore it.  I recommended to the board that we carry out a feasibility study.  I propose to elaborate on the findings of that study.  The study was drawn up by former senior executives of Irish Sugar, Greencore, scientists in UCD and farmer representatives, and the financial figures within the study, which is available, were verified by the international consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>  The primary findings of the report are in the conclusion which states that a viable and profitable industry based on sugar beet as the primary raw material and sugar and ethanol as the main products can be established in Ireland.  The industry would have very significant employment opportunities during construction and operation and wider benefits for growers, contractors, hauliers and the local and national economy.  Some obstacles would have to be overcome before it would become a reality, although these are not considered insurmountable.  The report is approximately two years old.  Some of the figures quoted at the time would have changed, for example, the price of sugar would have increased.  Obstacles is a word one could use but if I were asked what needs to be done now to take this to the next level, one is quite imminent.</p><p>  Shortly after the report was concluded we met the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  While he supported our endeavours at the time he clearly stated, and has since stated, that any venture to develop a combined sugar or bio-ethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense to be viable and to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.  Clearly, that was giving us the position of Government at the time.  The second issue that needs to be addressed is the quota.  Again, historically, in 2005, at the time of the reform, Greencore, which was the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of the voluntary scheme and dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006.  In other words, there is no mechanism that would enable us to grow beet and produce sugar.  However, under the Irish Presidency, negotiations are ongoing to finalise the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform package that will be in place for the future, including provisions for sugar production in the European Union post 2015.</p><p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, as president of the Council, made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a majority of member states to extend the current quota regime for a further two years until September 2017 when it would finally cease.  This is now the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council as it enters the final phase of the ongoing CAP reform negotiations with the European Parliament and the Commission.  We understand that a decision on the overall CAP reform package, including the future of the EU sugar regime, will be sought at the next session of the Agriculture Council beginning on 24 June when it is hoped it can be brought to a successful conclusion before the Irish Presidency ends on 30 June.  Clearly, that is a key date from the point of view of the findings in this particular report.  We are hopeful that a conclusion can be reached and, if so, planning can take place.  Without a quota it is very difficult to engage with investors who will be required.  For the proposal to be progressed, presuming we get clarity after the end of June, expressions of interest from farmers will be key.  They are going to produce the raw material.  Therefore, we need expressions of interest from farmers.</p><p>  I think we can advance a suitable site, even while awaiting the outcome of the CAP negotiations.  Our group is of the view that given the competitive nature of the production of sugar in Europe, we have to be extraordinarily competitive.  One of the key fundamentals will be cost of transport.  Therefore, this plant has to be central to the growing area - the southern parts of Offaly, Kildare, Carlow, Wexford, east Cork and east Tipperary.  Our research identifies that it is somewhere between Carlow and Kilkenny.  We are not being specific but we clearly believe it is in the south east and is driven 100% by virtue of the cost of transporting the raw material to the factory.  Any particular site must have good road structures and must be central to the heart of beet growing in Ireland.</p><p>  That is a short summary of the findings of the study.  Some of the figures in the study are being updated.  Certainly it gives us food for thought.  If there are any questions, I will certainly answer them.  We see this as an opportunity.  It will be a challenge because of our competitors.  We are entering an already well-established business.  As there is no evidence of a shortage of sugar in Ireland, there are players already in a position to supply Ireland with its quota.  However, one of the significant benefits of Ireland having its own industry is that some of our significant employers in the confectionery business would be guaranteed a supply.  There is a whole list of reasons we should do this.  We have to be realistic also and recognise the challenges that lie ahead and see how, working together, we can make it happen.</p></speech>

As the Vice Chairman said, we have the presentations and they will be factored into our report.  I do not know if the visitors heard the session with the Kilkenny county manager.  The whole area of agriculture and Food Harvest 2020 was raised.  The visitors have reinforced much of what was said earlier.  Everybody agrees that the targets for Food Harvest 2020 are ambitious but realistic and deliverable.  If they are to be achieved, we must ensure the infrastructure is in place.  If we are to expand milk production - obviously we have opportunities with the abolition of milk quotas - we must ensure the infrastructure is in place to process milk.  We have had a positive announcement from Glanbia on the Belview site.  That is hugely important for the south east, midlands and the south west in terms of taking the increased milk.</p><p>  The infrastructure at that level is only part of the jigsaw.  Certainly the farmers in the region want their concerns addressed.  For example, if they need to expand their herd or their on-farm infrastructure, they will need access to credit and, perhaps, employment supports if they are taking people on.</p> <p>In their opinion, a range of supports will need to be put in place to aid them in capitalising on opportunities.  Our guests mentioned access to credit, but perhaps they will briefly discuss some of these points.</p><p> Mr. Joe Crockett, the Kilkenny county manager, referred to the opportunity for the south east to become a leader in food, for example, production, technology, ingredients, etc.  What more can be done to support that work?  He also mentioned the challenges that could be overcome.  For example, if we increase herd size, we increase effluent, which creates problems in terms of compliance with the water framework directive.  The nitrates directive is still hanging over us.  How important are these challenges in terms of ensuring compliance with the water framework directive on the one hand while continuing the nitrates directive derogation on the other?</p><p> The sugar beet industry idea is laudable and I would support it as it would create substantial jobs in the region.  There is no point in looking back on the decisions that have been made.  We must look forward and determine where to go from here.  Serious challenges must be overcome, but the starting point is to ask whether we are serious about going with this idea.  We must decide whether we can be competitive and get growers and other players to buy into it.  They are the key ingredient, if everyone will pardon the pun.  If a decision is made at Government level to the effect that the idea is viable, everything else will flow from it and we will overcome the challenges.</p><p> Price competitiveness for beet growers was also mentioned.  It is key that the industry be economically viable if farmers are to get a return on their produce.  These issues must be examined.  Mr. Kelly's group has conducted a feasibility study.  If Government agencies make a decision to pursue this opportunity, particularly the bio-refinery element, it will happen.  If a positive decision is not made, it will not happen.  A Government decision is critical.</p></speech>

As recently as last week, one of the main banks sent an e-mail to all public representatives updating them on how well it was reaching its access to finance targets.  Sometimes, it is anecdotally correct to claim that finance is not being provided.  From our guests' experience, are banks providing finance to people who are legitimately in a position to access it?</p><p>  My second question is for Mr. Kelly.  What are the employment figures in terms of constructing and operating the sugar beet industry?</p></speech>

The Tipperary Co-op has invested heavily in its cheese plant to move forward with its Food Harvest 2020 ambition.  I omitted to mention that the Irish Dairy Board had made a significant investment in securing markets for post-2015.  As an exporting nation, we need this.</p><p>  The farmers to whom the Senator spoke were right.  If a farmer goes from milking 60 cows to milking 100 cows, he or she does not want to spend four hours in the parlour or whatever the case may be.  There is a dairy equipment scheme.  With the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, we hope that an enhanced scheme will be available to farmers under Pillar 2 as we head towards 2014 and 2015.  If farmers increase their numbers, they must have sufficient slurry storage facilities.  We made a strong case to Teagasc and the Department regarding the nitrates directive.  The dairy cow is not permitted to be outwintered.  Facilities must be available, even if there is only an eight week winter.  In particular, parts of County Kilkenny-----</p></speech>

Farmers there could outwinter some of their stock.  Capital will be required.  Mr. O'Loughlin will take the Chairman's question.</p><p>  The dairy industry would welcome a return of the beet industry.  The sugar industry's by-product would be a significant boost to milk production, particularly in the late third and early fourth quarters.  The industry's return would be significant for our Food Harvest 2020 ambition.</p></speech>

I am also the chairman of our local discussion group.  Banks have copped on and are lending money when they know they will get it back.  They are providing money more sensibly.  In 90% of cases previously, farmers tended to borrow sensibly.  The banks know that the farmers' businesses have made steady returns.</p><p>  A number of problems have arisen.  For example, some of the legal charges have gone bananas.  Legal charges are unrelated to the amount of money loaned or borrowed.  Often, banks, and borrowers, solicitors' fees are paid at both ends.</p><p>  Fees are an issue.  The banks are really sucking hard on them.  They are reluctant to offer money based solely on a business plan - the capacity to make a return on the borrowed money - and are more concerned with getting deeds into their vaults.  This is disappointing.  Traditionally in the agricultural sector, borrowed money was repaid without bother.  In light of the bad weather this spring, however, my bank of AIB has been conscious of farmers' needs.  It has been proactive in our area by approaching farmers before their situations worsened.  If feed or an overdraft was required, the bank moved.  If a farmer's situation was fine, the bank did not move.  Credit should be given where it is due.</p></speech>

I do not want to quote statistics, but I will put the issue in context.  The study went into great detail.  Based on a yield of 60 tonnes per hectare, some 24 tonnes per acre, there would be a requirement of 20,000 hectares or 50,000 acres of sugar beet.  At an average of ten acres per grower, this would involve approximately 2,000 growers.  This is what we need to deliver a significant project.  They would need to be high end growers, that is, open to technology.  The yields can be increased considerably with the co-operation of Teagasc.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman referred to jobs.  We have concluded that between 400 and 500 jobs would be created during the construction period and approximately 200 people would be employed to operate the plant.  Crucially, significant indirect employment amounting to 5,000 jobs would be created among farmers, agricultural contractors, hauliers and input suppliers.  It would be a major contributor.</p><p>  We need a serious commitment from farmers.  On the night of the ministerial decision, sugar was the item that held up matters.</p> <p>This was not anticipated because the focus was on beef and milk, funnily enough.  It was sugar that burned the midnight oil, however.  This was a kind of deal that was done in respect of 2017.  It was not what we were looking for ideally because the exit date was to be in 2015, but there is a lead-in time to make the process work.  There is evidence of commitment.  The financial commitment is considerable, obviously.  The Government and Department must show cause, but not so much in a financial sense as one can offer support in so many different ways.  We need that support.  Enterprise Ireland has a remit regarding indigenous industry and it has not ruled itself out.  The challenge for us is to take this to the next level, including through a farmers' commitment</p><p> The process is predicated on a successful conclusion at the end of this month such that we will know the exact position on the Irish sugar industry.  Some challenges remain but we are still convinced that, with the commitment and involvement of the key stakeholders, the objectives can be met.  At present, there is much publicity over what happened in the past and what we should do again.  That does not help in the making of progress because this is about a commercially viable proposition.  By getting the key people involved, we can deliver.  However, it will not happen today or tomorrow.  We are aware that another group, Beet Ireland, decided it will examine the feasibility of the proposal and has concluded it is commercially viable.  Realistically, for it to happen, there ought to be one group.  We are always available to make that happen.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode, as they will interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>  The first item on our agenda is a discussion of the topic democratic legitimacy and accountability in the European Union.  On behalf of the joint committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. Francis Jacobs, head of office at the European Parliament Information Centre in Dublin.  This is another in a series of discussions we are having on the future of the European Union.  Today our focus is on the role of an ever-more assertive European Parliament in underpinning democratic legitimacy and accountability.  As members know, the 2008 Lisbon treaty placed directly elected MEPs at the heart of the European Union's decision-making process.  As the European Union shifts from crisis management to a more proactive approach, we will explore the role the European Parliament is playing in bolstering public confidence in the Union's capacity to deliver for its citizens through measures such as, for example, the youth guarantee initiative.  This session with Mr. Jacobs gives us the opportunity to debate such issues.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, make charges against or criticise a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her easily identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an individual or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it easily identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Jacobs to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I also welcome the initiative taken by the committee which it has been carrying out in recent weeks and months.  Its inquiry is timely.  The European Union has been going through a major economic crisis which has undoubtedly weakened support for its institutions and policies.</p> <p>The measures taken to tackle the crisis have had considerable success, but they have tended to deepen EU integration on an <i>ad hoc</i>and sometimes an even intergovernmental basis without some of the corresponding measures to strengthen democratic accountability at either European Parliament or national parliament level.  European Parliament elections will be held in just under one year's time.  All of these developments could lower turnout and-or lead to a rise in support for populist or protest parties.  It is essential, therefore, that the democratic legitimacy of all EU policies, including the evolving Economic and Monetary Union, be strengthened at all levels.  The European Parliament passed a resolution last week on this subject in which stated it was &quot;deeply concerned that democratic accountability in the EMU [the fourth building block] has not so far been tackled properly in the Council's deliberations&quot;.</p><p> In the short period given to me to make my opening remarks I will be telegraphic and will not go into detail.  I will look briefly at what I see as some of the key challenges in ensuring democratic accountability and some ways by which this could be better achieved.  I will finish by saying a few words about the European Parliament elections in 2014 and the views within the Parliament as to how they might be made more European in nature.  </p><p> In respect of the key challenges in ensuring democratic accountability, at which the committee has been looking for the past few months, it will always be a difficult task to ensure the accountability of EU-related actions and activities for a number of reasons.  Obviously, the complexity of EU structures, the very technical nature of many of its activities, the question of to whom one is accountable - Europeans as a whole, national citizens, etc. - and the very different national mentalities and cultures of 27 and soon to be 28 member states are issues.  It has been made even more difficult because it is no longer just about the adoption of EU laws.  When one looks at the adoption of EU laws, one can see that the European Parliament has much stronger powers than it used to have.  Since the Lisbon treaty, it co-decides with the member states on almost every European law and can amend or even reject them.  The committee has seen this in the past few weeks with the negotiations the Presidency is carrying out on the multi-annual financial framework, the CAP, fisheries and many other key policy areas.  </p><p> When we are talking about EU laws, accountability is less direct than with national parliaments.  However, one has the yellow and orange card systems and the possibility of making contributions to the EU legal process.  The response to the economic crisis has led to new laws such as the six-pack, the two-pack and now the evolving laws on banking union.  What I want to emphasise, in particular, is that the Economic and Monetary Union developments have also reinforced the non-legislative activities of the European Union for which democratic accountability is even more difficult to achieve.  A few obvious examples are <i>ex-ante</i>co-ordination of national economic policies, the economic semester, <i>ex-post</i>reporting and monitoring of implementation to see if measures are being properly implemented and enhanced co-operation in which not all member states take part - the obvious example being the financial transaction tax  - and the other intergovernmental activities in which not every member state participates such as the measures in the fiscal stability treaty.  All of these are more difficult for the European Parliament and national parliaments to account for democratically.  They are more Executive-driven and there is less chance to amend or reject them.  </p><p> What are the possible solutions?  In the short period available I will concentrate on process questions, but, of course, the most important things relate to policy.  In respect of institutional developments, one thing that may well happen, although not in the short term, is further treaty change.  This may include new and stronger rules for democratic accountability, more powers for the European Parliament and, possibly, revisiting the powers of national parliaments.  All of these are desirable, but they will involve tough negotiations and will not be available for some time.  A variant is more informal agreements between the institutions which the European Parliament is always very keen to negotiate.  These would be inter-institutional agreements between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament such that the Parliament has more say in the process.  </p><p> Another way of doing it is to build new control powers into individual EU measures.  Again, who would participate in these measures?  Would it be countries of the eurozone or all states?  Would it be intergovernmental or within the EU system?  </p><p> There are internal changes that could be made.  First, the European Parliament could spend more time on these non-legislative powers.  It is quite difficult because the European Parliament has fewer formal powers in these areas and it is more difficult to build a real role for itself.  It has tried to use its budgetary powers and other formal powers to have more powers in the non-legislative areas, but it is a difficult task.  There are a number of techniques that could be used and that have been used in some committees, for example, implementation question time within individual committees and not focusing on new laws but asking questions in the much more informal setting of a committee rather than at a full plenary.  There are a number of other ways at which the European Parliament has been looking.  It makes much use of the rapporteur system, whereby one individual member of a committee is empowered to draw up a report on a particular subject.  One of the suggestions made is that they should not just monitor the adoption of new legislation but also follow through on its implementation.  In other words, their role should continue for longer.  It involves a person becoming the expert on a particular area and helping to focus debate on it.  </p><p> The next issue is how to strengthen the role of national parliaments, which is the focus of the committee's inquiry.  I emphasise the need for further co-operation between the European Parliament and national parliaments.  Some 20 ago when I was working with parliamentary committees, there was relativy little contact between the European Parliament and national parliaments.  The process has developed significantly in the past 20 years, but clearly there is scope, not just for formal co-operation but also for informal co-operation, which will probably be even more important in the long run.  I will not go into detail, although I am happy to come back on questions.  One thing that will be hugely important in the future is making better use of national parliament contributions on legislation and feeding it into the work of European Parliament committees.  One has subsidiarity control with the yellow and orange card system.  Increasingly, however, national parliaments are making contributions which can be on legislation, but they can also be on communications and non-legislative texts.  They are increasingly being sent to the sectoral committees of the European Parliament, but there is much scope for them to play more of a role and for more account to be taken of them in the future.  </p><p> Another very important issue is that of increasing openness and transparency in all its aspects.  This involves access to documents, better information on what is being proposed and discussed and texts being more clearly written rather than in jargon.  Providing better information for citizens on how the European Union works is also very important.  The Danish Parliament has a very good system for informing its citizens about the European Parliament.  It was one of the things that inspired the European Parliament to have its own visitor centre which has been in operation in Brussels for a couple of years and has been hugely successful in giving people an idea about the European Union, the history of the European Parliament, how it works and a flavour of it.   </p><p> Obviously, these are all ways by which changes could be made.  What are the preconditions for this to work based on my experience in the European Parliament?</p> <p>One, of course, is adequate resources to finance the necessary expertise, because democratic accountability within the European Parliament, and probably within in all parliaments, is very people-intensive.  To do the job well, especially in these non-legislative areas, takes a lot of resources.  Another precondition is for adequate time to be set aside.  Within the European Parliament there was always a tendency for the non-legislative work to be crowded out by the legislative work, where the European Parliament had real powers.  It is very important that adequate time is set aside for the non-legislative control work.  Another very important precondition, especially in relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments, is continuity of contacts.  I was involved, from the European Parliament side in committees, in accompanying members of parliaments at many inter-parliamentary meetings.  As the clerk for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety committee, for example - my last job before I came to this one - I went to approximately four or five meetings of environment committees.  At national parliament and European Parliament level there were different members on each occasion, which undercut continuity of contact.  I know how difficult it is to achieve somewhat greater continuity, but it helps a lot.  Priority setting is important too.  Any parliament - and the European Parliament is no exception - has to pick its battles.  There is so much within the European Union that priority setting is absolutely key.</p><p> At the moment the European Union is perceived as remote and dominated by one or more big member states.  There needs to be far more emphasis on strengthening the community method and on getting all member states involved.  There needs to be - to use a tired but extraordinarily important word - solidarity between the member states and better implementation of what has been agreed.  One thing that has developed a great deal but in a rather uneven way in the debate on economic and monetary union is readiness to criticise individual member states.  There was always an unspoken rule that one did not criticise other states, and that has become a more important feature, but is also a very sensitive and difficult one.</p><p> Finally, I will comment briefly on the European Parliament elections and the views within the Parliament as to how these might be made more European in nature.  The slogan that will be used is "This time, it's different."  It refers to two aspects: one, of course, is the fact that since the Lisbon treaty the European Parliament has more powers in terms of budget, agriculture, fisheries and almost all legislative areas.  The other aspect is that it is the intention of the political groups in the Parliament to make the elections more European and more political than before.  Two weeks ago the Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted the Duff report on a Commission communication on the conduct of the European elections, and that will come up soon - perhaps in the next plenary session - for final adoption within the Parliament.  The report highlights three proposed changes, one of which is to bring forward the date of the elections.  This has already been decided, so we now know that the next European Parliament elections will not take place in June, as they always have in the past, but over the four days between 22 and 25 May.  The purpose of this was largely to allow more time to choose the Commission - first the President of the Commission and then the hearings of all the Irish and other Commissioners - so that the job can be done properly before the summer break and before the Parliament returns to normal legislative mode in the autumn.  In the past this has been telescoped into the month of July.  The idea is to have more time to do this.  That is one of the key reasons for the change of date.  The Duff report also puts forward several other suggestions, such as insisting that in countries where candidates are chosen only at the last moment, this be done at least six weeks in advance.  I do not think that will be a problem in Ireland, but it is in some countries.  It recommends having more women candidates than before, if possible, and equality, if possible, in list systems and so on.</p><p> The second big change is that European political parties are being encouraged to be on the ballot papers for the next European elections.  The Parliament wants national political parties to publicise their European political party affiliations when they come to the next election.  That is a national competence at the moment but the European Parliament is trying to encourage them to put names and, if possible, emblems on ballot papers and, if possible, to have political broadcasts by the European political parties.</p><p> The third change is perhaps the most controversial and difficult of all: to have nominations from the European political parties for post of President of the European Commission.  The Parliament wants the political parties to put these candidates forward sufficiently in advance.  It asks that national parties taking part in the elections say whom they support and wishes to promote the political programmes of these candidates through a series of public debates between the different candidates and so on.  We do not know how this will work out for the selection of the President of the Commission.  The Duff report talks of encouraging the Parliament and the European Council to agree on the method for doing this by common accord.  The Committee on Constitutional Affairs stated that it "expects that 'the candidate for Commission President who was put forward by the European political party that wins the most seats in the Parliament will be the first to be considered' with a view to 'ascertaining his or her ability to secure the support of the necessary absolute majority in Parliament'." </p><p> I am very happy to answer any questions and look forward to working with this committee and its staff over the coming period.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

Before I ask for contributions from the floor I would like some clarification on a few of the points that Mr. Jacobs raised.  He mentioned how European Parliament committees could take more input from national parliaments and spoke about the yellow card and so on.  Does he envisage that people from national parliaments would attend committees of the European Parliament?  What are his thoughts on how that link-up could be improved?</p><p>  Second, he mentioned the Danish Parliament's initiative to increase awareness among Danish citizens of the work of the European Parliament.  As I am not familiar with that work, could he outline what exactly it does?  We could then see whether we could do something similar here.</p><p>  Many of us would welcome the proposal and prospect of having a real European election as opposed to a referendum on government performance, which is what many European elections have been.  What work will organisations such as the European Parliament Information Office do to put pressure on, and encourage, political parties on issues such as greater representation by women, early choice of candidates and putting out a political message based on the European vision as opposed to the local vision?  What will Mr. Jacobs' organisation and others such as the European Movement be doing to try to steer the political agenda that way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013061800004#C00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Jacobs and thank him for coming here.  I was very happy to discover when I spoke to him earlier in the hallway that he had many Reilly and O'Reilly relations in County Cavan.  Indeed, Senator Kathryn Reilly may well also be related to him, but he and I have established family ties in Cavan.  I will let him explain later, but it seems that on his mother's side he has a whole Cavan connection.  I was delighted by that and when I heard the quality of his contribution I was convinced of the genealogy.</p> <p>I have a number of issues that are a source of distress.  The prospect that our level of representation in the European Parliament will decrease because of the numbers of MEPs from new member states is a source of angst for me and others.  It will increase the democratic deficit and further alienation from Europe.  There is an assumption that we will lose a seat and I would like Mr. Jacobs to comment on the degree to which fewer representatives will contribute to the democratic deficit and whether there are solutions to that difficulty.</p><p> As the European Parliament gets stronger and the Lisbon treaty has enshrined new powers, there is a risk that the national priorities of small countries, such as Ireland can become submerged.  Mr. Jacobs's suggestion on the chairmanship of committee is a possible solution.  Will he comment on the way to avoid submerging the national interest as we work with the Socialist group or the European Peoples Party, EPP or the ALDE group.  What concerns me is how to advance issues, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the lack of employment opportunities that are of concern to Ireland?  I know we can work on the issues in our political grouping in Europe but how does Mr. Jacobs see it working on the floor of the European Parliament?</p><p> Mr. Jacobs referred to the strength of the committee chairpersons and will Mr. Jacobs comment on the potential of seeking such a post to strengthen our position?</p><p> I think his point on the need for strong links between the European Parliament and the parliaments of member states is important.  There is a need to develop a satisfactory methodologies to do that.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Jacobs that candidates standing for election in the European elections would have to state the grouping with which they would align in Europe and that there be a debate on what the various grouping stands for.  That would have amusing outcomes in the Irish context.  Our Chairman, Deputy Hannigan's point on achieving a gender balance was well made and I ask Mr. Jacobs to address that issue also.</p><p> I would appreciate if Mr. Jacobs would try to address some of those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013061800005#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. Jacobs, who is a frequent and prominent visitor to the Oireachtas, for his presentation.  We have been present during his many presentations on this issue.  I have three specific questions.  First, how likely is a treaty change in the short term?  If such a change is likely, in which area is it likely to be?  Second, is he aware of a change in the public perception in the context of the additional powers the European Parliament has recently gained?  My sense is that there has been a shift in public understanding of the role of the European Parliament and the power it has.  I do not overstate how much the needle has shifted but I think there has been a change.  I am interested in hearing his perception of that issue.</p><p>  Finally, in regard to further economic integration, which he referenced briefly, how does he envisage the shape of further economic integration?  If I look at budgetary policy, with the two-pack, the six-pack, the fiscal treaty, it is quite difficult to see how that could move further without the role of national parliaments being radically diminished.  If I look at the role of tax competency within the European Union, I find it difficult to see how that will radically shift without parliaments all over the European Union becoming very upset.  I see potential for further integration in the area of a banking union, euro bonds and euro bills but beyond that, I always struggle to see to what areas people are referring, when speaking in terms of greater integration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013061800005#D00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Jacobs and thank him for his contribution.  This time next year we will have 600 plus fewer county councillors, and depending on the passage of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, we may have fewer Members of the Oireachtas in 2016.  The number of politicians in Ireland will be reduced.  That will give more of a profile or the possibility of a higher profile for MEPs.  Does Mr. Jacobs agree that this scenario would offer an opportunity to our MEPs?</p><p>  European elections are often dominated by national issues.  I am sure in other countries that local and European election coincide, in order to boost turnout and save money.  Will we ever reach the stage in which the elections to the European Parliament will be focused entirely on European issues?  I know we have very good debates on the national media when European elections are being held.  The increase in the power and influence of the European Parliament, while a positive development, has implications for the smaller member states because as such states have lower numbers of MEPs.  This leads to a perception that the influence of the power of the European Parliament lies with the larger states.  That is a concern, and as Deputy Joe O'Reilly stated we are likely to lose one MEP in the next review.</p><p>  When it comes to choosing a President of the European Parliament, would that choice be determined by the party, the nationality of the various candidates, the language abilities of candidates, which is a positive for those who are multilingual, or the political blocs to which they belong?  Would it play into the hands of those parties that chose a candidate from a smaller or a neutral country?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-18a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Jacobs" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013061800005#D00500"><p>Deputies have asked very good questions and many of them are linked, so I will try to link them together.  The Chairman asked the simplest question on the Danish Parliament.</p><p>  I was referring to the Folketing visitors centre.  I do not know when they set it up but all school groups who come to the Danish Parliament come here to learn how the Danish Parliamentary system works, with simulations and so on.  They also started to explain the structure of the European Union.</p> <p>Most questions on the European Union are to the Danish Parliament's own special centre, but I can check with my Danish counterpart and pass on the information.  One advantage of my job is that we are part of a network of counterparts in all the member states.  I would be very happy to provide more information on that matter.  </p><p> The contributions are very important.  I have always felt - I do not know how the committee feels about it - that subsidiarity can be very important in blocking some inappropriate proposals, but it is a legal concept and is difficult to interpret.  It is very difficult to get the necessary number of member states.  Often, the more practical approach is to express a national parliament's views on a specific issue - in a sense, to be almost a lobbyist within the process.  At the moment the contributions of national parliaments come through the European Parliament's service for relations with national parliaments, which sends them on to the specific committees, but I see scope for closer links, especially between the sectoral committees within the Irish system and within other systems which now have a greater role on European matters. <b></b>The Chairman<b></b>mentioned the attendance of national parliamentarians at committees.  That has happened in some Parliament committees in the past.  When I was on the constitutional committee there was a standing invitation for national parliamentarians who attended the committee.  However, it is more important to meet in an informal way and try to get specific Irish and other national concerns into the process.  An issue on which there has been some discussion, although it has not yet been developed, is video linking.  I know the Irish MEPs have mentioned it when they appeared before the committee.  They were very happy when the meetings were moved to Thursday because there was a chance of their being able to attend.  Generally speaking, the European Parliament calendar and the Irish Parliament's calendar do not mesh.  One way of dealing with the issue in a practical way is to have a video link, whether with Irish MEPs or with a rapporteur of the European Parliament who may be dealing with an important subject of interest to the committee or one of the other sectoral committees.  The Parliament's committees are equipped for that possibility.  It is possible that somebody could make a ten-minute presentation and be questioned directly by the committee.  It is a practical way of getting a closer exchange.</p><p> The Chairman's third question was about what we are doing to publicise the elections.  Obviously we are a very small office.  The main way we can do that is through working with Irish NGOs, the European movement, the National Women's Council, the youth networks and so on.  In the next few months I will be meeting with as many groups as I can to see how they are going to publicise the European elections.  The National Women's Council and groups such as the 5050 Group are trying to promote greater participation by female candidates.  Obviously we will be talking to them to see what we can do.  The most practical way we can do it is to work with other organisations.</p><p> Deputy Joe O'Reilly mentioned the loss of one seat for Ireland in the European Parliament, which was finally voted on by the Parliament last week.  It was a very difficult process because the Lisbon treaty provided for a ceiling of 751 Members of the European Parliament.  When Croatia became a member without a further treaty change, a number of seats needed to found for it.  The constitutional committee considered the issue and decided that no country should lose more than one seat.  As a result, 11 countries have lost seats, including Ireland.  It was passed last week by a very large majority, but the vast majority of Irish Members voted against it.  There is one important clause in the resolution that was passed - that is, that before the next European elections, the Parliament, which has the right of initiative on its own size - normally it is the Commission, but in this case it is the Parliament - will return to this issue and examine whether it is fair from the bigger to the smaller states.  Certainly the Irish Members argued that it is not fair that after the next election the 11 Irish MEPs will be representing more voters than the Danish, Finish and Slovak members, which are the next countries that are not losing seats.  The principle of digressive proportionality, which sounds horrible, is a mathematical formula.  All it means is that the bigger a member state, the more individuals MEPs are supposed to represent, from a maximum of 96 for Germany down to the minimum of six for Luxembourg, Malta and others.</p></speech>

Next time, population growth should be one of the factors to be considered.  For example, at one stage Italy, France and the UK, all of which have the same number of seats in the European Parliament, had roughly similar populations.  Italy's population has stagnated while that of the UK has grown, but France's population has grown the most, so that it now has 3 million or 4 million more people than Italy although it has only one more seat.  The UK and Italy have the same number of seats although the UK has 2 million more people than Italy.  The whole issue needs to be examined.  Spain is under-represented in the European Parliament in terms of population per MEP.  There are a number of anomalies, including Ireland.  The idea is that before the next elections that issue should be examined in order to arrive at a fair system of digressive proportionality.</p></speech>

If it was proportional, which the German constitutional court would love, and if there really was a federal united states of Europe, then Germany would have 170 or 180 MEPs and Malta and Luxembourg would have one.  One can work it out one's self.  What has happened is a compromise, because the European Union system is already complicated enough.  If it was like the United States, as some have suggested, there would two chambers in the European Parliament, one in which Ireland would have the same number of Members as Germany and another one which would be proportional.  In the US, California has 60 congressmen and two senators while Wyoming has one congressman and two senators.  That has been debated by many people within the European Parliament, but it is seen as making the system, which is already complicated enough, even more complicated.  This is why, within one European Parliament, the term "digressive proportionality" is an example of the horrible jargon I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is difficult.  At the same time the system in the European Parliament is not just a simple majority-minority system.  There is a separation of powers in that it is a Parliament in which there is not a permanent majority or minority.  It varies from issue to issue, which gives great opportunities for different coalitions.  It means that, for example, on agriculture the Irish Members will make alliances with French and many other nationalities.  On issues of importance to Ireland there will be allies within the political groups within the Parliament.</p><p> There will probably be 20 committees next time - I imagine there will be the same number of committees and possibly even one or two more - and 11 Members will have to cover them.  Their staff will have to cover the committees they cannot attend.  It means that it is even more important to identify the national interests that must be defended by coalitions with others within the European Parliament.  It does not vote along simple national lines.  It rarely votes with all German Members on one side or all French Members on another.  They are normally divided, which gives many possibilities for making coalitions.  This is probably not a satisfactory answer, but it is the only one I can give.  There are many possibilities.  This is a very open Parliament and it is a question of identifying the key issues which need to be defended and what is the best way of doing this within each political family.</p><p> On European Parliament and national parliament relations, this will be the key in the future.  The European Parliament obviously has many new powers.  It is a very powerful parliament, but it is more remote from citizens than national parliaments, which is why these two tiers of democratic accountability are complementary.  That sometimes sounds theoretical, but the key will be to try to make it work on specific issues in a practical way, in some of the ways I mentioned.  That applies particularly at political level, but it is also very important at staff level.</p><p> One of the important elements of my job and those of my counterparts in the member states is to follow the debate within the national parliaments.  As the committee knows, I attend quite a few of its meetings, to which I attach great importance.  I work very closely with, for example, Mr. Derek Dignam, the committee's representative in Brussels with the directorate for relations with national parliaments, who will be coming here next week for the meeting of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and, where necessary, the sectoral committees of the Parliament.  If something comes up in the Irish Parliament which I think is of interest to a sectoral committee, I try to bring it to the attention of my colleagues there.  It is a drop in the ocean, but it can help a little.  If there is any way I can help in that regard, I am very willing to do it because it is an important practical backup to the political work the Irish MEPs and the committee do.</p><p> There was also a question on promoting gender balance.  Obviously, it boils down to individual decisions at national level.  The European Parliament cannot impose it in European Parliament elections.  There have been many resolutions in the Parliament on this subject, encouraging individual parties and political groups, especially when there are list systems where it is easier to have a balance between younger and older candidates and a gender balance, and national parliaments to take it more seriously.  Where the Parliament will have a big impact on gender issues is on the choice of the next Commission.  As the committee knows, the Parliament must first vote on the President of the Commission and can say yes or no.  Afterwards, while it cannot vote on individual Commissioners, it can vote on the Commission as a whole.  One of the preconditions is that if there is not a 50:50 balance, there is an adequate number of women candidates and the maximum degree of gender balance among all the national Members.</p></speech>

However, it has tried to insist on at least one third or more being women candidates.  A country putting forward a woman nominee - so far it has been that way rather than the other way round - is obviously already winning some support for itself, as long as the candidate is good in quality terms.  In fact, the candidate the Parliament did not like the last time and who had to be withdrawn was the Bulgarian candidate who was a woman.  She was replaced by another Bulgarian woman candidate who was an excellent candidate and easily passed her confirmation hearing.</p><p>  The confirmation hearings are a really gruelling process lasting over two hours.  Many factors are taken into account during them.  They are based, to some extent, on the US model.  When they were set up for the first time in the early 1990s, the European Parliament sent some of its staff and politicians to the United Stated to see how the Americans did it and learn positive and negative lessons from the US confirmation hearings process.</p><p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne mentioned the issue of the European elections inevitably being more on national issues.  I believe that will be the case for a long time.  Inevitably, it is an opportunity to raise issues.  That is why many people in the European Parliament are worried about next year's elections, at a time when there could still be a severe economic crisis in many countries.  It could be a chance to protest against incumbent governments and protest parties could do very well in the elections in many countries.  There is a great deal of concern about this.  What the European Parliament is trying to do, especially by having a more presidential election, is to have some of the Europe-wide issues raised.  If the Greens group, the socialist group, the European People's Party, the left socialists and the European United Left, GUE, group within the Parliament have candidates for the post of President, it is not only a chance for that person to gain a higher profile but also for the political programme of that political group to be diffused better throughout the European Union.  It is a policy option opportunity, as well as a personality matter.</p></speech>

I will try to find out a little more about it.  I understand the process could not even be started until the formal decision was taken.  Now we have reached the point where it can be done and I presume it will take place early in the autumn.  Incidentally, Ireland is unique in requiring an adaptation of constituencies.  The other ten countries which have lost seats just reduce the list by one person.  There are some other countries with constituencies, but I am not aware that any of them has formally lost seats.  None of the countries that has lost seats will require a boundary commission to reallocate constituencies.  In that sense, Ireland is unique.</p></speech>

The only reason I mentioned that is that I remember the late Brian Lenihan giving a talk in our building and saying that maybe one day that will happen.  The assumption is that the constituencies will continue but the basis on which it will do comes under purely national competence.</p><p>  There was a long debate in the European Parliament about having a uniform electoral system and it was abandoned because there were too many differences between the member states.  The compromise reached was that there should be a few key principles which were common such as proportionality, which is why the British eventually had to abandon the first past the post system for the European elections, as it was distorting the political balance in the European Parliament.  In 1979 there were 22 Conservatives more than they would have been proportionally.  The Conservatives were not too worried about that but in 1994 when there were 20 more socialists because the British Labour Party got 60 out of the 75 seats, or whatever number it was, the Conservatives started to take it seriously and it was later changed during Tony Blair's period as Prime Minister.  The principle of each system had to be proportional but it was up to each member state whether to have a single transferable vote, open lists, closed lists and so on.</p><p>  An idea that was put forward but which has not gone anywhere, which Andrew Duff, the rapporteur, and some other members, have long advocated, is that, in addition to the individual member states, there should be one Europe-wide constituency where candidates who would stand at a Europe-wide level.  However, that idea was dropped in favour of the idea of having candidates for President of the Commission for the obvious reason that it would mean that countries like Ireland and others would have even fewer seats.  There is great reluctance to go down that route, although some people have posed the question, would that not give a more European flavour to the elections, but others have said the European Union is not ready for that, that is not yet a federal system and therefore that would be too federal an element.  That idea, which has been put forward by some in the Parliament, has never had a majority.  I cannot envisage it having a majority in the foreseeable future but some members have advocated it.</p><p>  Deputy Donohoe's questions are difficult ones for me to answer because treaty change in the past has typically happened in a very <i>ad hoc</i> way.  A series of demands built up for areas where problems emerged for a country or a group of countries and eventually there was a  compromise where a number of these concerns were put together and it was decided to draw up a treaty.  There was not a master plan to provide that this is what we need to do at European level.  It has been very much an <i>ad hoc</i> process and this may have been part of the problem of getting the public on-side.  There was an attempt to get away with that in the Constitutional Convention held a few years ago when John Bruton was on the presidium, Dick Roche was the Government representative, Proinsias De Rossa was another member and John Gormley was there as well.  It was a mixture of national and European parliamentarians who examined the structure of the European Union to see where treaty changes needed to be made.  There are still many people in the Parliament who like this method of debate between the European Parliament and national parliaments - rather than it being decided by executives - on what does and not does not need to be changed and putting that forward for the future.  The discussion currently tends to be, as the Deputy said, on a complete banking union, Angela Merkel saying that we need a treaty change to do that and other members saying what we should do on another area.  This is currently done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The only thing on which the Parliament is very strong and, I am sure, on which the committee would be very strong, is that whatever changes are needed they need to strengthen this democratic accountability element.  That is critical if European citizens are to be brought on board.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the public perception of the European Parliament.  One may or may not like opinion polls.  We have a very regular measure of this; the Eurobarometer does a series of polls, many of which ask questions about faith and trust in the European institutions, including the European Parliament.  We also have our own small opinion poll unit.  It does not do its own polls but it helps to commission some, focusing more particularly on the role of the European Parliament.  I am happy to share with the committee the work with which it comes up.  Unsurprisingly, it shows that the economic crisis has led to a drop in the support for and popularity of all the European Union institutions and the EU as a whole - the Parliament, the Commission and the Council are all less trusted than they were a few years ago.  An interesting consideration is that when there is economic recovery, will that change and, if so, how quickly? The biggest problem the European Parliament has is its distance from citizens.  It has very great powers.  </p><p>  As the Deputy said, there are 11 Irish MEPs who have to cover the whole range of European Parliament activities which are becoming increasingly complex.  They have to meet and look after their constituents and attend committee meetings and plenary sessions, and that is the same for all members of the European Parliament.  They have to look after the home base, take part in an increasingly difficult legislative and non-legislative control and accountability work and inevitably sometimes citizens find that they are a bit remote.  </p><p>  There is a wider problem of trust in the whole political process, therefore, the turnout in elections has decreased in even national elections, but it is something of which we must be very aware.  As the European Parliament has got more powerful, the turnout in elections has tended to go down rather up.  A key factor recently has been the big enlargement in 2004 where a large number of new member states joined.  The turnout in even national elections in some of the new member states have been very low and they have been new lows.  One of the new member states has only a 17% turnout in the last European Parliament elections and that brought down the overall turnout considerably.  That member state was Slovakia.  The percentage turnout in Poland was in the low 20s.  Of the older member states, the only one in which the turnout has been consistently at a very low level is the United Kingdom, where the turnout has fluctuated between 24% and 36%.</p></speech>

The US Congress, regardless of whether one likes it or does not like it, is a very powerful parliament and yet the turnout in mid-term elections is typically 40% to 50% as well.  That percentage turnout is not very high for the US Congress.  That is not a defence or an argument and clearly one of the key challenges will be to try to raise turnouts in individual countries and in Europe as a whole.  The turnout at elections is an important factor in the legitimacy of all parliaments.</p></speech>
